By a decision of Thurrock Council dated 28 January 2015 the 
policies and supporting text of the Thurrock Core Strategy 
and Policies for Management of Development 2011  are 
amended as follows:-  
 
Following publication of the NPPF, the Council have identified a number of 
policies in the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development 
DPD (adopted in December 2011) that require amendment in order to remain 
consistent with the NPPF. 
 
This Focused Review amends certain policies to which amendments could be 
taken forward without the need to prepare additional evidence.  These policies 
are: CSSP5, CSTP8, CSTP23, CSTP25, CSTP26, CSTP27, CSTP28, 
CSTP31, CSTP32, PMD1, PMD2, PMD4, PMD6, PMD7, PMD10, PMD12, 
PMD15, PMD16.  On adoption of the Focused Review, the previous adopted 
versions of these policies are replaced by the amended versions.  New Policy 
OSPD1 is also added. 
 
All other policies of the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of 
Development DPD remain unchanged.  The Examination of the Focused 
Review: Consistency with National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) did not 
endorse any of the unchanged policies as being consistent with the NPPF.  
The Council intend to prepare a Local Plan for the Borough which will include 
a full review of all of the policies in the Core Strategy and Policies for 
Management of Development DPD.

FOREWORD   
 
Dear reader, 
 
This document is the Adopted Core Strategy and Policies for Management of 
Development, Development Plan Document for Thurrock;  the “Core Strategy” 
for short. 
 
The Adopted Core Strategy addresses many issues affecting local people. 
The policies cover spatial development issues in relation to education, health, 
community safety, energy management, sustainable development, climate 
change and flood management. It also contains policies on more traditional 
but important planning activity such as housing, employment, leisure and 
sport, natural and historic environment and community facilities. 
 
In light of the challenge of climate change we have strengthened our 
environmental policies and standards to ensure that future generations will not 
pay a heavy price for our increased prosperity. 
 
We have strengthened the Core Strategy to reflect the changed economic 
conditions in Thurrock and set out our new vision for the future. The Core 
Strategy’s vision re-emphasises the need for the regeneration and renewal of 
Thurrock’s communities to be on a truly sustainable basis whilst protecting the 
Green Belt and conserving environmental assets within the Borough. 
 
The Core Strategy is the most important step to date towards the creation of 
Thurrock’s long-term Spatial Development Plan. Thurrock is going through a 
period of significant change, which will see growth in jobs, homes, and 
infrastructure to support the needs of local people now, and for generations to 
come. 
 
The Core Strategy is the foundation for future work on developing detailed 
policies for all types of development sites and areas of change such as 
Purfleet, the proposed Lakeside Regional Town Centre and London Gateway 
Port.

 A SPATIAL STRATEGY FOR THURROCK: THE “CORE STRATEGY”  
 
1.1   This Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development, 
Development Plan Document (Core Strategy) is a strategic document 
providing broad guidance on the scale and distribution of development and the 
provision of supporting infrastructure. It sets out the spatial vision, spatial 
objectives, the spatial development strategy and policies for Thurrock to 2026 
and beyond together with a monitoring and implementation framework.  
 
1.2   The Strategic Policies set out in the Core Strategy relate to housing, 
employment, communities, transport, the natural and built environment, 
climate change, water, waste and minerals. 
 
1.3   The Thurrock Core Strategy also contains the policies and standards for the 
Management of Development.  These policies set out the criteria against 
which planning applications for the development and use of land and buildings 
will be considered to ensure that development occurs in the most appropriate 
location.   
 
Supporting the Sustainable Community Strategy 
 
1.4   The Core Strategy directly supports the delivery of the Thurrock Sustainable 
Community Strategy by ensuring that land and sites are made available for 
health, education, open space, industry and housing, together with improved 
accessibility to these facilities by all sections of the community.   
 
THE NEW SYSTEM - THURROCK’S LOCAL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK 
 
1.5   The Core Strategy is part of the wider Local Development Framework (LDF)  
for Thurrock.  The LDF is the current system of development plans in England 
that was introduced by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.  The 
Local Development Framework will replace the existing adopted Thurrock 
Borough Local Plan (1997). The LDF is made up of 2 types of Local 
Development Documents:  
 
1) Development Plan Documents (DPD)  - A Development Plan Document 
has to be independently tested by a Government inspector and carries full 
weight in relation to planning applications. They include information of key 
development goals set out within the LDF. Thurrock’s DPDs include: 
 
 The Core Strategy  is the overarching Development Plan Document 
(DPD) that provides the strategic framework for the other 
components of the LDF.  
 The Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD (including 
Lakeside)  will set out the sites that will deliver the Core Strategy 
spatial strategy, policies and targets. 
 The Minerals and Waste DPD  will contain policies and sites for 
these two specialist topic areas.  
 The Adopted Proposals Map  shows the location and boundaries of 
adopted policies and proposals contained in the Development Plan.  
The Proposals Map will be updated on the adoption of each 
Development Plan Document. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development. (as amended)

Three other documents will be included in the Council’s LDF folder.  These 
are: 
 
 The  Statement of Community Involvement (SCI).  This will 
specify how the Council will involve stakeholders and the local 
community in the process of preparing Local Development 
Documents.  It has been subject to independent testing.  
 The Local Development Scheme (LDS).   This sets out details of 
each of the Local Development Documents to be produced by the 
Council, and the timescales and arrangements for its preparation.  
 The Council must produce an Annual Monitoring Report (AMR).  
This will review progress in the previous 12 months in terms of 
production of Local Development Documents and the 
implementation of policies.

 THE CORE STRATEGY- STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT 
 
1.6   This chapter sets out the structure and content of each chapter within the Core 
Strategy and provides information on previous consultation. 
 
1.7   Chapter Two sets out a summary of the key strategies, policies and 
programmes that have helped shape Thurrock’s Core Strategy.  Some of the 
key plans and programmes include the East of England Plan (EERA 2008) at 
the regional level, and also more local level documents such as Thurrock’s 
Sustainable Community Strategy and plans and strategies formulated by the 
Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation.   
 
1.8   Chapter Three sets out the long-term Spatial Vision for guiding future 
development and land use in Thurrock.  This section aims to provide a portrait 
of Thurrock in 2026 and beyond.  This section also sets out Thurrock’s 
Strategic Spatial Objectives and highlights the key locations in the Borough.  
 
1.9   Chapter Four sets out the Core Strategic Spatial Policies (CSSP)  which 
ensure that the Spatial Vision and Objectives are delivered.   
 
1.10   Chapter Five sets out the Core Strategic Thematic Policies (CSTP)  which 
deal with the themes in the CSSPs and details how the Council intends to 
ensure the best outcomes are delivered.  
 
1.11   Chapter Six sets out the Policies for Management of Development (PMD) .  
The Council will use these policies to assess planning applications.  These 
policies are not strategic, but are aimed to ensure that all development within 
the Borough meets certain criteria and contributes to the achievement of the 
overall vision of the Core Strategy.  
 
1.12   Chapter Seven sets out Thurrock’s Monitoring and Implementation 
Framework . This chapter seeks to set out the key mechanisms that the 
Council will employ to maximise the opportunities for the successful delivery of 
the Core Strategy.   
 
1.13   Appendices  include a list of the evidence base for the Core Strategy, relevant 
strategies, policies and guidance, standards and relevant maps.

 MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK 
 
1.15   The Policies set out in this Plan are designed to promote the co-ordinated 
delivery of strategies in Thurrock that have been prepared by the Council and 
other regional, sub-regional and local organisations and groups. The 
Monitoring and Implementation Framework sets out how the Council intends 
to ensure the successful delivery of the Strategic Spatial Objectives and how 
the Council will monitor the effectiveness of the Core Strategy and supporting 
documents within the Thurrock Local Development Framework.  The Council 
publishes an Annual Monitoring Report that sets out the progress on delivery 
of the LDF. 
 
SUSTAINABILITY APPRAISAL AND APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT 
 
1.16 The Thurrock Core Strategy must be informed by a Sustainability Appraisal 
(SA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) which are carried out at 
all stages of its production. The purpose of SEA/SA is to promote 
environmental protection and contribute to the integration of environmental, 
social and economic considerations into the preparation and adoption of the 
Core Strategy, with a view to promote sustainable development.  An 
Appropriate Assessment (AA) is also a statutory requirement that relates to 
the impact of the Core Strategy’s spatial strategy and policies on the EU 
designated Ramsar site along the Thurrock riverside . 
 
1.17 The Council has formulated this Plan in parallel with an SEA/SA and AA.  The 
SEA/SA and AA have contributed towards the reasoning behind and the 
refinement of the policies set out in the Plan.  The Council has published the 
Independent SEA/SA/AA Environmental Report to accompany this Plan. It 
highlights the economic, environmental and social implications of adopting the 
proposed strategic option and associated policies.   Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development

 Introduction 
 
2.1 This chapter summarises some of the key plans and strategies that 
have informed the Local Development Framework and this Core 
Strategy document in particular.  A list of all relevant strategies and 
policy guidance is provided in Appendix 1. 
 
NATIONAL STRATEGIES, POLICIES AND GUIDANCE 
 
 Central Government’s Sustainable Communities Plan ‘Building for 
the Future’ 
 
2.2 Thurrock is within the Thames Gateway, the biggest of four growth 
areas outlined in the Government’s Communities Plan ‘Building for the 
Future’, launched in February 2003.  The Thames Gateway is a 
national priority area for social and economic regeneration.  The 
Government defines sustainable communities as being “places where 
people want to live and work, now and in the future”.  To ensure that 
sustainable communities are appropriately delivered throughout 
England, the Government has identified eight sustainable community 
components;   
 Active, inclusive and safe 
 Well run 
 Environmentally sensitive 
 Well designed and built 
 Well connected 
 Thriving 
 Well served, and  
 Fair for everyone 
 
2.3 Thurrock Council wants to ensure that the strategic vision, objectives 
and accompanying policies embrace these sustainable community 
components and address Thurrock’s particular challenges and needs.  
 
 National Planning Policy Guidance and Statements 
 
2.4 National Government is currently revising and replacing Planning 
Policy Guidance notes (PPGs) with Planning Policy Statements (PPS).  
PPGs and PPSs explain the statutory requirements of policy and 
provide guidance to local authorities on planning policy and the 
planning system.  They deal with specific topics including housing, 
employment, waste, transportation and the natural and built 
environment.    
 
  White Paper: ‘Planning for a Sustainable Future’   
 
2.5 National Government has also formulated a range of White Papers.  
Key to the planning process is ‘Planning for a Sustainable Future’ 
White Paper (DCLG, May 2007).  This recognises the important role 
that planning plays and highlights some of the key challenges that Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 2 – Policy Context                                                                  Adopted January 2015

 planning is increasingly facing.  It suggests the possible role that the 
planning system can have in addressing challenges including:  
 Climate change 
 Sustainable economic development 
 Increasing housing supply 
 Protecting and enhancing the environment and natural 
resources  
 Improving our local and national infrastructure, and  
 Maintaining energy supply.   
  
REGIONAL STRATEGIES, POLICIES AND GUIDANCE 
 
East of England Plan – The Revision to the Regional Spatial 
Strategy for the East of England (May 2008) 
 
2.6 The Government Office for the East of England published the adopted 
East of England Plan in May 2008. It forms the top tier of the statutory 
development plan.  The East of England Plan also contains the 
Regional Transport Strategy. It provides a consistent framework to 
inform the preparation of Local Development Documents (including the 
Core Strategy), local transport plans, regional and sub-regional plans 
and programmes that impact on the development and land use 
activities.  The key implications for Thurrock that are set out in the East 
of England Plan include the following –  
 The Thurrock Urban Area (stretching from Purfleet in the 
west to Tilbury and Chadwell St Mary in the East) has been 
identified as a key centre for development and change; 
 Thurrock Urban Area is also allocated as a strategic 
employment site; 
 Essex Thames Gateway (which includes a substantial part of 
Thurrock) has been deemed a priority area for regeneration; 
 The indicative job growth target for Thurrock between 2001-
2021 is 26,000 new jobs; 
 The Plan promotes inter-regional and intra-regional and 
business clusters such as environmental technologies 
stretching from Essex to Cambridgeshire and supports the 
delivery of locally important clusters; 
 The Plan highlights that Thurrock Council should plan for the 
delivery of housing for at least 15 years from the date of 
adoption of the relevant Development Plan Document (e.g. 
Core Strategy) and that Thurrock should plan for a minimum 
of 18,500 new residential dwellings between 2001-2021; 
 Essex Thames Gateway including the London to Southend 
on Sea corridor has been identified as a transport investment 
priority; 
 The Thames Chase Community Forest should be targeted 
for woodland creation. 
Two Single Issue Reviews of the East of England Plan were 
subsequently undertaken. The policy implication of the Single Issue 
Review of Gypsies and Travellers (Adopted July 2009) and the Single Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 2 – Policy Context                                                                  Adopted January 2015

 Issue Review of the Thurrock Key Centre of Development and Change 
(Lakeside Basin Review) has been incorporated directly into Thurrock’s 
Core Strategy.   
 
SUB REGIONAL STRATEGIES, POLICIES AND GUIDANCE 
 
Thames Gateway – Delivery Plan  
 
2.7 This is the first Delivery Plan for the Thames Gateway.  The Thames 
Gateway Interim Plan, in November 2006, set out the vision for the 
Gateway, recognising its unique identity as an area with a proud past 
and a vibrant economic future.  The Delivery Plan seeks to confirm the 
commitment to support the Thames Gateway vision, by outlining clear 
priorities and funding.  The key aims for the Thames Gateway sub-
region, which are also of importance for Thurrock, include:  
 Building a vibrant economy – with at least 225,000 new jobs 
throughout Thames Gateway.  It is important to create conditions so 
local people can access these jobs and the success is monitored.   
 Improve the quality of life for residents of the Gateway – by 
providing 160,000 good quality homes at all levels of affordability for 
existing and new communities, reviving town centres, improving 
public services and providing a better environment through the 
Thames Gateway Parklands programme; and  
 Establishing the Gateway as an eco-region – leading the way for 
the rest of the country in low-carbon and sustainable regeneration.   
 
CROSS- BOUNDARY ISSUES 
 
2.8 The Core Strategy complies with parts 4.16 and 4.45 of PPS12 that 
relate to spatial planning not being constrained to Local Planning 
Authority boundaries and to be coherent with the Core Strategies 
prepared by neighbouring authorities in the following ways: 
 
 Regional policy context:  The Core Strategy has been prepared 
within the regional policy framework set out in the RSS East of 
England Plan as have the Core Strategies of all adjoining local 
authorities. This has ensured that the cross-boundary dimension 
relating to all the high-level strategic planning issues have been 
effectively co-ordinated with adjoining local authorities through the 
RSS processes. 
 
 Regional and sub-regional partnerships, agencies and delivery 
bodies: The Core Strategy policies and their supporting texts, 
where appropriate, refer to the relevant regional, county and sub-
regional partnerships, agencies and delivery bodies; their 
Strategies, Technical Studies and Delivery Plans that underpin the 
policies. The relevant policies therefore take full account of cross-
boundary issues. 
 
 Sub-regional and Thurrock Council Technical Studies:  As 
appropriate, policies are informed by and set within the relevant Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 2 – Policy Context                                                                  Adopted January 2015

 sub-regional strategies and their under-pinning studies e.g. South 
Essex Greengrid, Essex Biodiversity Action Plans, South Essex 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment, South West Essex NHS 
Vision, South Essex Rapid Transit, Thames Gateway South Essex 
Partnership Delivering the Future, Thames Estuary 2100 Plan, 
South Essex Catchment Flood Management Plan, etc. This ensures 
that cross-boundary issues are woven into the fabric of the technical 
evidence base that informs the policies from the outset. 
 
 Thurrock Council Technical Studies: The Core Strategy Policies 
are informed by and founded on an extensive body of Thurrock 
Council Technical Studies and Strategies. All Studies and 
Strategies take account of cross-boundary issues, where relevant, 
as part of their brief.  
 
 Monitoring and Implementation Framework: Chapter 7 sets out 
the Monitoring and Implementation Framework for the Core 
Strategy that clearly demonstrates the role of regional and sub-
regional partner organisations, agencies and bodies and relevant 
Indicators. 
 
LOCAL STRATEGIES 
 
Thurrock Sustainable Community Strategy  
 
2.9 A revised Thurrock Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) was 
approved in November 2009, prepared by the Local Strategic 
Partnership, ‘Shaping Thurrock’.  It envisaged that by 2020, Thurrock 
will be at the dynamic heart of the Thames Gateway, a place of 
ambition, enterprise and opportunity, where communities and 
businesses flourish and the quality of life for local people is continually 
improving. To achieve this vision, five priorities are identified: 
 
1.   To improve the education and skills of local people. 
2.   To encourage and promote job creation and economic 
prosperity. 
3.   To ensure a safe, clean and green environment. 
4. To provide high quality and accessible public services. 
5.  To build pride, respect and responsibility in Thurrock’s 
communities and its residents.  
 
Local Area Agreement (LAA)  
 
2.10 The LAA is a partnership document and successful delivery against the 
ambitious targets agreed with Government is dependent on the co-
operation and contributions of a range of lead and contributing 
partners.  The seven crosscutting themes of the LAA were designed to 
address the objectives of Thurrock’s Sustainable Community Strategy.  
The themes outlined in the LAA include: 
 
1. Sustainable Growth; Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 2. Positive Image of Thurrock; 
3. Reaching Your Potential; 
4. Embracing Change and Difference;  
5. Supporting the Vulnerable; 
6. Reducing Inequality; and 
7. Leisure and Healthy Living. 
  
Thurrock Sustainable Development Strategy and Framework 
 
2.11 Thurrock Council has developed a Sustainable Development Strategy 
and Framework to embed the principles of sustainable development 
into the local context. The Council’s overarching objective is to “Ensure 
the principles of Sustainable Development underpin Physical and 
Social Regeneration in Thurrock”. The Council will achieve this by: 
 
 Mainstreaming the Government’s guiding principles for 
sustainable development into local strategy and policy making 
through the Sustainable Development Framework. 
 Appraising the Thurrock Sustainable Community Strategy 
against local sustainability objectives. 
 Identifying local priorities and actions to help achieve UK 
shared priorities through the Sustainable Development 
Strategy. 
 
2.12 The Council’s Local Development Framework will be the key Statutory 
Development Plan, setting out how the spatial and land-use 
dimensions of the Thurrock Sustainable Development Strategy will be 
delivered.  
 
Thurrock Transport Strategy   
 
2.13 Thurrock Council published its Transport Strategy in November 2008.  
The Transport Strategy sets out how improvements will be delivered 
between 2008 and 2021, establishing ways in which congestion, road 
safety, air quality and better access to services can be tackled.  The 
Transport Strategy will also provide the main strategic focus for the 
third and fourth Local Transport Plans and will influence the on-going 
delivery of the second Local Transport Plan to 2010.  The Transport 
Strategy has guided the Core Strategy Transport and Access Policies. 
 
Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation  
 
2.14 In February 2003 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (now 
Communities and Local Government (CLG)) announced that, as part of 
the Government’s Sustainable Communities Plan, an Urban 
Development Corporation would be established in Thurrock to drive 
forward the regeneration of the area.  The Thurrock Thames Gateway 
Development Corporation (TTGDC) became a legal entity in October 
2003 and became operational from January 2004. 
 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 2 – Policy Context                                                                  Adopted January 2015 
 
10 
 2.15 The TTGDC has a remit to facilitate the growth, development and 
regeneration of Thurrock.  The expectation is that this will drive a 
significant increase in housing provision as well as improvements in 
employment and education. The TTGDC formally received 
development control powers from 12th October 2005 and has 
responsibility for dealing with significant planning applications and 
Master Planning.   
 
2.16 The TTGDC prepares a range of Masterplans, Strategies and 
Frameworks that help shape Thurrock’s Local Development 
Framework and specifically the Core Strategy.  The relevant plans, 
policies and programmes produced by the TTGDC that are of particular 
relevant to the Core Strategy include:  
 Thurrock Spatial Plan – August 2007; 
 Regeneration Framework – Autumn 2005; 
 Building a New Thurrock – Sharing the Vision; 
 Purfleet Centre Development Framework – June 2009; 
 Aveley and South Ockendon Masterplan – November 2007;  
 South Grays Design Brief – July 2008; 
 East Thurrock Masterplan - Nov 2009; 
 South Stifford Framework - Oct 2008; 
 Lakeside Basin and West Thurrock Masterplan - Nov 2008; 
 North Grays Design Brief – Jan 2009; 
 South East Thurrock Masterplan. 
 
The TTGDC is also developing Masterplans for other parts of the 
borough including:  
 Grays Town Centre Masterplan; 
 North Grays Masterplan 
 
Sustainability Appraisal and Appropriate Assessment   
 
2.17 Sustainability Appraisal is a mandatory process under the Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 for the production of Local 
Development Frameworks.  The Thurrock Council Core Strategy 
requires a Strategic Appraisal that incorporates the dual statutory 
requirement of both Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and Strategic 
Environmental Assessment (SEA). The purpose of SA/SEA is to 
promote environmental protection and contribute to the integration of 
environmental, social and economic considerations into the preparation 
and adoption of plans, with a view to promoting sustainable 
development. 
 
2.18 The SA/SEA is an important component of the evidence base and has 
been prepared and consulted on in parallel with the Core Strategy.  At 
various stages in the production of the Core Strategy, parts of SA/SEA 
were published.  These stages of SA/SEA publication are outlined in 
table 2.

Information  The first stage of the Sustainability Appraisal included the 
production of the Scoping Report.  The Scoping Report for 
Thurrock covers the Core Strategy and Site Specific 
Allocations and Policies Development Plan Documents.  The 
framework and methodology will be utilised to assess the 
Development Plan Documents.  The Scoping Report was 
subject to consultation.

Documents.  It assesses whether the objectives and 
proposals set out in the Issues and Options Development 
Plan Documents contribute to the principles of sustainable 
development.

Information  Similarly to previous Sustainability Appraisals this 
assessment relates to both Preferred Options Development 
Plan Documents.  It identified the impacts of the emerging 
Development Plan Documents on the economy, the 
community and the environment.  It also suggests 
approaches that may be adopted to avoid and reduce any 
adverse impacts arising from the Development Plan 
Documents.  The assessment also highlights methods that 
may be implemented to maximise positive impacts.  The 
appraisal included a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) and 
Equality Impact Assessment (EqIA).  A separate Appropriate 
Assessment was also undertaken and consulted on at this 
stage. 
 
2.19 A further assessment of the Submissions Core Strategy has also been 
undertaken and published alongside the Submissions Core Strategy.  
This Sustainability Appraisal Report and Appropriate Assessment 
(under the Habitat Regulations) include an assessment of policies 
where appropriate.  This report also demonstrates how the 
Submissions Core Strategy has been informed by the Preferred 
Options Core Strategy Sustainability Appraisal (2007).    
 
The Evidence Base  
 
2.20 Thurrock Council has been compiling information to support the 
preparation of the Local Development Framework.  This information is 
known as the ‘evidence base’. The evidence includes information on Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 2 – Policy Context                                                                  Adopted January 2015

 the social, economic and environmental characteristics of Thurrock.  
Thurrock’s Spatial Strategy, policies and approaches outlined in the 
Core Strategy are based on an understanding of our needs within the 
Borough, identified through the evidence base. The evidence base also 
assists in determining and assessing the constraints and what is 
feasibly deliverable throughout the plan period.  A comprehensive list of 
Thurrock’s evidence base for the Submissions Core Strategy is

 CHARACTERISTICS OF THURROCK 
 
3.1 This section of the Core Strategy provides information about Thurrock, 
including characteristics and the key drivers of change, to help put into 
context the ‘Spatial Vision’ and Strategic Objectives that follow.   
 
3.2 Thurrock is situated north of the Thames, twenty miles east of central 
London, in South Essex, and has a population of approximately 
157,000. The Borough covers 165 sq km and has a diverse range of 
land uses and associated environmental issues.  More than half of the 
land in Thurrock is designated Green Belt and it has over 18 miles of 
riverfront.   
 
3.3 Much of the riverside area of Thurrock is highly urbanised, with a 
mixture of industrial and residential development at the western and 
eastern ends.  The Borough has a number of main settlements, 
including Grays, Stanford-le-Hope, Corringham, South Ockendon and 
Tilbury, together with a number of villages in the Green Belt.  Thurrock 
also contains the relatively new community of Chafford Hundred and 
also the Lakeside Regional Shopping Centre, located west of Grays 
and east of the M25.   
 
3.4 Thurrock has a diverse and thriving economy, with retail, public 
services and manufacturing as dominant employment sectors.  The 
Government has, in recent years, approved a major port and 
employment development at the former Shell Haven refinery site.  The 
East of England Plan, adopted in May 2008, and the South Essex 
Thames Gateway Partnership reinforces this by promoting Thurrock as 
a ‘world leading logistics centre’. 
 
3.5 Thurrock benefits from a good location in terms of transport.  The M25 
and A13 act as strategic crossroads of national importance.  Regular 
rail services operate between London and Southend on Sea, serving 
seven stations and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link passes through the 
Borough.  The existing Port of Tilbury provides international 
connections for both passengers and freight. 
 
3.6 Thurrock has more than 60% of its land in the Green Belt.  Some of the 
Green Belt throughout Thurrock is also of considerable nature 
conservation and landscape value.  The Borough has sites of 
international and national importance for nature conservation including 
a Ramsar site and 12 Sites of Special Scientific Interest.  There are 7 
Conservation Areas and 241 Listed Buildings.   
 
3.7 Further information about the population of Thurrock, where they live 
and where they work, is given in the Profile of Thurrock at 
www.thurrock.gov.uk.  Further information on these topics is available 
in the Council’s Annual Monitoring Report and the Sustainability 
Appraisal.

15 
 KEY DRIVERS OF CHANGE 
 
3.8 This section highlights the key positive and negative social, economic 
and environmental issues that are facing Thurrock now and that are 
anticipated for the future.    
 
1.  Population and Household Growth – The growth of Thurrock’s 
population has exceeded regional and national growth since 1991.  
Thurrock is a designated growth area within the Thames Gateway.  
Future growth is projected to continue to outstrip national and regional 
rates due to a combination of indigenous growth and net inward 
migration.  The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has predicted that 
the population of Thurrock will reach 183,200 in 2031, an increase of 
34,300 population (23%) over a 25 year period from 2006. This is 
according to 2006 based population projections based upon previous 
trends. The implications of this population growth include the need for 
substantial further housing development, improved social, green and 
transportation infrastructure, increased capacity of waste recovery 
facilities and demand for water. Thurrock needs to plan to 
accommodate at least an additional 18,500 new homes over the period 
2001 to 2021 and up to a further 4750 dwellings to 2026 and beyond in 
order to provide a 15-year supply to meet Government requirements. 
 
2. Ageing Population –  Thurrock is expected to experience a 
significantly ageing population due to longer lives, falling birth rates and 
ageing of the baby boom generation.  For example, the proportion of 
people aged over 65 will increase by 13,800 people (a 71% increase) 
and people aged over 85 will more than double, increasing by 3,100 
people (a 141% increase). An ageing population has serious 
implications for the Local Development Framework as it is important 
that future housing development is adaptable to the needs of the 
ageing population and adequate health care provision is appropriately 
planned for and delivered.   
 
3.  Ethnic Population –  Thurrock has lower proportions of men and 
women from minority ethnic communities than the national average. In 
2001, the census showed 4.7% (6729) of Thurrock’s population to be 
from non-white groups compared with 9.1% across the Country as a 
whole. Asian/Asian British is the largest ethnic group at 2%. In 2007, it 
is estimated that the ethnic population has risen to 9.0%. 
 
The implication for the Local Development Framework is that it is 
important that the policies adopted are flexible, to ensure that the 
needs of a more ethnically diverse population are appropriately 
addressed throughout the Plan period.  
 
4.  Deprivation - Thurrock’s ranking in the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 
has improved from 113th in 2000, to 124th in 2007 (Deprivation/Thurrock 
Analysis, 2007). This is two places lower (less deprived) than from the 
2004 survey (122nd). Despite this increase, there are still deep pockets 
of deprivation in some wards.  The Indices of Multiple Deprivation Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015 
 
16 
 shows that Thurrock has 24% of identified communities in the lower 
quartile, 62% in the medium quartiles and 14% in the upper quartile.  
Five of the identified communities are in the 10% most deprived areas 
of England and 12 are in the 20% most deprived areas.  The most 
deprived communities have the highest levels of crime and anti-social 
behaviour, poor health and increased instances of school-age 
pregnancies. In Thurrock, 21 identified Super Output Areas (SOAs) are 
within the 10% most deprived areas in England for education, skills and 
training, while 48 SOAs are within the 20% most deprived areas.   
 
The most deprived wards in Thurrock include Tilbury St Chads, Grays, 
Belhus, Chadwell St Mary, Ockendon and West Thurrock.  The Council 
therefore aims to ensure that the Local Development Framework 
assists in narrowing the gap between rich and poor, by supporting 
these communities, improving their access to affordable homes, health 
and community facilities and integrating the principles of “Secured by 
Design” into all new developments to help reduce crime and anti-social 
behaviour.  
 
5.  Incidences of Crime – Evidence demonstrates that the overall crime 
rate in Thurrock continues to fall. There were over 1,000 less crimes in 
2008/09 than in 2007/08, a 9% reduction which is in line with the 
national decline in crime rate. However, although the proportionate rate 
of
 crime is declining, the perceptions of anti-social behaviour in the 
Borough are worse than the national average although reported anti-
social behaviour is decreasing. In 2008/9 serious acquisitive crime was 
recorded at 21 per 1,000 households and assault with injury 60.2. The 
Council therefore aims to ensure that the Local Development 
Framework facilitates and promotes the delivery of high quality design, 
where the principles of “Secured by Design” are integral to all new 
development throughout the Borough.  
 
6.  Educational Attainment – The Council has concluded that raising 
attainment levels in schools is a key priority for Thurrock. Evidence 
demonstrates that the qualifications and skills profile in Thurrock is 
improving but remains below the national average. It is therefore 
important that the Local Development Framework seeks to facilitate 
and promote the development of existing and new educational and 
training establishments.  Improved educational attainment and training 
within the Borough will also stimulate a more diverse economic base, 
through growth in the cultural industries and knowledge sectors. There 
is currently a lack of a major higher education facility in Thurrock: The 
Core Strategy addresses this major deficit in tandem with improving 
access to further education. The Core Strategy will address the 
educational and training needs of both existing and the new 
communities arising from population growth, including reinvestment in 
primary and secondary schools. 
 
7. Healthy Living and Inequalities – The health of Thurrock’s  residents 
is generally comparable to national trends. The proportion of Thurrock’s 
population living in disadvantage is quite low at just over 10%, however Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015 
 
17 
 life expectancy of those residents is 8 years less than those living in 
more affluent areas.  There is an identified lack of a major centre 
providing integrated medical services and the network of health centres 
throughout Thurrock needs to be progressively extended and 
upgraded. Throughout Thurrock there are 46 GP surgeries with a total 
of 62 GPs.  Many of the GP’s operate as single practitioners.  The 
spatial distribution of surgeries is uneven with two clusters in central 
Grays and central Tilbury.  There is an identified lack of GPs in the 
West Thurrock and the Purfleet area. There is also a shortage of 
nurses and health visitors within the Borough.  It is therefore important 
that the spatial distribution of development planned within Thurrock 
addresses current deficiencies as well as additional requirements to 
ensure adequate health provision for existing and future communities. 
 
8. Industrial and Occupational Structure –  Thurrock’s economy is 
centred on distribution, hotels and restaurants, public administration, 
retail and transport and communication. Local people employed in 
professional occupations increased from 6.3% to 8.3% between 2008 
and 2009 and those employed as associate professionals or in 
technical occupations increased from 11.25% to 12.6% during the 
same period. The less skilled occupations experienced a decline over 
the same period: - Distribution, hotels and restaurants (39%), Public 
administration, education and health industries (17%) and Transport 
and communications (14%). The implications for the Local 
Development Framework are that there is a need to diversify 
Thurrock’s economic base to provide the local community with more 
training and employment opportunities in the identified growth sectors.  
 
Evidence suggests that the VAT registered business stock in the 
Borough has grown by 40% since 1997, which is higher than the 
national rate (21%). VAT registered business stock at 2007 was 3,620. 
Since 2007 there has been a global economic restructuring that has 
affected parts of Thurrock’s economy.  However the indications from 
regional forecasting are that Thurrock’s economy will continue to grow 
over the long-term period to 2026 with retail, transport and 
communities, health and public administration being the key growth 
sectors.  
 
 The implication for the Local Development Framework is that it is 
important that policies aim to ensure that growth in local businesses is 
supported and promoted. Overall, the Core Strategy aspires to help 
secure an additional 26,000 jobs in Thurrock over the period 2001 –
2026, in conformity with the East of England Plan, mainly located within 
the five strategic employment growth locations. 
 
9. Retail Centres and Local Centres –  Within Thurrock, Grays is the 
major town centre, but only received 10% of comparison goods spend 
in 2007, a decline from 11% in 2000.  Grays was the dominant retail 
centre in the Borough until the opening of Lakeside Shopping Centre in 
1990. Lakeside Shopping Centre has ten times more floor-space than 
Grays.  Grays is the administrative centre for Thurrock and the focus Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015 
 
18 
 for service and cultural facilities.  Of the local centres, Corringham and 
South Ockendon are the largest, with a greater proportion of 
comparison goods in Corringham than South Ockendon. There is an 
identified need to promote the further diversification and development 
of Lakeside as a strategic employment location, whilst securing the 
health and vitality of Grays, through the promotion of the cultural, 
knowledge, retail, and public services sectors. 
 
10. Heritage Assets –  Throughout the Borough of Thurrock there are 
seven Conservation Areas located within the following areas; Horndon-
on-the-Hill, Corringham, Orsett, Fobbing, Purfleet, West Tilbury and 
East Tilbury. Other heritage assets within the Borough include Listed 
Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and the Registered Park at Belhus. 
All these provide a strong and positive contribution to local 
distinctiveness and character and should be maintained, enhanced and 
respected. 
 
11. International National, Regional and Local Designated Sites for 
Nature Conservation –  Thurrock has 1 Ramsar Site and 12 Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest. 57% of these sites are classified by Natural 
England as in a favourable condition.  There are 70 Local Wildlife Sites, 
with further potential sites identified.  The Borough also has 2 
designated Local Nature Reserves at Linford Wood and Grove House 
Wood.  Within the Borough there are 2 Special Landscape Areas 
classified for their landscape importance in a regional and countrywide 
context: the Mardyke Valley and Langdon Hills.  The Historic Buildings 
and Monuments Commission for England has classified Belhus Park as 
an Historic Park.  The implication for the Local Development 
Framework is that it is important that the location, type and scale of 
development planned within Thurrock is in keeping with the designated 
sites, does not impact negatively on them and, where possible, 
positively enhances their quality.   
 
12. Waste –  Evidence suggests that recycling and composting of 
household waste in Thurrock is improving. The proportion of household 
waste recycling and composting has increased from 4% in 2003/04 to 
30% in 2008/09. The Council recognises that recycling and composting 
of household waste should be promoted to reduce the utilisation of 
landfill.  The Council concludes that the design and layout of residential 
and commercial development should facilitate sustainable waste 
disposal, with due consideration given to recycling and composting. 
Commercial and industrial waste arisings are significant and Thurrock 
still receives a sizeable amount of London‘s waste. Land-fill capacity is 
limited and all other options for waste recovery and disposal must be 
addressed.

 THURROCK SPATIAL VISION FOR 2026  
 
3.9 This Plan will guide and deliver the regeneration of Thurrock, 
consolidating the approach to regeneration developed by the Shaping 
Thurrock Partnership. The Borough will become by 2026 a place where 
residents are provided with the education and skills to capture a wide 
range of local jobs, where the range of jobs is expanded to provide high 
quality employment with facilities and places that all members of the 
community can use and enjoy. 
 
3.10 The regeneration of Thurrock will be concentrated in five regeneration 
areas (as described below), with the nature of growth in each designed 
to create the establishment and maintenance of new purpose and 
identity. Purfleet will have a new centre with a thriving community at its 
heart and Lakeside will be transformed into a Regional Centre (town 
centre) providing a range of retail, leisure, employment, housing and 
new transport facilities. Grays will be an administrative centre and will 
include municipal, education, health and leisure facilities catering for 
Thurrock’s communities. Tilbury Town Centre will be an eco-quarter 
and an expanded Port of Tilbury and London Gateway Port will be 
some of the UK’s leading ports, providing employment, investment and 
facilities that benefit Thurrock as well as the sub-region. 
 
3.11 The Council and its regeneration partners will prioritise efforts to bring 
about the transformation of Lakeside into a Regional Centre and in 
doing so, will create an image, re-shape perceptions and consequently 
encourage and drive forward inward investment.  The level of 
investment in Lakeside by both private and public sectors will create 
confidence throughout the Borough. 
 
3.12 The Borough’s 26,000 planned new jobs will be derived from a 
combination of expansion of existing employers and new business 
start-ups, although the majority will come from inward investment. The 
jobs will broaden the range of skills to include management, 
administrative and technology based work with a significant 
contribution made by creative industries following the successful 
establishment of the Royal Opera House Production Park within 
Thurrock. Further evidence on the emergence of this sector will be 
found throughout the Borough, but notably at the Bata Estate at East 
Tilbury. 
 
3.13 This level of investment will drive demand for new housing. The Local 
Development Framework provides for over 18,500 new homes by 2021 
and up to a further 4750 dwellings to meet provision to 2026 and 
beyond with an emphasis on achieving a more balanced housing 
supply, providing greater numbers of family houses to rectify the 
present lack of supply of family housing and the deficit of Band D and 
above dwellings. 
 
3.14 To facilitate employment and housing growth, the Council will develop 
and strengthen the role of education within the Borough. The flagship Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015 
 
20 
 will be a thriving Learning Campus located in Grays, with Further 
Education and Higher Education facilities. It will operate on a ‘hub and 
spoke’ model – being linked to the National Skills Academy for Creative 
and Cultural Skills at the Royal Opera House Production Park, a new 
Logistics Academy at London Gateway and businesses throughout the 
sub-region. These schemes will be serviced by new and redeveloped 
secondary schools that offer a range of Academy, Federated and 
Independent places.  
 
3.15 In delivering unprecedented levels of employment and housing growth 
by 2026, considerable attention will be given to maintaining the 
environment and creating community identity.   The Borough will have 
moved from a haphazard pattern of land use to a series of distinct 
communities.  Place making will result in recognisable centres, many of 
which will establish new connections to the river frontage (in Purfleet, 
Grays and Tilbury) and will be well related through some of the best 
Green Grid facilities in the Region. 
 
3.16 By the end of the Plan period, Thurrock will be a place where investors 
are confident and communities are successful.   Thurrock lies at the 
centre of the Thames Gateway and will be an exemplar of how growth 
can effectively achieve the regeneration of places and communities.  
 
THURROCK - KEY CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE 
(THE THURROCK URBAN AREA) 
 
3.17 The great majority of new housing, employment and associated 
infrastructure will be located within the Thurrock Urban Area Key 
Centre for Development and Change extending from Purfleet to 
Tilbury/Chadwell.  This will provide approximately up to 10,000 of the 
additional homes and 15,000 additional jobs and improved community 
infrastructure sites on Previously Developed Land (i.e. brownfield 
sites). 
 
3.18 The Council has identified five key Regeneration Areas and key 
strategic Economic Hubs, which focus development on the Thurrock 
Urban Areas (KCDC) and the London Gateway site. Smaller scale 
development is also identified for the outlying settlements. 
 
REGENERATION AREAS 
 
3.19 The Key Areas of Regeneration and Growth Locations are: 
 
1. Purfleet 
2. Lakeside/West Thurrock 
3. Grays 
4. Tilbury 
5. London Gateway (employment only)

21 
 1. Purfleet 
 
3.20 Regeneration will be founded on the development of a mix of dwellings, 
employment and community facilities focused around a new centre 
adjoining the railway station and riverside. Approximately 3,000 new 
homes will be built in a variety of dwelling types and there will be a 
Neighbourhood Renewal project for the Garrison Estate and wider 
regeneration of Purfleet delivered through the Purfleet PRIDe Strategy. 
 
3.21 There will be a new Neighbourhood Area at the southern end of Botany 
Way adjoining the station, with a Community Hub Centre, a Health 
Centre, school and shopping facilities.  
 
3.22 High quality mixed-use and small business development will be 
encouraged at Botany Way and west of the railway station.  Cultural 
industries, including the Royal Opera House project, will be located on 
a site at High House Farm.  There will be additional employment sites 
at the northern and eastern ends of Purfleet. 
 
3.23 Public access to and along the riverfront will be improved and new 
urban open spaces will be provided as part of the Greengrid network. 
There will be a new road link connecting London Road with the Purfleet 
by-pass to improve access and traffic flow. 
 
2. Lakeside/West Thurrock 
 
3.24 The great majority of new housing, employment and associated 
development in the Borough will be located in the Lakeside/West 
Thurrock Regeneration Area. A mix of 3,300 new dwellings will be 
located to the south and east of Lakeside; new Neighbourhood Areas 
will be developed at West Thurrock and South Stifford including 
community and health facilities, primary schools and shopping facilities. 
 
3.25 The Lakeside Basin will be transformed into a Regional Centre (town 
centre), and, together with the wider area, will provide between 7,000 
and 9,000 jobs. Development will include a substantial expansion of 
retail floorspace (50,000 sqm net of comparison floorspace) to serve 
sub-regional needs and additional convenience and service retail, 
office and leisure floorspace to broaden the mix of uses. There will be 
an additional 3,000 dwellings, improved open space, and more 
community and health facilities.   
 
3.26 The transport network will be redesigned with improved accessibility 
east and west to Lakeside Shopping Centre from the A13, a relocated 
bus station and environmental improvements surrounding the Shopping 
Centre, including road and parking alterations. 
 
3.27 The Plan proposes the provision of a new railway station at West 
Thurrock, introduces the South Essex Rapid Transit and will ensure 
pedestrian access will be improved, including north-south access from Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015

 the river through Lakeside and West Thurrock to the Green Belt and 
beyond to South Ockendon. 
 
3.28 There will be improved public access to and along the riverfront at 
Wouldham Works and West Thurrock. New urban open spaces will be 
incorporated, as part of the Greengrid network  
 
3. Grays 
 
3.29 Grays will be modernised and regenerated as the key Civic, Cultural 
and Education centre in the Borough. There will be provision of 
approximately 2,600 additional dwellings of different types and 1600 
jobs including commercial offices in and around Grays. A new 
commercial and residential quarter will be developed to the south of the 
railway. 
 
3.30 Grays will be a focus for education with the location of HE/FE Open 
Learning Campus in the town centre and new schools around the town 
centre. A new Community Hospital and further community facilities will 
be located in the northern part of the town centre.  
 
3.31 Cultural facilities will be improved, including the Thameside Theatre 
and refurbishment of the State Cinema. Shopping facilities will be 
retained and improved including redevelopment and refurbishment of 
certain sites. 
 
3.32 A new Transport Zone will be developed around the station including 
an improved railway crossing. The pedestrian environment will be 
improved, including better links between north of the railway line and 
the south and the riverfront. 
 
3.33 There will be new housing-led development in Titan Pit area with 
community facilities, and development of a Sports Hub area in North 
East Grays (including Blackshots). 
 
4. Tilbury 
 
3.34 Tilbury is a key location for employment in the Borough and will provide 
between 1,600 and 3,800 additional jobs in logistics, port and riverside 
industries. Port-related employment land is located to the north of 
Tilbury. 
 
3.35 Approximately 1000 new dwellings over the longer term will also be 
built in Tilbury, together with improved health and community facilities.  
Major renewal of housing and local facilities in the centre will take place 
to create an eco-quarter that is also sustainable in a flood-risk zone.  
 
3.36 The land between Tilbury and the riverside will be enhanced and 
opportunities for appropriate re-use and refurbishment of Listed 
Buildings and green linkage between the urban area and the river 
pursued. The landscape setting of Tilbury Fort and approaches to it will 
be enhanced. There will be further development of cultural facilities and Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015 
 
23 
 industry based upon the riverside development and cultural heritage of 
the riverside.  
 
3.37 Public access and informal recreation along the riverside will be 
improved. There will be improvements to transport links.  A Strategic 
Lorry Park will be developed to the north of Tilbury on Tilbury Marshes. 
 
5. London Gateway/Corringham and Stanford-Le-Hope 
 
3.38 There will be a major logistics, import-export based employment 
development at London Gateway with 11,000 to 13,000 jobs created to 
secure the long-term future of the industry in Thurrock. Development of 
ancillary, associated and spin-off employment activities will take place 
on the wider employment site, including a strategic lorry park.  There is 
also potential scope for large-scale high quality campus style relocation 
or inward-investment business developments. 
 
3.39 New homes will be provided mainly on Previously Developed Land 
(brownfield) at Corringham and Stanford-le-hope.  There will be some 
Green Belt land release around Stanford-le-hope.  
 
3.40 There will be improved community facilities including refreshed schools 
and an improved and enhanced town centre of Stanford-le-hope. 
 
OUTLYING SETTLEMENTS 
 
Outlying settlements south of the A13 
 
3.41 There will be some limited housing development at East Tilbury and 
Chadwell St Mary together with some improved local facilities.  There 
will be a focus of mixed use development within East Tilbury to 
regenerate the centre.  Cultural and leisure facilities will be developed 
at the riverside at East Tilbury.  
 
Outlying settlements north of the A13 
 
3.42 South Ockendon/Aveley will be a focus for regeneration including 
provision for a limited number of approximately 2,100 additional homes 
underpinned by enhancement of community infrastructure and services 
including an expanded and refurbished school.   
 
3.43 Other villages will be a focus for conservation and enhancement of the 
built environment under-pinned by enhancement of community 
infrastructure and services.  The Strategy will not include any planned 
Green Belt release at these settlements. 
 
THE GREEN BELT  
 
3.44 Except for the limited specific planned land releases set out below, 
there will be no strategic scale release of Green Belt land in general 
conformity with the Regional Spatial Strategy East of England Plan. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015 
 
24 
 Where limited local scale land release is required for the planned 
developments, the overall schemes will provide for measures to 
enhance the surrounding Green Belt and incorporate design features 
that reinforce and secure defensible Green Belt boundaries that are 
sustainable into the long term. 
 
3.45 The Council will support the relocation of a school currently located 
within the Green Belt at the North Grays Broad Location as 
complementary development to the proposed new Sports Hub and the 
relocation of a college to Grays Learning Campus town centre site.  
The vacated sites will be available for housing development.  The 
Council will release land within the Green Belt if required on the urban 
edge of Stanford-Le-Hope for dwellings and at Corringham to provide 
for a new replacement secondary school. Recent planning consent 
granted on appeal has released Green Belt land for housing at 
Batafield in East Tilbury and Land at Aveley. 
 
3.46 There will also be specific, defined Green Belt land release to meet a 
strategic requirement for additional employment land north of Tilbury, 
on Tilbury Marshes, including a Lorry Park. 
 
 
STRATEGIC SPATIAL OBJECTIVES 
 
3.47 To achieve the Spatial Vision for the Borough of Thurrock it is essential 
that the Core Strategy includes Strategic Spatial Objectives (SSOs).  
The Core Strategy’s policies will deliver the SSOs. 
 
3.48 The Council consulted on the SSOs in July 2006 and January 2008.  
The SSOs set out below reflect the comments expressed by the local 
community. 
 
3.49 Appendix 2 demonstrates the relationships between the SSOs and the 
Thematic Policies in Chapter 5. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 CORE STRATEGY POLICIES 
 
3.50 The Council has developed policies at four levels: 
 
 Overarching Sustainable Development Policy  – sets out the 
Council’s commitment to the sustainable growth and regeneration of 
Thurrock’s communities through a presumption in favour of sustainable 
development. This policy is set out in full as the final section of this 
chapter as the scene-setter and overarching policy context for the 
spatial, thematic and Management of Development policies that follow 
in the subsequent chapters. 
 Core Strategic Spatial Policies – deal with the overall spatial 
distribution, broad locations and key strategic schemes for 
development that will deliver the Spatial Vision for Thurrock. Chapter 4 
sets out in full the five Core Strategic Spatial Policies. 
 
 Core Strategic Thematic Policies  – deal with each important theme 
or topic in turn and set out in detail how the Council intends to ensure 
the best outcomes are delivered.  Chapter 5 sets out in full the thirty-
three Core Strategic Thematic policies.  
 
 Core Strategic Policies for Management of Development  – which in 
conjunction with the Thematic and Strategic Spatial Policies are the 
basis for the determination of planning applications for the development 
and use of land and buildings. 
 
 
OSDP1 – PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND 
REGENERATION IN THURROCK 
Thurrock Council is committed to promoting sustainable growth in Thurrock 
that serves to regenerate its communities by proactively engaging with 
developers to deliver high quality sustainable development schemes across 
all types of land uses and facilities. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)   
Chapter 3 – The Future of Thurrock                               Adopted January 2015 
 
28 
 Thurrock Council, when considering development proposals, will take a 
positive approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable 
development contained in the National Planning Policy Framework. It will 
always work proactively with applicants jointly to find solutions which mean 
that proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to secure 
development that improves the economic, social and environmental 
conditions in Thurrock.  Working pro-actively to find solutions will be 
achieved by measures such as encouraging applicants to hold early pre-
application discussions and through the use of Planning Performance 
Agreements and Local Development Order s in appropriate circumstances. 
Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Core Strategy, 
(and, where relevant, with polices in neighbourhood plans) will be approved 
without delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. 
Where t here are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies 
are out of date at the time of making the decision then the Council will grant 
permission unless material considerations indicate otherwise – taking into 
account whether: 
(i) Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly 
and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against 
the policies in the National Planning Policy Framework taken as a 
whole; or 
(ii) Specific policies in that Framework indicate that development 
should be restricted. 
 
The presumption in favour of sustainable development does not apply 
where development requiring appropriate assessment under the Birds or 
Habitats Directives is being considered, planned or determined.

 CSSP1 – SUSTAINABLE HOUSING AND LOCATIONS  
 
Introduction  
 
4.1 In 2003, the Thames Gateway was identified as one of the Growth 
Areas in the Government’s Sustainable Communities Plan. Thurrock is 
located strategically within the Thames Gateway and has been 
identified by regional government as a driver for economic and housing 
growth within this sub-region. The Council will focus on this strategic 
context for Thurrock in a way that will promote and deliver sustainable 
communities by creating places where people want to live, work and 
visit, and which will enable people to meet their aspirations and 
potential.  
 
4.2 Housing growth will be achieved through the managed regeneration 
and renewal of previously developed land and if necessary through 
greenfield release that will be well integrated with existing 
neighbourhoods in Thurrock. This policy sets out the scale and broad 
locations of new housing development to meet the East of England 
Plan requirements for 18,500 new dwellings in Thurrock to be delivered 
over the period 2001 to 2021, which the Council considers are 
manageable and desirable to deliver its sustainable regeneration 
strategy for Thurrock.  
 
4.3 A Plan, Monitor and Manage approach to residential land supply is 
required to ensure that the positive effects of regeneration are not 
undermined by potential negative environmental effects. The Council 
has prepared a Housing Trajectory, which identifies how the rolling five-
year land supply relates to the current market outlook and anticipated 
recovery in the housing market. In addition, a 15-year supply has been 
identified for the period 2011 (planned adoption year) to 2026. It also 
shows how the overall housing allocation pans out over the Plan 
period. The trajectory will be updated and published in the AMR to take 
account of actual completions, changing market conditions and outlook.  
 
Thurrock Strategies and Plans  
 
4.4 Thurrock’s Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) 
contains a full assessment of the availability and suitability of all known 
potential housing land identified within Thurrock.  The SHLAA will be 
rolled forward and refreshed on an annual basis to inform the Housing 
Trajectory and be reported through the Annual Monitoring Report 
(AMR). 
 
4.5 Through the AMR the Council has monitored the land supply in 
Thurrock and developed a Housing Trajectory for the plan period and 
beyond.  The Housing Trajectory indicates that a total of 4,950  new 
dwellings were completed between 1st April 2001 and 31st March 2009. 
It is evident from the AMR that approximately 92% of these dwellings 
will be delivered on previously developed land in the Thurrock Urban 
Area over the plan period.  Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended) 
Chapter 4 – Spatial Policies                                                                 Adopted January 2015 
 
31 
  
4.6 Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation (TTGDC) 
Corporate Plan 2008 – 2011 sets out the TTGDC’s approach to 
housing delivery to 2021.  TTGDC intends on concentrating its direct 
housing interventions on a number of key sites where market failure 
has occurred. These sites are at Purfleet Pride (Purfleet Waterside and 
Botany Way), Wouldham Road/Fiddlers Reach (West Thurrock), South 
Stifford and Tilbury Town.  The TTGDC has prepared a series of 
masterplans for each of these areas and for Grays, Aveley and South 
Ockendon. These masterplans will guide development in the respective 
areas.  
   
CSSP1 – SUSTAINABLE HOUSING AND LOCATIONS  
1. HOUSING DELIVERY  
 
Thurrock is required to deliver a minimum of 18,500 dwellings between 2001 and 
2021. This policy makes provision through allocations at broad locations for 
approximately 13,550 dwellings for the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2021. Within 
the overall total allocation, the Council has also made an Indicative Provision for 
4750 dwellings for the 5-year period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2026 in accordance 
with the provisions of PPS3 to provide a strategic 15-year supply from the planned 
date of Adoption of this DPD in 2011. 
 
I. New residential development will be directed to Previously Developed Land in 
the Thurrock Urban Area, Outlying Settlements and other existing built-up 
areas to protect the surrounding countryside and Green Belt. Over the period 
2009 to 2021 the Council will seek to ensure that up to 92%  of new residential 
development will be on Previously Developed Land (PDL). 
 
II. Development will only be permitted on greenfield and Green Belt land where it 
is specifically allocated for residential development and where it is required to 
maintain a five-year rolling housing land supply. 
 
III. The Council has and will continue to identify Broadly Defined Locations for the 
release of land within the Green Belt in accordance with Policies CSTP 1 and 
CSSP 4 to help maintain a rolling 5-year supply of available and deliverable 
housing land over the Plan period to 2026 and will maintain this rolling 5-year 
supply through an Annual Refresh of the SHLAA and the Annual Monitoring 
Report.  
 
IV. The Council’s Strategic Spatial Housing Policy is to direct development to 
Broadly Defined Locations that make optimum use of Previously Developed 
Land both in and around the Thurrock Urban Area, at identified Outlying 
Settlements and within the Green Belt where appropriate, subject to section 2 
and 3 below. 
 
2. ALLOCATIONS AND PHASING  
 
I. To allocate at least 85% of new housing development in the 5-year period 
2011-2016 inclusive to Previously Developed Land (PDL) locations in and 
around the Thurrock Urban Area, at the identified Outlying Settlements and Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended) 
Chapter 4 – Spatial Policies                                                                 Adopted January 2015 
 
32 
 within the Green Belt where appropriate. 
 
II. To allocate at least 80% of new housing development in the period 2011-2026 
to PDL locations in and around the Thurrock Urban Area, at the identified 
Outlying Settlements and PDL locations within the Green Belt where 
appropriate. 
 
III. Identify and allocate Broadly Defined Locations for the release of land within 
the Green Belt in accordance with Policies CSTP 1 and CSSP 4 for the period 
2011–2026 to accommodate no more than 20% of new housing development. 
 
IV. To identify indicative Broadly Defined Locations for the release of sufficient 
PDL in and around the Thurrock Urban Area and at the identified Outlying 
Settlements together with PDL and green-field locations within the Green Belt 
to provide the indicative Strategic Housing Land supply from 2021 to 2026 
inclusive in accordance with PPS3. 
 
3. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PROPOSED HOUSING BROAD LOCATIONS 
2009 - 2021 
 
i. Thurrock Urban Area  (Identified Dwelling Capacity as at 1st April 2009) 
 
The great majority of new housing and associated development for the period 
2009-2021 will be located in and around the Thurrock Urban Area Key Centre 
for Development and Change including: 
 
Purfleet   3180 dwellings  
West Thurrock/Lakeside Basin   3365 dwellings  
Grays   2605 dwellings  
Tilbury including Town centre        470 dwellings  
Chadwell St Mary   390 dwellings  
TOTAL  10,010 dwellings  
 
 
ii. Outlying Settlements north of the A13 (approximately 2100 new dwellings)  
 
Ockendon and Aveley will be a focus for regeneration including provision for a 
limited number of additional homes on PDL locations under-pinned by 
enhancement of community infrastructure and services. This includes capacity 
identified for 210 dwellings on Previously Developed Land in the Green Belt.  In 
addition the Aveley Village Extension, South of Aveley By-pass site (340 
dwellings) is shown on the Proposals Map as a release from the Green Belt as a 
consequence of a recent planning permission.  
 
 
iii. Outlying Settlements south of the A13 (approximately 580 New dwellings)  
 
The outlying centres of East Tilbury and Corringham/Stanford-le-hope will each 
be a focus for regeneration including provision for a limited number of additional 
homes on Brownfield land under-pinned by enhancement of community 
infrastructure and services. This total includes the recent consent on Green Belt 
land at Batafield at East Tilbury.  The housing location is shown on the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended) 
Chapter 4 – Spatial Policies                                                                 Adopted January 2015

 Proposals Map as a release from the Green Belt as a consequence of a recent 
planning permission.  
 
iv. Stanford-le-hope/Corringham Urban Extension  (330 new dwellings - indicative 
capacity) 
 
There will be a limited release of greenfield land at two locations on the urban 
fringe of Stanford-le hope / Corringham. In total the land release on the urban 
fringe will amount to 330 dwellings approx. No dwelling, including its curtilage, 
may be located on areas modelled to be Flood Zone 3b, including an 
appropriate allowance for climate change.  There are additional PDL sites 
available within the urban area.  The final site boundaries will be included in the 
Adopted Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD and identified on the 
Proposals Map. 
 
v. North-east Grays Urban Extension  (approximately 460 dwellings - indicative 
capacity) 
 
There will be a limited release of PDL within the Green Belt that will be made 
available by the relocation of one school and one college currently located 
within the North-East of the Grays Urban Area to accommodate new homes 
supported by community infrastructure.  The final site boundaries will be 
included in the Adopted Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD and 
identified on the Proposals Map.  A new “Sports Hub” of co-located leisure and 
sports facilities will be developed in association with the new homes and the 
new relocated school/college.  
 
vi.   Small Green Belt sites /Villages in Green Belt  (approximately 120 new  
dwellings)  
 
As of 1st of April 2009 there was potential capacity for 120 dwellings  (including a 
number with planning consent) on PDL and green-field Green Belt land at 
several small sites. This Policy does not preclude continuation of one-off green-
field or PDL Green Belt land release for small housing sites where proposals 
cou
ld demonstrate “very special circumstances” in accordance with PPG2, and 
meet the requirements of the relevant Thematic and Development Management 
policies in this Plan. 
 
4. INDICATIVE 5 YEAR HOUSING SUPPLY (15 YEAR TOTAL) FROM 2021 TO 
2026 INCLUSIVE 
 
The Council considers that the most appropriate Indicative Broad Locations for the 
long-term housing supply beyond 2021 is Previously Developed Land within the 
Thurrock Urban Area and outlying urban settlements.

Grays (broad location) 1935 dwellings (approx) 
West Thurrock 279 dwellings (approx) 
Stanford –le-hope and Corringham  250 dwellings (approx) 
 
The total capacity of the above broad locations exceeds the target allocation of 4750 
dwellings, but the Council considers it prudent to build in a measure of potential 
redundancy into these Indicative Locations.  The dwelling figures include provision 
to take account for the rolling forward of the base date for adoption of the Core 
Strategy. 
 
The Council reserves its position on the final allocation of Broad Locations for the 
period 2021-2026 inclusive. These will be firmed up through the periodic review of 
the Plan.

 CSSP2 - SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT GROWTH  
 
Introduction  
 
4.7 The Council will encourage and develop a thriving economy in the 
Borough by ensuring that there is sufficient land and floorspace to 
accommodate projected employment growth to facilitate the continuing 
and emerging needs of business. The policy focus will contribute to 
three broad outcomes – supporting employment growth, creating the 
conditions required for sustainable growth in target growth sectors; and 
ensuring direct benefits to local communities.  
 
4.8 The Council will plan, monitor and manage the supply of employment 
land to ensure and develop sufficient capacity to accommodate future 
employment growth and achieve an appropriate balance in supply and 
demand for employment land.  
 
4.9 The evidence base to the East of England Plan (2008) requires the 
local authorities in the TGSE to provide an enabling context for at least 
55,000 net additional jobs, of which 26,000 jobs must be delivered in 
Thurrock during the period 2001 to 2021. The 2008-2009 recession has 
effectively made this time horizon obsolete. The Council will however, 
seek to maintain its employment role by protecting sufficient land to 
accommodate this growth over the longer time horizon to 2026 and 
beyond as necessary. The East of England Plan (Regional Spatial 
Strategy) Single Issue Review: Thurrock Key Centre for Development 
and Change Policy  (2009) considers the potential for economic growth 
across the Thurrock Urban Area with particular focus upon the 
Lakeside Basin/West Thurrock. The Council considers that the 
evidence base to support the contention that there is capacity in the 
Lakeside Basin/West Thurrock to accommodate 120,300m2 of Class 
B1 (Business), Class B2 (General Industrial) and Class B8 (Warehouse 
and Distribution) floorspace remains valid. 
 
4.10 The adopted Regional Economic Strategy (RES) of 2008 seeks to align 
with the review of the RSS to 2031.  The RES identifies the Thames 
Gateway South Essex sub region as one of the “Engines of Growth” for 
the region.  Specific reference is made to Thurrock in the RES and in 
particular with regard to the role and need to enhance economic 
clusters.  There are two economic clusters identified in Thurrock as key 
economic drivers and future areas of development: 
 London Gateway and Tilbury Ports 
 Lakeside Basin 
The strategy also highlights the potential for the area to be a niche 
centre in creative industries and environmental technologies including a 
possible bio-energy park in Thurrock.  
 
Thurrock Strategies and Plans  
 
4.11 The Thurrock Economic Development Strategy  (2009) (TEDS), which 
was developed by the TTDGC in partnership with the Council. The Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended) 
Chapter 4 – Spatial Policies                                                                 Adopted January 2015 
 
36 
 basis of this strategy is to focus future growth upon the existing core 
economic sectors and the identified growth sectors. Thurrock’s core 
economic sectors include the international port and logistic related 
facilities at Tilbury and the recent approval for a deep-water port at 
London Gateway and the logistics and retail clusters at the Lakeside 
Basin / West Thurrock.  
 
4.12 The TEDS seeks to reduce dependency upon these sectors by 
diversifying the economy in a manner that will not impact upon the 
area’s core sectors negatively or create unnecessary barriers to the 
continuing development of businesses in these core activities. The 
growth sectors identified by the TEDS could offer additional sources of 
new employment and contribute to economic diversification in: 
business services; recreation and leisure; environmental technologies; 
recycling and energy; creative industries; and public sector services. 
They provide an opportunity to broaden the economic base over the 
long-term period and provide new sources of employment. 
 
4.13 The TEDS sets out five Key Strategic Economic Hubs at Purfleet; 
Grays; Lakeside / West Thurrock Basin; London Gateway and Tilbury. 
These Key Strategic Economic Hubs will collectively form the locations 
for employment growth across the core and growth sectors and will 
provide the engines of economic development and regeneration in 
Thurrock. New employment development will be directed to appropriate 
locations in the Key Strategic Economic Hubs on land identified as 
Primary and Secondary Industrial and Commercial Employment Land, 
mixed-use and other job generating land. 
 
CSSP2 -SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT GROWTH  
1. The Council will promote and support economic development in the Key Strategic 
Economic Hubs that seeks to expand upon their existing core sectors and/or provide 
opportunities in the growth sectors.  
 
I. The Key Strategic Economic Hubs will deliver the East of England Plan’s indicative 
target of 26,000 new jobs for Thurrock over the period 2001-2026 and beyond. 
 
II. The Key Strategic Economic Hubs and other sites will supply approximately 456 
Ha (gross) of employment land, including circa 245 Ha at the London Gateway 
development. There is sufficient previously developed land in the Key Strategic 
Economic Hubs to accommodate the proposed jobs numbers with the exception of 
the Green Belt release North of Tilbury to provide expansion land for port related 
development .  The final site boundaries will be included in the Adopted Site 
Specific Allocations and Policies DPD and identified on the Proposals Map. 
 
III. The Council will direct inward investment to the Key Strategic Economic Hubs.  
 
IV. The Council will promote Flagship Developments that will generate and provide a 
catalyst for securing high quality jobs in the Key Strategic Economic Hubs. The 
Key Economic Strategic Economic Hubs, Core and Growth Sectors and Flagship 
Developments are set out below.

 CSSP3 – SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE  
 
Introduction  
 
4.14 In order to deliver the regeneration agenda for Thurrock, it is necessary 
that the essential social and physical infrastructure be put in place.  
There is a need to provide modern effective social and physical 
infrastructure and enhance the quality and provision of all public 
services, including health education, transport and community 
infrastructure. The Council will ensure that the high levels of 
development proposed will deliver the right infrastructure in the right 
place at the right time. Infrastructure funding will be secured from both 
the public and private sectors and the Council will work with public and 
voluntary bodies to create a sense of well being and pride in the 
community. 
 
4.15 The delivery of the regeneration agenda for Thurrock will be a complex 
process that will require co-ordination amongst the key stakeholders to 
ensure that infrastructure is delivered alongside and, where 
appropriate, in advance of new development. Phasing is one of the 
most important aspects of delivering the quality and form of 
development in Thurrock. The delivery of required new infrastructure 
will determine how quickly certain areas can be developed and the 
ability of providers to deliver necessary infrastructure will need to be 
taken into account. The viability of public and private services, including 
public transport, required to support the new housing and jobs will also 
be dependent on land being released in a phased and logical way. 
 
4.16 The Council is convinced a proactive Plan–led and driven approach is 
essential to create a “step change” in infrastructure delivery capacity 
and capability and to match the planned housing and employment 
growth. This policy is crucial to the Council demonstrating the overall 
sustainability and deliverability of the Strategic Spatial Development 
Strategy. It also must be sufficiently robust and flexible to 
accommodate rapid societal change and fluctuating economic 
conditions and any uplift in housing/employment sub-regional 
allocations that may result from the review of the East of England Plan. 
 
4.17 The Thames Gateway Delivery Plan (2007) seeks to deliver the growth 
agenda identified in the Sustainable Communities Plan through key 
priority cross-Government funding. The Thames Gateway Delivery Plan 
provides a framework for making use of public investment, local 
ownership and private sector entrepreneurship for the period 2008 to 
2011. Thurrock is identified as one of six priority locations in terms of 
local community spending allocations. The Thames Gateway Delivery 
Plan states that TTGDC funding proposals are set out in the Corporate 
Plan, which was agreed with Ministers.  
 
4.18 The East of England Plan specifies that there has got to be a step 
change in the provision of transport infrastructure in order to 
accommodate the additional development in the Gateway. To this end, Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended) 
Chapter 4 – Spatial Policies                                                                 Adopted January 2015 
 
40 
 it includes Thurrock among the ‘Key Centres for Development and 
Change’. The East of England Plan Implementation Plan (EEPIP)  
(2009) seeks to bring together the East of England Plan and East of 
England Regional Economic Strategy through one integrated delivery 
document and is an important component of the Regional 
Implementation Framework. This document sets out the key sub-
regional investment priorities for the South Essex Thames Gateway 
including Thurrock.   
 
4.19 The TTGDC currently has responsibility for the delivery of the 
regeneration and growth agenda in partnership with the Council and 
other agencies and developers. As part of that task its key role is to 
identify infrastructure requirements through implementation of the 
Regeneration Framework and Master Planning exercises and assist in 
the assembly of land and delivering supporting infrastructure from 
developer contributions from major schemes. The TTGDC Corporate 
Plan identifies a number of key priorities in which the TTGDC will act as 
the lead partner to deliver specific interventions.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
4.20 The Infrastructure Prioritisation and Implementation Programme 2006 -
2021 advises on the infrastructure needed to support the levels of 
development planned for the Borough between 2006 and 2021. The 
specific objectives of the Infrastructure Prioritisation and 
Implementation Programme are as follows: 
 
 A comprehensive assessment of the infrastructure 
requirement, backed up by a sound argument and an evidence 
trail; 
 Modelling of spatial options and the impact of associated 
infrastructure interventions including transport modelling; 
 An understanding of the infrastructure delivery options related 
to the phasing of specific developments; 
 An assessment of the financial options available to the Council 
to deliver the infrastructure, including a revised basis for 
securing Section 106 investment, a municipal bond and other 
public / private funding sources; 
 Recommendation of a preferred delivery programme that 
draws together the above elements, to include an assessment 
of risk. 
 
4.21 An updated version of this document (2010) was published in tandem 
with this DPD as the Technical Evidence Base for this policy. The 
Infrastructure Prioritisation and Implementation Programme provides 
the basis for the Infrastructure Trajectory that is appended to this Plan. 
It will be reviewed on an annual basis alongside the Housing Trajectory 
and published in the Annual Monitoring Report.

 CSSP4 - SUSTAINABLE GREEN BELT  
 
Introduction 
 
4.22 The Green Belt has had a profound effect on settlement development 
pattern within Thurrock and ensured that Thurrock has not coalesced 
with London. In total, the Green Belt accounts for approximately 60% of 
the Borough’s total land area. The remaining 40% comprises the major 
settlements and land comprising the proposed London Gateway Port 
and existing oil refinery at Coryton. Thurrock has a number of Major 
Developed Sites in the Green Belt. These will be identified in the 
Proposals Map and Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD. 
 
4.23 The Borough’s development requirements will continue to be directed 
to previously developed land to promote the regeneration of derelict 
and under-used land within the identified Regeneration Areas. Planning 
applications for development within the Green Belt will be assessed 
against the relevant Core Thematic and Development Management 
policies and National Planning Policy on Green Belts.  
 
4.24 The policy also sets out the Council’s strategic planning approach to 
sustaining the Green Belt in Thurrock, promoting opportunities to 
enhance it and the measures the Council will promote to strengthen the 
local landscape features, help sustain the open character of the Green 
Belt and secure sustainable boundaries. This includes:  
 
 provide opportunities for access to the open countryside for the 
urban population 
 provide opportunities for outdoor sport and outdoor recreation near 
urban areas 
 retain attractive landscapes, and enhance landscapes, near where 
people live 
 improve damaged and derelict land around towns 
 secure nature conservation and biodiversity interest and 
 retain land in agricultural, forestry and related uses  
 
4.25 PPG2  sets out the Government’s policy on the purpose of Green Belt 
and appropriate development within it. As defined by PPG2, there are 
five purposes for the Green Belt, all of which are particularly relevant to 
Thurrock given the proximity of the Borough to London’s urban area 
and the spatial pattern of Thurrock’s settlements and their relationship 
to the countryside.  The five purposes of the Green Belt are: 
 
 To check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas; 
 To prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another; 
 To assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment; 
 To preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and 
 To assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of 
derelict and other urban land.

 4.26 The East of England Plan (2008)  sets out the broad extent of the Green 
Belt in the East of England. Policy SS7 states that the broad extent of 
Green Belts still remains appropriate within the region and should be 
maintained. It is also stated that where Green Belt boundaries are 
reviewed, the aim should be to release sufficient land to avoid further 
review before 2031 and that Development Plan Documents should test 
whether this scale of growth after 2021 will be achievable in the local 
circumstances and, if not, release the maximum area commensurate 
with sustainable development. Policy SS8 addresses the urban fringe. 
The policy requires the enhancement, effective management and 
appropriate use of land in the urban fringe with consideration for 
enhancement of character and appearance and its recreational and/or 
biodiversity value.  
 
4.27   The Adopted RSS policy for Thurrock confirms that a formal Statutory   
Green Belt Review is not required for Thurrock at this stage. However, 
the on-going RSS Review 2011-2031 will consider whether such a 
formal Statutory Green Belt Review should be a requirement post 
2011. The Council will monitor the position and put forward its 
proposals for the Thurrock Green Belt to 2031 in the subsequent 
Review of this DPD that will commence once the Review RSS 2011-
2031 is adopted or successor plan.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
4.28 Transforming and Revitalising Thurrock: A Framework for 
Regeneration and Sustainable Growth (2005) sets out the TTGDC’s 
priorities and agenda for positive change in Thurrock. Policy 3 relates 
to the establishment of green space to facilitate growth. In reference to 
the Green Belt, this policy states that valuable areas of green space will 
continue to be protected.  
 
4.29 The Council has tested the following policy against the Exceptional 
Circumstances test as set out in PPG 2. 
 
CSSP4  - SUSTAINABLE GREEN BE LT 
1. Balancing competing demands on the Thurrock Green Belt  
 
The Council’s policy is to maintain the purpose, function and open character 
of the Green Belt in Thurrock in accordance with the provisions of PPG2 for 
the plan period. 
 
The Council will:  
I. Maintain the permanence of the boundaries of the Green Belt, 
excepting the proposed Urban Extension Broad Locations Identified in 
this policy, Policy CSSP 1 and as shown on the Proposals Map. 
 
II. Resist development where there would be any danger of coalescence.  
 
III. Maximise opportunities for increased public access, leisure and 
biodiversity. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

All without prejudice to and pending: 
IV. The formal Review of the Thurrock Core Strategy DPD that the Council 
will commence in 2011 In accordance with the requirements of the 
proposed Localism Act and the proposed National Planning Policy 
Framework. 
 
2. Locating sustainable development at Broad Locations adjoining the 
Thurrock Urban Area and Outlying Settlements. 
 
The Council will direct development to the following Urban Extension Broad 
Locations subject to the provisions of policies CSSP1, CSSP2, CSSP3, 
CSTP1 and the provisions set out below: 
 
I. Opportunities for Leisure and Sport in the Green Belt  
 
i. The Council’s policy is that the constructive and positive use of the 
Green Belt for sports and leisure purposes is an essential component 
of the Thurrock Spatial Strategy that will underpin the sustainable 
development and regeneration of Thurrock to the long-term benefit of 
local people.  
ii. The Council will actively encourage the pursuit of leisure and sports 
activities appropriate to the Green Belt by improving connectivity 
between Thurrock’s Urban Areas and the Green Belt to promote this 
asset for the enjoyment and well being of Thurrock’s communities. 
iii. In particular, the Council will support the development of Sports Hubs 
in Green Belt land at North East Grays and at Belhus (shown on the 
Key Diagram and included in the Adopted Site Specific Allocations 
and Policies DPD and identified on the Proposals Map).  
 
II. Opportunities for Economic Development  
 
           Broad Location: Tilbury Marshes 
 
i. The Council will support the principle of release of Green Belt land ( 26 
Ha.) to the North of Tilbury for port-related employment use and a 
Strategic Lorry Park to facilitate expansion of Tilbury Port. The Council 
will require management arrangements to be put in place for the 
remainder of the Tilbury Marshes site that has important biodiversity 
interest and required mitigation measures to be implemented to 
replace lost habitat and flood storage areas.  The final site boundaries 
will be included in the Adopted Sites Specific Allocations and Policies 
DPD and identified on the Proposals Map. 
 
III. Opportunities for improving for Educational provision 
 
i. Belhus School Site  
 
The Council supports the potential relocation of the school for the 
Ormiston Trust Academy within the Belhus School Site.

48 
 ii. Broad Location: North-East Grays – Relocation of the Secondary 
School and College within the Green Belt 
 
The Council will support the relocation of a school currently located 
within the Green Belt at the North Grays Broad Location as 
complementary development to the proposed new Sports Hub and the 
relocation of a college to Grays Learning Campus town centre site.   
The final site boundaries will be included in the Adopted Site Specific 
Allocations and Policies DPD and identified on the Proposals Map. The 
vacated sites will be available for housing development (See 3.I.i 
below)  
 
iii. Broad Location: NE Stanford-le-hope/Corringham  
 
The Council will release land within the Green Belt if required to the NE 
of Stanford-le-hope / Corringham to provide for a new replacement 
secondary school (see Key Diagram). 
 
The vacated school site (currently “white land” in the Local Plan) would 
then be available for housing development. 
 
3. Housing Land Supply to 2021 
 
I. The following Broad Locations have been identified as Green Belt 
releases to contribute to the housing supply to 2021: 
 
(i) North East Grays – 461 (Identified potential capacity from school 
and college site, see 2 III.iii above)  The 
final site boundaries will be included in the 
Adopted Site Specific Allocations and 
Policies DPD and identified on the 
Proposals Map. 
(ii) Stanford-le-hope – 328 (provided no dwellings, including its 
curtilage, is located on areas modelled to be 
Flood Zone 3b, including an appropriate 
allowance for climate change).  The final 
site boundaries will be included in the 
Adopted Site Specific Allocations and 
Policies DPD and identified on the 
Proposals Map. 
 
The Council considers that this relatively small-scale housing allocation 
on sites within the Green Belt is required to ensure a robust and 
deliverable policy whilst entirely reasonable and proportional to the 
Thurrock context. 
 
II. This policy approach will be reviewed with regard to the final outcome of 
the East of England Plan Review 2011 or successor document the 
evolving new Local Plans system and the proposed National Planning 
Policy Framework.

4. Enhancing the Green Belt  
 
I. Sustainable Boundaries 
The Council will seek to reinforce the Green Belt boundary through 
structural enhancement of the local landscape features. The Council 
will secure structural landscape enhancements in accordance with 
Landscape Character Assessments and they will be delivered by 
developers as part of an overall contribution package linked to 
development schemes. 
 
II. Public access, open space and biodiversity 
The implementation of the Greengrid Strategy will form a critical 
component of the overall Green Belt strategy to retain open character, 
enhance public access and secure biodiversity within Green Belt. 
 
III. Sustainable Design and Construction 
Developers proposing schemes within the Green Belt will have to fully 
comply with the relevant Thematic and Development Management 
policies in this plan. 
 
5. Green Belt Alterations to Proposals Map  
 
I. Land excluded from the Green Belt because planning permission has 
been granted for housing at Batafield, East Tilbury and land south of 
Aveley By-pass and employment land at Ponds Farm, Purfleet. 
 
II. The Council proposes to include 55.3 hectares of previously 
safeguarded land adjacent to the former Shell Haven refinery site that 
was identified as oil refinery expansion land. With the cessation of the 
refinery use at Shell Haven and recent decision of the Secretary of 
State to exclude the land for development purposes from the London 
Gateway scheme, the land will assist in the purposes of the Green Belt 
in maintaining a strategic gap between the residential settlements of 
Stanford le hope and Corringham and the port at London Gateway.  
 
III. The Council proposes 1.6 hectares of land is excluded from the Green 
Belt that has planning permission for housing development and is part 
of the major development site at Orsett and is incorrectly shown in the 
Local Plan as Green Belt.

 CSSP 5 – SUSTAINABLE GREENGRID 
 
Introduction  
 
4.30 The Thurrock Greengrid Strategy is a key priority for the Council, Local 
Strategic Partnership and other partners. Its principle puts the natural 
environment at the centre of land use management and development. 
This enables multifunctional land use of both public and private space 
and is supported by a physical network of green links for people and 
wildlife. In land use terms, the key elements of the Greengrid are: 
 Open space, such as parks and recreational grounds; 
 Biodiversity, including grasslands, reedbeds, hedgerow, and 
woodlands; and 
 Green Infrastructure, such as private gardens, street trees, road 
verges, green roofs, public Right of Way and greenways, 
cemeteries and churchyards and productive lands.  
 
4.31 It also closely interlinks with other policy areas such as social and 
cultural and supports the implementation of the Local Development 
Framework. Some of the benefits of the delivery of the Greengrid 
Strategy are:  
 environmental - protecting biodiversity integrity, water and air 
quality, and sustaining hydrological and geological functions; 
 economic - safeguarding property values, promoting business 
opportunities and increasing investment confidence;  
 social / community - creating safe, well-used, attractive spaces for 
people to gather, celebrate and express ideas for better community 
cohesion; 
 health and well-being - better access to play and recreational 
facilities for physical health and relaxation opportunities for mental 
well-being;  
 educational - awareness-raising, skills development and training 
opportunities; 
 cultural - protecting, managing and enhancing key cultural and 
heritage assets; and 
 climate change - adaptation and mitigation through renewal energy 
technologies, carbon reduction and natural systems attenuation. 
 
4.32 The Thames Chase Community Forest has been identified as an asset 
of regional significance for the retention, enhancement and provision of 
Green Infrastructure for its value as an area of landscape, ecological 
and recreational importance.  Natural England’s Green Infrastructure 
Guidance  (2009) confirms the value of Green Infrastructure and sets 
out how this can be promoted through development plans, which 
should link into Sustainable Communities Strategies, Local Area 
Agreements and partnership working. 
 
 
 
 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended) 
Chapter 4 – Spatial Policies                                                                 Adopted January 2015 
 
51 
 4.33 ‘Greening the Gateway’  published in 2004, set out the Government’s 
vision for the Thames Gateway as a world class model of sustainable 
development. It calls for the landscape to be regarded as ‘functional 
Green Infrastructure’ and suggests that the Thames Gateway should 
promote a high quality, functional green space network for use by local 
people.  The NPPF recognises the importance of green infrastructure, 
the principles of which are incorporated in the Green Grid.  The Council 
will plan positively for the creation, protection, conservation, 
enhancement and management of networks of biodiversity, heritage 
assets and green infrastructure as appropriate to their significance, and 
will identify opportunities to incorporate adaptation measures that will 
address risks associated with climate change.  The Parklands Projects 
are large-scale projects announced by Government in 2008 to deliver 
large areas of the South Essex Greengrid. Two of these projects are in 
Thurrock, including Wildspace, which is a project focused around the 
Rainham RSPB Reserve, Purfleet and the Thameside Nature Park, 
Mucking. The Council will actively participate in effective joint working 
arrangements with neighbouring local authorities in the case of those 
sites of importance that cross administrative boundaries.  In addition a 
substantial part of Thurrock lies within the Greater Thames Marshes 
Nature Improvement Area.  Nature Improvement Areas aim to achieve 
significant and demonstrable enhancements of the ecological network 
over large areas by such actions as increasing the size and number of, 
and connectively between, wildlife sites.  The proposals encompass 
consideration of the historic dimension of the landscape among the 
shared objectives for such areas and the Greengrid generally.  The 
Council will take account of any ecological network components and 
locations for priority action identified in project plans for the designated 
area.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
4.34 The Greengrid Strategy for Thurrock 2006-2011  is supported by the 
Thurrock Open Space Strategy 2006-2011 , the Thurrock Biodiversity 
Study 2006-2011  and the Green Infrastructure Plan for Thurrock 2006-
2011 . The Greengrid Strategy recognises that improved green access 
links between green assets is key to maximising the benefits derived 
from green assets for residents, workers and visitors to the Borough.  It 
also details the appropriate green assets to be delivered to address 
deficiencies and meet the needs of the growing population.  There is a 
need to enhance existing provision to ensure that it meets the 
standards set out in the Council’s Community Needs and Open Spaces 
Study (2005). 
 
4.35 The Council’s Community Needs and Open Spaces Study (2005)  
assesses open space including parks and gardens; amenity green 
spaces; children’s play space; outdoor sports facilities; and allotments 
and community gardens.  The report sets out current provision levels, 
and confirms the deficit throughout the Borough.  It identifies a need to 
enhance existing open space provision to ensure that it meets the 
standards for quality, quantity and accessibility as set out in the Open Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended) 
Chapter 4 – Spatial Policies                                                                 Adopted January 2015 
 
52 
 Spaces Strategy 2006-2011. Based on the best available evidence and 
understanding of community needs the Council will designate open 
spaces through the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan.  However the 
Council welcomes the opportunity afforded to local communities to 
designate additional Local Green Spaces through neighbourhood 
plans.  Should any such spaces be designated the Council will respect 
the wishes of the community that these areas be protected.   
 
CSSP5 – SUSTAINABLE GREENGRI D 
It is the policy of the Council and its Partners to: 
 
1. Deliver the Greengrid Strategy as part of the Thurrock Core Strategy 
Infrastructure Prioritisation and Implementation Plan and the Adopted 
Statutory Development Plan 
 
I. Ensure that all development proposals take account of the objectives of 
the Greengrid network and where appropriate contribute to the 
management and enhancement of the Greengrid. 
 
II. Deliver the area based Greengrid Improvement Zones to ensure that 
the location, planning, design and ongoing management of sites is 
appropriate, and that opportunities are sought to make best use of land 
and green infrastructure assets in delivering ecosystem services. 
 
III. Set out guidance for the delivery of Thurrock Greengrid in the Thurrock 
Greengrid Supplementary Planning Document. 
 
IV. Ensure the Thurrock Greengrid is delivered by Developer Contributions 
as necessary.  
 
V. Provide opportunities for skills development, education and public 
awareness-raising on the value and importance of the Greengrid. 
 
2. The Greengrid will be delivered at a spatial level through a series of 8 
Greengrid Improvement Zones. The Improvement Zones are listed 
below: 
i. Aveley and South Ockendon (Including Thames Chase) 
ii. Mardyke Valley 
iii. West Thurrock/Lakeside/Chafford 
iv. Purfleet 
v. North Grays & Chadwell St Mary 
vi. Grays Riverside/ Tilbury 
vii. East Thurrock / Rural Riverside 
viii. Stanford-le-hope/ Corringham/ Horndon/ Langdon Hills 
 
Across the borough, considerations will include:  
 Semi-natural green space 
 Multifunctional greenspace 
 Promotion and safeguarding of biodiversity and 
geodiversity 
 Urban and rural trees and woodlands Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

3. Develop and protect Local Scale Assets  
 
The Council will promote and protect Local-scale assets including any Local 
Green Spaces identified in local plans or neighbourhood plans that contribute 
to Thurrock’s sustainable Greengrid including:  
i. Doorstep sites, play areas, amenity open spaces and 
allotments, which are often local sites within urban areas and 
villages and the first link to the wider setting; 
ii. Local green links, which provide vital routes for people to 
access local sites and the wider Rights of Way and Safe 
Routes to School network; 
iii. Registered commons and villages and town greens; 
iv. Biodiversity interests and local nature reserves, such as 
Linford Wood and Grove House Wood; 
v. Local productive land, including local allotments, community 
gardens and commercial small-holdings involved in supplying 
local food or craft resources. 
 
Development within Local Green Spaces will not be permitted unless there 
are very special circumstances.  The Council envisages these circumstances 
will include where such development would support the functional value of 
such spaces without detracting from the visual qualities which the community 
may value.   
 
4.  In addition to the above actions, specifically support the objectives of the 
Greater Thames Marshes Nature Improvement Area by taking account of 
any core areas and buffer zones, corridors and stepping stones, restoration 
areas, and locations for priority action which may in due course be identified 
by the project plans of the Nature Improvement Area Partnership.  
 
5. Promote productive land and natural system opportunities 
 
The Council and Partners will promote productive land and natural systems 
opportunities (soils, bio and geo diversity), including: 
i. current allotments 
ii. agricultural/rural lands  
iii. the potential for biomass cropping in the northeast of Thurrock 
iv. potential co-firing using biomass fuels in the Tilbury area 
v. the potential use of the Thames Chase Community Forest 
area for sustainable management of wood fuel.

 CSTP1 - STRATEGIC HOUSING PROVISION  
 
Introduction  
 
5.1 A growing population and smaller household sizes are creating 
demand for new homes in Thurrock. Access to good quality housing is 
vital for the creation of sustainable, mixed communities and is key to 
the economic prospects of Thurrock, as the Borough’s ability to attract 
and retain its workforce will be determined in part by the quality and 
affordability of its housing stock. 
 
5.2 The Council seeks to maximise the use of redundant and underused 
land in the Borough by increasing potential residential capacity, whilst 
maintaining a commitment to delivering high quality and well designed 
housing and liveable and inclusive neighbourhoods.  
  
5.3 PPS3  places a statutory requirement upon local authorities to plan, 
monitor and manage the supply of housing land in their areas. A key 
aspect of this requirement is to set in place, through planning policy, 
the mechanism for identifying broad locations that will enable 
continuing delivery of housing for at least 15 years from the date of 
adoption. Thurrock is required by the East of England Plan (2008) to 
make provision for at least 18,500 new dwellings between 2001 and 
2021.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.4 The emerging Thurrock Housing Strategy is being developed to 
address all aspects of housing and housing need across all sectors, 
and will set out detailed delivery plans for each strand of the strategy 
covering the following policy areas (paragraphs 5.5 to 5.10):- 
 
5.5 Decent Homes and regeneration – an Estate/Neighbourhood approach 
to estate regeneration will be developed linked to the Council’s 
Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy and supported by the LDF policy. 
The Council will investigate all potential models for securing investment 
and regeneration including the potential for a local housing company. 
 
5.6 New Homes – the Council will encourage development to meet our 
patterns of housing need, and our ambitious targets for new supply, 
with an aim of making Thurrock a place where people choose to make 
their home and stay. 
 
5.7 Private rented sector – the Council will work to secure a thriving, well 
controlled, private rented  market, putting in place a Landlord

Housing Provision  
 
5.11 A proportion of this housing is already accounted for by recent housing 
completions and extant planning permissions. Thurrock has delivered 
4,950 new dwellings between 2001 and 2009 at an average rate of 587 
dwellings per year. In April 2009, there were 2,036 dwellings with 
outstanding planning permission. Thurrock is therefore required to 
make provision for a minimum of 13,550 new dwellings between 2009 
and 2021. The Thurrock Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment (2010)  (SHLAA) identifies an adequate supply of 
deliverable housing sites for the five-year period from 2011 to 2016 and 
the longer-term periods of 2011 – 2021 and 2011 – 2026. This has 
been rolled forward to apply to the Plan period up to 2026. A summary 
breakdown of the housing land supply position is set out in the table 
below, based on completions as at 31st March 2009 and a 5 year 
supply from April 1st 2010. This analysis is provided for information 
purposes only to illustrate the position at these base dates. Table 4 are  
figures based on RSS housing allocation, actual completion counts and 
site capacity assessments in the SHLAA, rounded as appropriate.

5.12 The Council is required to demonstrate a rolling 5-year supply of 
deliverable housing land. The latest position will be set out in the most 
recent Annual Monitoring Report  and the Housing Trajectory [See 
Appendix 3] that is refreshed on an annual basis. This monitoring 
process will track the progress of housing completions against the 
provisions of this policy and will make an annual reassessment in 
respect to the supply of deliverable and developable housing land.  
 
5.13 To assist the delivery of housing the Council has produced a SHLAA, 
which is not a one-off study but an integral part of the Annual 
Monitoring Report process that will enable the supply of land to be 
regularly reviewed and rolled forward. Through the Annual Monitoring 
Report, the Council will review existing sites with and without planning 
permission to judge whether there are any actions that can be taken to 
unlock sites and allow development to go ahead, such as, holding 
discussions with developers and landowners to identify barriers to 
delivery; use of the Council’s land acquisition powers; and investigating 
and progressing urban renewal projects.

Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 Housing Density Approach  
 
5.14 The Council seeks to maximise the use of redundant and underused 
land in the Borough and increase potential residential capacity whilst 
maintaining a commitment to delivering high quality and well designed 
housing and liveable and inclusive neighbourhoods. The Council 
considers it essential that the density of new residential development is 
an output of a design-led process that takes account of local context 
and distinctiveness, site constraints and public transport accessibility. 
The role of the policy seeks to enable high-density development in the 
areas of good accessibility and access to services and an enabling 
mechanism which supports the Council’s regeneration vision for some 
of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the Borough.   
 
5.15 The South Essex Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2008) 
(SHMA) provided a residential density assessment of the sub-region 
and concluded that a density of at least 60 dwellings per hectare would 
be appropriate in urban locations with high public transport accessibility 
and good access to services. The Council welcomes this approach and 
considers it entirely appropriate in Thurrock. In respect to suburban 
locations, a density range of 30 to 40 dwellings per hectare was 
suggested. It is considered that in the urban context of Thurrock a 
density range of 30 to 75 dwellings per hectare would be more 
appropriate in such locations. The Council will produce a Design and 
Sustainability SPD that will set out the design principles that will guide 
density levels in the Borough and provide a character assessment of 
each area to provide area specific density guidance.      
 
Housing Size and Type 
 
5.16 It is apparent from the national statistics and evidence sourced from 
the SHMA that there would be growth in most age groups over the next 
twenty years with the age group over 60 experiencing the greatest 
growth. The impact of this population growth is a projected 47% 
increase in single person households. This compares to a projected 
19% growth in all households. The SHMA expects a high proportion of 
the growth in single person households to result from more single 
persons aged 55 or over. The growth in this age group and the high 
proportion of single person households within it, gives rise to the need 
for provision of bungalows and specialist and extra care housing for 
older persons. 
 
5.17 The SHMA indicates that that there is not, however, a direct 
relationship between household size and housing size in the market 
sector. In particular it is noted that the size of dwellings relates more to 
age and wealth than it does to the sizes of households. As such, 
across Thames Gateway South Essex an estimated 75% of all homes 
were considered to be under-occupied in 2001. On this basis, the 
SHMA considered that it was inappropriate to provide specific dwelling 
size targets for market housing through the LDF and that the market 
housing sector in the sub-region was effective at matching the size of Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
63 
 dwellings to market demand at a local level. By contrast the SHMA sets 
out the range of affordable housing dwelling sizes required in the sub-
region. It was noted that across the sub-region there is a need for 
family accommodation. However, the situation in Thurrock is different 
from the sub-region in that the affordable housing demand is primarily 
for one and two-bed properties. 
 
Inclusive Residential Developments 
 
5.18 The national Lifetime Homes standard allows for new dwellings to be 
adapted as residents’ circumstances change over time, and increases 
flexibility in the housing stock. The Government is proposing that all 
housing meets the standard by 2013. Given the changing demographic 
structure in Thurrock, the SHMA recommends that the Lifetime Homes 
standard be implemented during the interim period to 2013.    
 
5.19 National statistics indicate that in Thurrock, 4% of the population are 
claiming a disability living allowance, which provides care and mobility 
assistance. Approximately 75% of those people that claim disability 
living allowance, which amounts to 3% of the total Thurrock population, 
have been doing so for over five years. The Council will therefore 
require residential development proposals to meet the highest 
standards of accessibility and inclusion with 3% of new residential 
dwellings built to full wheelchair standards as set out in the Housing 
Corporation’s ‘Wheelchair Housing Design Guide’ . The Design and 
Sustainability SPD will provide further guidance on inclusive design 
matters. 
 
CSTP1  - STRATEGIC HOUSING PR OVISION  
Thurrock is required to deliver a minimum of 18,500 dwellings between 2001 
and 2021.The Council will promote a mix of dwelling types, size and tenure, to 
meet the needs of Thurrock’s current and future population.  The Council will 
monitor and review housing land supply on a regular basis to ensure sufficient 
land is available to enable the following:- 
 
1. HOUSING GROWTH 2009 TO 2026  
i. For the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2021, an additional 13,550 
dwellings are required to meet this policy aim.  
 
ii. For the 5 year period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2026, the Council has 
made an indicative provision for 4750 dwellings.  
 
iii. The SHLAA and future reviews will identify deliverable sites for 5yrs 
and developable sites within  10yrs and 15yrs period that will underpin 
the AMR and Housing Trajectory. 
  
iv. Housing Sites will be allocated as part of the Site Specific Allocations 
and Policies Development Plan Document.  
 
v. The Council uses a Managed Delivery Approach to the calculation 
and maintenance of a  continuing deliverable 5-year housing land Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
64 
 supply. This approach is based on a ‘plan, monitor, manage’ regime 
using the key tools of the Annual Monitoring Report and the SHLAA 
to monitor and review the Housing Trajectory. Through  this process 
the Council will track the progress in housing delivery and the 
continuing maintenance of a deliverable 5-year housing land supply 
in accordance with the current PPS3 or its statutory successor. 
 
vi. The Council and partners will actively seek to increase the supply of 
deliverable housing sites where it appears that the five-year housing 
supply will not meet the required dwelling provision. 
 
2. HOUSING DENSITY APPROACH 
i. Proposals for residential development will be design-led and will seek 
to optimise the use of land in a manner that is compatible with the 
local context. The Council will strongly resist excessive density that 
would lead to a poor quality of life for existing and future occupants of 
the local area and would undermine the Council’s commitment of 
delivering sustainable neighbourhoods. 
 
ii. New residential development will be led by the design standards set 
out in the Layout and Standards SPD and the Core Strategy Policies.  
 
iii. Within the Borough’s Town Centres, Regenerations Areas, key 
flagship schemes and other areas with high public transport 
accessibility, the Council will, subject to other development plan 
policies, seek to secure a minimum density of at least 60 dwellings 
per hectare. Outside of these areas, a density range of between 30 
and 70 dwellings per hectare will generally be sought.  
 
3. DWELLING MIX 
i. The Council will require new residential developments to provide a 
range of dwelling types and sizes to reflect the Borough’s housing 
need, in accordance with the findings of the Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment , any relevant development briefs, the local context, 
amenity and car parking standards. 
 
4. LIFETIME HOMES AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING 
i. The Council will require all future development to meet the highest 
standards of accessibility and inclusion. All new dwellings will be 
required to meet the Lifetime Homes standard.  
 
ii. The Council will seek 3% of new dwellings on developments of 30 
dwellings or more will be built to full wheelchair standards. 
 
iii. The requirements for Lifetime Homes and Accessible Housing may 
be adjusted where the developer is able to prove that these 
requirements will be economically unviable, rendering the site 
undeliverable.

 CSTP2 - THE PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
 
Introduction 
 
5.20 The delivery of Affordable Housing to meet the current and future 
needs of Thurrock is an essential component of creating sustainable 
communities. The Council seeks to deliver a wide choice of high-quality 
homes to address the needs of local people and to create sustainable, 
inclusive and mixed communities.  
 
5.21 PPS3 sets out the definition of Affordable Housing and highlights the 
need for delivery of high quality housing for people who are unable to 
access or afford market housing. PPS3  also indicates that it is 
important that Development Plan Documents set out sufficient 
guidance on the Council’s approach to seeking developer 
contributions.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.22 The Thurrock Housing Strategy (2004), Thurrock Housing Need Survey 
(2004) and SHMA (2008) have established what the people of 
Thurrock need in terms of the type, affordability and tenure of 
dwellings. 
 
5.23 The SHMA (2008) provided an independent assessment of housing 
need across the South Essex sub-region. The SHMA indicated that 
across the South Essex sub-region, 54% of anticipated housing 
delivery levels should be affordable to meet the housing need. The 
SHMA recognised that this level is not deliverable and suggested that 
subject to specific viability testing by each local authority, a 35% 
affordable housing target across the sub-region would be an 
appropriate threshold. The SMHA recommended that subject to 
specific need identified by each local authority, a policy of an 80:20 
split of Affordable Housing between social rented and intermediate 
provision should be developed. However, to further sustainable 
communities within Thurrock a minimum split of 70:30 split of 
affordable housing between social rented and intermediate provision, 
should be the starting point for negotiation. 
 
5.24 The Council has commissioned an Economic Viability Assessment 
(EVA) that assesses the delivery of Affordable Housing in Thurrock. 
The EVA includes the analysis of a representative sample of housing 
site typologies using the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) 
approved model. The outcome of this study confirms that in broad 
terms green-field sites are capable of delivering Affordable Housing at 
a 35% level in most market conditions and within the range of 
assumptions input into the model. Brownfield (Previously Developed 
Land PDL) sites are necessarily more challenging but the Council’s 
and Development Corporation’s  track record since 2001 shows that 
Affordable Housing can be delivered on these sites when the market 
conditions allow and the necessary support and intervention is Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 provided.  Therefore, where appropriate the Council will assess 
deliverability issues when considering particular residential 
development proposals in the light of all relevant economic and market 
factors operative at the time. This approach will apply in relation to 
particular brownfield sites which have substantive constraints and 
barriers to development. The Council will be ready to negotiate with 
developers on such identified sites on the basis of an open-book 
economic viability assessment for the particular site in question. The 
Development Corporation is frequently directly instrumental in bringing 
forward the largest brownfield sites, assembling various land-holdings 
and establishing partnerships with developers e.g. Purfleet PRIDe. 
 
CSTP2 – THE PROVISION OF AFF ORDABLE HOUSING  
 
1. In order to address the current and future need for Affordable Housing in 
Thurrock, the Council will seek the minimum provision of 35% of the total 
number of residential units built to be provided as Affordable Housing.  
The Council’s policy is that provision should be maintained in perpetuity as 
Affordable Housing as far as legally possible.  
 
2. The Council will seek Affordable Housing to meet local needs on qualifying 
sites subject  to: 
i. its suitability for on-site provision; 
ii. the economics of providing affordable housing; 
iii. the extent to which the provision of affordable housing would 
prejudice other planning objectives to be met from the development 
of the site; and 
iv. the mix of units necessary to meet local needs and achieve a 
successful sustainable socially inclusive development. 
 
3. The Council recognises that the majority of Thurrock’s identified housing 
land supply is on Previously Developed Land often subject to a variety of 
physical constraints. The capacity of a site to deliver a level of Affordable 
Housing that can be supported financially will be determined by individual 
site ‘open book’ economic viability analysis where deemed appropriate. 
This analysis will take into consideration existing use values, as well as 
other site-specific factors. 
 
4. In some areas of Thurrock, the local need for Affordable Housing may be 
less than 35%. In this case the Council will require a financial contribution 
to off-site Affordable Housing provision at the equivalent rate to meet 
priority needs elsewhere within Thurrock.       
 
5. In order to meet the overall target, the Council will seek to achieve, where 
viable, 35% Affordable Housing on all new housing developments capable 
of accommodating 10 or more dwellings or sites of 0.5 ha or more 
irrespective of the number of dwellings. Sites below threshold will make an 
equivalent financial contribution towards off-site provision. 
 
6. The Affordable Housing provision should seek to achieve a target of 70% 
social rented accommodation with the balance being provided as Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
68 
 intermediate housing. In determining the amount and mix of Affordable 
Housing to be delivered, specific site conditions and other material 
considerations including viability, redevelopment of previously developed 
land or mitigation of contamination will be taken into account. 
 
7. Where appropriate for specific sites, criteria setting out variations in the 
form the contribution should take (including tenure mix) will be provided in 
the Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD.  
 
8. The following Affordable Housing dwelling size mix will generally be  sought 
where affordable housing is provided: 
 
Dwelling size: No. 
bedrooms 1-Bed 2-Bed 3-Bed 4-Bed 
Affordable Housing 
Provision 40% 35% 15% 10% 
 
Where this affordable mix is not considered appropriate developers will be 
required to justify to the satisfaction of the Council a more appropriate 
affordable dwelling mix.   
 
9. The above proportions relating to social rented housing, intermediate 
housing and dwelling size may be varied where justified and with 
agreement with the Council; the Council will take account of the latest 
available evidence from the SHMA (or its equivalent successor). 
 
10. The Council will require developments to integrate Affordable Housing and 
market housing, with a consistent standard of quality design and public 
spaces, to create mixed and sustainable communities.

 CSTP3 - GYPSIES AND TRAVELLERS  
 
Introduction 
 
5.25 Gypsies and Travellers comprise a number of diverse groups that have 
different origins, traditions and ways of travelling. In Thurrock there are 
currently 3 Council owned Gypsy and Traveller sites and several 
authorised private Gypsy sites. The number of unauthorised caravans 
(including tolerated) on various sites in 2008 was equivalent to 18 
pitches. The policy seeks to maintain Gypsies’ and Travellers’ way of 
life and seeks to improve their quality of life and access to services. 
 
National and Regional Policy Context 
 
5.26 Policy H3 of the East of England Plan: Provision for Gypsies and 
Travellers requires an additional 44 pitches to be provided in Thurrock 
between 2006 and 2011. Policy H3  states that beyond 2011, provision 
should be made for an annual 3% compound increase in residential 
pitches across the region, giving Thurrock a total of 87 additional 
pitches by 2021. 
 
5.27 The Council considers the provision of sites for Gypsies and Travellers 
within Thurrock to be sufficient for its needs for the foreseeable future 
and continues to seek a more fair and equitable distribution of Gypsy 
pitch provision in the East of England.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.28 Thurrock is home to a significant number of Gypsy and Traveller 
populations. In order to understand their needs and characteristics, the 
Council commissioned Fordham Research (2006) to conduct a Gypsy 
and Traveller Accommodation Assessment  (GTAA). It was found in the 
assessment that that there is a need for additional pitch provision, 
however the large populations in the Borough are disproportionate 
compared to the wider Essex area. As such, Fordham Research 
recommended a joint approach with the East of England Regional 
Assembly and neighbouring authorities to increase provision in a more 
appropriate manner across Essex.  
 
5.29 The GTAA reported that Gypsies and Travellers experience barriers to 
key services such as education and health. The GTAA recommended 
that the Council form a coherent policy that seeks to improve the health 
and education status of Gypsies and Travellers and their access to 
services. Evidence from the GTAA has demonstrated that Gypsies and 
Travellers have a preference to live on small-scale sites, principally to 
ensure that family bonds are retained. This requirement is recognised 
in Policy CSTP3 in terms of how the Council will assess individual 
applications for additional pitch provision from future Gypsy and 
Traveller site proposals.

 CSTP3 - GYPS IES AND TRAVELLERS  
 
1. The Council will support proposals that seek to ensure that the standard of 
the existing approved Gypsy and Traveller sites in the Borough is 
progressively improved and upgraded.  
 
2. The Council will seek to make provision for a total of 87 additional pitches 
(see i to iii below) in accordance with RSS Policy H3, for the period 2006-
2021, subject to credible evidence of actual need for any further pitch 
provision demonstrated over the period to 2021 through the GTAA review. 
 
i. The Council will review the existing unauthorised “tolerated” Gypsy 
and Traveller sites through the Site Specific Allocations DPD and 
where appropriate regularise their status at existing pitch levels or 
with appropriate extensions to the site, if satisfied that they meet the 
provisions of this policy and if required at the time.  
 
ii. The Council will provide an additional five pitches at the Pilgrims 
Lane site.  
 
iii. Subsequently the Council will make additional pitch allocations 
through extensions of the other existing sites, authorised and 
regulated, and through allocation of new sites if proven to be 
necessary and appropriate.  
 
3. The Council will refresh its own GTAA to assess the evidence of actual 
need over the Plan period from 2021 to 2026/7 and shall identify further 
pitch provision to meet any such need through the Site Specific 
Allocations and Policies DPD or a revision thereto.   
 
4. The Council will continue to engage with local gypsies and travellers 
through the work of the dedicated Gypsy liaison and planning officers. 
 
5. In relation to the identified need beyond 2021, the Council will continue to 
work with our partners in the region to develop a fair and equitable 
distribution of provision. 
 
6. Proposals for new or extensions to existing Gypsy and Traveller Sites will 
be considered by reference to the following criteria: 
 
(i) The Council is satisfied that there is a clearly established need for 
the site and the number of pitches involved cannot be met by an 
existing site;  
(ii) The site is accessible by foot, cycle and/or public transport to local 
services and facilities, such as shops, primary and secondary 
schools, healthcare and other community facilities;  
(iii) The site proposal will not unacceptably impact upon the safety and 
amenity of the occupants and neighbouring uses; 
(iv) The site proposal will not unacceptably harm the character and 
appearance of the area and will not result in an unacceptable visual 
impact;  Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

71 
 (v) The proposed accommodation on the site or site extension will not 
normally comprise more than 5 individual pitches. This threshold 
may be exceeded where the site location and topography allows 
always subject to the availability of credible evidence of actual 
need; 
(vi) The site will have safe and convenient access to the road network 
and would not cause a significant hazard to other road users; 
(vii) The site will make provision for parking, turning, service and 
emergency vehicles;  
(viii) The site will be supplied with essential services such as water, 
power, sewerage and drainage, and waste disposal; 
(ix) Proposals incorporate a landscape strategy where appropriate; 
(x) The vulnerability of the proposed site to flood risk.

 CSTP4 - TRAVELLING SHOWPEOPLE 
 
Introduction 
 
5.30 Thurrock is home to a large Travelling Showpeople population, which is 
concentrated on just a small number of large sites that incorporate both 
authorised and unauthorised elements. In Thurrock there are currently 
64 authorised Travelling Showpeople plots and 62 plots with temporary 
permission. This policy aims to set out robust locational principles for 
new sites and the means by which the Council will develop jointly with 
adjoining Local Authorities the future strategic pitch provision for 
Travelling Showpeople. The policy seeks to ensure that the Travelling 
Showpeople population enjoys a good quality of life, appropriate living 
conditions and opportunities to operate their businesses effectively. 
 
National and Regional Policy Context 
 
5.31 Travelling Showpeople are defined  by Circular 04/2007 as “Members of 
a community that consists of self-employed business people who travel 
the country, often with their families, holding fairs”. The Circular states 
that although their work is of a mobile nature, Travelling Showpeople 
require secure, permanent bases for the storage of their equipment 
and residential purposes.  
 
5.32 Policy H4 of the East of England Plan RSS Gypsy and Traveller 
Review July 2009 requires local authorities to make provision for plots 
to meet the identified needs of Travelling Showpeople in the area and 
where development plans look beyond 2011, they should provide for 
an annual 1.5% compound increase in plots. It also states that local 
authorities should work in County groupings with local Travelling 
Showpeople and the Showmen's Guild to identify the sites required in 
meeting the need.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.33 The plan area is home to a significant Travelling Showpeople 
population. The Thurrock Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showperson 
Accommodation Assessment (2007) notes that there is an 
overcrowding issue amongst the Travelling Showpeople population at 
Buckles Lane.  
 
5.34 Travelling Showpeople’s Sites – A Planning Focus (2007) was 
published by the  Showmen's Guild of Great Britain. This document sets 
out the site requirements for Travelling Showpeople sites and suggests 
a site criteria in which to assess planning applications. This document 
describes Travelling Showpeople’s Sites  as being generally 
characterised as mixed-use in land use terms with a combination of 
residential, commercial and storage areas within one site.

 CSTP5 – NEIGHBOURHOOD RENEWAL  
 
Introduction  
 
5.35 The Council, working with its LSP partners to ensure that Thurrock will 
be the location of choice - a place where people thrive and prosper; 
have access to high quality services; and where development is 
sustainable and supports Thurrock’s new and existing communities as 
they grow. While many of Thurrock’s neighbourhoods already provide 
attractive living environments with good access to local facilities, there 
are several neighbourhoods that suffer from high levels of deprivation. 
To reduce this inequality it is necessary that a number of the Borough’s 
neighbourhoods are renewed, regenerated and integrated within the 
wider urban fabric to meet the needs of the existing and future 
residents.  
 
5.36 The policy seeks to provide a framework for regeneration initiatives 
across the most disadvantaged communities in Thurrock. The focus is 
not just on improving housing and the physical fabric of 
neighbourhoods, but also addressing the fundamental problems in 
relation to access to health, education, local services and job 
opportunities.  
 
5.37 The NPPF sets out the framework for delivering sustainable 
communities. In support of the regeneration approach the DCLG 
recently published Transforming places; changing lives: taking forward 
the regeneration framework (2009). This document sets out the 
Government’s approach to taking forward regeneration initiatives. It is 
stated that regeneration can help remove the barriers, that hold back 
local areas and provide an important catalyst for reversing decline and 
improving prosperity and can help retain existing businesses whilst 
also attracting new inward investment and enterprise. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.38 The Neighbourhood Renewal Working Group (NRWG) is leading on 
the preparation and implementation of the Thurrock Neighbourhood 
Renewal Strategy. This strategy has been developed within the 
strategic framework provided by the Borough’s Sustainable Community 
Strategy and supports delivery of the overarching vision for Thurrock. 
The Thurrock Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy has established the 
priority areas in the Borough for renewal based profiling information 
primarily derived from the Office of National Statistics’ Indices of 
Deprivation  (2007). It is evident from this information that deep pockets 
of deprivation are experienced in some wards. The Indices of 
Deprivation  show that 24% of Borough’s identified communities are 
within the 25% most deprived communities in England with five of 
these communities being within the 10% most deprived areas. The 
highest levels of deprivation in the Borough can be found in parts of 
Tilbury, Grays Riverside, Belhus and Purfleet.  
 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
76 
 5.39 The NRWG is developing a strategic and cross cutting approach to 
neighbourhood renewal that seeks to ensure that no one in the 
Borough is disadvantaged by where they live. This will be achieved by 
improving the quality of life in the most disadvantaged areas of 
Thurrock by tackling poor job prospects; high crime levels; educational 
under-achievement; poor health; problems with housing; the local 
environment; and access to services. The strategy will target two levels 
of activity – ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’. The ‘top down’ approach will be 
led by ‘strategic intervention projects’ identified in the Thurrock 
Economic Development Strategy whilst the ‘bottom up’ approach will 
seek to engage the local communities and empower them to resolve 
the issues that adversely affect their lives on a daily basis.  
 
5.40 Thames Gateway Development Corporation: Corporate Plan 2008 – 
2011 (2008) identifies the need to reduce the high levels of deprivation 
in Thurrock.  Of particular concern are the low levels of employment, 
income and qualifications in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods, 
together with a lack of community facilities and infrastructure, high 
levels of child poverty, poor health and a low life expectancy. The 
TTGDC has identified a number of specific areas where direct 
neighbourhood renewal initiatives are required. These initiatives will be 
recognised and incorporated within the action plans prepared for each 
of the four priority areas.  
 
5.41 At Purfleet, the TTGDC is working in partnership with the Council to 
secure the long-term regeneration of the Garrison Estate. The 
regeneration of the estate will enable the TTGDC to improve the 
integration of Purfleet’s existing communities with the wider 
redevelopment and regeneration proposals in the surrounding Purfleet 
area. The TTGDC’s Corporate Plan  also noted the acute problems 
facing Tilbury and in particular the level of social deprivation and 
exclusion in the town. It is the TTGDC’s, and Shaping Thurrock 
partners’ view that comprehensive regeneration initiatives are required 
to remodel the existing settlement at Tilbury. 
 
5.42 The TTGDC has produced a number of Masterplans that include 
several of the regeneration areas indicated in the policy. These 
Masterplans will guide development in the respective areas and direct 
and set out the principles for regeneration.

CSTP5 – NEIGHBOURHOOD RENEWA L  
1. The Council and Partners  seeks to ensure that no one in the Borough 
should be disadvantaged by where they live, particularly in relation to 
health, education, local services, job opportunities and good housing. The 
Council will work with all relevant agencies in the delivery of regeneration 
in the Borough to achieve sustainable, mixed and balanced communities. 
The following neighbourhoods been have identified as priority regeneration 
areas by the Thurrock Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy: 
 
 Purfleet; 
 Grays Riverside and Grays Central; 
 Tilbury and Chadwell St. Mary; 
 South Ockendon (including Belhus). 
 
2. All developments in the regeneration areas will be required to support and 
assist: 
 
i. The creation of a more balanced housing stock through the 
development of high quality new dwellings that offer a better choice of 
housing types and tenures based on specific needs of the area. 
ii. The retention and improvement of social and private sector housing 
to meet decent homes standards and resident aspirations. 
iii. The improvement of the external environment through the provision 
of: 
 
(i) Community facilities and infrastructure including health and 
education facilities.   
(ii) Public open space and recreation facilities and enhancement 
of existing open spaces to create a green corridor network 
integrated throughout the area. 
 
iv. The enhancement of the area’s economic viability by promoting the 
creation of business space for new start-up and local businesses.  
v. The promotion of high quality architecture, public realm and 
environmental design throughout the development.  
vi. High standards of sustainable construction and design, energy and 
water efficiency and flood risk management that contribute to meeting 
the climate change challenges locally. 
vii. The development of capacity within communities to create cohesive, 
engaged and empowered communities. 
viii. The Borough-wide approach to neighbourhood management.

 CSTP6 – STRATEGIC EMPLOYMENT PROVISION 
 
Introduction 
 
5.43 A sound economic future is essential to securing Thurrock’s future. The 
Council will seek to encourage and develop a thriving economy, where 
there is sufficient land and floor-space to accommodate projected 
employment growth in the core and growth sectors and to facilitate the 
continuing and emerging needs of business. The policy focus will 
contribute to three broad outcomes – supporting employment growth; 
creating the conditions required for sustainable growth; and ensuring 
direct benefits to local communities. 
 
5.44 The Annual Business Inquiry indicates that the level of employment in 
Thurrock has increased from 53,400 in 2001 to 57,000 in 2007, an 
increase of 3,600 jobs. This represents a slowdown in employment 
growth compared to the period 1995 to 2001 where approximately 
9,000 new jobs were created in the Borough. The most significant 
change in employment over the last fifteen years has been the rapid 
growth in services. The growth of service employment has occurred 
nationally, however within Thurrock this growth has been more 
pronounced through the retail expansion of Lakeside since the 1990s. 
The largest absolute increase in numbers was in wholesale and retail 
trade sector, which increased from 9,923 jobs in 1993 to 17,759 jobs in 
2003. Hotels and restaurants, education and health also enjoyed large 
increases of around 40-50% between 1991-2001. In contrast, financial 
and business services, and personal services, had risen by a much 
lower rate and extractive, energy and manufacturing employment had 
fallen.  
 
5.45 Given Thurrock’s strategic location, logistics and distribution remains 
the Borough’s major employer, however national data suggests that 
employment in this sector peaked in 2000 with as many as 15,600 
jobs, but declined to 12,400 jobs by 2004. Within the South Essex 
context, Thurrock is one of the three main employment hubs, alongside 
Basildon and Southend-on-Sea. Thurrock’s economic role within South 
Essex is as a logistics and distribution hub with 22% of employment in 
the Borough in 2001, generated from this sector. By comparison, the 
manufacturing and service sectors are under represented in Thurrock 
when compared to Basildon and Southend-on-Sea. The statistical 
effects of the 2008-2009 recession on levels of employment across 
sectors in Thurrock, have not yet been fully collated and published in 
the Annual Business Inquiry.  The ONS Annual Population Survey 
indicates, however, that unemployment in Thurrock rose steeply during 
this period, reaching 8% in 2009, or double the rate of 2004. 
 
5.46 An important component of the strategic employment provision is the 
development of a culture and leisure sector. As Thurrock’s economy 
diversifies and its communities regenerate, grow and become more 
prosperous, there will be increasing demand for cultural and leisure 
activities. The Council seeks to facilitate the development of this sector Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
80 
 to meet the future demands and encourage health and well-being 
amongst the existing and future communities of Thurrock. It is 
expected that this sector will emerge as a significant employer of 
Thurrock’s population over the forthcoming years.  
 
5.47 This policy aims to support employment growth, create the conditions 
required for sustainable growth in the core and growth sectors and 
ensure the local communities receive direct benefits. A co-ordinated 
and consistent approach has been developed to create opportunities 
for up to 26,000 additional jobs throughout Thurrock over the Plan 
period and beyond. This policy will set out the indicative land supply to 
complement the broad locations set out in Policy CSSP2. The 
Council’s approach to sustainable economic development includes: 
 Achieving increased prosperity and employment growth; 
 A sustainable balance between housing and jobs growth across the 
Borough; 
 Supporting indigenous business; 
 Attracting inward investment; 
 Diversifying the economy; 
 Providing improved skills and jobs for local people; and 
 Providing for land and sites of appropriate type and location. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.48 The Thurrock Employment Study (2005)  indicates that there are three 
basic elements to the potential employment growth. First there is trend-
based growth, which is projected to provide circa 6,800 jobs. Secondly 
there is London Gateway, with a potential to provide at least 10,000 net 
direct and indirect jobs by 2026, subject to delivery timescales. Thirdly 
the recently Adopted RSS Lakeside policy sets out the future potential 
employment that could be generated at Lakeside that could be in 
excess of 6000 new jobs subject to a final determination of retail, 
commercial and leisure floor-space thresholds.  Finally, there are the 
possible impacts of additional inward investment, particularly through 
the efforts of the TTGDC, which could generate at least 1,300 jobs. 
The Thurrock Employment Study indicates that the East of England 
Plan 26,000 job target for Thurrock will be very challenging to deliver 
by 2026 and that there is a strong reliance upon the delivery of the 
London Gateway Port at Shell Haven. Given the recent delays to the 
London Gateway scheme, the Lakeside Basin now stands centre stage 
as the most likely Key Strategic Economic Hub to produce significant 
numbers of jobs in the short and medium term. 
 
5.49 The Employment Land Review (2007)  noted that the 26,000 job 
requirement for Thurrock relates to total employment across the 
different sectors in the Borough and it does not relate specifically to 
employment land. As such an assessment of the Borough’s 
employment land was undertaken to demonstrate the actual industries 
that are located on the employment land. The analysis demonstrated 
that employment growth on employment land, as a percentage of 
overall employment growth in Thurrock would account for 44% or Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
81 
 11,440 jobs. The proportion of new jobs on employment land may 
continue to decline in Thurrock with the introduction of flexible working 
practices. 
 
5.50 To meet the job growth requirements, the analysis from the Thurrock 
Employment Land Review has identified a need for between 45.2 and 
83.8 hectares of employment land outside of the London Gateway over 
the Plan period and beyond in order to accommodate employment 
growth in B class uses. The Thurrock Employment Land Review 
identifies a total need for re-designation of between 69.8 to 88.6 
hectares of designated employment land to other uses in the 
forthcoming plan period. It is stated that part of this figure will include 
an approximate displacement of between 10-15 hectares of 
employment uses to the London Gateway.  
 
5.51 Further technical studies have been prepared including the 
Employment Sites Review (2010) that assesses job densities of sites 
proposed and intensification of existing sites.  This assessment 
included an initial appraisal of sites identified in the Lakeside Single 
Issue Review.  A revised Employment Land Review (2010) has also 
identified the sustainability of existing and proposed sites for 
employment. 
 
5.52 The updated technical studies (2010) have identified that up to 5345 
jobs have been delivered from net additional employment land between 
2001 and 2009.  The net additional employment land provision 
identified including mixed-use, leisure and retail could accommodate 
almost 28,000 jobs and therefore provides sufficient capacity for the 
26,000 jobs growth the Council wishes to promote in the Borough 
during the lifetime of the plan.  The calculation takes into account the 
proposed loss of some employment land to other uses, notably 
housing.  The Employment Studies have also identified that 1000 jobs 
could be provided from small scale public services and home working.  
The Local Development Documents for Lakeside may identify 
additional jobs through further intensification of sites.  The total number 
of jobs identified exceeds the RSS requirement. 
 
5.53 The Council designates Industrial and Commercial land in the Borough 
as either Primary or Secondary employment land.  Primary 
employment land has good access to the strategic/principal road 
network. Secondary employment land is an important source of local 
jobs, but is not ideally located in relation to the highway network or 
neighbouring housing areas.  Activities on Secondary employment 
land, or traffic generated by them, can cause significant environmental 
problems for local residents. Exceptionally, housing development may 
be considered acceptable on Secondary employment sites if this 
enables a particular environmental or traffic problem to be overcome.  
These sites will be defined in the Site Specific Allocations and Policies 
DPD.

82 
 CSTP6 – STRATEGIC EMPLOYMENT PROVISION  
1. Key Strategic Economic Hubs  
 
I. The Council will actively seek to maintain high and stable levels of 
economic and employment growth by creating a network of high quality, 
mutually reinforcing Key Strategic Economic Hubs, identified in Policy 
CSSP2. The Key Strategic Economic Hubs will provide 445 hectares  of 
the Industrial and Commercial and Mixed-Use Land between 2009 and 
2026.  This provision is included in 2 and 3 below. 
 
2. Primary and Secondary Industrial and Commercial Areas  
 
I. The Council will safeguard existing Primary and Secondary Industrial 
and Commercial land and premises in, or last used for employment 
purposes, where it is required to maintain a sufficient supply of 
employment land in the Plan period.  The Site Specific Allocations and 
Policies DPD will include policies and identify existing Industrial and 
Commercial land that will be protected for employment purposes, as well 
as existing employment land to be allocated to other uses.  These areas 
and sites will be shown on the Proposals Map.    
 
II. The proposed new Primary and Secondary Industrial and Commercial 
sites (identified in the Site Allocations and Policies DPD and Proposals 
Map) will provide approximately 372 hectares of net employment land 
across the Borough between 2009 and 2026. 
 
III. The Primary and Secondary Industrial and Commercial areas will be 
reserved for employment generating uses falling within Class B1, B2, 
and B8 and sui generis uses. The Council will consider economic 
development that includes non-B Class uses within the Primary and 
Secondary Industrial and Commercial areas provided that it meets the 
following:  
 
(i) The non-B Class Use provides a complementary and supporting 
use for the existing Class B uses; or 
(ii) The non-B Class Use is necessary for the day-to-day service 
requirements of the existing Class B uses; or 
(iii) There is a demonstrable need for the non-B Class Use within the 
Borough and there are no other reasonable alternative sites 
within the Borough;  and 
(iv) The introduction of the non-B Class Use will not compromise the 
supply of Class B land within the Borough and will not adversely 
affect Thurrock’s existing and future economic structure; 
 
IV. Non-B Class uses will not be supported within the Primary and 
Secondary Industrial and Commercial areas where they materially 
change the Class B character of the Primary and Secondary Industrial 
and Commercial areas.   
 
V. Where proposals for new economic development are proposed outside 
the Primary and Secondary Industrial and Commercial areas, the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
83 
 Council will make an assessment against the following criteria: 
 
(i) Compatibility with uses in the area surrounding the proposal and 
potential impacts on those uses.  
(ii) Capacity and impact on the road network and access by 
sustainable modes of transport. 
 
3. Mixed-Use Employment Locations 
 
The Council will encourage development that maximises the 
employment contribution from mixed-use development sites.  In total, 
the Council has designated 75.4 hectares of land throughout the 
Borough for mixed-use development between 2009 and 2026. The 
mixed-use development sites will be included in the Site Specific 
Allocations and Policies DPD and identified on the Proposals Map. 
 
4. Redundant and Under-Used Employment Land and Buildings 
 
In addition to those employment sites allocated to other uses through the 
Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD, the Council will accept the 
redevelopment of genuinely redundant or underused employment land and 
buildings to non-employment uses provided that it can be demonstrated, to 
the satisfaction of the Council that:   
(i) Employment uses are no longer feasible on site;  
(ii) There are sufficient alternative sites/provision to meet existing 
and future employment needs as identified in this Plan and any 
future review. 
(iii) The new uses are compatible with neighbouring uses and will not 
harm the viability of the surrounding employment area; 
(iv) The proposals are compliant with other development plan 
policies. 
 
5. Relocation and Expansion of Existing Businesses   
 
The Council will positively encourage the relocation (within Thurrock) of 
existing firms wishing to expand and major non-conforming installations 
where this will improve their economic and environmental sustainability, 
improve the local environment for local residents and enhance the 
sustainable development potential of adjoining sites. The Council will 
promote the regeneration and renewal of these sites and their 
surroundings for housing and mixed-use development. 
 
6. Office Development  
 
The Council will seek to direct office development to the town centres 
identified on the Key Diagram and the Key Strategic Economic Hubs.  The 
Council will review locations for office development as part of the 
Development Plan Documents on Lakeside.  Office development will 
generally be supported in the Primary and Secondary Industrial and 
Commercial areas provided that it is accessible by sustainable modes of 
transport and that it does not: Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

84 
  
(i) Impact upon the viability and amenity of surrounding uses. 
(ii) Unacceptably impact upon the road capacity and network.   
 
7. Knowledge and Cultural Based Regeneration 
 
I. The Council will work with partners to enhance local employment 
opportunities within the Regeneration Areas.  
 
II. Knowledge based, cultural, retail, leisure and office developments will be 
directed to existing centres and the Regeneration Areas to promote their 
vitality and viability. These sectors will act as drivers for sustainable 
economic growth. The priority centres for the promotion of these sectors 
are: 
 Purfleet; 
 Lakeside / West Thurrock Basin;  
 Grays; and  
 Tilbury.  
 
8. Environmental Industries  
 
The Council will seek to encourage and direct the development of 
environmental industries to the Key Strategic Economic Hubs. The Council 
will work with partners to bring forward the delivery of priority 
environmental industry projects at the preferred following locations:  
 
 Tilbury

 CSTP7 - NETWORK OF CENTRES 
 
Introduction 
 
5.54 Thurrock’s network of centres is an important factor underpinning 
sustainable growth.  The transformation of Lakeside into a new 
regional (town) centre and the enhancement of existing centres are 
vital for sustainable development ensuring the provision of local 
accessible services and employment opportunities for the Borough’s 
residents. 
 
Lakeside Single Issue Review 
 
5.55 The East of England Plan (May 2008) called for a Single Issue Review 
of Policy ETG2 Thurrock Key Centre for Development and Change, 
with the purpose of preparing a robust strategic planning framework to 
guide the regeneration and redevelopment of the Lakeside Basin. 
 
5.56 The Single Issue Review of Policy ETG2 commenced in autumn 2008.  
In October 2009, the Secretary of State published Proposed 
Modifications to Policy ETG2 and identifies the northern part of the 
Lakeside Basin as a regional centre under Policy E5 of the East of 
England Plan.  Retail expansion is limited to 50,000 sqm of net 
comparison floorspace by 2019 and no expansion can be approved 
until Local Development Documents satisfy a series of pre-conditions 
set out in the policy. 
 
Thurrock Strategies and Plans 
 
5.57 Evidence on retail and town centre uses is within the Thurrock Retail 
Study (September 2007) and the Lakeside Basin Single Issue Review 
Agreed Final Report (March 2009).   In combination, these documents 
provide robust evidence on the need and location for additional retail 
and town centre floorspace within the Borough. 
 
5.58 It is expected that Thurrock Thames Gateway Development 
Corporation (TTGDC) will jointly inform the development and 
management of Thurrock’s network of centres through its masterplans 
and other strategies.  
 
5.59 Within Grays town centre and existing local and neighbourhood 
centres, good access to day to-day facilities and services is necessary 
to ensure that the local community is in close proximity to those 
services used regularly.  Day-to-day facilities and services include: 
primary schools, health centres, convenience shops, branch libraries 
and local offices and service providers.  
 
5.60 Policy ETG2 of the East of England Plan provides detailed guidance 
regarding the pre-conditions for Lakeside to attain regional centre 
status.  The Council remains supportive of these pre-conditions and 
they will be addressed in the Local Development Documents. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

CSTP7 – NETWORK OF CENTRES  
1. New Lakeside Regional Centre: Consistent with em erging Policy 
ETG2, the Council supports the transformation of the northern part of 
the Lakeside Basin into a new regional centre.  This will be achieved 
in policy through a detailed chapter and inset plan within the Site 
Specific Allocations and Policies DPD and the Lakeside 
Implementation and Delivery SPD.  The Site Specific Allocations and 
Policies DPD will also include the Regional Town Centre boundary 
which will be identified on the Proposals Map.  Expansion at the new 
Lakeside regional centre will include the following:  
 
(i) Up to 50,000 sqm of net comparison floorspace (by 2019); 
(ii) At least 4,000 sqm of net convenience floorspace; 
(iii) Up to 3,000 new dwellings; subject to review and the Site 
Specific Allocations and Policies DPD. 
(iv) Employment and other services floorspace to broaden the 
employment base; 
(v) Commercial leisure floorspace, including food and drink uses, 
consistent with the function of a regional centre. 
 
2. Grays Town Centre: the Council supports the regeneration of Grays 
town centre. It will become the focus for cultural, administrative and 
educational functions, whilst providing retail development that is 
complementary to the Lakeside Basin.  Development should be of an 
appropriate scale and should be well integrated with the existing 
centre.    Development in Grays town centre will include the following: 
 
(i) Up to 5,500-6,500 sqm of net comparison floorspace by 2026; 
(ii) Up to 4,000-5,000 sqm of net bulky durable floorspace by 
2026; 
(iii) Between 1,500-2,000 sqm of net convenience floorspace by 
2026; 
(iv) Other cultural, administrative and education developments 
consistent with the spatial vision for Grays. 
 
3. Existing Local Centres: Corringham, Stanford-le-Hope, South 
Ockendon, Tilbury, Aveley, Socketts Heath are designated as local 
centres.  The Council encourages the following development for local 
centres: 
 
(i) Renewal, upgrading or remodelling of existing floorspace; 
(ii) Additional small scale retail floorspace space in suitable 
locations that will strengthen the centres’ retail offer; 
(iii) Investigation into the potential of a new supermarket on an 
appropriate site in Stanford-le-Hope to reduce convenience 
expenditure leakage from the east of the Borough. 
 
4. New Centres: A new local centre is designated at Purfleet.  Two new 
neighbourhood centres are designated at West Thurrock and South 
Stifford and will be developed in conjunction with major residential Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 development.  The Council encourages the following development for 
these new local centres:   
 
(i) In Purfleet, a new food store of between 1,500-2,000 sqm (net) 
convenience retail floorspace and complementary floorspace; 
(ii) In all new local centres, an appropriate mix of day to day 
services will be provided to accommodate the needs of the 
residential development.  
 
5. Existing Neighbourhood Centres : Larger neighbourhood parades  
are identified at Chadwell St Mary, Stifford Clays, East Tilbury, 
Corringham, Grays, Little Thurrock, Chafford Hundred, Tilbury.  
Smaller neighbourhood parades  are identified at South Ockendon, 
Aveley, Grays, Tilbury, Linford, Stanford-le-Hope, Corringham, 
Purfleet.  The Council encourages the following for neighbourhood 
centres: 
 
(i) Maintain existing retail function, with changes of use to ground-
floor retail units to non-retail use permitted where it can be 
shown there is no long-term demand for retail use of the unit or 
where there is a particular community need that would be met 
by the change of use.

 CSTP8 – VITALITY AND VIABILITY OF EXISTING CENTRES 
 
5.61 Alongside the transformation of Lakeside into a regional centre and the 
creation of the new Purfleet Centre, the improvement of the vitality and 
viability of Grays town centre, the local centres and neighbourhood 
centres is fundamental to the achievement of sustainable development.  
Therefore, development of an appropriate scale will be directed to 
these centres, and out-of-centre proposals for main town centre uses 
will be resisted if suitable sites are available within, or failing that, 
adjacent to these centres. 
 
5.62 These include an indicative area for the future town centre boundary of 
the Lakeside regional centre which will be set out in the Site Specific 
Allocations and Policies DPD consistent with Policy CSTP7 and on the 
Proposals Map; also boundaries for Grays town centre, the existing 
local centres, broad locations for new local centres and the locations of 
existing neighbourhood centres (larger and smaller).  
 
 
 
CSTP8 - VITALITY AND VIABILI TY OF EXISTING CENTR ES 
The Council will maintain and promote the retail function of existing centres. 
Measures to improve the vitality and viability of the network of centres will be 
encouraged in order to meet the needs of the Borough’s residents and act as 
a focus for retail, leisure, cultural, business and residential uses.  The 
Council will do this in the following ways: 
 
(i) Permitting applications for main town centre uses on suitable 
sites of an appropriate scale to the role and function of the 
centres, with Town Centres being the preferred locations, 
followed by edge of Town Centre locations; 
(ii) Resist proposals for main town centre uses in out of centre 
locations if town centre or edge of town centre locations are 
available, and also at edge of town centre locations if Town 
Centre locations are available; 
(iii) Encouraging diversification and improvement of the range and 
quality of facilities including retail, employment, leisure and 
entertainment, community, culture and education;  
(iv) Retaining and, subject to other Core Strategy policies, 
permitting additional residential development in appropriate 
locations and in particular on sites identified for mixed 
development; 
(v) Improving access for public transport, pedestrians, cyclists and 
those with special needs, whilst managing road traffic and 
improving road safety; 
(vi) Improving the wider environment by ensuring new development 
protects and/or enhances the designated centres including 
historic character, townscape and biodiversity 
(vii) Where appropriate seeking to improve personal safety and 
contribute to crime reduction by design and other measures

 CSTP9 – WELLBEING: LEISURE AND SPORTS     
 
Introduction  
 
5.63 Leisure and sport are of prime importance to improving and 
maintaining the quality of life in the Borough by encouraging an active 
and healthy community. Thurrock Council is committed to meeting the 
leisure and sports needs of the community and this policy aims to 
address identified deficiencies and maintain and improve existing 
provision. Leisure and sport facilities have an important role in 
improving the wellbeing of the community.  This includes ensuring the 
physical and mental health of individuals, preventing disease and 
reducing the health inequalities that exist across the Borough.   
 
5.64 It is important that leisure and sports provision links well to 
communities in the Borough, providing facilities that are accessible to 
all through walking, cycling and public transport and which people are 
confident to use. These forms of provision often form part of the 
Borough’s green and historic infrastructure and links between those 
infrastructures and sports and other leisure facilities are of great value 
and should be benefitted from as far as possible.     
 
5.65 Several agencies have produced guidance related to Leisure and 
Sports, including the Sport England Strategy 2008-2011, which 
confirms that local authorities and partners can use sport to deliver 
stronger, healthier and more cohesive communities. The NHS 
promotes physical exercise and activity in order to cut the risk of 
serious illness.     
 
 Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.66 A Framework for Regeneration and Sustainable Growth, Transforming 
and Revitalising Thurrock  (TTGDC, 2005) includes strategic goals 
aiming for increasing opportunities for entertainment, leisure and 
culture in the Borough. Thurrock's Sustainable Community Strategy 
2009 (SCS ) aims at promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing the 
health inequalities that exist between different parts of the community.   
 
5.67 The Core Strategy has also been informed by the Sports and Active 
Recreation Strategy for Thurrock (Thurrock Council, TTGDC and Sport 
England, 2009) which considers how existing sports facilities can be 
enhanced, as well as the creation of new sport and leisure facilities.  
This strategy will be used to direct future resources and ensure 
Thurrock has up to date, accessible and inviting sports facilities to 
support both the existing population and the predicted growth. The 
Council’s Thurrock Outdoor Sports Strategy assesses and audits 
pla
ying pitch provision within the Borough. 
 
5.68 The Council’s Community Needs and Open Spaces Study (2005)  
assessed the quality, quality and accessibility of open space across the 
Borough.  The study showed that there were deficiencies in the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
93 
 provision across Thurrock. Some areas having little pedestrian access 
to parks, for example, while play spaces for children are often 
considered to be of poor quality; natural greenspace is unevenly 
distributed across the Borough, and changing room facilities for sport 
fail to provide adequately for female participation.  There is clear need 
to address the weaknesses illustrated in the study, as well as 
accommodate the needs associated with the substantial growth 
planned over the lifetime of the plan.  A Play Strategy for Thurrock: The 
Thurrock Play Partnership 2007-2017  reflects access, quality and types 
of spaces in which children and young people play.  The strategy 
identifies gaps in the provision of play spaces and actions to address 
the gaps and opportunities for funding. 
 
5.69 The Council will ensure that future investment improves sport 
resources and improves their accessibility.  The Council will work for 
the funding to ensure improvements in adult participation in sport by 1-
2% per annum, as set out in Council’s national indicator targets 
included in the Shaping Thurrock Partnership’s Local Area Agreement 
(LAA) 2008/09-2010/11 .  
 
CSTP9 – WELL -BEING: LEISURE AND SPORTS  
The Council and Partners will support the delivery of a physically active, socially 
inclusive and healthy community through the provision of high quality sports and 
leisure facilities and appropriate spaces for those that live, work, and visit the 
borough. To achieve this, the Council and Partners will:  
 
1. New and Existing Facilities  
I. Safeguard existing and future provision of leisure, sports and open space 
facilities. The Council will only allow the loss of a particular facility where 
appropriate alternative provision can be made elsewhere.    
  
II. Support the provision of new or improved leisure and sports facilities to 
address deficiencies identified in the Thurrock Outdoor Sports Strategy , 
Sports and Active Recreation Strategy  and the Community Needs and 
Open Spaces Study. 
 
III. Promote smaller-scale sports and leisure facilities in town centres, local 
centres and Lakeside Regional centre.  
 
IV. Ensure that new or improved facilities are in locations that are accessible 
to the local community and create or improve links to Thurrock’s network 
of green and historic infrastructure, including the Thames riverside.  
 
V. Provide facilities for schools and other institutions which can be linked 
and shared with the community.  
 
VI. Where appropriate, encouraging development proposals that seek to 
support the development of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and 
legacy. 
 
VII. Ensure that the potential health impacts of development are identified Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
94 
 and addressed at an early stage in the planning process. 
 
2. Key Sites  
I. The Council will work with relevant partners to progress the development 
of key flagship leisure and sports facilities at key locations to promote 
regeneration. The identified flagship sites include: 
    
i. Sports and Well-Being Hubs (initially at Belhus, followed  by 
facilities at Blackshots-North Grays) 
ii. Leisure and sports facilities for Lakeside will be identified and set 
out in the relevant Development Plan Documents. 
 
II. The Council will review the potential for enhanced leisure facilities at 
Grays river front.   
 
III. A Supplementary Planning Document will be prepared at a future date to 
consider the issues of health and wellbeing with regard to Chadwell St. 
Mary and Tilbury. 
 
The sites will be included in the Adopted Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD 
and identified on the Proposals Map. 
 
3. Developer Contributions 
Proposals for new development will be required to contribute towards the leisure 
and sports needs generated by the development and address any deficiencies 
in the locality that they may generate or exacerbate.

 CSTP10 – COMMUNITY FACILITIES     
 
Introduction  
 
5.70 Community facilities contribute towards meeting the varied needs of 
local people, including providing opportunities to engage in learning, 
develop skills and talents, and to interact with other members of the 
community.  It is important that sufficient community facilities, including 
libraries, museums, village halls, places of worship and other public 
halls, community centres, organised attractions and festivals are in 
place to support the community, including the substantial additional 
growth planned for Thurrock during the lifetime of the plan. 
 
5.71 This policy aims to ensure the delivery of community facilities within the 
Borough, through action by the Council and its partners, in order to 
address identified needs and to maintain existing provision. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.72 Thurrock Council’s Refreshed Cultural Strategy (2006) highlights the 
importance of delivering community facilities.  It sets out the Council’s 
vision to maintain and enhance cultural facilities in the Borough. The 
Council has commissioned an Infrastructure Implementation and 
Prioritisation Programme (2010) to assess the infrastructure 
requirements for the Borough, which is required to consider the needs 
associated with the substantial growth planned.  A Faith Infrastructure 
Study has been undertaken to identify the infrastructure requirements 
of faith groups and their future need for new premises. The study 
identifies an estimated need for four new sites on or adjacent to major 
housing developments identified by applying the Three Dragons 
standards; and 38 new or shared premises identified through direct 
consultation with faith groups 
 
5.73 Studies produced by the Thurrock Thames Gateway Development 
Corporation include the Preferred Option Spatial Plan  (TTGDC, 2006) 
and A Framework for Regeneration and Sustainable Growth: 
Transforming and Revitalising Thurrock (TTGDC, 2005).  Both these 
studies acknowledge the importance of culture, heritage and leisure to 
the quality of life of the people of Thurrock.   
 
CSTP10 – COMMUNITY FACILITIES  
1. Existing Facilities  
I. The Council will safeguard existing community facilities and will only 
allow their loss in circumstances where appropriate facilities of equal or 
better quality will be provided as part of the development. 
 
II. The Council and partners will promote higher levels of active 
participation of existing community facilities through campaign 
awareness, education and community engagement.

community facilities to serve new and existing communities, regenerate 
areas and raise the profile of Thurrock as a destination for culture and 
the arts.  
 
II. The Council will encourage the development of multi-functional 
community facilities as an integral part of all major development in the 
Borough.  
 
3. Key Projects 
I. The Council will work with relevant partners to deliver the following 
projects: 
 
i. Multi-functional Hub Community Centres at centres such as 
Chadwell St Mary and Purfleet.

 CSTP11 – HEALTH PROVISION  
 
Introduction  
 
5.74 According to Thurrock Joint Strategic Needs Assessments  (2008), the 
health of the population has been improving steadily. However, despite 
this general improvement, the gap in the main causes of death 
between those in advantaged and disadvantaged groups has widened. 
Those in disadvantaged groups are more likely to die earlier and to be 
in poorer health than the rest of the population. This is linked to social 
and demographic circumstances such as educational attainment, 
occupation, income, housing type and where people live. A range of 
policies within the Core Strategy provide measures to help tackle 
health inequality in Thurrock by ensuring good accessibility to services 
and facilities, including open and green spaces, community spaces and 
infrastructure and sport facilities.     
 
5.75 This policy aims to highlight the planned delivery of health services that 
will benefit the existing and future local community of Thurrock.  The 
longer-term vision for health care provision is to introduce a sustained 
realignment of the whole health and social care system.  Far more 
services will be delivered safely and effectively in settings closer to 
home, and services will be built around the needs of individuals and not 
service providers.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.76 Thurrock’s Sustainable Community Strategy  (Strategic Partnership for 
Thurrock, 2009) highlights a range of objectives related to health.  With 
reference to the spatial planning framework, it highlights the 
importance of reducing the health inequalities that exist between 
different parts of our community, including the joining up of health and 
social services. 
 
NHS South West Essex Vision  
 
5.77 The vision of NHS South West Essex is ‘for the entire population 
served by NHS South West Essex to become one of the healthiest and 
best cared for in the country’. To enable this to happen a Strategic Plan 
2009-2014 (‘A Golden Opportunity’) was developed, incorporating 5 
key strategic priorities: 
 
 Access to quality primary, community and dental care. 
 Integrated care pathways. 
 Prevention and screening. 
 Patient experience, quality and safety. 
 Organisational Development. 
 
The NHS South West Essex Strategic Service Development Plan will 
ensure that services are planned, commissioned and provided 
reflecting these priorities in order to achieve the vision statement. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
98 
 
 
This vision will be supported by four goals: 
 
 To improve life expectancy and reduce health inequalities through 
faster improvements in the most deprived areas of our community. 
 To support healthy lives by reducing the key determinants of ill 
health, providing preventative care and access to screening. 
 To improve access to high quality care so that care is provided at 
the right time, and in the right place. 
 All patients experience high quality care which is safe, clinically 
effective and offers a good patient experience. 
 
5.78 The NHS South West Essex vision further outlines a tiered model of 
health care provision across SWE, for Thurrock this translates the 
model into a number of developments as set out below.   
 
Within Thurrock a wide range of health provision will be provided from 
the tier 0-3 levels. The highest order of health care provision available 
within Thurrock will be the New Generation Community Hospital in 
Grays (tier 3). However, Thurrock’s local community will also benefit 
from health care infrastructure from a higher tier provision located 
outside the Borough.

 5.79 The Strategic Outline Case: Development of a New Generation 
Community Hospital in Grays as Part of Regeneration Thurrock  (NHS 
South West Essex, 2008) sets out the needs that have been identified 
and options for development in Grays to inform consultation of the 
community hospital for Grays. Once completed, NHS SWE will prepare 
an Outline Business Case, confirming the location and architectural 
plans for the new hospital.  The final stage of NHS planning will be set 
out in the Final Business Case, before construction of the hospital can 
begin.  Timescales for the preparation of these further documents and 
development of the hospital are to be confirmed later in 2010. 
       
CSTP11 – HEALTH PROVISION  
1. Health Care Provision  
 
The Council will work with partners to deliver:  
I. A healthy, strong and vibrant sustainable community by ensuring the 
delivery of health care infrastructure within Thurrock through a tiered 
model for health care provision.   
 
II. A significant reduction in health inequalities between different groups 
within the Borough, and between the Borough and the region, in line with 
national and regional NHS objectives.    
 
III. Health care facilities that are located according to need, and which are 
accessible to all people in the Borough, including by public transport, 
cycling or walking. 
 
IV. Health care facilities that meet existing and future community needs, 
including those needs arising from the new housing and employment that 
will be developed in the Borough over the lifetime of the plan. 
 
V. Improved access to General Practitioners within West Thurrock and 
Purfleet where an existing deficit has been identified. 
 
2. Tier 3 – A Community Hospital – Offering High level Intermediate 
Services  
I. The Council supports the development of a New Generation Community 
Hospital (NGCH) in Hogg Lane, Grays with an anticipated built 
completion date of late 2013.  This will be the highest tier health care 
facility in Thurrock, and will be supported by secondary and tertiary care 
facilities outside the Borough. 
 
II. The Council supports the provision of a wide range of health and social 
care services for local people through the NGCH.  Services are 
anticipated to include a GP surgery, x-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, a 
minor injuries unit, primary care assessment and outpatient facilities.      
 
3. Tier 2 - Health Centres with Community and Extended Services  
I. The Council supports the development of Tier 2 health care 
infrastructure in Thurrock, with each facility providing a range of 
specialist health services for a population of approximately 30,000 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 people.  They are anticipated to be delivered at the following locations: 
 
i. Purfleet – Over the next ten years the population of Purfleet is 
expected to increase due to proposed housing developments. An 
increase in health care services will be provided to meet increasing 
needs in Purfleet as the area is developed. The level of these 
facilities and timing of construction will depend on the phasing of 
the proposed development.  
ii. Grays Town Centre –  New GP-led health care facilities at the 
Equitable Access Centre. This service will be available in 2010 and 
will lead to a requirement for four additional Whole Time Equivalent 
(WTE) GP’s in 2010, and one further WTE GP by 2014.    
iii. Tilbury – Proposed new modern heath care facilities to address the 
deficit in provision in Tilbury following a strategic review and public 
engagement during 2009.  It is anticipated that this will lead to a 
requirement for three additional WTE GP’s by 2012.   
iv. The Council will work with health partners to plan for additional 
facilities in Thurrock Urban area if need is identified from any future 
assessments. 
 
4. Tier 1 – Local Service Providers in fit for purpose premises offering a 
range of services  
The Council supports the provision of new and improved tier one services, 
particularly in areas where a deficiency is identified.  There is currently a 
deficit in tier 1 services across the Borough that will be affected further by 
the increase in population and employment envisaged in the Regional 
Spatial Strategy.

 5. Partnership Working  
The Council and NHS South West Essex are committed to working closely 
with partners to respond to local population changes.  NHS SWE will 
ensure good communication with partners and Thurrock’s local community 
to ensure that health care infrastructure development is responsive to 
patients’ needs.  
 
6. Adult Social Care  
I. The Council will support the development of adult social care facilities 
that allow people to stay in their own homes for as long as possible, 
rather than providing more space in care homes and nursing homes.   
 
II. Where alterations to residential property are required to allow people to 
retain independence and stay in their home, the Council will support 
them subject to the normal controls on design and layout of residential 
properties and protection of neighbouring amenity.   
 
III. The Council will only support the development of specialist care facilities 
in small units, to provide facilities for members of the community who 
cannot be cared for at home.  These will include facilities for specialist 
areas such as autism, profound physical and learning disabilities, where 
there is no local provision.  
 
IV. The Council will look to expand the provision of extra care housing and 
will be working with Housing colleagues to identify sites that can be 
developed as an alternative to long term residential care.  
 
7. Private Sector Provision 
The Council supports, in principle, the provision of hospice 
accommodation at a location to be set out in the Site Specific Allocations 
and Policies DPD. The Council will give consideration to allowing enabling 
development if it can be demonstrated that this is essentially required. 
 
8. Developer Contributions 
Any significant new developments that will have an adverse impact on the 
current accessibility and capacity of health care services will be required to 
contribute towards the community needs generated by the development 
and address any identified deficiencies in the locality that they generate or 
exacerbate.

 CSTP12 – EDUCATION AND LEARNING  
 
Introduction  
 
5.80 The Sustainable Communities Plan: Building for the Future  highlights 
the important role of education and learning in contributing to the 
delivery of a sustainable community.  This policy aims to highlight the 
planned delivery of education and learning services and facilities that 
will benefit the existing and future community of Thurrock.  Other 
policies within the Core Strategy aim to ensure good accessibility to 
educational and learning and community services through a range of 
transport, access and other policies.  Further policies within the Core 
Strategy must be taken into account when seeking to achieve 
integration of education and learning with other facilities and services. 
 
Thurrock Strategies and Plans  
 
5.81 Thurrock’s Sustainable Community Strategy (2009) highlights a 
number of objectives related to education, including providing better 
access to learning opportunities for skills and personal development.  
The Core Strategy highlights the spatial implications for providing 
better education and learning opportunities in Thurrock and for 
realising opportunities to co-locate and integrate with other services.   
 
5.82 Thurrock has a strategic vision for educational transformation; it is 
embodied in the Children and Young People’s Plan:  this plan 
overarches all other strategies and plans for education and learning. 
Thurrock Council’s School Strategy 2020 Vision  and plans for 
education emphasise the importance of integration of services to 
deliver the Every Child Matters  agenda; integration through 
partnerships, collaboration, federations, and clusters is a central part of 
the vision for delivering education and learning. Therefore appropriately 
sized and located sites and high quality communications and transport 
infrastructure are essential for access and delivery.  
 
5.83 Thurrock Council’s vision for education commits to developing a co-
ordinated and collaborative approach to delivering the 14-19 curriculum 
entitlement.  In accordance with the Education and Skills Act 2008 
Thurrock Council has arrangements in place to promote co-operation 
between the local authority, relevant partners such as the Learning 
Skills Council (LSC) or successors, and 14-19 providers, as part of the 
Children’s Trust.  The 14-19 Strategic Partnership, as a sub-set of the 
Children’s Trust is the key body for this work.  Thurrock Council, South 
Essex College, TTGDC, the Higher Education Funding Council for 
England, Anglia Ruskin University, University of East Anglia, University 
of Essex and regional/local providers are leading implementation of co-
located higher education in Thurrock at the Thurrock Learning 
Campus.  The Core Strategy supports the vision and highlights the 
development of the proposed Thurrock Learning Campus in Grays 
town centre and other higher educational facilities such as the linked 
Royal Opera House and National Skills Academy. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
103 
  
5.84 Thurrock Council is committed to developing its secondary education, 
training and community provision for young people and their families 
through the national programmes for Academies  and Building Schools 
for the Future  (BSF).  These programmes and developers’ obligations 
will substantially fund the enlargement, replacement and/or 
refurbishment of all secondary schools both mainstream and special. 
 
5.85 Thurrock’s long-term aims for primary education are to raise and 
accelerate progress in attainment, raise aspirations, secure all through 
primary provision in all schools and provide for growth but also redress 
any marked imbalances between supply and demand.  Primary schools 
will be renovated and a few rebuilt: this will be substantially funded by 
the national Primary Capital Programme (PCP) and developers’ 
obligations.  Additional primary schools will be necessary where there 
are large housing developments.  The PCP includes both mainstream 
and special schools. 
 
5.86 The Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation’s (TTGDC) 
Regeneration Framework: Transforming and Revitalising Thurrock  
encourages participation and attainment in lifelong learning and skills 
development by co-ordinating the input of partners to improve the 
pattern and take up of local education.  This vision has been carried 
forward into the TTGDC Spatial Plan, its masterplanning exercises, 
particularly in Grays Town Centre, and the Core Strategy. 
 
5.87 It is the Council’s objective and priority to maximise the benefit of 
investment in buildings, grounds and Information and Communications 
Technologies (ICT), to achieve educational transformation.  These are 
the three principal themes of transformation, with educational 
attainment our priority, to drive forward:  
 Education vision  – focus on vision and defining the needs of the 
future and not just address today’s problems.  
 ICT integration  – challenge how the teaching and learning 
opportunities from ICT affect the design of facilities and the 
delivery of curriculum.  
 Design  – explore design opportunities for educational settings, for 
example learning spaces and security, and designs which are 
inspiring and memorable – places where students want to come 
and enjoy every day. 
An essential part of achieving transformation is the relationship 
between these themes. 
 
CSTP12 – EDUCATION AND LEARNING  
1. General Approach  
In order to enhance educational achievement and skills in the Borough, the 
Council will work with the Department of Children Schools and Families 
(DCSF), the TTGDC, schools, learners, employers and other partners to 
ensure:  
 
I. The Council’s objective and priority to maximise the benefit of investment Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
104 
 in buildings, grounds and ICT, to achieve educational transformation. 
II. The provision of pre-school, primary school, high school, further 
education and special education facilities meets current and future 
needs: where appropriate different levels of education may be located 
together. 
III. The integration of schools into multi-functional hubs with linkages to key 
facilities such as sports and leisure facilities, health and social care. 
IV. Facilities in schools are fully integrated into community use where 
possible. 
V. Opportunities for learning and training facilities associated with new and 
existing businesses are realised (in particular, the Council will promote 
Enterprise and Learning Hubs, such as The Royal Opera House 
Production Campus and Skills Academy). 
VI. The co-ordination of new educational provision with new development. 
VII. The provision of high quality communications and transport 
infrastructure. 
VIII. ICT which maximises the benefits from its use for teaching and learning, 
and administration and communication, being available anytime 
anywhere for life-long learning, to engage parents and support integrated 
working to safeguard children. 
IX. Environmental, economic and social (educational and community) 
sustainability. 
X. That educational opportunities are accessible to all.  
 
2. Post 16 Education 
The Council is working with partners to transform post-16 routes to 
achievement, increase choice and diversity for learners and parents, and 
improve educational services and facilities. The Council will pursue 
engagement between post-16 educational institutions and 14- 19 partners.  
Where appropriate this will include the creation of Trusts and Academies.  
The Council will progress development schemes including:  
 
i. Thurrock Learning Campus, Grays - the plans for providing 21st 
Century facilities for further and higher education in Grays Town 
Centre are being progressed. A consortium including Thurrock 
Borough Council and four Higher Education Institutions will 
establish co-located higher education at the Thurrock Learning 
Campus; 
ii. Palmer’s Sixth Form College, Grays; 
iii. Additional Sixth Form Provision - a sixth form presumption at Gable 
Hall School resulting from the awarding of High Performing 
Specialist School status, sixth forms are also being put in place at 
the Gateway Academy, Ormiston Park and Chafford Hundred; 
iv. The Royal Opera House together with the National Skills Academy 
for Creative Arts, Purfleet; 
v. The Logistics Academy at London Gateway, Stanford-le-hope / 
Corringham. 
 
3. Secondary Education

105 
 and improve mainstream secondary school provision and will work with 
partners to identify and/or confirm sites of an appropriate size and location for 
schools as set out in the School Strategy 2020 Vision  including: 
 
i. New build, refurbishment and expansion of existing mainstream 
secondary schools under the BSF programme and other capital 
investments. 
ii. Rebuild Belhus Chase School on its existing site as Ormiston Park 
Academy and safeguard adjoining land for long-term expansion. 
iii. The priority is to provide additional school places at existing schools 
in the major regeneration areas and where appropriate to relocate 
schools to linked facilities identified in the Plan.  
 
4. Primary Education 
The Council has outlined a programme of refurbishment, expansion and new 
schools required to support long-term aims and growth in Regeneration Areas 
and other Broad Locations in the Plan; it includes: 
 
i. New additional primary schools in Purfleet and South Stifford; 
ii. Long term - a further new primary school in Grays;

 CSTP13 – EMERGENCY SERVICES AND UTILITIES   
 
Introduction  
 
5.88 Adequate infrastructure such as emergency services and public utilities 
(police, ambulance, fire services, water, gas, electricity and sewerage) 
are essential for creating sustainable development of land for housing. 
Transport, open space, and health infrastructure are critical, but these 
have been covered in other policies in the plan. The Council will work 
with partners such as utility providers, the Local Strategic Partnership, 
the Police, the Community Safety group, and the Community and 
Voluntary sectors to ensure the provision of these facilities.  
 
5.89 Future development in Thurrock will also put pressure on infrastructure. 
Without appropriate investment, further development will be neither 
sustainable nor acceptable. The infrastructure requirements of new 
development will need to be established, and the need for any 
infrastructure should be planned before development takes place. In 
many cases, this might be provided by developers in the form of 
contributions. This policy aims to ensure that key services are located 
in sustainable locations to promote service delivery for existing and 
future communities. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.90 The Thurrock Water Cycle Study (comprising Scoping Study, 2009; 
Outline Study, 2010; and Detailed Study, forthcoming) assesses the 
effect of the growth proposed for Thurrock in this Plan, under the terms 
of the RSS, on water cycle infrastructure and the water environment 
within the Thurrock study area.  The study determines where additional 
investment is required in order to (i) supply the new infrastructure 
required to support the housing growth, and (ii) to protect the water 
environment.  The Detailed Study will define in more detail the 
infrastructure requirements to support development in the Borough, 
and will enable Thurrock Council and its partners to determine when 
phased delivery of waste water infrastructure will be required, in 
parallel with the development of new housing, to safeguard the water 
quality of European Sites (Ramsar Sites, Special Protections Areas 
and Special Areas of Conservation) against increased volumes of 
waste water. The Thurrock Infrastructure Prioritisation and 
Implementation Programme  (2010) assesses Thurrock’s infrastructure 
needs, including emergency services, health infrastructure and other 
community facilities and utilities, in light of the growth proposed in the 
Borough during the lifetime of the plan.  
 
5.91 The Sustainable Community Strategy (2009) aims to ensure that 
Thurrock’s Third Sector will be thriving and providing high quality 
services according to identified needs. Clearly the inclusion of this 
policy aims to ensure that health, police, fire and statutory undertaker’s 
services and facilities are appropriately located to maximise service 
delivery for the existing and future Thurrock community. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

107 
 CSTP13  – EMERGENCY SERVICES AND UTILITIES  
1. The Council will work with partners to ensure the adequate provision of 
emergency services and utilities to meet existing and future needs. The 
Council will ensure that:  
 
I. Proposals for development will not be permitted unless the Council is 
satisfied that any consequential loss or impact on utility infrastructure or 
emergency services is fully mitigated.  
 
II. The Council will aim to facilitate co-location of services especially within 
community hubs where opportunities arise.  
 
III. The Council will ensure that services are easily accessible to minimise 
response times for the local community within Thurrock. 
 
IV. The Council and partners will work with the Essex Local Resilience 
Forum in order to ensure that emergency services are able to reach all 
members of the community within Thurrock.  
 
V. The Council will work with partners to ensure that facilities and services 
are located and designed to be resilient to flood risk and other 
emergencies to ensure continuity of service in times of flood.  
 
VI. Proposals for development will not be permitted unless the Council is 
satisfied that mechanisms to ensure the co-ordinated and timely delivery 
of utility infrastructure has been put in place.  
 
VII. Proposals for development must provide for the phased delivery of any 
necessary new infrastructure linked to the phasing of development, 
particularly water supply and waste water treatment.  
 
2. Key Schemes  
 
I. Emergency Services 
(i) New police facilities at Purfleet.

 INTRODUCTION: THURROCK TRANSPORT STRATEGY  
 
5.92 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  establishes the way in 
which congestion, road safety, air quality and enabling better access to 
services will be tackled in Thurrock. It sets out how transport 
improvements will be delivered between 2008 and 2021. The strategy 
will deliver better accessibility to services such as education 
(particularly further and higher education), employment, healthcare and 
other Regional Transport Nodes. This will be achieved first and 
foremost by reducing the need to travel, especially through policies and 
practices that will encourage the location of new development and 
delivery of services in places that have good levels of accessibility for 
people, especially the location of new education and hospital facilities.  
 
5.93 The strategy is consistent with the subsequently issued NPPF which 
states that transport policies have an important role to play in 
facilitating sustainable development but also in contributing to wider  
sustainability and health objectives.  It further states that plans and 
decisions should ensure that developments generating significant 
movement are located where the need to travel will be minimised and 
the use of sustainable transport modes can be maximised.  The priority 
will be to deliver accessibility improvements both where deprivation is 
most apparent and where significant levels of growth need to be 
accommodated sustainably. The strategy will give a priority to 
promoting active transport to improve health, a key element of which 
will be helping to deliver the Greengrid. Improved accessibility will also 
be delivered in a way that supports the large-scale jobs growth in 
Thurrock, such as widening the labour market. 
 
5.94 The strategy will tackle congestion by focusing interventions on where 
congestion and poor journey reliability are having the most adverse 
impact on quality of life and on economic productivity and 
competitiveness.  This will mean tackling congestion as a priority 
around strategic employment sites and employment growth locations 
(much of the Thurrock Urban Area and London Gateway), and on the 
routes that provide access to strategic employment and ports, 
especially for freight traffic.  
 
5.95 The strategy will achieve reduced congestion by, in priority order, 
delivering a modal shift to more sustainable modes of transport 
particularly in the urban areas (including Smarter Choices), improving 
the efficiency of the road transport network, and as a last resort 
providing additional highway infrastructure. This is broadly consistent 
with national policy as set out in the NPPF and the Government’s 
vision for the transport system as set out in the Creating Growth, 
Cutting Carbon  White Paper.

Modal Shift : The movement of people and freight to more 
sustainable/alternative modes of transport including walking, 
cycling, public transport, and river transport . 
 
Smarter Choices:  These are techniques for influencing 
people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable options 
such as encouraging school, workplace and individualised 
travel planning. They also seek to improve public transport 
and marketing services such as travel awareness campaigns, 
setting up websites for car share schemes, supporting car 
clubs and encouraging teleworking.  
 
5.96 In addition, the strategy will improve air quality and minimise emissions 
by reducing the need to travel and encouraging a modal shift (as 
described respectively in the accessibility and congestion strategies 
above), with benefits being most pronounced in areas suffering from 
both poor air quality and health deprivation. 
 
5.97 The Road Safety Strategy, whilst aiming to reduce the number of 
people killed and seriously injured, will take a proactive approach by 
reducing road danger and thereby promoting accessibility and 
community regeneration as a way of supporting other strategy areas. 
The strategy will therefore improve conditions for vulnerable road users 
and sustainable transport modes, and give priority to improving road 
safety in disadvantaged communities as well as around schools and 
major workplaces. In addition, the strategy will give a priority to 
casualty reduction where the resultant incident based congestion has 
the greatest adverse impact on economic productivity and 
competitiveness, such as routes to strategic employment locations, as 
well as on inter-urban public transport routes.

 CSTP14 – TRANSPORT IN THE THURROCK URBAN AREA: 
PURFLEET TO TILBURY 
 
Introduction 
 
5.98 The Thurrock Urban Area (Key Centre for Development and Change) 
is the main focus for growth for new housing, employment and 
associated development extending from Purfleet, West Thurrock/ 
Lakeside, Grays, Chadwell St Mary to Tilbury. Focusing growth in 
these areas will improve accessibility, as it will enable people and 
services to be located closer together, including through the delivery of 
community infrastructure such as the Learning Campus at Grays. It 
also risks generating high levels of additional traffic in a constrained 
and highly populated urban area. 
 
5.99 In order to achieve the delivery of growth in the Thurrock Urban Area, 
the policy will enable improvement in accessibility and achieve modal 
shift to improve the quality of life for residents. 
 
5.100 Combined with parking controls, the improvement of sustainable 
transport modes can tackle congestion in urban areas by means of 
modal shift and improve economic productivity. The policy highlights 
the benefits of modal shift for reducing emissions, and the health 
benefits of active transport.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.101 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  recognised the 
necessity of improving sustainable transport modes, combined with 
good management of car parking, in order to deliver the planned 
growth sustainably. It plans to improve accessibility and prioritise road 
safety interventions so as to help tackle the high levels of deprivation in 
parts of the Thurrock Urban Area, and to promote a modal shift. The 
Sustainable Communities Strategy (Thurrock LSP 2009 ) priority sets 
out that roads, public transport networks and housing will be enhanced 
so that local people have better access to employment opportunities, 
other amenities and affordable housing. 
 
5.102 The forecast traffic increases will result in considerable congestion 
(Infrastructure Deficit Study 2004 – 2021 ) and associated air pollution, 
and will therefore require strong interventions to make the growth 
deliverable and sustainable. Local policies are required to address 
challenges identified in the Thurrock Transport Strategy Evidence Base 
2008) , such as increasing the low levels of walking and cycling, making 
the most of the good levels of accessibility to local services, improving 
access to hospital and further education, building on modal shift 
achieved through travel planning, meeting the forecast demand for 
public transport, enabling access to and use of the Greengrid and 
helping to deliver the National Cycle Network Route 13, and managing 
the increased risk of walking and cycling accidents as a result of modal 
shift.  Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

CSTP14  - TRANSPORT IN THE THURROCK URBAN AREA  
1. The Council will work with partners to deliver at least a 10% reduction in car traffic 
from forecast 2026 levels.  To achieve this the Council and partners will: 
 
I. Phase the delivery of a network of walking and cycling core routes, with priority 
in growth areas. These will be supported by widespread provision of good quality 
cycle parking facilities. The core routes will improve access to education, 
healthcare, transport interchanges, employment, sports facilities, the riverside, 
Grays town centre, and Lakeside Regional Shopping Centre. They will also form 
an integral and substantial part of the Greengrid. In fulfilling this role the core 
routes will also provide sustainable access from the urban doorstep to both 
strategic and local green space. Wherever possible the design and route 
selection will assist to deliver biodiversity enhancement and habitat corridors.  
 
II. Implement widespread 20mph zones in residential areas in the Thurrock Urban 
Area. Priority will be in areas of deprivation, especially health deprivation, in 
order to create neighbourhoods that are safer for pedestrians and cyclists as well 
as residents. 
 
III. Deliver the National Cycle Network Route 13 by 2026. 
 
IV. Improve public transport infrastructure in the Thurrock Urban Area through the 
phased delivery of the South Essex Rapid Transit (SERT) and other inter-urban 
public transport and bus priority, allowing fast and reliable services to the new 
Community Hospital and Learning Campus at Grays, Lakeside Regional 
Shopping Centre, and employment opportunities. 
 
V. Ensure new development promotes high levels of accessibility by sustainable 
transport modes and local services are conveniently located to reduce the need 
to travel by car.  
 
VI. Employ Smarter Choices measures to change travel behaviour to achieve a 
reduction in forecast traffic and help to deliver better air quality and a better 
environment for job creation. Priority areas for Smarter Choices programmes 
include Grays and Lakeside. 
 
 
VII. Identify priority areas such as Grays town centre and Lakeside Basin, for 
network efficiency improvement measures to address congestion and air quality 
issues. Other Air Quality Management Areas as well as growth/regeneration 
areas will undergo transport network improvements, including where improved 
access is required.  
 
VIII. Road space will be reorganised to improve the public realm and give further 
priority to sustainable modes at transport interchanges, with priority at Grays rail 
station. 
 
IX. The maximum and minimum residential car parking standards and the maximum 
non-residential car parking standards will be reduced where accessibility is high.  
This would principally be in areas within the vicinity of transport interchanges, Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 inter-urban public transport routes, and town centres.  
 
2. New Lakeside Regional Centre 
 
The Council supports the transformation of the northern part of the Lakeside Basin 
into a new regional centre.  This will be achieved in policy through other Local 
Development Documents.  Regeneration and remodelling of the wider Lakeside Basin 
and West Thurrock areas will be taken forward with the following guiding principles: 
 
i. Securing more sustainable movement patterns, reduced private motor 
vehicle dependence and complementary travel demand management 
measures including an area-wide travel plan. 
 
ii. Improving local accessibility and connectivity by public transport and 
pedestrian and cyclist permeability throughout the area including 
consideration of ways to reconnect the north and the south of the area, a 
high frequency service rail station in the south, and a personal rapid transit 
system. 
 
iii. Providing the necessary improvements to the local and strategic road 
network. 
 
iv. Introduction of a car parking charging and management regime.

 CSTP15 - TRANSPORT IN GREATER THURROCK  
 
Introduction 
 
5.103 Greater Thurrock consists of the areas outside of the Thurrock Urban 
Area (Key Centre for Development and Change). Although settlements 
such as South Ockendon, Aveley, East Tilbury and 
Corringham/Stanford-le-Hope will accommodate some degree of 
growth, they will be a focus for regeneration including provision of a 
limited number of additional homes as well as jobs, community facilities 
and services. Development such as the London Gateway will constitute 
the main employment growth area in Greater Thurrock. It is important 
that development contributes to improvements in accessibility, 
especially by sustainable transport, and ensures that communities can 
enjoy the benefits of growth. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.104 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  plans to focus 
accessibility improvements in Greater Thurrock on helping to deliver 
the Greengrid strategy and on supporting Demand Responsive 
Transport, especially to link up with good public transport services. The 
Sustainable Communities Strategy  (Thurrock LSP 2009) aims to 
improve access to sustainable modes of transport, promote healthy 
lifestyles, and improve the natural environment, as well as overall try to 
enable existing as well as new communities to benefit from 
development. 
 
5.105 A number of transport challenges were identified in the Thurrock 
Transport Strategy Evidence Base (2008), such as building on recent 
improvements to public transport accessibility and the availability of 
Demand Responsive Transport, improving accessibility to further 
education and hospitals by public transport, ensuring the most is made 
of a Rights of Way network that is easy to use, delivering accessibility 
to London Gateway and the Thurrock Urban Area, and implementing 
the School Travel Plans. 
 
5.106 The Greengrid Strategy  2006-2011  recognises that improved green 
access links which enable movement of people and wildlife between 
countryside and strategic openspace to doorstep spaces, is key to 
maximising the benefits of all green spaces. The Greengrid Strategy for 
Thurrock 2006-2011  is supported by the Thurrock Open Space 
Strategy 2006-2011 , the Thurrock Biodiversity Study 2006-2011  and 
the Green Infrastructure Plan for Thurrock 2006-2011 .

116 
 CSTP15  - TRANSPORT IN GREATER THURROCK  
In Greater Thurrock, accessibility, especially to work, education and 
healthcare, will be improved. To achieve this the Council and partners will: 
 
I. Promote and support the use of passenger services that respond to 
demand particularly in areas with poor accessibility.  
 
II. Integrate local passenger transport services with the inter-urban public 
transport routes such as SERT. 
 
III. Prioritise Rights of Way/Bridleway improvements, such as the Mardyke 
Valley route, that contribute to the development of the Greengrid. 
 
IV. Develop local walking and cycle routes that link to the Thurrock urban 
area and that link the National Cycle Network Route 13 to employment. 
Access to London Gateway will be a priority. These local routes will also 
form an integral part of the Greengrid strategic and local green 
links.  Wherever possible the design and route selection will assist to 
deliver biodiversity enhancement and habitat corridors. 
 
V. Support more sustainable and healthy travel patterns through school and 
workplace travel plans, particularly in South Ockendon and in accessing 
London Gateway.  The latter should include improved public transport 
interchange at Stanford-le-Hope railway station and with SERT, to 
connect with local bus services to London Gateway.   
 
VI. Growth or regeneration areas will also undergo transport network 
improvements where new accesses are required, particularly for 
sustainable transport modes. 
 
VII. Ensure new development, especially London Gateway, promotes high 
levels of accessibility by sustainable transport modes and local services 
are conveniently located to reduce the need to travel by car.

 CSTP16 - NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TRANSPORT NETWORKS  
 
Introduction 
 
5.107 Although most of the growth in Thurrock will be in the Thurrock Urban 
Area, as well as at the London Gateway development, considerable 
growth will take place just outside the Borough as part of the wider 
Thames Gateway growth and regeneration. Thurrock is also an area of 
port-related activity and industry generating considerable and growing 
numbers of HGVs, which require access to destinations well beyond 
Thurrock. All this means that travel demand for both HGVs and people 
along key corridors is considerable and is forecast to grow.  
 
5.108 Supporting economic growth by ensuring sustainable, high quality and 
reliable access to key employment locations and the ports is critical. 
This will be achieved by enabling more inter-urban movements to be 
made by public transport, thereby improving accessibility, as well as 
achieving modal shift and a consequent reduction in emissions. 
 
5.109 The NPPF indicates that the transport system needs to be balanced in 
favour of sustainable transport modes.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.110 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  plans to achieve a 
modal shift onto a high quality inter-urban public transport network, with 
high quality bus routes where rail does not exist. Where modal shift is 
not sufficient to ease congestion on those routes important for the 
Thurrock economy, it plans to ease congestion by improving highway 
capacity and to complement this with a high priority being given to 
tackling incidents, such as accidents, that cause sporadic congestion.  
 
5.111 According to the Thurrock Transport Strategy Evidence Base (2008) 
and the Infrastructure Deficit Study 2004 – 2021 , the situation in 
Thurrock creates many challenges that need addressing including 
providing transport choices for the high levels of in and out-commuting, 
continuing the recent increase in bus and train use to facilitate the 
forecast demand for public transport, improving accessibility to non-
local services such as hospital and further education, overcoming the 
remoteness of London Gateway from the urban area, and addressing 
congestion and capacity issues adversely affecting key pieces of 
infrastructure (with knock-on impacts for local roads), such as parts of 
the A13, M25 and also some rail stations. 
 
CSTP16  - NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TRANSPORT NETWORKS  
1. The Council will work with partners to deliver improvements to national and 
regional transport networks to ensure growth does not result in routes 
being above capacity. Public transport improvements will be prioritised in 
order to achieve a modal shift. To achieve this the Council and partners 
will:

118 
 I. Develop a high quality network of inter-urban public transport routes 
offering a minimum of a half hourly frequency during the day, linking the 
Thurrock Urban Area with other Regional Transport Nodes and London.  
 
II. Improve capacity by lengthening platforms at key railway stations. 
 
III. Provide a route linking Thurrock Urban Area to Basildon through SERT 
by 2016 followed by additional routes to other Regional Transport Nodes.  
 
IV. Improve passenger connections that make use of the River Thames, 
such as linking Tilbury and Gravesend. 
 
V. Improve capacity and connections between modes of transport at key 
transport interchanges such as rail stations. Priority will be given to: 
i. Improvements of inter-urban public transport routes and 
connections, and especially access to Strategic Employment 
Sites.  
ii. Improvements at Grays, Stanford-le-Hope, Chafford Hundred/ 
Lakeside, Tilbury, and Purfleet, and a new rail station at West 
Thurrock. 
 
VI. Target key economically important routes for accident reduction 
interventions. 
 
VII. Support the delivery of additional highway capacity, including through the 
use of technology and information, but only where modal shift will be 
insufficient to address congestion. Opportunities will be taken to improve 
public transport as part of any enhancements. Priority will be given to 
routes that provide access, especially for freight, to Strategic 
Employment Sites, the ports at London Gateway, Tilbury and Purfleet, 
and regeneration areas. This will include: 
 
i. M25 between junctions 27 and 30 
ii. M25 junction 30 
iii. A13 from A128 to A1014 
iv. A13 and A1089 junction improvement 
v. A1014 from A13 to London Gateway 
 
2. Thurrock Council will, with the Highways Agency and relevant stakeholders 
where appropriate, identify cost effective interim measures to deliver 
sustainable and efficient national and regional transportation infrastructure 
within Thurrock.

CSTP17 - STRATEGIC FREIGHT MOVEMENT AND ACCESS TO 
PORTS 
 
Introduction 
 
5.112 Thurrock is traditionally an area of port-related and freight activity. 
Growth over the plan period, particularly the London Gateway 
development and Tilbury port, is forecast to increase freight activity, 
especially HGVs. The policy will support economic growth by ensuring 
sustainable, high quality and reliable freight access to the ports and 
other key employment locations, whilst minimising the adverse impacts 
such activity might have on people, the environment and the transport 
system.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.113 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  plans to support a 
Freight Quality Partnership and to use this and other means to achieve 
a freight modal shift onto rail and the River Thames, to ensure HGVs 
use the most appropriate roads around Thurrock, and to reduce 
harmful pollution from HGVs. It also supported improved lorry parking 
provision.  
 
5.114 The Thurrock Transport Strategy Evidence Base  (2008) along with the 
Infrastructure Deficit Study 2004 – 2021  identified a number of 
challenges including the worsening congestion on key roads such as 
the A13, concerns about the capacity of the rail network to deliver 
freight modal shift and continue the increasing use of rail freight, 
opportunities for moving freight on the River Thames, the adverse 
impact on air pollution with this spreading eastward with the 
development of London Gateway, increasing CO2 emissions, and 
HGVs parking in residential areas and other inappropriate places. 
 
CSTP17  - STRATEGIC FREIGHT MOVEMENT AND ACCESS TO PORTS  
The Council will support the logistics and port sectors, and the positive 
impacts of freight activity in Thurrock and beyond, by: 
 
1. Facilitating a shift to rail freight and freight carried on the River Thames. 
This will be through:  
I. Protecting inter-modal, rail and water-borne freight facilities from 
other development at locations where a demand exists or is expected 
to exist. 
 
II. Promoting the use of rail and water borne freight facilities by 
supporting the development of appropriate infrastructure. 
 
III. Supporting improvements to facilitate sustainable freight movements, 
including the rail hub at London Gateway, the South West Thurrock 
Railhead and improving access to the ports.

120 
 2. Facilitating the provision of 24 hour lorry parks at Tilbury Port, London 
Gateway and West Thurrock. Subject to compliance with other policies in 
this plan, other lorry parks will be considered in locations where demand 
can be shown to exist, which are located away from residential areas 
and have good access to the Strategic Road Network 
 
3. Working as part of a Freight Quality Partnership and with other relevant 
partners, in order to:  
 
i. Maximise modal shift opportunities. 
ii. Ensure freight traffic keeps to the most suitable routes as 
defined in Thurrock Council’s Road Network Hierarchy. 
iii. Promote the use of less polluting freight vehicles.  
iv. Reduce the adverse impact of congestion caused by road freight 
on the A13, A1089, and A1306.

 CSTP18 – GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE  
 
Introduction  
 
5.115 The Thurrock Green Infrastructure Plan is a key delivery document for 
the Sustainable Community Strategy. Its principle puts natural 
environment features and processes at the centre of land use 
management and development of both private and public land. Green 
Infrastructure assets include both large and small scale, natural and 
developed land, such as rivers and flood plains, road and railway 
corridors, civic spaces, private gardens, street trees, green roofs, 
cemeteries and churchyards, productive land, vacant and derelict land.  
 
5.116 Thurrock’s approach is to ensure the provision of a multi-functional 
landscape and maximise connections between assets.  It will deliver a 
network of green assets and green links to serve and connect the 
urban and rural areas and their communities, enhance local landscape 
character and promote a sense of place for Thurrock. A key element of 
the Green Infrastructure approach is the use of green assets for 
multiple functions. Green Infrastructure has a wider approach than 
open space and aims to influence private land holdings as well as 
public land.  
 
Green Infrastructure provides a number of ‘ecosystem services’: 
 Supporting services:  soil formation, photosynthesis, primary 
production, nutrient cycling and water cycling.   
 Provisioning services:  food, fuel (especially low-
carbon/renewable resources), genetic resources, ornamental 
resources and fresh water. 
 Regulating services:  air quality regulation, climate regulation (e.g. 
reducing urban ‘heat island’ effects, providing shade and 
windbreaks), improved water resource and waste management, 
storm water surcharge and flood risk reduction and erosion control.   
 Cultural services:  spiritual enrichment, landscape values such as 
heritage interpretation, recreation and aesthetic experiences.  
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.117 The Greengrid Strategy  2006-2011  recognises that improved green 
access links between green assets is key to maximising the benefits 
derived from green assets for residents, workers and visitors to the 
Borough.   
 
5.118 The Green Infrastructure Plan for Thurrock 2006-2011 , sits within the 
Thurrock Greengrid Strategy 2006-2011  along with the Thurrock Open 
Spaces Strategy 2006-2011  and the Thurrock Biodiversity Study 2006-
2011 . It identifies green assets as having the potential to perform 
multiple functions and details the appropriate Green Infrastructure to be 
delivered to address deficiencies and meet the needs of the growing 
population.  There is a need to enhance existing provision to ensure 
that it meets the standards set out in the Council’s Community Spaces Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
123 
 and Open Spaces Study (2005). It also identifies many examples of 
Green Infrastructure assets in addition to potential sites for creation or 
enhancement of green infrastructure assets including: 
 the creation of a new, multi-functional country park at the Cory 
Landfill site, Mucking;  
 enhancement of multifunctional greenspace at Belhus Park, 
sports hub and associated woods complex, East Thurrock 
Marshes and Blackshots sports hub; and  
 flood management opportunities within the Mardyke valley, and 
Fobbing and Mucking Marshes areas. 
 
5.119 A Landscape Strategy for Thurrock 2002-2017  confirms the Council’s 
commitment to conserving and enhancing the landscape character of 
the Borough, and sets out specific features to be preserved and 
enhanced.  Within this there are opportunities to improve the quality of 
the urban fringe through the provision of new woodland planting, 
hedgerow planting and other habitat improvements.  This may also 
come through allowing appropriate uses in the countryside, such as 
informal recreation and access, which is further addressed in the Well-
Being: Leisure and Sports policy. 
  
5.120 The Thurrock Landscape Capacity Study  (2005) sets out the landscape 
character areas for Thurrock. This informs the policy which aims to 
ensure that: 
 The landscape character types which give Thurrock its sense of 
place are identified and valued; 
 Key characteristics which contribute to each character type and 
create local distinctiveness are recognised; 
 Key landscape qualities desirable to safeguard are identified; and  
 Key landscape conditions and options for sustainable development 
are identified. 
 
CSTP18 – GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE  
1. Green Infrastructure Network  
I. The Council, with its partners, will restore, protect, enhance and where 
appropriate create its green assets. The Green Infrastructure seeks to 
address the connectivity between urban and rural areas in the Borough 
and ensure that such green assets are multi-functional in use.  Green 
assets can be those in public or private ownership and can be legally 
protected or covered by non-statutory designations.   
 
2. A net gain and New Development 
I. The Council will require a net gain in Green Infrastructure. This will 
contribute to addressing the existing and developing deficiencies, 
ensuring connectivity and relieving pressure on designated biodiversity 
sites such as SSSI’s.  
 
II. Alongside the requirements for biodiversity set out in Policy CSTP19,  
development must contribute to the delivery of Green Infrastructure, 
including the acquisition, planning, design and ongoing management 
consistent with the emerging Greengrid SPD. A key element of this will Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
124 
 be connectivity and the integrity of the network; sites should not be 
considered in isolation. 
 
III. Opportunities to increase Green Infrastructure will be pursued in new 
developments through the incorporation of features such as green roofs, 
green walls and other habitat/wildlife creation and also innovative 
technology. 
 
IV. Green Infrastructure assets will be identified, enhanced and safeguarded 
through: 
i. Not permitting development that compromises the integrity of green 
and historic assets and that of the overall Green Infrastructure 
network;  
ii. Using developer contributions to facilitate improvements to the 
quality, use and provision of multi-functional green assets and 
green linkages; and  
iii. Investment from external funding sources. 
 
3. Deficits 
Where there is an identified deficit the Council will require the creation of 
green assets including parks and gardens; natural and semi-natural 
spaces; amenity greens; children’s play space; and outdoor sports 
facilities. Developments in areas of deficiency should provide for the 
supply and ongoing management of new areas of high quality natural and 
semi-natural space to address the new demand for green infrastructure. 
The guidance for provision of Green Infrastructure will be identified in the 
Greengrid SPD. 
 
4. Programmes  
I. The Council will work with partners to develop and implement Green 
Infrastructure through an area-based Greengrid Improvement Zones at a 
local level as necessary in order to deliver the green infrastructure in 
accordance with the overarching objectives of the Greengrid Strategy.  
 
II. The Council will lead in Green Infrastructure management through 
developing best practice biodiversity enhancement throughout both 
urban-amenity and infrastructure land. This will be coordinated by 
programmes of education and community engagement and will support 
the development of environmental skills training in the region.  
 
III. Allocations for new Green Infrastructure for Lakeside will be identified in 
other relevant Development Plan Documents.    
 
IV. The Council will identify projects to enhance the network further by 
improving the quality of existing provision and create new facilities to 
address existing deficiencies and serve the increasing population and to 
improve links between sites.

 CSTP19 – BIODIVERSITY   
 
Introduction  
 
5.121 Thurrock has unique biodiversity significance owing to a combination of 
factors, including its geology, orientation and microclimate together 
with past and present land-uses.  The large amount of brownfield land 
that has been left unmanaged has resulted in significant plant and 
invertebrate communities. There are features such as the River 
Thames, remnants of the Thames Terrace grasslands and the coastal 
marshes that also support a rich collection of marine and terrestrial 
species; however much has been lost to agriculture or industrial uses.  
More detail about the priority habitats and species within the Borough 
is provided in the Thurrock Biodiversity Action Plan (2006).  
 
Thurrock has a number of sites designated for their wildlife importance. 
This includes: 
 1 Ramsar site 
 1 Special Protection Area (SPA) 
 12 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
 12 Wildlife Corridors 
 11 Habitat Chains/clusters 
 2 Local Nature Reserves 
 
5.122 There are also other sites contributing to the network that have 
considerable biodiversity value but which are not statutorily protected, 
including 70 Local Wildlife Sites and 69 Potential Local Wildlife Sites.  
While some species have specific legal protection, many Red Data 
Book and/or UK Biodiversity Action Plan species are not formally 
protected but are of particular importance to Thurrock due to the 
presence of a diverse assemblage of invertebrates, many of which are 
nationally scarce.  It is important therefore that consideration is given 
as to how best to protect sites with particularly rich assemblages.   
 
5.123 Biodiversity is not solely about site protection, but can be achieved 
through choosing to use native species and adopting appropriate 
management regimes. This policy seeks to protect sites of existing 
biodiversity value and to develop an ecological network that is 
sufficiently robust to withstand the impacts of additional development 
and climate change.  The substantial growth planned for the Borough 
should not be to the detriment of the biodiversity of the area.  New 
development should understand and respect this, and not lead to any 
net loss of species or habitats.  There are opportunities to achieve 
benefits for biodiversity through the way land is managed. 
 
5.124 The Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan  published in 1994, sets out broad 
strategies for biodiversity conservation in the UK for the next 20 years. 
A UK Biodiversity Steering Group was set up, and its report published 
in 1995 gave more detailed action plans for species and habitats of 
highest priority for conservation action. The report also promoted Local 
Biodiversity Action Plans as a means of implementing the national Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 plan. Currently Geodiversity Action Plans are being developed by local 
'geo' groups in Eastern England as part of the East of England 
Geodiversity Partnership. Sites within Thurrock will be key elements in 
the plans. 
 
5.125 Essex Biodiversity Action Plan  (1999) was developed by a steering 
group of representatives from local authorities, statutory agencies and 
voluntary organisations. The plan selects species and habitats from the 
UK list that are appropriate to Essex and also others of local 
conservation value, and details actions to be taken.  The EBAP 
currently contains action plans for the 25 species and 10 habitats.  The 
EBAP is currently being rewritten.  Essex Wildlife Trust has identified 
seven Living Landscape  areas either wholly or partly within the 
Borough.  All of these are situated close to the main growth locations 
and therefore will bring important landscape, biodiversity and 
recreational benefits for residents. The Council supports the 
development of Living Landscapes as a tool for addressing the issues 
of habitat loss and fragmentation at a landscape scale.  The first step is 
to develop clear visions with action plans setting out how the areas of 
biodiversity significance can be improved. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.126 The Thurrock Biodiversity Study 2006-2011  and Thurrock Biodiversity 
Action Plan 2007-2012  aims to conserve priority species and habitats 
in Thurrock.  This Biodiversity Action Plan identifies the key biodiversity 
habitats and species for Thurrock and aims to: 
 Raise awareness of Thurrock's important biodiversity species and 
habitats to the people of Thurrock.  
 Outline an action programme to help protect and enhance 
Thurrock's priority species and habitats.  
 Encourage developers and planners to integrate biodiversity 
improvements into new development. 
5.127 There are a mix of designated sites within the Borough including Sites 
of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) that are protected under the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.  Some of these are also protected 
under international legislation and agreements including Special 
Protection Areas that are protected under EC Directive on the 
conservation of wild birds (79/409/EEC) and Ramsar sites.  There are 
currently two Local Nature Reserves declared under the National Parks 
and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, with plans to declare further 
sites.   
 
CSTP19  - BIODIVERSITY  
Development will be encouraged to include measures to contribute positively 
to the overall biodiversity in the Borough.    
 
1. The Biodiversity Network 
The Council will create a robust network of ecological sites centring on the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
128 
 designated sites, i.e. SSSIs, SPAs, Ramsar, Local Nature Reserves and 
Local Wildlife Sites.  These sites will be safeguarded and enhanced to 
mitigate the effects of past habitat loss and fragmentation, development 
and climate change.   
 
2. Positive Biodiversity Management 
I. The Council will ensure that all designated sites are managed 
appropriately and will prepare suitable Biodiversity Management Plans, 
with partners, to demonstrate how positive management will be 
achieved.   
 
II. Buffering and extensions to existing sites and additional habitat will be 
sought through the adoption of appropriate Biodiversity Site 
Management Plans.   
 
III. Access will be balanced against biodiversity interest.  
 
3. Key Sites 
The Council has identified the following key sites that it will work with 
partners to enhance, and will pursue appropriate opportunities to increase 
the biodiversity network in the Borough.  
i. East Thurrock Marshes; 
ii. Mardyke Valley Project; 
iii. Local Wildlife Sites; and  
iv. Living Landscapes Sites. 
4. Climate Change and Habitat Loss 
The Council recognises the need for mitigation for habitat loss due to 
climate change. It supports the identification, through the Thames Estuary 
2100 project, of potential inter-tidal habitat creation sites at Fobbing 
Marshes and East Tilbury, and fresh water habitat creation sites at North 
Fobbing Marshes, South Fobbing Marshes, Tilbury and West Tilbury 
Marshes and the Mardyke.  
 
5. Biodiversity and Geodiversity Action Plans 
I. The Council is committed to delivering the actions set out within the 
Thurrock, Essex and UK Biodiversity Action Plans.  
 
II. The Council will promote small-scale biodiversity interventions such as 
green roofs.     
 
III. The Council supports the production and implementation of the 
Geodiversity Action Plans being developed by local 'geo' groups in 
Eastern England as part of the East of England Geodiversity Partnership.

 CSTP20 – OPEN SPACE  
 
Introduction  
 
5.128 Thurrock has a broad range of existing public open spaces, parks, and 
recreational areas, from Country Parks to amenity green spaces, with a 
range of equipped play spaces and natural play areas. These spaces 
provide varied opportunities for formal and informal active and passive 
recreation and make an important contribution to Thurrock’s Green 
Infrastructure and the Greengrid. Thurrock’s evidence base shows that 
there are a number of areas in the Borough that are deficient in good 
quality, accessible public open spaces.  
 
5.129 The open space policy will ensure a network of high quality, accessible 
public open spaces is provided, maintained and enhanced for the 
benefit of Thurrock’s residents, visitors and investors.   
 
5.130 A high quality, accessible and well-used open space network can: 
 improve social cohesion,  
 provide a sense of place, 
 provide a learning environment for adults and children,  
 encourage investment and local economic development,  
 improve the health and well-being of individuals and the community,  
 reduce opportunities for crime and the fear of crime; and  
 help protect and enhance the natural environment, its systems and 
the services it can offer. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.131 The Open Spaces Strategy 2006-2011 , which sits within the Thurrock 
Greengrid Strategy 2006-2011 , identifies a network of open spaces, 
many with heritage and biodiversity value.  The recommendations in 
the Open Spaces Strategy  will help Thurrock and external partners to 
deliver a network of high quality open space that will serve the whole 
community, now and in the future.   The Council’s Community Needs 
and Open Spaces Study (2005)  assesses open space including parks 
and gardens, amenity green spaces, children’s play space, allotments 
and community gardens.  The report sets out current provision levels, 
and confirms local deficits throughout the Borough.  It identifies a need 
to enhance existing open space provision to ensure that it meets the 
standards for quality, quantity and accessibility as set out in the Open 
Spaces Strategy 2006-2011 . 
 
CSTP20 – OPEN SPACE  
I. The Council will seek to ensure that a diverse range of accessible public 
open spaces, including natural and equipped play and recreational 
spaces is provided and maintained to meet the needs of the local 
community. 
 
II. New provision will be encouraged particularly to address areas of 
deficiency as identified in the Open Space Strategy.  Areas identified Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 include: 
i. Purfleet; 
ii. West Thurrock/Lakeside Basin; 
iii. Chafford Hundred; 
iv. South Chafford; 
v. Grays; 
vi. Parts of South Ockendon and Aveley; 
vii. North Stifford; 
viii. Parts of Chadwell St Mary; 
ix. Parts of Tilbury; 
x. Parts of Stanford–le-Hope; and 
xi. Horndon-on-the-Hill. 
 
III. Proposals for new development must ensure the adequate provision of a 
range of accessible, high quality open space, including natural and semi-
natural green space. Consideration must be given to the open space 
standards for open space provision within new developments set out in 
the Layout and Standards SPD and Appendix 5.    
 
IV. Wherever possible, open spaces should be identified, planned, designed 
and managed as areas that can perform multiple functions.  Functions to 
be considered in the planning, design and management of open spaces 
include: 
i. strategic functions (buffering and linkages); 
ii. biodiversity; 
iii. climate change mitigation and adaptation; 
iv. historic interest; 
v. urban quality; 
vi. health and well-being; 
vii. sustainable transport and movement; 
viii. productivity of land (food production, allotments);  
ix. community use (places for congregating and events) and 
x. visual amenity. 
 
V. The Council will work towards the achievement of Green Flag status for 
Thurrock’s public parks. 
 
Funding and Developer Contributions 
 
The Council and partners will require developer contributions and pursue 
opportunities for external funding for open space improvement through capital 
funding streams or via successful bids to other funding bodies.

131 
 CSTP21 – PRODUCTIVE LAND  
 
Introduction  
 
5.132 The landscape in Thurrock comprises a matrix of land uses and has 
been shaped by the underlying geology, hydrology, soil quality, 
woodland and agricultural practices.  As part of the multi-functional 
Green Infrastructure approach, it is recognised that land is a limited 
resource and as such, it is important to ensure a mix of appropriate 
uses that maximise productive use of land alongside other uses such 
as biodiversity sites and open space. The productive land policy will 
ensure the protection, conservation and enhancement of productive 
land and soil throughout the Borough. The policy seeks to ensure 
appropriate management, opportunities for food production in urban 
areas and to support the rural economy. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.133 The Thurrock Greengrid Strategy  emphasis the importance of 
recognising the economic value of food production, promoting local 
food production and distribution. 
 
CSTP 21 – PRODUCTIVE LAND  
The Council recognises the importance of food security and will ensure the 
protection, conservation and enhancement of agriculture, productive land and soil 
in the Borough. 
 
1. Ensuring appropriate land management 
I. The Council will promote the appropriate management and conservation of 
agricultural land and soil to address the changing climatic and economic 
environment anticipated in the future.  
 
II. Development of the best and most versatile land (DEFRA Grades 1, 2 and 3) 
will not be supported except in exceptional circumstances. Developers will 
need to demonstrate that: 
i. there is no suitable site in a sustainable location on land of poorer 
agricultural quality; or 
ii. alternative sites have greater value for their landscape, biodiversity, 
amenity, heritage or natural resources or are subject to other 
constraints such as flooding.  
 
III. The Council will take into account the importance and quality of agricultural 
land when considering land allocation for climate change 
adaptation/mitigation activities such as new fresh and salt-water habitat. 
 
2. Supporting productivity  
I. The Council, with its partners, will support the rural economy through: 
i. Recognising and promoting the economic value of local food 
production and distribution.  
ii. Promoting farming and local food co-operatives and supporting rural 
grant applications. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
132 
 iii. Promoting and encouraging the expansion of agri-environment 
schemes.  
iv. Maintaining and enhancing soil quality and resilience and optimising 
the areas where soil degradation has occurred.  
v. Encouraging energy-efficiency and renewable energy in agriculture. 
vi. Promoting sustainable water use.  
vii. Promoting woodland creation in appropriate places.  
 
3. Complementary uses 
I. The Council will encourage farm diversification where appropriate through the 
development of complementary small-scale businesses, which do not 
undermine nor degrade agricultural capacity. Businesses such as: 
i. Rural shops, pubs and services which contribute to maintaining the 
clusters of facilities serving the rural community; 
ii. Country pursuits that make a significant contribution to rural areas 
and have the potential to expand the leisure and tourism industry. 
 
II. The Council will support sustainable transport for rural access.  
 
4. Allotments and urban production 
I. The Council will support opportunities to engage residents in food production 
to increase education and awareness of healthy living. 
 
II. The Council will seek to identify opportunities for food production in urban 
areas including allotments, community gardens and orchards.   
 
III. Developers will be required to consider provision for allotments in new 
development in line with the standards in the Greengrid Strategy and 
Appendix 5. 
 
IV. Some areas of Thurrock have been identified as being deficient in quality 
sites for allotments.  The following allotment areas have been identified as 
sites for improvements to allotments: 
 
i. Anchor Field; ii. Bull Meadow; 
iii. Cromwell Road; iv. Thurloe Walk; 
v. Whitehall Lane; vi. West Road; 
vii. Adams Road; viii. Wharf Road; and 
ix. High Road.  
 
V. Where deficiencies exist in small-scale allotments in rural areas, the Council 
will identify potential sites and any improvements to these sites.

 CSTP22 – THURROCK DESIGN  
 
Introduction  
  
5.134 Good design is crucial to achieving Thurrock’s environmental, 
economic and social objectives, including enhancing the environment 
and improving the quality of life and the prospects of those who live in 
the Borough.  
 
5.135 The Council wants to promote an understanding of good design in 
Thurrock that extends beyond the quality of the architecture of 
individual buildings and encompasses the effect of development on the 
environment, character and quality of Thurrock as a whole. All 
development has the potential to contribute to the objectives of the 
Borough and should be designed to do so, integrating into and 
enhancing the Thurrock Greengrid, contributing to efforts to adapt to 
and mitigate climate change, contributing to the local economy and the 
quality of life of residents and delivering sustainable development 
throughout the Borough.     
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.136 Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation’s (TTGDC) 
Spatial Plan (2007 ) reiterates the Council’s commitment to promoting 
the success of Thurrock through development of high quality, which 
reinforces local community identities.  The Thames Gateway South 
Essex Partnership’s Delivering the Future (2003)  stresses the role of 
high quality design in the regeneration of the region.  
 
5.137 Thurrock Council has adopted the Essex Design Guide  (Essex County 
Council, 1997) as Supplementary Planning Guidance to inform the 
design of housing and covers such aspects as layout, landscaping, 
access, garaging and parking, services, building design and materials.  
Although some parts of this document have been superseded by 
subsequent policy documents, it provides a solid basis for design. 
 
5.138 This policy is informed by Thurrock Council’s Urban Character Study 
(2005),  which assesses the features of each settlement.  Volume 2 
(Design Exercises)  includes design case studies undertaken to inform 
the capacity estimates including four ‘design exemplar’ sites within 
Thurrock. The Council is preparing a Sustainability Checklist. Under 
the Sustainability Checklist, development over specific thresholds will 
be required to demonstrate social, environmental and economic 
elements have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Council.

134 
 CSTP22  – THURROCK DESIGN  
The Council will promote high quality design in Thurrock and will progress 
opportunities to improve the quality of the environment throughout the 
Borough and particularly in the Regeneration Areas and Key Strategic 
Employment Hubs.  
  
I. Development proposals must demonstrate high quality design founded 
on a thorough understanding of, and positive response to, the local 
context.  
 
II. The Council will promote a robust design process with the use of skilled 
designers so that proposals achieve the best balance of physical, social, 
economic and environmental outcomes. 
 
III. In particular, the Council requires developers to demonstrate that their 
proposals are designed to respect the distinct positive characteristics of 
areas within Thurrock, whether urban or rural, and create a sense of 
place within their schemes. 
 
IV. Development must provide a high standard of inclusive design so that it 
is accessible to all users. 
 
V. Development must be safe and secure in its design and contribute to 
community safety. 
 
VI. The Council will encourage distinctive new designs of high architectural 
quality in appropriate locations. 
 
VII. Development must embrace the use of high quality design including 
sustainable, renewable resources of energy and low-emissions 
technology, and enhance Green Infrastructure.  
 
VIII. The Council will require that developments address the particular 
sensitivities and capacity of the places within which they occur, including 
how adverse impacts are mitigated. 
 
Pre-application discussions with developers will be encouraged to help 
achieve the above and to ensure that the criteria set out in Policy PMD2 
Design and Layout and other related policies are met.   
 
The Council will provide further guidance on Thurrock’s design principles in 
the Design and Sustainability SPD.

 CSTP23 – THURROCK CHARACTER AND DISTINCTIVENESS 
 
Introduction   
 
5.139 The character of a place or area is derived from the recognisable and 
consistent patterns of natural, historic and built elements within it, 
which make it different or distinct from another place or area. Thurrock 
recognises that protecting and promoting the best elements of the 
Borough’s character and strengthening its sense of place provides 
benefits for community cohesion, the quality of life, and economic 
growth.   
 
5.140 Thurrock is broadly characterised into areas of coastal marshes, the 
Thames terrace, rolling hills and rural villages in the north and larger 
residential and industrial areas in the south and east. Thurrock’s 
landscape includes large scale landmarks and fragmented but highly 
valued areas of historic interest, biodiversity and amenity value. The 
resulting character is of surprising contrast and juxtaposition of local 
and micro-character areas.  
 
5.141 Thurrock’s proximity to London and its position as a transport gateway 
is reflected in its historical land-use features, as well as the existing 
pressures created by its busy road and rail network. The transport and 
energy infrastructures have resulted in the physical and visual 
subdivision of the Borough and significant decline in amenity and 
tranquillity values. Waste management and mineral working combined 
with incremental change in urban and rural areas has degraded the 
quality and cohesion of the Borough’s character.  
 
5.142 The requirement for increased housing in Thurrock exerts pressure on 
both the industrial river frontage of the Thames and the central swathe 
of rural Green Belt, while the transport agenda also remains central 
and will have major implications for the character and sense of place of 
the Borough.  Residential areas are subject to proposals for infill and 
backland development but some of these areas have distinctive 
characters which would be degraded by such development.  Thurrock 
character studies identify five broad types: Fenland, Rolling Farmland / 
Wooded Hills, Marsh, Urban Fringe and Urban which are distributed 
into 23 distinct landscape character areas, 14 urban character areas 
and 7 villages. The purpose of the policy is to ensure that the character 
of Thurrock is preserved and improved. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.143 The Urban Character Study (2005)  assesses the features of each 
settlement. Other Studies include, Thurrock Landscape Capacity Study 
(2005),  Essex County Council’s Thurrock Unitary Historic Environment 
Characterisation Study (2009) , Landscape Character Assessment and 
Thurrock Urban Character Study- Recognising the sense of place 
(2007).

136 
 5.144 Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation’s (TTGDC) 
Spatial Plan (2007)  reiterates the Council’s commitment to promoting 
the success of Thurrock through development of high quality, which 
reinforces local community identities.   
 
CSTP2 3 – THURROCK CHARACTER  AND DISTINCTIVENESS  
The Council will protect, manage and enhance the character of Thurrock to 
ensure improved quality and strengthened sense of place.  
 
I. The Council identifies the following key areas where character is a key 
issue: 
i. Regeneration Areas  
ii. Lakeside Basin 
iii. Strategic Employment Hubs 
iv. High volume transport networks 
v. Urban Fringe  
vi. Town/Village centres 
vii. Historically Sensitive Areas 
viii. Strategic Natural and Semi- Natural Spaces  
ix. Strategic Multifunctional Green Space 
x. Rural landscapes 
xi. Green Belt 
xii. Wooded Hills  
xiii. Residential Precincts comprising distinctly spacious residential 
areas and the intensively developed Homesteads ward 
xiv. Small scale sites where development may contribute to cumulative 
degradation. 
 
II. The Council requires the retention and enhancement of significant 
natural, historic and built features which contribute to the character of the 
Borough as defined by their value, quality, cultural association and 
meaning or their relationship to the setting and local context. 
  
III. The Council requires the retention and enhancement of strategic and 
local views, which contribute to a distinctive sense of place.  Where 
development will affect these views, their sensitivity and capacity for 
change must be adequately assessed and the effect of the development 
on them appropriately tested.    
 
In order to assess the sensitivity and capacity for change of Thurrock’s 
character, the Council will require an assessment based on The Guidelines 
for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment , or other methodology 
supported by the Council.  
 
The Council will provide further guidance in the Design and Sustainability 
SPD.

 CSTP24 – HERITAGE ASSETS AND THE HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT  
 
Introduction  
 
5.145 The Council is committed to preserving or enhancing Thurrock’s 
historic environment, in accordance with the wishes of the community 
and other stakeholders as determined through consultation.  Thurrock’s 
historic environment includes a range of heritage assets: 
    
 The significant surviving historic urban fabric of the towns and other 
settlements.  
 The cohesive hierarchy of smaller settlements ranging from 
nucleated villages, often marked by architecturally significant 
medieval parish churches, through a pattern of dispersed hamlets 
and isolated farms.  
 The historic coastal zone, which includes extensive submerged 
prehistoric landscapes, ancient salt manufacturing and fishing 
facilities, the relict sea walls of grazing marshes and ancient ports.  
 The outstanding regional and nationally important defence and 
military coastal fortifications, which reflect the strategic importance 
of the Thames Estuary, including Tilbury Fort and Coalhouse Fort.  
The former is of international significance.   
 Formal planned settlements of the early twentieth century including 
the factory village of Bata at East Tilbury.  
 Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings and historic parks and 
gardens, including both their fabric and their settings.  
 Rural landscapes as identified in English Heritage’s Historic 
Landscape Characterisation Study (2004), Thurrock’s Landscape 
Capacity Study (2005) and Essex County Council’s Thurrock 
Unitary Historic Environment Characterisation Project (2009).  
 Ancient woodland, hedgerows and trees.  
 Wide variety of archaeological monuments, sites and buried 
deposits which include many ancient monuments and other 
nationally important archaeological assets.  
 Extensive buried historic landscape of multi-period date known from 
aerial photography.   
 
5.146 Heritage assets are not only important in their own right but have a 
valuable role in helping to create a sense of place and links to the 
historic development of the distinct areas within Thurrock.  Heritage 
assets often have an important cultural and economic role, as they can 
attract visitors and can act as catalysts for development and 
regeneration. These assets also have considerable importance as part 
of the Greengrid, with larger features forming key visitor destinations.  
It is important, therefore, that the settings of heritage assets are 
preserved or enhanced and access to them is secured.  The purpose 
of the policy is to prevent the loss, protect and achieve the broader 
benefits, of these important local heritage assets to the Borough and to 
the wider historic environment. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.147  Thurrock contains a number of important historic assets including:  
 7 Conservation Areas;  
 241 entries in the List of Buildings of Special Architectural or 
Historic Interest; 
 16 Scheduled Ancient Monuments;   
 1 listing on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Interest;  
 23 Ancient woodlands; and  
 1095 Archaeological records on the Historic Environment Record. 
 
5.148 Between 2007 and 2009, the Council adopted Character Appraisals 
and Management Proposals  for each of the seven Conservation Areas 
in the Borough.  The Character Appraisals evaluate the Conservation 
Areas’ special interest and significance, and the Management 
Proposals set out how the areas will be preserved and enhanced.  The 
Council will review Character Appraisals at least every five years to 
ensure that they are fit for their purpose of preserving and enhancing 
the Borough’s heritage assets. 
  
5.149 The Council aims to review the Thurrock Heritage at Risk Register  
annually, to identify the Borough’s Listed Buildings in need of repair 
and/or maintenance.  The register informs bids for grant funding, and 
work with developers, when relevant planning applications come 
forward.  The Council will also prepare a local list of heritage assets . In 
2009, the Council also commissioned a Historic Environment 
Characterisation Project of Thurrock which highlights the sensitivity and 
importance of the Council’s historic environment.

ii. Ensure that the setting of Coalhouse Fort is appropriately 
protected from development and that its fabric is conserved.   
iii. Resist development that undermines an understanding of the 
role the river Thames has played in the historic development 
of Thurrock. 
iv. Promote public access between Tilbury Fort and Coalhouse 
Fort through riverside links.    
v. Ensure that any new development close to, or within, Bata 
Village or the Bata Factory complex is well designed and 
contributes positively to their settings.   
vi. Ensure that Thurrock’s historic landscapes, and the 
contribution made to them by ancient woodland, hedgerows 
and trees, are appropriately considered in all development 
proposals.

 CSTP25 – ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE  
 
Introduction  
 
5.150 Whilst climate change has been identified as one of the most important 
challenges we face as a global community, it may also have severe 
repercussions on a local level in Thurrock. Rises in sea level from 
partial melting of large ice masses could lead to widespread flooding. 
Climate change could also lead to higher local temperatures, stronger 
winds, significant changes in rainfall, and increases in coastal and soil 
erosion, all of which will have impacts on Thurrock’s economy, 
environment and population. Without substantial reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, local and global climates may 
continue to change. Planning for adaptation to the impacts of climate 
change and reducing vulnerability to these impacts is equally as 
important as climate change mitigation measures. Adaptation involves 
adjustments to natural or human systems in response to actual or 
expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or 
exploits beneficial opportunities.2 
 
5.151 As referenced in Policy CSTP22– Thurrock Design, new developments 
in Thurrock provide an opportunity to promote new techniques in 
design and renewable energy. To achieve this, the Council will:  
 
 Secure the use of sustainable construction techniques; 
 Develop guidance on sustainable construction and design for the 
construction of any new facilities; 
 Enable increase of sustainable construction, design and renewable 
energy in new housing and industrial development; 
 Reduce waste and carbon emissions; encourage better use of 
water and energy; and reduce environmental impact and increase 
efficiency of construction industry; 
 Reduce our impact and increase our preparedness for climate 
change;  
 Develop an action plan to improve energy efficiency in existing 
communities, and 
 Promote and support climate change adaptation measures through 
the use of green infrastructure.  
 
5.152 This policy covers the overarching issues for mitigation and adaptation 
of climate change in order to meet National and Local Area Agreement 
targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions and adapting to 
withstand and minimise the impacts of climate change. 
 
5.153 The Climate Change Act (2008)  sets challenging but achievable targets 
for net UK carbon emissions, to reduce emissions to at least 80% lower 
than the 1990 baseline by 2050, with a reduction of at least 26% by 
2020.  The NPPF indicates that Planning plays a key role in helping 
shape places to secure radical reductions in greenhouse gas

 emissions, minimising vulnerability and providing resilience to the 
impacts of climate change and supporting the delivery of renewable 
and low carbon energy and associated infrastructure.  
 
5.154 In 2003, the East of England Sustainable Development Roundtable 
commissioned Living with Climate Change in the East of England to 
determine the regional impacts of climate change. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.155 The Sustainable Community Strategy (Thurrock LSP, 2009 ) advocates 
for more homes and businesses with reduced carbon emissions and 
for Thurrock to be better prepared for the impact of climate change. 
This is reiterated by A Sustainable Framework for Thurrock  (Thurrock 
Council, 2007), which promotes the highest standards of sustainable 
construction and the Code for Sustainable Homes.  In June 2007, the 
Council signed up to the Nottingham Declaration on Climate Change, 
committing to various actions including reducing CO 2; developing plans 
with partners to address the causes and impacts of climate change; 
assessing risks; and monitoring progress. These will be further 
expanded in the Thurrock Climate Change Strategy , which is 
anticipated to be adopted by 2011.  This will set out how the Council 
will lead by example by managing its own properties and providing 
services to residents, linking to priorities in the LAA and the Council’s 
Corporate Plan.   
 
5.156 The Thurrock Climate Change Evidence Base sets out the issues and 
opportunities surrounding climate change at a local level.  This analysis 
found that Thurrock is particularly vulnerable to water resource 
deficiencies, sea level changes, fluvial flooding and is also likely to be 
at risk from subsidence. This confirms that new development must be 
designed to cope with a changing climate, to protect those who utilise 
development and to protect investment.  Retrofitting existing 
development and infrastructure to adapt to climate change will also be 
essential for minimising the impacts of climate change on society and 
the economy. Based on the evidence, the following have been 
identified as priorities for Thurrock to consider in relation to strategic 
climate change action:  
 Reducing CO 2 and N 2O emissions from the industrial and 
commercial sector, particularly from gas and electricity 
consumption;   
 Reducing CO 2 and N 2O emissions from road transport, particularly 
from diesel freight vehicles and the workplace commuter;   
 Reducing methane emissions from the waste sector, particularly 
from landfill;   
 Increasing renewable and low carbon energy generation;   
 Ensuring that new development incorporates energy and water 
efficiency into design;   
 Ensuring new build developments incorporate climate change 
‘resistant’ features to minimise vulnerability;  Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
143 
  Ensuring that new vulnerable development is not at risk of flooding; 
and   
 Reducing flood risk at existing development.   
 
Thurrock Council’s Local Climate Impact Profile  (October 2010) will 
support this policy and inform the forthcoming Design and 
Sustainability SPD.      
 
CSTP2 5 – ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE  
1. Adaptation  
I. The Council will require climate change adaptation measures and 
technology to be considered from the outset in any development 
proposal including reduction of emissions, renewable and low carbon 
technologies, passive design, recycling and waste minimisation, and 
through the application of green infrastructure techniques. 
 
II. The Council will work to ensure that vulnerability to climate change 
impacts is minimised in new development, and that such development 
does not increase vulnerability to climate change impacts.  
 
III. The location and layout of new buildings should minimise vulnerability 
to climate change.  
 
IV. Developers must consider the potential effects of climate change on 
their development, including:  
i. Water conservation and drainage 
ii. Need for summer cooling 
iii. Risk of subsidence 
iv. Flood risk from tidal, fluvial and surface water 
 
2. Mitigation 
I. The Council will require new and existing development and associated 
activities to adhere to local, regional and national targets for reducing 
carbon emissions.  
 
II. The Council will seek the achievement and maintenance of the 
following minimum reductions in CO2 emissions compared to 
emissions in 2005:- 
 
Sector  
 By 2015  By 2020  
Domestic: CO2 per household 
 4.0% 5.8% 
Road Transport: CO2 per AADT* 6.0% 6.5% 
Business: CO2 per job 9.0% 11.3% 
*Annual Average Daily Traffic 
 
III. The Council will employ innovative methods of reducing and mitigating 
emissions, including the introduction of a Carbon Offset Fund.

 CSTP26 - RENEWABLE OR LOW-CARBON ENERGY 
GENERATION 
 
Introduction 
 
5.157 Renewable energy covers those energy flows that occur naturally and 
repeatedly in the environment. Low-carbon technologies are those that 
can help reduce carbon emissions. It also includes energy for heating 
and cooling as well as generating electricity.  
 
5.158 Thurrock is performing relatively well in terms of renewable energy with 
52.6 MW of installed capacity. Thurrock currently contains 54% of the 
county’s and 11% of the region’s renewable energy generating 
capacity (2008). The majority of renewable energy in Thurrock (76%) is 
derived from utilising landfill gas, with the remaining 24% provided by a 
biomass facility at Tilbury Power Station.  Power stations in Thurrock 
currently generate over 1,800 MW of energy for homes around Britain, 
but they are also the largest point source emitters of CO 2. Encouraging 
the conversion of existing power stations or new renewable energy or 
low-carbon development should work to reduce CO 2 emissions from 
these point sources and also from industrial, commercial and domestic 
energy consumption. 
 
5.159 Thurrock presents unique opportunities for encouraging additional 
standalone, large-scale renewable or low-carbon energy generation 
projects. For example, Tilbury Green Power has consent for a site in 
the Port of Tilbury for a 60MW facility using a mix of imported biomass 
and household waste. If this facility were to come forward, Thurrock’s 
renewable energy generation would more than double. In addition 
small-scale energy generation technology can be promoted as ancillary 
to other uses such as residential, commercial and community.   
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
5.160 The Thurrock Climate Change Evidence Base (2008) sets out the 
issues surrounding climate change at a local level, and notes the 
opportunities for increasing renewable energy supply, particularly 
through the Local Development Framework and the proposal for a 
large scale renewable facility at Tilbury.

 CSTP 2 6- RENEWABLE OR LOW -CARBON ENERGY GENERATION  
As part of the shift to lo w-carbon future and to tackle climate change, the 
Council will encourage opportunities to generate energy from non-fossil fuel 
and low-carbon sources.  
I. The Council will promote and facilitate proposals for centralised 
renewable or low-carbon energy schemes at appropriate locations and 
standards, including but not exclusively at Tilbury and London Gateway. 
 
II. The Council will promote the delivery of renewable and low-carbon 
energy developments utilising technology such as solar panels, biomass 
heating, small-scale wind turbine, photovoltaic cells, Combined Heat and 
Power and other methods.  
 
III. The Council will promote the delivery of district energy networks in 
appropriate locations, in order to increase the proportion of energy 
delivered from renewable and low-carbon sources in the Borough. 
 
IV. The Council will ensure that effort is made to achieve a significant carbon 
reduction in all new development, at least matching the national targets.  
 
The Council will view an application as unacceptable where it produces a 
significant adverse impact that cannot be mitigated , including cumulative 
landscape or visual impacts.

 CSTP27 – MANAGEMENT AND REDUCTION OF FLOOD RISK 
 
Introduction 
 
5.161 A large proportion of Thurrock’s urban areas are located within Flood 
Zone 3, translating to approximately 11,000 properties currently at risk 
of flooding. The changing climate, combined with increased 
development pressures, will continue to make flood risk a key 
consideration for the Borough into the future. 
 
5.162 In relation to flood risk the primary aim of the NPPF is to ensure that 
flood risk is taken into account at all stages in the planning process in 
order to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding, 
and wherever possible, to direct development towards areas at least 
risk of flooding. This is achieved through the application of the 
Sequential Test. 
 
5.163 An updated Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) was completed 
in September 2009 and assesses all forms of flooding relevant to the 
Borough. This confirms that the majority of Thurrock Urban Area is 
classified as Flood Zone 3a, the high risk flood zone, with some areas 
of Flood Zone 3b, the functional floodplain, associated with the main 
rivers (River Mardyke and Stanford Brook) and the Flood Storage Area 
designated under the Reservoirs Act 1975 in the marshes immediately 
to the north of Tilbury. 
 
5.164 The tidal floodplain associated with the River Thames is considered to 
be defended from tidal flooding to the 1 in 1000 year standard including 
climate change. The SFRA therefore concludes that the greatest flood 
risk posed to the Borough would result from the residual risk 
associated with a failure of those defences during an extreme tidal 
event. This residual risk has also been assessed in the Thurrock SFRA 
and includes the identification and classification of areas of flood 
hazard and also the times to inundation in the event of a breach of the 
defences. 
 
5.165 The SFRA will be periodically reviewed and updated when necessary 
to keep pace with policy changes and new climate change guidance. 
 
5.166 Core Strategy policies CSSP1 to CSSP5 identify the 5 Broad Areas for 
Regeneration within the Borough, these have all been subject to the 
Sequential Test.  Future site allocations will be subject to a more 
detailed Sequential Test  in accordance with the NPPF. 
 
5.167 Due to the location of the main settlements in Thurrock and the nature 
of flood risk in the Borough, it has not been possible to locate all new 
development in areas of least flood risk.  The NPPF therefore requires 
the application of the Exception Test which will ensure that proposed 
development will deliver sustainability benefits to the whole community, 
makes effective use of land and can be achieved safely without Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
149 
 increasing flood risk elsewhere, and where possible, reduces flood risk 
overall. 
 
5.168 In achieving the final part of the Exception Test at a strategic level, it 
will be essential to employ effective floodplain management through 
working with partner organizations, such as the Environment Agency 
and the Emergency Services, to deliver strategic flood management 
plans and programmes, and in the production of a comprehensive 
Emergency Plan for the Borough.  
 
5.169 Of particular importance to Thurrock will be the Thames Estuary 2100 
(TE2100) Plan, produced by the Environment Agency to provide a 
flood risk management plan for London and the Thames Estuary into 
the next century. The plan is due to be submitted to Defra in the first 
quarter of 2010 and will recommend what flood risk management 
actions will need to be introduced and when over the next century. It is 
designed to be adaptable to a changing climate, even if climate change 
accelerates beyond current predictions. 
 
5.170 The TE2100 Plan has divided Thurrock into four Policy Management 
Units (PMUs) covering Shellhaven and Fobbing Marshes; East Tilbury 
and Mucking Marshes; Purfleet, Grays and Tilbury; Rainham Marshes 
and the Mardyke. 
 
5.171 In the east of the Borough the TE2100 Plan highlights that defences 
should be maintained to their current level into the future, although this 
would result in an increase in flood risk over time as sea-levels rise due 
to the impacts of climate change. Opportunities in these areas to 
manage the floodplain through effective land-use and emergency 
planning, as well as making space for water must therefore be sought. 
 
5.172 To the west of the Borough the TE2100 Plan highlights that more 
action should be taken to keep up with the impacts of climate change. 
This would most likely be achieved through a combination of floodplain 
management techniques as described above, and also maintaining, 
and where possible improving, flood defences (subject to funding and 
approval).  
 
5.173 The continued reliance on flood defences has implications for the 
biodiversity of the Borough due to the exacerbated threat of coastal 
squeeze. A range of flood risk management options should therefore 
be employed across the Borough to mitigate for this and opportunities 
to make space for water and recreate those habitats threatened or lost 
through coastal squeeze should be sought. 
 
5.174 The South Essex Catchment Flood Management Plan identifies that, 
other than the residual flood risk associated with tidal sources, surface 
water flooding is also an issue for the Thurrock area. It is usually 
associated with heavy rainfall over a short period of time, particularly 
when the ground is already saturated or when flow channels become 
blocked or tide-locked. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
150 
  
5.175 The flood risk posed by surface water will be addressed in the Thurrock 
Surface Water Management Plan which will be undertaken following 
the completion of the Thurrock Water Cycle Study. 
 
CSTP27 – MANAGEMENT AND REDUCTION OF FLOOD RISK  
I. The Council will ensure that flood risk management is implemented and 
supported through effective land use planning. The Sequential, and 
where necessary Exception Test, as set out in the NPPF and associated 
Planning Practice Guidance will be employed when allocating sites for 
development and an Emergency Plan for the Borough will be completed.  
 
II. The Council will also continue to work collaboratively with the 
Environment Agency by supporting the area based policy approach 
adopted in the Thames Estuary 2100 Project. In particular the Council 
will seek to safeguard existing flood defences and new areas for flood 
defences, water storage and drainage areas, as well as seeking 
secondary defences for key assets. 
 
III. The Council will support the work of the Environment Agency in the 
Environmental Enhancement Project for the Mucking Flats and Marshes 
to ensure the delivery of appropriate flood mitigation and environmental 
enhancement measures.  
 
IV. The Council will work with the Environment Agency and other main 
stakeholders to ensure that fluvial and surface water flood risk is 
managed within Thurrock. This will include supporting the policies 
identified in the South Essex Catchment Flood Management Plan, such 
as identifying and safeguarding areas of land for existing and future 
areas of water storage in Policy Units 9, 10, 11 & 12 and in formulating 
System Asset Management Plans (SAMP) and the Integrated Urban 
Drainage Plans for Stanford-le-Hope, Tilbury and Purfleet.  A Surface 
Water Management Plan will also be carried out to assist in the 
identification and mapping of areas susceptible to surface water flooding 
as recommended by Defra and the Pitt Review. Development proposals 
that will affect these locations will be expected to contribute towards 
infrastructure improvements , including where appropriate green 
infrastructure, in these locations to enable the development to proceed. 
 
V. The Council will ensure that, where necessary, new development 
throughout the Borough contains space for water including naturalisation 
and environmental enhancement.   
 
VI. Developers will be required to incorporate sustainable drainage systems 
as a priority and to contribute towards flood risk management 
infrastructure where appropriate. 
 
VII. Planning applications received for sites within Flood Zone 3 will be 
treated in accordance with the NPPF, this policy and Policy PMD15.

Implementation Mechanisms 
 
5.176 Less vulnerable development might therefore be permitted on 
previously developed land in Flood Zone 3a.  More vulnerable 
development may also be permitted in areas identified as Flood Zone 
3a, but will be subject to the Exception Test, as outlined in the NPPF. 
Essential infrastructure will also be required to pass the Exception Test 
in both Flood Zone 3a and 3b. Highly vulnerable development will not 
normally be permitted in Flood Zone 3a in accordance with NPPF. All 
development within a flood zone must apply the NPPF Sequential Test 
and it must be shown that there are no other sites where the proposed 
development can be situated within a lower risk flood zone. 
 
Infrastructure Delivery

 CSTP28 - RIVER THAMES 
 
Introduction 
 
5.178 The River Thames plays a vital role in the region’s economy because 
of the ports, current and planned power stations at Tilbury, and the 
freight links.  Tilbury is currently the busiest port on the river, and there 
will be the new deep sea container port at London Gateway. The river 
is also important as a natural habitat including a Ramsar site and 
important riverscape including heritage assets such as Coalhouse and 
Tilbury forts.  
 
5.179 This policy sets out the basis for assessing the suitability of riverside 
development proposals, and for improving accessibility and 
recreational activities along the Thurrock riverside, balanced against 
the need for environmental protection. The Council will work 
collaboratively with relevant stakeholder organisations and agencies to 
ensure the delivery of a balanced approach to the Thurrock riverside.  
 
5.180 A key feature of the Thames Gateway Parklands Vision (2008) is to 
improve the river setting, its environment and landscape, and make it 
more accessible and visible for people.  This is also reflected in 
Delivering the Future by the Thames Gateway South Essex 
Partnership which promotes bringing the natural environment closer to 
communities through development of a Greengrid.  People can 
currently interact with the Thames ‘riverscape’ in a variety of ways, 
such as enjoying walks on the various nature trails.  However, much of 
the river and its landscape are not easily accessible or visible, both of 
which are important to define the area’s identity.  For operational 
reasons, many of the industrial complexes and port areas are fenced 
in, posing significant obstacles to permeability along the river edges. 
 
Thurrock Riverside Opportunities 
 
5.181 The Sustainability Appraisal  (December 2007) and representations on 
earlier stages of the Core Strategy recommended that efforts may be 
needed to address the apparent conflict between some of the preferred 
policy approaches such as biodiversity, public access to the river, and 
the upgrading and operation of ports. In addition it raised the important 
issue of protecting Thurrock’s historical assets and their setting. There 
was strong support for improved access, through delivery of the 
Greengrid, though caveated by the need to ensure compatibility with 
industry’s operational needs. It was also suggested that priority should 
be given to allocating riverside sites to uses that require access to the 
river frontage. 
 
5.182 So whilst industry and the large tracts of industrial landscape should be 
safeguarded and promoted to support the regeneration of Thurrock 
riverside in the broadest sense, the river and its setting needs to be 
accessible and visible, capitalising on the landscape and environmental Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 improvements that will be realised for the future through the policies in 
this Core Strategy. 
 
CSTP28 – RIVER THAMES  
I. The Council and Partners will ensure that the  economic and commercial 
function of the river will continue to be promoted through: 
 
i. Priority being given to allocating riverside development sites to uses 
that require access to the river frontage, especially those which 
promote use of the river for passenger transportation purposes. 
ii. Safeguarding port-related operational land. 
iii. Safeguarding additional adjacent land required for further port 
development, including expansion. For port development onto 
additional land to be acceptable however, it will be necessary to 
substantiate the need for it over and above land that is already 
available for operational port uses. 
iv. To safeguard existing and promote new jetties and wharves facilities 
where appropriate for transport of goods and materials. 
 
II. New development will provide new or enhanced sustainable, safe and 
equitable access to and along the river foreshore, especially using 
natural and semi-natural corridors and other elements of the Greengrid. 
 
III. Development Proposals will be required to undertake appropriate level of 
flood risk assessment as set out by the  NPPF and take account of the 
need for flood mitigation measures and to accommodate any necessary 
flood defence measures. 
 
IV. New development will also maintain or enhance views, particularly of key 
features including heritage and landscapes, and will improve recreational 
interaction with the river and its setting. Critical elements include: 
 
i. The Thames Path through Thurrock, a designated National Trail.  
ii. National Cycle Network Route 13, which overlaps with the 
Thames Path through much of Thurrock. 
iii. Safeguarding of strategic and locally important views. 
 
V. The following exceptions to this may apply: 
 
i. Where industrial/commercial development requires use of the 
river and its foreshore and needs to restrict public access for 
operational or safety reasons. 
ii. Where unrestricted public access is likely to result in 
unacceptable adverse impacts on riverside habitat or 
biodiversity. 
 
In both cases, reasons for access restrictions will need to be substantiated 
and justified with supporting evidence. In addition, the expectation will be that 
opportunities will still be sought to enable views of the river and its setting, 
such as through the design of development.

 CSTP 29 – WASTE STRATEGY 
 
Introduction 
 
5.183 As a unitary authority Thurrock must plan for the management of waste 
by setting the planning framework for an adequate supply of waste 
treatment and disposal facilities. Those facilities must enable the 
Borough to be self sufficient in the way it manages its own waste and 
contribute to the management of a reducing proportion of wastes from 
London. 
 
5.184 Although the emphasis will be on reducing waste at source, re-use and 
recycling wherever possible, Thurrock must still find new and 
alternative methods to manage and dispose of remaining waste 
arisings. This is because European and national legislation requires a 
reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill sites by applying 
alternative waste management methods.  
 
5.185 In meeting this change, Thurrock is required to plan for waste 
management provision. Policy CSTP29 sets out Thurrock’s strategic 
approach toward planning for the additional waste management 
capacity throughout the Plan period and sets the strategic planning 
policy context for site allocations within the Minerals and Waste 
Development Plan Document (MWDPD).  
 
5.186 Planning Policy Statement 10 – Planning for Sustainable Waste 
Management (PPS10) provides the overarching policy framework for 
planning for waste management facilities. The aim of PPS10 is to 
achieve more sustainable methods of waste management. A waste 
planning strategy will be delivered for Thurrock which achieves the 
sustainable management of waste in accordance with the requirements 
of PPS10, the UK Government Sustainable Development Strategy and 
the 2007 Waste Strategy. 
 
5.187 PPS10 advises opportunities should be sought to identify suitable 
locations for new waste management facilities on existing waste 
management sites; industrial sites and previously developed land. 
PPS10 recognises that some waste facilities are, in exceptional 
circumstances, acceptable in the Green Belt. Thurrock Council’s 
approach is that, although landfill may be required as part of an agreed 
and necessary restoration scheme of a mineral working, there will 
continue to be a presumption against ‘permanent’ waste management 
facilities within the Green Belt except small scale facilities serving a 
defined local need where no suitable sites outside the Green Belt are 
available. The Council will primarily identify sites and permit proposals 
for waste management outside the Green Belt. 
 
5.188 Policy WM1 of the RSS, sets out the overall vision, objectives and 
capacity requirements for the provision of waste management facilities 
in the region. A number of key themes are apparent, including the 
timely and adequate delivery of waste facilities required for the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 recovery and disposal of the region’s waste and for  reducing quantities 
of wastes imported into the region; minimising the impact of waste 
management development; viewing waste as a resource; encouraging 
community support and participation in promoting responsible waste 
behaviour; maximising re-use, composting and recycling whilst 
responding positively to managing the residual waste and recognising 
the particular location needs of waste management proposals. 
 
5.189 RSS Policy WM2 sets waste management targets which must be 
adopted by all authorities in the region to minimise waste and to 
provide the basis for implementing the overall aim of recycling, 
composting and recovering value from waste.  Targets in Policy WM2 
are to be kept under review and extended to the end of the Plan period 
(2021) and beyond. There is also an ongoing review of the RSS until 
2011. 
 
5.190 The RSS Policy WM3 provides for imported wastes and requires 
Thurrock to plan for the management of an apportionment of waste 
from London of 210,000 tonnes per annum by 2010/11 and 100,000 
tonnes per annum from 2015/16.  Annual tonnages are set in appendix 
C of the RSS. The draft Revision of the RSS to 2031 included reduced 
annual imports of London waste to Thurrock from London of 190,000 
tonnes by 2010/11, 68,000 tonnes by 2020/21 and 9,000 tonnes by 
2031. Thurrock Council has included the revised RSS waste tonnages 
for waste imported into Thurrock from London up to 2026 as the 
evidence base for the policy approach in the Core Strategy. 
 
5.191 The RSS Policy WM4 outlines that each WPA must plan for self 
sufficiency in the management of their own waste arisings by planning 
for additional capacity. RSS Policy WM4 outlines the main strategic 
principle for the management of waste produced within each sub-
region. In developing waste policies and considering waste proposals, 
waste planning authorities should take responsibility for waste arisings 
within their administrative boundaries. Thurrock Council has adopted 
the principle of self sufficiency of managing its own waste arisings in 
the policy approach of the Core Strategy.  
 
5.192 The adopted RSS set out the quantities of waste to be managed 
including a proportion of London’s waste. The review RSS evidence 
base has provided what is considered to be more valid and up to date 
waste tonnages and indicates lower quantities of MSW, C&I and 
London Waste imports to be planned for in the region and for Thurrock. 
The apportionment set by the RSS is currently under review and where 
WPAs are confident they have more local and up-to-date information, 
there is an opportunity to present this as an evidential alternative to the 
apportionment contained in the RSS. Thurrock has undertaken its own 
study of waste management arisings and capacity requirements for the 
authority area based on the more recent RSS Review figures but 
adjusted to take account of the higher dwelling numbers and 
employment profile set out in this Core Strategy.

Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
Municipal Waste Strategy for Thurrock 2008-2020 
 
5.193 PSS10 requires the Core Strategy to inform and take account of a 
relevant municipal waste management strategy.  As a unitary authority, 
Thurrock is responsible for both the collection and disposal of 
municipal solid waste, as well as being the waste planning authority. 
The Municipal Waste Strategy for Thurrock 2008-2020 provides 
information on municipal waste management in Thurrock and informed 
the preparation of this Core Strategy. 
 
5.194 The MWMS sets out 6 key aims for a long-term municipal waste 
strategy, namely: 
 
 Deliver the principles of the waste hierarchy; 
 Deliver the diversion of bio-degradable municipal waste from 
landfill; 
 Ensure that Thurrock recycles enough material to comply with 
statutory recycling targets; 
 Ensure that Thurrock recovers sufficient value from residual waste 
to comply with statutory recovery targets; 
 Ensure that any procurement activities are in line with best value 
principles and achieve efficiency savings; and 
 Work towards achieving top quartile positioning with respect to 
waste management provision in the UK. 
 
Other Evidence 
 
Waste Arisings and Capacity Study for Thurrock  
 
5.195 A study to assess the existing waste arisings, capacity and need for 
additional waste facilities in Thurrock for the period 2006-2021 was 
undertaken by Environment Resource Management (ERM) in 2007 
with updates in 2009 and 2010 (‘the study’). The study provides an 
assessment of the capacity of existing and planned waste 
management infrastructure in Thurrock and, where not provided for in 
the RSS, forms the evidence base for the required additional waste 
management capacity for a range of waste streams. 
 
5.196 The study identifies different possible growth scenarios for all waste 
streams including Municipal Solid Waste (MSW); Commercial and 
Industrial (C&I); Hazardous Waste and Construction and Demolition 
(C&D) waste.  
 
5.197 The 2010 update to the Waste Arisings and Capacity Study has further 
assessed capacity taking into account the use of the evidence base of 
the draft Revision RSS and amendments to the C&D site data, arisings 
and capacity. This study forms the basis of revised arisings and 
capacity tonnages for the Core Strategy and future reviews. The 2010 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
159 
 update has also assessed MSW and C&I waste arisings based on the 
recent RSS Review figures but taking into account the higher dwelling 
numbers and more local assessment of the employment profile 
reflected in the Core Strategy. This latter scenario is set out as the 
evidence to support the top end capacity to be planned for in the Core 
Strategy and indicates higher MSW and C&I arisings. The capacity 
requirements over the period of the plan will be monitored and 
reviewed to take account of the level of development during the plan 
period and any review of future data.  
 
Municipal Solid Waste 
 
5.198 According to the draft revision RSS evidence base, the total MSW 
arising in Thurrock in 2009/10 was 75,000 tonnes. Table 5 illustrates 
the estimated growth in MSW over the Plan period taken from 
Appendix C of the draft revision RSS and also the higher level scenario 
of arisings to take account of the levels of growth set out in the Core 
Strategy.

growth.

and 22% spread on exempt sites. The proportional split has been 
revised in the Thurrock 2010 study to take account of higher recycling 
targets and less generous exemptions under the environmental 
permitting regulations during the plan period.

5.202 Policy CSTP31 sets out the Council’s position on encouraging greater 
recycling and re-use of C&D waste. Therefore recycling rates are 
expected to increase over the Plan period. This will be considered in 
the approach for additional C&D recycling capacity and the need for 
sites in the MWDPD. 
 
5.203 The revised 2010 Thurrock Study on waste arisings and capacity 
estimates, has taken into account the principle of increasing the 
amount of recycled aggregates and soil to achieve up to 70% recycling 
by 2021 in accordance with the Waste Framework Directive 
2008/98/EC.

 Hazardous Waste 
 
5.204 Policy WM7 of the RSS identifies the current regional approach toward 
the provision of hazardous waste management capacity. It is 
recognised there is a deficit in hazardous waste management capacity 
throughout the region. At this time there are no provisions for additional 
hazardous waste capacity made at the regional or sub-regional levels.  
 
5.205 However, WPAs are required to consider the possible provision of 
hazardous waste capacity, where it contributes to the delivery for waste 
arising in the region. The draft Revision RSS stated WPA’s should 
identify suitable sites for Stable Non-Reactive Hazardous Waste Cells.  
The Thurrock study considered 5 growth scenarios and Table 9 
provides the highest growth scenario based on economic growth.

Current Capacity and Gap Analysis 
 
5.206 The Thurrock Waste Arising and Capacity Studies (2009 and 2010) 
identified the current waste management capacity within Thurrock for 
each waste management method. 
 
Recycling and Composting 
 
5.207 Currently there is 24,250  tonnes per annum of combined MSW and 
C&I waste recycling and composting capacity and 547,400 tonnes of 
C&D recycling capacity. 
 
5.208 The level of recycling and composting capacity currently operational, 
including that with permission but non-operational, is insufficient to deal 
with the combined MSW and C&I waste arisings forecasts. Based on 
the 2010 study, the current combined deficit is estimated to be within 
the range between 46,200 to 53,733 tonnes per annum and by the end 
of the Plan period within the range between 142,400 to 159,000 tonnes 
per annum. This is expressed as a range of higher levels of recycling. 
The actual amount of recycling capacity required will be dependent on 
the proportion of recycling compared to other forms of recovery that 
may be available.   
 
5.209 There is a current surplus in C&D recycling capacity within Thurrock. 
However with the loss of temporary facilities associated with former 
quarries/landfill sites facilities, and through redevelopment, Thurrock 
will fall short of fixed site recycling capacity by 2015/16 and by the end 
of the plan period this deficit is estimated to be 250,000  tonnes per 
annum in the worst case scenario.  However in practise this deficit will 
be reduced by the extent of recycling carried out on development sites.   Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
162 
  
Recovery 
 
5.210 There is at 2010 no operational treatment recovery other than tyre 
recovery facility and niche Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipments 
(WEEE) facilities. Thurrock therefore requires additional recovery 
capacity. The 2010 study, identifies the need for between 71,200 to 
133,000 tonnes per annum by the end of the Plan period. There is 
consent for 300,000 tonnes recovery facility but this is currently non-
operational at this stage (See Paragraph 5.221). This consented 
provision, could meet all Thurrock’s needs.  
 
Landfill 
 
5.211 The provision of adequate landfill capacity for waste generated within 
the Thurrock area and imports of London waste is an important policy 
issue. Policy CSTP30 deals with Thurrock’s approach to London 
apportionment in more detail.  Landfill capacity in Thurrock in 2008 is 
shown in Table 10.

 3,830,000 9,400,000 
Non-Hazardous 
 5,600,000 7,600,000 
 
5.212 The Adopted RSS predicts that the amount of waste from London is 
expected to fall, and by 2015 it would represent 30% of its 2003/04 
level and then remain at that level. On that basis there would be 
enough existing capacity over the Plan period to meet Thurrock’s need 
and the remaining apportionment of London’s waste to the end of the 
Plan period. However, the current level of London imports exceeds the 
annual RSS apportionment and imports could continue at a higher 
annual rate than set out in the RSS. Thurrock will monitor and plan 
capacity to ensure it is able to meet its own need for landfill and it’s 
apportionment for London waste as set out in the Review RSS 
evidence base for waste imports.  
 
Conclusions of the Capacity Study 
 
5.213 The Thurrock study concludes by identifying the capacity gaps for each 
waste management method, although not all were split for each waste 
stream.

 Delivering the Required Capacity 
 
5.215 The Council will aim to ensure the above capacity requirements are 
met through the provision of appropriate criteria against which sites 
and waste management proposals can be assessed and brought 
forward to achieve a well planned and sustainable network of waste 
management facilities. 
 
5.216 Thurrock Council is aware of the importance of providing waste 
facilities which are close to the major sources of waste arisings. For 
Thurrock the majority of waste arisings are located to the west and east 
of Thurrock. 
 
5.217 This arisings issue together with capacity need, provide the strategic 
locational context for Thurrock. The overall strategy for the delivery of 
the additional waste management capacity is to provide a network of 
waste management facilities with a number of small scale facilities 
which support the collection, delivery and management of all waste 
streams, with one or two strategic sites containing a range of facilities 
and a reducing reliance on landfill facilities for the disposal of the 
residual element of the waste during the plan period. 
 
5.218 It should be noted that on 27 August 2009 Tilbury Green Power were 
granted planning permission by the Secretary of State for a biomass 
and energy from waste power station run on a combination of cleaned 
and waste wood.  A condition of the consent allows for 300,000tpa of 
waste (80,000tpa of municipal solid waste, 220,000tpa of Commercial 
and Industrial Waste) and 350,000tpa of biomass and waste wood to 
be brought on to the site per annum, of which no more than 50,000 
tonnes per annum of waste wood shall be brought to the site by road.  
It is anticipated that the plant will be operational in 2012.  If this 
proposal is implemented and provides for Thurrock’s needs it could 
meet most of the total waste capacity required for Thurrock.  However 
until the scheme is implemented and until it is confirmed that it provides 
for Thurrock’s waste needs, a flexible and robust approach is required 
to plan for waste capacity to meet Thurrock’s need. 
 
CSTP29  – WASTE STRATEGY  
1. Waste Planning Strategy  
 
The Council will seek to drive waste management up the waste hierarchy 
by: 
 
I. Ensuring developments minimise waste at source and maximise use 
of recycled materials. Within major developments provision should be 
made for local waste reduction, recycling and management.  
 
II. Reducing waste arisings and increased re-use/recycling and recovery 
of waste. The level of biodegradable waste going to landfill will be 
reduced by increasing recycling and composting rates for all municipal, 
commercial and industrial waste.  Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
165 
  
III. Creating a sustainable network of waste management facilities that 
complements the sustainability objectives in accordance with the 
Thurrock Sustainable Communities Strategy.  
 
IV. Seeking to treat waste as a ‘resource’ and where possible use waste 
to drive forward local renewable energy objectives.  
 
2. Waste Management Capacity 
 
Provision will only be made for total waste management capacity equivalent 
to the requirements for Thurrock (including imports) as set out in the Core 
Strategy (Tables 5, 6 and 7) or latest capacity requirements as identified 
through an update of the regional or local data as a result of a review of the 
LDF. 
 
3. Strategic Site Approach and Contingency 
 
In order to meet the provision in part 2 above, the Council will identify 1 or 2 
strategic sites for the co-location of a range of waste management activities 
within the broad locations of Tilbury – Purfleet and the London Gateway as 
identified on the key diagram. These sites will be located within appropriate 
employment and industrial/port locations and will be identified in the 
MWDPD and identified in the Proposals Map. 
 
Where it is demonstrated that the strategic site allocations are proven to be 
undeliverable, or where the waste management capacity requirements 
cannot be met on the allocated sites, planning permission in non-strategic 
areas will be considered where the site/s are situated within: 
 
i. existing waste management facilities, except landfill sites, where 
this does not lead to a reduction in the existing waste 
management capacity; 
ii. appropriate employment locations; or 
iii. appropriate port locations; and, 
iv. Where the sites meet the relevant policies in this Core Strategy 
and criteria set out in the policies in the MWDPD and 
development management policies. 
 
New development for waste management will not be permitted in the Green 
Belt, unless part of a necessary restoration scheme and the proposals 
conform with Green Belt policy. The exception to this is the provision of 
small scale facilities which address an identified local need where no 
suitable sites outside the Green Belt have been shown to exist following an 
alternative assessment. 
 
4. Recycling and Composting 
 
Additional recycling and composting provision is required in Thurrock to 
meet a predicted capacity deficit throughout the plan period (see Table 12 
above). Proposed new provision for different types and sizes of specialist Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
166 
 recycling and composting facilities will be considered against the specific 
policies contained within the MWDPD. 
 
5. Landfill  
 
I. New non-hazardous or inert landfill capacity will only be considered 
where it can be demonstrated to contribute to the capacity 
requirements set out in the sub-text to this policy (as set out in Table 
12 above) or the regional import approach set out in Policy CSTP30. 
 
II. Proposals for new landfilling will be resisted unless part of a necessary 
scheme to achieve approved restoration levels at a mineral working 
site. The Council will require satisfactory restoration in accordance 
with the aftercare and restoration policy within the MWDPD and seek 
appropriate after uses for waste management sites where they are not 
proposed to stay within a waste management use. Proposals for 
landraising above approved restoration levels will not be supported. 
 
6. Construction and Demolition Waste 
 
I. Thurrock has a requirement for non landfill waste sites to deal with 
Construction and Demolition Waste. Thurrock will look to safeguard 
existing provision to handle construction, demolition and excavation 
waste at sites demonstrating high standards of operation in order to 
set benchmarks and raise standards across the Borough.  
 
II. Permanent authorised sites processing Construction, Demolition and 
excavation waste specifically to create quality secondary aggregate 
and to recover soils will be protected in line with the safeguarding 
Policy CSTP32 of this Core Strategy and criteria set out in the 
Minerals and Waste DPD. 
 
7. Hazardous Waste 
 
Proposals for the management of hazardous waste will only be considered 
where there is foremost an identified need for the management of 
Thurrock’s own hazardous waste, but recognising that such a facility might 
also contribute to the management of a proportion of the region’s 
hazardous waste. 
 
8. General Environmental Principles 
 
The Council will reduce, as far as practicable, any negative environmental 
impacts that may arise from waste management proposals, as well as 
ensure that the recovery or disposal of waste takes place without 
endangering human health, especially from the landfilling of waste, through 
cross-cutting development management policies set out in this Core 
Strategy and the MWDPD. 
 
All proposals for waste management use will be required to conform with 
the policies and site allocations set out in the Minerals and Waste DPD. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 CSTP30 – REGIONAL WASTE APPORTIONMENT 
 
Introduction 
 
5.219 As well as managing Thurrock’s own waste, the Borough is also 
required to plan for a reducing amount of waste imports for landfill from 
London. After 2015, provision for waste originating outside the Borough 
should only be made for residual waste. Policy CSTP30 sets out 
Thurrock’s approach in meeting the apportionment for London’s waste 
imports. 
 
5.220 PPS10 clarifies that Regional Planning Bodies (RPBs) should take 
account of the likely demand for waste management capacity arising 
from neighbouring regions, where meeting this demand would be 
consistent with the policies set out in PPS10. 
 
5.221 In identifying the pattern of waste management facilities, RPBs should 
also take into account “the need for waste management, including for 
disposal of the residues from treated wastes, arising in more than one 
waste planning authority area but where only a limited number of 
facilities would be required” . This capacity requirement for imports from 
outside of the region is passed down to the WPAs via apportionment. 
 
5.222 Policy WM3 of the RSS requires waste-planning authorities in the East 
of England to plan for a progressive reduction of the level of waste 
imported to the region for landfilling, in particular from London. It also 
sets out an apportionment for the amount of London’s waste to be 
exported and landfilled in the region. 
 
5.223 Over the Plan period, Thurrock is required to plan for the provision of 
13% of London’s waste imports apportioned to the East of England, an 
annual tonnage of 210,000 tonnes by 2010 and 100,000 tonnes by 
2015. After 2015, the region is only required to plan for residual waste 
which has been subject to the maximum practicable level of treatment, 
exported from London, through the availability landfill capacity. The 
draft revision RSS sought to reduce tonnages imported from London 
over time to 2031 to the figure of 3% weight of the MSW and C&I 
currently exported to the East of England. Thurrock Council has 
included the revised RSS evidence base of London Waste tonnages to 
be planned for in Thurrock to 2026 for the Core Strategy. 
 
5.224 In relation to other imports and the provision of new non-landfill waste 
management facilities for these imports, allowance should only be 
made for a proposed facility where it is proven to be of regional 
significance and which would enable the recovery of more localised 
waste arisings in order to meet the waste management needs of the 
recipient WPA.

 Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
Thurrock Municipal Waste Strategy and Position Statement 2005-2010 
 
5.225 As part of Thurrock’s overall approach to minimise the amount of waste 
sent to landfill, the Strategic Vision within the Waste Strategy seeks to 
reduce “ the levels of imported waste, especially from London, and 
continue to oppose landraising in the area” , recognising the 
unsustainable level of London’s imports being sent to landfill sites 
within the Borough. 
 
Other Evidence 
 
London Imports 
 
5.226 Thurrock has already exhausted a significant proportion of its landfill 
capacity to accommodate waste imports arising from London.  The 
reality of current importation of waste from London to Thurrock for 
landfill is at odds with the requirements set out in the RSS. 
 
5.227 If the estimated amount of landfill was to used up before the end of the 
Plan period, there would be a need to approve proposals for new non-
hazardous landfill voidspace in order to meet the required landfill 
provision of London’s imports even though the cumulative 
apportionment will have been exceeded by that date. 
 
5.228 Thurrock will ensure that provision is made for a declining amount of 
waste imports from London, but only a provision equal to the 
cumulative London apportionment for Thurrock for the Plan period 
outlined in the RSS and subject to any Review.  
 
5.229 In terms of non–landfill infrastructure the Council recognises the RSS3 
does not totally discourage the provision of non-landfill waste 
management facilities for waste predominantly originating outside of 
the region. However, the proposed facility will need to be proven to be 
of regional significance and there is some benefit to the recovery of 
localised waste arisings in order to meet the local recovery targets. 
 
CSTP 30 – REGIONAL WASTE APPORTIONMENT  
Strategic Approach to London’s Im ports  
I. Thurrock will only make provision for London’s waste imports equivalent 
to the following cumulative tonnages across the Plan period 
(from2009/2010) of 1,885,000 tonnes. 
 
II. Thurrock will not allocate or grant planning permission for new landfill 
capacity to accommodate London’s waste arisings where the above 
capacity requirements have been met. 
 
III. Provision for new non-landfill waste facilities will only be made for waste

 not included within the above apportionment where a facility has a clear 
benefit to the region, such as the provision of specialist processing or 
treatment which would not be viable without a wider catchment and 
which would enable recovery of more locally generated wastes and 
contribute to meeting the capacity requirements set out in CSTP29.

171 
 CSTP31 – PROVISION OF MINERALS 
 
Introduction 
 
5.230 Thurrock is a Minerals Planning Authority (MPA) and is required to plan 
for an adequate and steady supply of mineral resource to meet the 
material needs of its own, and contribute to the regions’ needs. This 
provision must be made in accordance with the principles of 
sustainable development. 
 
5.231 This policy sets out the Council’s strategic approach towards 
maintaining a supply of minerals throughout the Plan period. This will 
be achieved by providing for appropriate sites to assist in meeting the 
sub-regional apportionment and encouraging a more sustainable and 
prudent use of mineral resources. 
 
5.232 The NPPF sets out the overall objectives of Government policy for 
minerals provision. It recognises that minerals are essential to support 
sustainable economic growth and quality of life.  It is therefore 
important that there is a sufficient supply of material to provide the 
infrastructure, buildings, energy and goods that the Country needs.  
Local planning authorities are required to: 
 
 identify, and have policies for the extraction of, mineral resources of 
local and national importance; 
 
 so far as practicable, take account of the contribution that substitute 
or secondary and recycled materials and minerals waste would 
make to the supply of materials, before considering extraction of 
primary materials; 
 
 plan for a steady and adequate supply of aggregates by preparing 
an annual Local Aggregate Assessment based on a rolling average 
of 10 years sales data and other relevant local information, and an 
assessment of all supply options including marine dredged, 
secondary and recycled sources; 
 
 plan for a landbank of permitted reserves of sand and gravel to be 
maintained for at least seven years. 
 
5.233 Policy M1 of the RSS applies the principles of national policy on 
minerals provision and requires all minerals planning authorities to 
identify and safeguard mineral resources to ensure they are sourced 
from the most environmentally acceptable locations whilst maintaining 
their respective average annual level of output. In doing so the 
Regional Aggregates Working Group sets out an annual apportionment 
for aggregates to which each sub-region must plan for. The East of 
England region is required to plan for the following tonnages to 2020: 
  
Land Won Sand and Gravel 14.75 million tonnes per annum 
(mtpa) (total 236mt) Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
172 
 Marine Sand and Gravel 14 million tonnes (0.9mtpa) 
Alternative Materials 
(recycled & secondary 
aggregate) 117 million tonnes (7.8mtpa)  
 
Net Imports to England 7 million tonnes 
Land Won Crushed Rock (not 
in Thurrock) 8 million tonnes   
 
5.234 Thurrock is required to plan for a sub-regional apportionment of 0.14 
mtpa (as part of the overall combined figure of 4.45 mtpa for Essex, 
Thurrock and Southend on Sea) of land won sand and gravel per 
annum throughout the Plan period.  A combined figure is used for 
monitoring purposes because of the limited number of sites and 
operators in Thurrock and the need to maintain commercial 
confidentiality for individual mineral operators.  Essex is separately 
planning for the provision of aggregates in accordance with their own 
landbank requirement. 
 
5.235 There are a limited number of ports and wharves in the region able to 
receive marine sand and gravel imports to England and these include 
wharves and combined wharves and rail depots on the River Thames 
in Thurrock. There is a need for Thurrock to continue to maintain these 
facilities.  Although the NPPF effectively encourages facilities for 
recycling of construction and demolition waste there is no target or sub-
regional split for the provision of alternative materials.  This is in part 
due to limited data.  Furthermore the great majority of facilities for the 
provision of such materials in Thurrock are temporary facilities 
associated with mineral workings which are being ‘fuelled’ by imports of 
waste into Thurrock.  Consequently while the Council will encourage 
the provision of appropriate facilities for these purposes it considers 
that it is not currently practicable to take account of the contribution 
these sites make to the supply of materials before considering 
extraction of primary materials. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.236 Thurrock has traditionally supplied sand and gravel, chalk and clay.  
These mineral sites have been restored to a variety of afteruses 
including retail and housing at Lakeside and Chafford Hundred.  In 
addition, the River Thames has been a major route for the 
transhipment and distribution of aggregates including the landing of 
hard rock and marine dredged aggregate.  The material has been 
distributed within Thurrock, the wider region and London. 
 
5.237 At present, there are 3 permitted sites in Thurrock (sand and gravel) 
with total sales over the last 3 years ranging from 25,000 tonnes to 
77,000 tonnes per annum. 
 
 
 
 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
173 
 Primary Aggregate Plan Provision, Monitoring and Review 
 
5.238 In order to make the necessary provision for land won sand and gravel, 
Thurrock is required to maintain a landbank (stock of permitted 
reserves) of at least 7 years, based upon the annual apportionment 
(0.14 mtpa).  If the landbank is below 7 years, additional resources 
(new sites or extensions to sites) need to be identified, to ensure the 
landbank is maintained. 
 
5.239 The Plan period is from 1 April 2010 – 2026. In order to provide an up 
to date provision requirement, the Council will use the latest monitoring 
figures to identify the future Plan provision. The monitoring data for 
minerals is collected on an annual basis for the previous calendar year 
to 31 December, and a base date of 1 January is used. At 1 January 
2008 there were 4 permitted sand and gravel sites in Thurrock with 
reserves totalling just over 2 million tonnes. However, at the end of 
May 2008, planning permission on one site with approximately 0.5mt of 
reserves had lapsed. Taking this into account, the current permitted 
reserves stood at 1.54 mtpa, equivalent to a 10.9 year landbank. The 
landbank is the sum of the permitted reserves expressed in years 
based upon the agreed sub-regional apportionment per annum.  This is 
calculated as follows:  
 
Table 13  - Landbank as at 1 January 2008  
Permitted Reserves at 1 January 2008 1.54 mt 
Divided by annual apportionment / 0.14 mtpa 
Current Landbank is 1.54 / 0.14  = 10.9 years  
 
5.240 Therefore, the current permitted reserves are sufficient to meet the 7 
year landbank requirement. However, if no new sites are permitted 
during the Plan period, sand and gravel reserves would be exhausted 
by 2019 and would fall below the 7-year landbank requirement during 
2012. Thurrock is therefore required to plan for an additional 0.28mt 
before the end of the Plan period. It is therefore clear that additional 
sites are required to provide, as a minimum, sufficient resources for the 
Plan period to ensure the sub-regional apportionment of 0.14mtpa (or 
any subsequent change to the apportionment). It is the role of the 
MWDPD to identify and allocate appropriate sites and provide the 
criteria with which to assess proposals for mineral extraction, and 
control the phasing of any site allocations to ensure the prudent use of 
Thurrock’s mineral resources. 
 
5.241 The Minerals and Waste Development Plan Document (MWDPD) will 
need to monitor and review the landbank to ensure that the Plan is 
reviewed at the appropriate time or additional resources are made 
available at the end of the Plan period, through the phasing of site 
allocations to maintain at least a 7-year landbank. 
 
5.242 Several approaches could be adopted, with review triggers, for when 
the landbank and remaining planned provision reach a certain level Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015

 (expressed in years) or for additional material to be planned for within 
the MWDPD beyond 2021.  Further details of an indicator, review 
cycle, or additional safety margin at the end of the Plan period are 
matters for the MWDPD. 
 
CSTP3 1 – PROVISION OF MINERALS  
1. Land Won Minerals  
 
I. The Council will endeavour to maintain a landbank of at least 7-years 
and aim to meet the sub-regional apportionment of 0.14mt per annum 
of sand and gravel throughout the Plan period or meet any subsequent 
change in the period as agreed by national policy or as a result of a 
review of the regional apportionment.  The Council will assess the 
provision of the landbank through its monitoring framework.   
 
II. To ensure the prudent use of Thurrock’s mineral resources: 
 
i. Mineral working will only be permitted where there is an identified 
national, regional or local need and the sites fall within the criteria 
policies outlined in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan. 
 
ii. The forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan will identify ‘Preferred Areas’ 
located within the Minerals Safeguarding Area (MSA) (Policy 
CSTP32) which, if granted planning permission, will contribute to 
maintaining the sand and gravel annual apportionment and the 7-
year landbank. Sites will be phased depending on the identified 
need, based upon the requirements outlined above (see Table 13) 
to 2021 or beyond, where the site will contribute to maintaining the 
7-year landbank and meeting the sub-regional apportionment 
throughout the Plan period. 
 
2. Recycled and Secondary Aggregate 
 
Subject to the waste policies of this plan the Council will encourage the use 
of facilities for recycling aggregate or secondary materials, or processing of 
such materials, as alternatives to land won aggregate. Proposals on 
unallocated sites which do come forward must meet the criteria set out in 
the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan.

 CSTP 32 – SAFEGUARDING MINERAL RESOURCES 
 
Introduction   
 
5.243 To ensure Thurrock is able to meet its mineral resource requirements 
over the Plan period, and beyond, it is important that all existing 
resources are safeguarded as far as practicably possible. 
 
5.244 This policy sets out the Council’s approach toward safeguarding 
Thurrock’s mineral resources and facilities which contribute to the 
delivery of sustainable resource use including the application of the 
Thurrock Mineral Safeguarding Area (MSA). 
 
National and Regional Policy Context 
 
5.245 The NPPF requires local planning authorities to: 
 
 define Minerals Safeguarding Areas and adopt appropriate policies 
in order that known locations of minerals are not needlessly 
sterilised by non-mineral development; 
 
 safeguard existing, planned and potential rail heads, wharfage and 
associated storage, handling and processing facilities for the bulk 
transport of minerals including recycled, secondary and marine-
dredged materials; 
 
 safeguard existing, planned and potential sites for concrete 
batching, the manufacture of coated materials, other concrete 
products and the handling, processing and distribution of substitute, 
recycled and secondary aggregate material.  
 
5.246 The RSS reinforces principles of ensuring the prudent use and 
safeguarding of mineral resources. Policy M1 of the RSS states that 
LDDs should identify and safeguard mineral resources, in turn leading 
to the most environmentally acceptable site allocations. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.247 An Environmental Capacity Statement (ECS)  has been prepared to 
assess the ability of Thurrock to absorb aggregate and other mineral 
provision within its environment and identifies a Mineral Safeguarding 
Area for Thurrock.  The ECS appraisal has taken into account a 
number of Thurrock’s planning constraints such as landscape, national 
and regional environmental designations. The ECS does not exclude 
any of the potentially workable mineral resources; however, it does 
make recommendations that minerals workings in some designated 
areas should be classed as ‘unfavourable’ in planning terms. 
 
5.248 The Proposals Map will include the designation of the Mineral 
Safeguarding Area (MSA), in accordance with paragraph 143 of the 
NPPF. The purpose of the MSA is not to identify all minerals deposits Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 5 – Thematic Policies                                                             Adopted January 2015 
 
176 
 which will be extracted, but to identify and indicate to developers the 
possible presence of workable mineral deposits, and to consider these 
deposits when submitting proposals for non-mineral related 
development. This is to ensure valuable mineral resources are not 
needlessly sterilised. 
 
5.249 The Minerals Safeguarding Area is being identified in conjunction with 
the preparation of the Minerals and Waste Development Plan 
Document. The MWDPD will identify specific mineral extraction site 
allocations using the MSA. The MSA is based on the work undertaken 
for the ECS which used a constraint sieving approach to identify all 
potentially workable mineral deposits. Constraints include 
environmental designations and mineral deposits located under 
existing urban development where extraction is not possible. 
 
Landing of Marine Sand and Gravel and imports  
 
5.250 The Essex Minerals Local Plan Review One  which covers Thurrock 
identified the following sites for safeguarding:

West Thurrock – Lafarge 
Operational port of Tilbury Tilbury 
 
5.251 The MWDPD will identify these existing areas as safeguarded, in 
conjunction with additional site allocations. 
 
CSTP32 – SAFEGUARDING MINERALS RESOURCES  
1. Mineral Safeguarding Area  
 
All site allocations for mineral extraction identified in the forthcoming Thurrock 
Local Plan will be based on the MSA to be identified in the forthcoming 
Thurrock Local Plan and on the Proposals Map. All areas identified in the 
MSA will be safeguarded from non-mineral related development. Applications 
for non-mineral related development on the site allocations will be assessed 
against the policies provided in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan. 
 
2. Aggregate Recycling and Secondary Processing Sites 
 
The permanent authorised aggregate recycling capacity will be safeguarded 
from non-mineral related development, unless the proposals meet the criteria 
outlined in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan and/or the site is identified for 
alternative use in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan.  
 
All safeguarded sites will be allocated in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 3. Coated materials and concrete products  
 
The permanent authorised facilities for concrete batching, manufacture of 
coated materials and concrete products, and the handling, processing and 
distribution of substitute, recycled and secondary aggregate material will be 
safeguarded from non-mineral related development, unless the proposals 
meet the criteria outlined in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan and/or 
identified for alternative use in forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan. 
 
All safeguarded sites will be allocated in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan. 
 
4. Aggregate Wharves 
All existing aggregate wharves will be safeguarded against proposals which 
prejudice their use for the importation of aggregates. The Council will favour 
proposals which contribute to the importation of aggregates where they 
accord with the policies in the forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan. New sites for 
possible aggregate wharves will be encouraged through policies in the 
forthcoming Thurrock Local Plan. 
 
All existing aggregate wharves will be identified in the forthcoming Thurrock 
Local Plan.

 CSTP33 - STRATEGIC INFRASTUCTURE PROVISION 
 
Introduction 
 
5.252 The Council and its partners recognise that successful delivery of the 
Spatial Vision for Thurrock and the Spatial Policies that drive the Core 
Strategy will be reliant upon timely investment in the necessary 
infrastructure to bring forward sustainable development. A robust 
Strategic Infrastructure Delivery Framework, and fit-for-purpose 
Partnership Delivery Arrangements to ensure development is 
implemented as planned, is therefore vital to the future successful 
delivery of sustainable benefits to the Thurrock community.   
 
5.253 Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation (TTGDC) have 
regeneration resources, borrowing powers, access to Treasury funds, 
planning control over major developments and land assembly powers, 
and are leading on the regeneration of particular communities in 
Thurrock. Thurrock Council as a Unitary Authority has tax-raising 
powers, borrowing powers, access to Treasury funds, planning control 
over minor developments, and land assembly powers. The Council is 
also a major purchaser of supplies and services and provider of public 
services to local people.  As the Statutory Spatial Planning Authority, 
the Council is responsible for ensuring the growth targets for this part 
of the Thames Gateway can be accommodated in a sustainable 
manner. The two authorities have complimentary powers and 
resources and recognise the need to have effective fit-for-purpose 
partnership delivery arrangements.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
5.254 The Infrastructure Prioritisation and Implementation Programme 2006-
2021  will be the driver for providing the full range of social and 
community, utility, transport and green infrastructure to underpin the 
regeneration and growth of sustainable communities throughout 
Thurrock over the Plan period. 
 
5.255 The completed Study and Implementation Programme provides the 
Technical Evidence Base to support this policy. A Summary of the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and the resultant Infrastructure Trajectory 
are set out in the Monitoring and Implementation Chapter 
demonstrating their under-pinning of the Housing Trajectory. Full 
versions of the Study Reports and Infrastructure Implementation 
Programme have been published in tandem with this DPD. (See 
Appendix  1 for details all supporting Technical Evidence Base 
documents). 
 
5.256 The Study and Implementation Programme is considered by the 
Council as a sound basis for negotiating, obtaining and delivering the 
necessary infrastructure to underpin the regeneration and growth 
agenda set out in the Core Strategy.

 CSTP33  - STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROVISION  
1. STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERY PLAN  
 
I. The Council and Partners will adopt  the Strategic Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan as the basis for the  Core Strategy Infrastructure Trajectory . The 
Council and Partners commit to an Annual Review of the above Delivery 
Plan for Monitoring and Reporting purposes with a fundamental Review 
every 3 years or more frequently if required by local circumstances, 
changes in Government guidance, requirements or Regulations. 
 
2. STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE BOARD  
 
I. The Council and delivery partners will work together with other partners 
and stakeholders to set up a Strategic Infrastructure Board reporting to 
the Sustainable Communities Board of the Thurrock Local Strategic 
Partnership “Shaping Thurrock”. The Board will not have executive 
powers but will seek to arrive at jointly agreed decisions on priorities for 
investment. 
 
II. The Council and delivery partners also recognise that there may well be 
the need for Scheme-led or area-based Local Asset Backed Vehicles to 
be set up, such as for Purfleet PRIDe. 
 
III. A Developer Contributions Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)  
and a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) Charging Schedule will be 
produced in consultation with partners and published in due course to 
support this policy.  
 
IV. The Council recognises that the current economic climate may cause 
delay to the Delivery Plan.  Reductions in public spending may mean that 
there is less funding available for infrastructure.  Development may be 
less profitable than envisaged so growth will be slower to take place, and 
infrastructure expected to be funded by Section 106 obligations and/or 
CIL will be correspondingly delayed.  This may mean that the Council 
has to prioritise, bringing forward those schemes which are most 
important and/or easiest to deliver.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
6.1 This chapter sets out the detailed Policies for Management of 
Development, which, in conjunction with the Thematic and Strategic 
Spatial Policies, are the basis for the determination of planning 
applications for the development and use of land and buildings.  
 
6.2 Some of the policies in this chapter are set out in similar themes to the 
Thematic Policies so that the links can be clearly identified. Each policy 
is presented within a box which also includes the link to the key 
diagram/maps. The policies do not, for the most part, include cross 
references to the Thematic and Strategic Spatial Policies as all the 
policies are inter-related to one another and should be read together.  
 
6.3 The explanatory text provides clear justification for the policy, its links 
to national, regional and local strategies and other sources forming the 
evidence base.  
 
6.4 The implementation of the Policies for Management of Development is 
important in facilitating the delivery of some of the Strategic Spatial, 
Thematic Policies and the Spatial Objectives set out in the Core 
Strategy. 
 
The Policies for the Management of Development include:

 PMD1 – MINIMISING POLLUTION AND IMPACTS ON AMENITY, 
HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT 
 
Introduction 
 
6.5 The main sources of pollution in Thurrock are emissions from road 
transport and industrial processes. Although in recent decades, cleaner 
fuels and the implementation of pollution control policies have led to 
some reductions, pollution attributed to motor vehicles remains, with 
heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) being the main contributors. Thurrock 
has fifteen Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) mainly in the west 
of the Borough, in close proximity to major transport routes, such as the 
M25 and A13.  
 
6.6 Owing to Thurrock’s industrial and extensive quarrying and land-filling 
past, the area has a legacy of contaminated land.  Consequently it also 
has land where stability may be an issue.  Some of this land lies within 
the urban area where development needs to take place to avoid 
intrusion into the Green Belt.  
 
6.7 The Borough also has a history of incompatible land uses, with housing 
having been developed next to heavy industries.  This has resulted in a 
poor living environment.  The Council’s aspiration is to break from 
previous trends and to minimise pollution, enhance local amenity and 
provide safe and healthy environments for the community.  The Council 
does not wish legitimate business activities to have to be curtailed 
because of the introduction of sensitive uses in locations where their 
presence would be likely to lead to restrictions over business activity 
having to be imposed in order to avoid unacceptable nuisance to those 
sensitive uses, unless that is part of the planned change of an area.  
 
6.8 The Council will be guided by the NPPF, EC Directive 2000/60/EC and 
Environmental Agency Acts to assess the implications of development, 
and will seek compliance with, and contribution to, EU limit values and 
national objectives for pollutants taking into the presence of AQMAs. 
 
6.9 In implementing this policy the Council will liaise closely with the 
Environment Agency and other relevant pollution control bodies.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.10 The Council is required to periodically review and assess strategies 
relating to pollution control under the environment protection legislation.  
 
PMD1 – MINIMISING POLLUTION AND IMPACTS ON AMENITY , 
HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT 
1. Development will not be permitted where it would cause or is likely to 
caus e unacceptable effects on: 
i. the amenities of the area; 
ii. the amenity, health or safety of others; 
iii. the amenity, health or safety of future occupiers of the site; or Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
183 
 iv. the natural environment. 
 
2. Particular consideration will be given to the location of sensitive land 
uses, especially housing, schools and health facilities, and nationally, 
regionally and locally designated biodiversity sites, and areas of 
recreational and amenity value which are relatively undisturbed by 
noise and valued for this reason. 
 
3. The Council will require assessments to accompany planning 
applications where it has reasonable grounds to believe that a 
development may suffer from, or cause:  
i. Air pollution; 
ii. Noise pollution; 
iii. Contaminated land/soil; 
iv. Odour; 
v. Light pollution and shadow flicker; 
vi. Water pollution; 
vii. Invasion of privacy;  
viii. Visual intrusion; 
ix. Loss of light; 
x. Ground instability; 
xi. Vibration 
 
4. Where the assessment confirms such potential harm, planning 
permission will only be granted if satisfactory solutions can be 
achieved through design, or suitable mitigation measures can be put 
in place through conditions or a planning obligation.  Where an 
assessment is not forthcoming the Council may refuse permission on 
a precautionary basis.  
 
5. The Council will seek compliance with, and contribution to, EU limit 
values or national objectives for pollutants, taking into account the 
presence of Air Quality Management Areas and the cumulative 
impacts on air quality in local areas arising from individual sites.   
 
6. In the interests of supporting legitimate business activity pursuant to 
policy CSSP2 the Council will resist the introduction of sensitive uses 
in locations where their presence would be likely to lead to 
unreasonable restrictions over business activity having to be imposed 
in order to avoid unacceptable n uisance to those sensitive uses.  
Exceptionally the Council may accept co-location of sensitive uses 
with business uses where the sensitive uses are part of approved 
proposals for the redevelopment of a wider area from business use to 
a predominantly resid ential use.

 PMD2 - DESIGN AND LAYOUT 
 
Introduction  
 
6.11 Thurrock has an environment of surprising contrast of industry, 
housing, infrastructure, farming and wildlife habitats. In some cases this 
has led to fragmented character and poor quality of physical and visual 
linkages. To rectify these deficiencies, the Council considers it 
essential that new schemes are built to appropriate design and layout 
standards to protect and enhance the quality and value of the built 
environment, natural assets and amenity on and around the 
development site.  The NPPF states that good design is a key aspect 
of sustainable development, is indivisible from good planning, and 
should contribute positively to making places better for people.  It 
further states that it is important to plan positively for the achievement 
of high quality and inclusive design for all development including 
individual buildings, public and private spaces and wider area 
development schemes.  Development should function well and add to 
the quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of 
the development.  Thurrock Council fully embraces these objectives.  
This policy sets out the criteria that will be assessed when considering 
schemes to ensure that their design and layout contributes to a high 
quality accessible environment in Thurrock. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.12 Thurrock Council has commissioned a number of studies which 
appraise the characteristics of the Borough, including seven 
Conservation Area Appraisals, the Landscape Capacity Study  (2005), 
the Urban Character Study (2005)  and the Thurrock Unitary Historic 
Environment Characterisation Project  (2009).  These studies form a 
basis for good design in Thurrock by providing developers with initial 
information and guidance on how to approach the design of individual 
sites. The Council’s forthcoming Design and Sustainability SPD  and 
Layout and Standards SPD  will provide guidance in securing high 
quality designs in Thurrock.  
 
PMD2 - DESIGN AND LAYOUT 
1. The Council requires all design proposals to respond to the sensitivity of 
the site and its surroundings, to optimize the potential of the site to 
accommodate development, to fully investigate the magnitude of change 
that would result from the proposals, and mitigate against negative 
impacts.  
 
All development proposals must satisfy the following criteria: 
 
i. Character – Development must contribute positively to the character 
of the area in which it is proposed, and to surrounding areas that may 
be affected by it. It should seek to contribute positively to local views, 
townscape, heritage assets and natural features, and contribute to the Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
185 
 creation of a positive sense of place. 
ii. Continuity – Development proposals must promote continuity of 
street frontages and provide active ground floor frontages as far as 
reasonably possible. 
iii. Public Realm – New development should contribute to improvements 
in the public realm by contributing sensitive planting, street furniture, 
appropriate lighting and public art where appropriate. The quality of 
the design and detailing of all development, including interfacing 
elements such as facades, steps and walls should be robust, 
engaging and contribute positively to the public realm. 
iv. Public and Private Amenity space – Development proposals must 
provide adequate public and private amenity space in accordance with 
Thurrock’s relevant adopted standards, particularly in areas with 
identified deficiencies. It should be attractive, safe, uncluttered, readily 
accessible and should promote play.  
v. Accessibility – Development proposals must allow easy and safe 
access for all members of the community. Development must also 
integrate land uses and all modes of transport but pedestrians and 
cyclists must be given priority over traffic in scheme design.  
vi. Permeability and Legibility – Development should promote 
connections between places that people wish to use, including public 
transport links, community facilities and the Greengrid. Development 
should be designed to help people find their way and must be legible 
for all members of the community, providing recognisable routes using 
landmarks and signage where appropriate.   
vii. Safety and Security – Development proposals must create safe and 
secure environments and reduce the scope for crime and fear of 
crime. Where appropriate, proposals should adopt the principles of 
Designing Out Crime set out in the Police Service’s publication 
‘Secured by Design’.  
viii. Landscape – Features contributing to the natural landscape in the 
Borough, such as  woods, hedges, specimen trees, unimproved 
grassland, ponds and marshes, will be protected and where 
appropriate enhanced to maintain their landscape and wildlife value. 
Provision and enhancement of landscape features will also be 
required to contribute to multiple uses and/or eco-system services, 
including amenity, recreation, flood alleviation and Sustainable Urban 
Drainage Systems. 
ix. Diversity – Development proposals must promote variety and choice 
through a mix of mutually compatible developments and uses.   
x. Utilities – Development proposals must accommodate public services 
and utilities without compromising design and layout. This includes 
providing suitable access to maintenance, waste and emergency 
service vehicles.  
xi. Energy and Resource use – Development should be designed to 
minimise energy and resource use. This includes integrating 
sustainable construction techniques, siting and orientation of buildings 
to maximise energy and water efficiency. 
xii. Layout – The layout of all development should optimise the assets of 
the site, while conforming to the appropriate standards for layout, 
design and access set out in the Layout and Standards SPD.    Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
186 
  
2. In the interests of encouraging good design the Council will require 
residential developers to carry out robust assessments of their proposals 
using the Building for Life 12  questions, where the questions are relevant 
to the development being proposed, and submit such assessments in 
support of planning applications.  The Council will use these questions as 
the basis for discussions with intending developers both before and after 
submission of planning applications.  The objective will be to arrive at a 
mutually agreed assessment of proposals prior to a decision being made 
where there are no ‘red’ outcomes and where the only ‘amber’ outcomes 
are those where the characteristics of the site and its circumstances are 
such as to make ‘green’ outcomes unachievable. 
 
3. The Council will encourage pre-application discussions and design review 
of development proposals by the Commission for Architecture and the 
Built Environment (CABE) and/or other relevant bodies , and in relation to 
proposals having a wider impact, will wish to see that developers have 
worked closely with local communities to arrive at proposals that take 
account of their views. 
 
4. Where the Council has produced a design brief for a site or sites, 
developers will be obliged to meet its detailed requirements.

 PMD3 – TALL BUILDINGS  
 
Introduction 
 
6.13 Thurrock has a number of tall residential, commercial and industrial 
buildings, located principally in Grays, Chadwell St Mary and Tilbury, 
and on the River Thames.  These buildings have a role in marking the 
settlements in which they are located, although their effects on the 
landscape and the community can be negative as well as positive.   
 
6.14 The Council wishes to adopt a positive approach to assessing tall 
building proposals.  It recognises that they can enhance the quality of 
the environment in Thurrock, so long as they are developed in 
appropriate locations, are of high quality design, and can be shown to 
make a positive contribution to the landscape and the quality of life of 
residents.  
 
6.15 There are several locations within Thurrock’s commercial areas where 
tall buildings would not necessarily be out of keeping, owing to the 
existing context. In many areas within Thurrock, however, tall buildings 
are not appropriate in urban and landscape design terms.  
 
6.16 Against the background of design guidance set out in the NPPF  
Thurrock will operate its tall buildings policy in accordance with 
guidance recognised as best practice, such as ‘Guidance on Tall 
buildings’ (2007), published by the Commission for Architecture and the 
Built Environment (CABE) and English Heritage. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.17 This policy is informed by Thurrock Council’s Urban Character Study 
(2005), Thurrock Landscape Capacity Study  (2005), Thurrock Unitary 
Historic Environment Characterisation Project  (2009) which assesses 
the features and sensitivity of each settlement including the types of 
deve
lopment options acceptable.   
 
PMD3 – TALL BUILDINGS  
1. The Council defines tall buildings as:  
 
i. Buildings of more than six storeys or a height of two storeys 
above the prevalent form of development, whichever is the lesser, 
within an established primarily residential area; or 
ii. Buildings of more than six storeys in other locations including 
recently developed, predominantly residential neighbourhoods.   
 
2. Thurrock will assess applications for tall buildings against the Criteria for 
Evaluation  set out in Section 4 of the CABE/English Heritage publication 
‘Guidance on Tall Buildings’  (2007).  The Council will only support those 
applications, which respond positively to all the relevant criteria.  The 
relevant criteria in Thurrock are:    
 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
188 
  
i. The relationship to context 
ii. The effect on historic assets 
iii. The relationship to transport infrastructure  
iv. The architectural quality of the proposal  
v. The sustainable design and construction of the proposal 
vi. The credibility of the design, both technically and financially  
vii. The contribution to public space and facilities 
viii. The effect on the local environment 
ix. The contribution made to permeability  
x. The provision of a well designed environment 
 
3. Applicants must demonstrate that they have considered this guidance in 
detail and have used it as a basis to develop their scheme design. 
 
4. Applicants must demonstrate that their proposals are also in accordance 
with other policies in this plan, including PMD2 - Design and Layout , and 
the Design and Sustainability SPD, when published.    
 
5. Applications will only be granted in locations identified in the Adopted Site 
Specific Allocations and Policies DPD and identified on the Proposals 
Map.   
 
6. Proposals for tall buildings in Thurrock will only be considered acceptable, 
outside of the locations (included in the Adopted Site Specific Allocations 
and Policies DPD and shown on the Proposals Map), in exceptional 
circumstances. Such exceptional circumstances will arise only when an 
applicant can demonstrate that a tall building will act as a catalyst for long 
term regeneration, with significant social, economic and environmental 
benefits for the local community, while also meeting the requirements of 
the criteria above and other relevant policies.      
 
7. Applications for outline permission for tall buildings should not be 
submitted; detailed applications will be required. 
 
8. Tall structures that cannot be occupied (such as silos, telecommunication 
masts, wind turbines, and chimneys) are not considered tall buildings by 
the Council and will be dealt with on their own merits, taking into account 
other relevant policies in the plan and as many of the CABE/English 
Heritage Criteria for Evaluation (above) that are relevant.

 PMD4 - HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT   
 
Introduction 
 
6.18 Thurrock’s architectural, archaeological and historic heritage is made 
up of both statutorily and non-statutorily protected assets.  The Council 
is committed to preserving or enhancing those assets for the benefit of 
current and future generations, by controlling development affecting 
their fabric or setting.  
 
6.19 Statutorily protected heritage assets include Listed Buildings, 
Scheduled Ancient Monuments and Archaeological sites, Conservation 
Areas, and Historic Parks and Gardens.  The Council also recognises 
the importance of non-statutorily protected heritage assets, such as 
ancient woodlands, landscapes and hedgerows, as well as those 
assets on the Thurrock Heritage at Risk Register and the Local Listing.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.20 The Council has produced a Character Appraisal for each of its seven 
Conservation Areas which evaluates the special interest and 
significance of these areas and sets out how they will be preserved and 
enhanced.  The Council’s Thurrock Heritage at Risk Register identifies 
the Borough’s Listed Buildings in need of repair and/or maintenance 
which will be reviewed annually.  
 
PMD4 - HISTORIC EN VIRONMENT  
The Council will ensure that the fabric and setting of heritage assets, 
including Listed Buildings, Conservation Areas, Scheduled Monuments and 
other important archeological sites, and historic landscape features are 
appropriately protected and enhanced in accordance with their significance. 
 
1. The Council will also require new development to take all reasonable 
steps to retain and incorporate non-statutorily protected heritage 
assets contributing to the quality of Thurrock’s broader historic 
environment.  
 
2. Applications must demonstrate that they contribute positively to the 
special qualities and local distinctiveness of Thurrock, through 
compliance with local heritage guidance including: 
 
i. Conservation Area Character Appraisals; 
ii. Conservation Area Management Proposals;   
iii. Other relevant Thurrock-based studies, including the 
Landscape Capacity Study (2005), the Thurrock Urban 
Character Study (2007) and the Thurrock Unitary Historic 
Environment Characterisation Project (2009). 
iv. Further local guidance as it is developed.  
 
3. The Council will follow the approach set out in the NPPF in the 
determination of applications affecting Thurrock’s built or Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015

 archaeological heritage assets including the expectation that the 
relevant historic environment record will be consulted and the heritage 
asset(s) assessed using appropriate expertise where necessary.  This 
will include consideration of alterations, extensions or demolition of 
Listed Buildings or the demolition of unlisted buildings within 
Conservation Areas, and requirements for pre-determination 
archaeological evaluations and for preservation of archaeology in situ 
or by recording.

 PMD5 – OPEN SPACES, OUTDOOR SPORTS AND 
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES  
 
Introduction 
 
6.21 Open spaces, outdoor sports and recreational facilities contribute to 
national objectives to promote social inclusion and community 
cohesion, mental and physical health and wellbeing, and regeneration. 
They also often contribute to biodiversity, nature conservation and 
other multi-functional uses in the Borough. The existing facilities in 
Thurrock are important assets which serve the communities in which 
they are located; their importance relates not only to their function but 
also to their amenity value, contribution to local character and 
distinctiveness and to Thurrock’s Greengrid.  
 
6.22 The provision of high quality, well managed and accessible open 
spaces, outdoor sports and recreational facilities is central, therefore, to 
Thurrock’s aim of improving the sense of place in the Borough and 
enabling the community to benefit from sport and leisure activities. 
These facilities will help address local deficiencies and needs. In 
addition, developer contributions will also be expected to address 
Borough wide Greengrid requirements (Policies CSTP18 and PMD16).  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.23 The NPPF states that planning policies for open space, sports and 
recreational facilities should be based on robust and up-to-date need 
assessments.  Thurrock Council undertook quantitative and qualitative 
assessments of existing local provision and deficiencies in open space 
in the Community Needs and Open Spaces Study  (2005).  The findings 
inform local policy and strategy development, and enable the 
determination of locally derived standards of provision. The study has 
informed the Thurrock Open Spaces Strategy 2006-2011  and the 
related Play Strategy for Thurrock: The Thurrock Play Partnership 
2007-2017.  
 
6.24 Thurrock’s Refreshed Cultural Strategy  (2006) also recognises that 
sports events, facilities and development, clubs, health and wellbeing 
initiatives, physical activity, parks and open spaces, children’s play, 
playgrounds and play activities all contribute towards the cultural life of 
Thurrock and are important elements in enriching the quality of life of 
residents and improving the economic prospects of the area. 
 
6.25 The Sports and Active Recreation Strategy for Thurrock  (Thurrock 
Council, TTGDC and Sport England, 2010) amplifies previous work, 
such as the Thurrock Open Space Strategy 2006-2011 , with the 
objective of ensuring that the Borough has a sports and active 
recreation facility infrastructure which meet the needs of existing and 
future residents and visitors.

 6.26 The Council has commissioned a Thurrock Outdoor Sports Strategy 
which refers to the extent and nature of deficiencies in outdoor sport 
provision in the Borough. 
 
 
PMD5 – OPEN SPACES, OUTDOOR SPORTS AND RECREATIONAL 
FACILITIES 
EXISTING FACILTITES  
 
1. The Council will safeguard all existing open spaces, outdoor sports and 
recreational facilities. Development proposals that would result in their 
complete or partial loss or cause or worsen a deficiency in the area served 
by the space or facility will not be permitted unless: 
 
i. conveniently located and accessible alternative facilities of an 
equivalent or improved standard will be provided to serve current 
and potential new users; or improvements to remaining spaces or 
facilities can be provided to a level sufficient to outweigh the loss;  
ii. proposals would not negatively affect the character of the area 
and/or the Greengrid. 
 
Any alternative and improved facilities should be available for use before an 
existing open space or facility is lost.  
 
2. The Council may also allow: 
 
i.     a partial loss of an open space or outdoor sports pitch site, where 
that partial loss would be due to the development of facilities 
ancillary to the use of that space or site (e.g. changing rooms) and 
would not result in a loss in the quality or number of pitches provided 
and their use; or 
ii.   the redevelopment of an existing open space, outdoor sports or 
recreational facility where redevelopment would incorporate a type 
of open space, outdoor sports, or recreational facility for which there 
is greater need.  
 
NEW DEVELOPMENT 
 
3.   Proposed development must ensure that: 
 
i. New open spaces, outdoor sports and recreational facilities are 
provided in accordance with adopted standards to meet the needs of 
the development and to address deficiencies.  
ii. New facilities are fully integrated into the design of development 
schemes as an element of place making.  
iii. Facilities are safe and easily accessible to all.     
 
Where the Council considers that provision on-site is not feasible or 
appropriate, it will require developer contributions to improve existing, or 
provide new, spaces or facilities elsewhere.

 STANDARDS  
 
4. The standards for the quantity and quality of open spaces, sports and 
recreational facilities and accessibility to them that the Council will require 
to be met are set out in the Layout and Standards SPD (Appendix 5 
provides current standards). Consideration should also be given to the 
Design and Sustainability SPD and the Developer Contributions SPD, 
which provide related information.  
 
5. In addition, the Council has the following specific requirements:  
 
I. Children’s Play Space:  
 
i. Residential development resulting in a net increase in dwellings of 
two or more bedrooms will be required to contribute to the provision 
of Children’s Play Space.  
ii. Local Areas for Play (LAP’s) should be provided on-site, unless this 
is proven to be impracticable given site constraints.  
iii. LAP’s should be located in a position close to the homes of 
residents, where they will be safe and secure, as these play spaces 
are for very young children.   
iv. Local Equipped Area for Play (LEAP’s) and Neighbourhood 
Equipped Area for Play (NEAP) may be located on-site or off-site, 
depending on local requirements. Where provision will be off-site, 
developer contributions will be required.  
 
II. Outdoor Sport Facilities (including playing pitches, courts and 
greens):  
 
i. New developments will be required to contribute to the provision of 
appropriate outdoor sports facilities.   
ii. All sports and recreational facilities are required to incorporate 
appropriate ancillary facilities, such as changing rooms and parking 
to ensure access for the whole community.  
 
III. Allotments:  
 
i. The redevelopment of existing allotment sites for other uses will only 
be permitted where it can clearly be shown that the facility is no 
longer required or that it can be adequately and conveniently 
replaced elsewhere without a loss of biodiversity value.    
 
IV. Exemptions: 
 
i. Sheltered dwellings, nursing and residential homes, residential 
extensions and annexes, and temporary dwellings will not be 
required to provide or contribute towards Children’s Play Space, 
Outdoor Sports Facilities or Allotments. 
ii. Redevelopment schemes where there is no net gain in the number of 
bed spaces will also be exempt from the provisions of 5(I), 5(II) and 5 
(III) above. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 PMD6 – DEVELOPMENT IN THE GREEN BELT  
 
 Introduction 
 
6.27 Approximately 60% of the total land within Thurrock is designated as 
Metropolitan Green Belt. The Council considers it important to provide 
robust strategic and management of development policies to ensure 
the delivery of high quality development throughout the Borough.  
 
6.28 A problem frequently associated with the urban fringe in the Green Belt 
is the growing demand for horse-keeping facilities. Horse riding as an 
activity requires significant areas of open land and there is a demand 
for a variety of facilities for this use, ranging from commercial riding 
schools to domestic stables. In land use terms, the main difference 
between private and commercial stabling is that the level of activity and 
size and number of buildings generated by commercial establishments 
tends to be much greater and makes the siting of such developments 
particularly sensitive. Traffic generation and car parking requirements 
associated with such uses also need to be the subject of careful 
consideration.  
 
6.29 Planning applications for stud farms and livery stables are often 
accompanied by the request for a dwelling for security reasons. It is a 
principle of Green Belt policy guidance that development should not be 
permitted, which will generate additional employment resulting in the 
demand for new dwellings.  
 
6.30 With regard to stables, the standard of one horse per 0.6 ha of grazing 
land is required in order that the land is not over-grazed and thus 
remains self-sufficient in terms of food supply. It is the standard 
recommended by the British Horse Society. Over-grazing causes visual 
and ecological harm to the landscape, and the importation of 
feedstocks permits an over intense use of land and a greater presence 
of stable buildings. Application of the standard will ensure that the 
number of stables present on a site is ancillary to the use of the land for 
grazing.    
 
6.31 There are a number of localities within the Green Belt, comprising well 
defined frontages of tightly knit development identified by the Council 
as Established Residential Frontages, where there can be some 
relaxation of normal Green Belt Policy without harm to the objectives of 
the Green Belt.   
 
6.32 Although generally open in character the Green Belt contains various 
buildings which should only be developed or redeveloped in ways 
consistent with the objectives of Green Belt policy.  This policy sets out 
clear guidance on the types of development that will be permitted within 
Thurrock’s Green Belt and the reasonable limitations that will apply to 
those developments.

 Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.33 The Green Belt in Thurrock is protected and maintained though the 
principles set out in Government guidance.  The Council will produce a 
Supplementary Planning Document to provide guidance on how the 
Council will define disproportionate additions and materially larger 
replacement buildings.  The Thurrock Greengrid Strategy  principle puts 
the natural environment at the centre of land use management and 
development in Thurrock. 
 
PMD6 – DEVELOPMENT IN THE G REEN BELT  
The Council will maintain, protect and enhance the open character of the 
Green Belt in Thurrock in accordance with the provisions of the NPPF.  The 
Council will plan positively to enhance the beneficial use of the Green Belt by 
looking for opportunities to provide access to the countryside, provide 
opportunities for outdoor sport and recreation, to retain and enhance 
landscapes, visual amenity and biodiversity, and to  improve damaged and 
derelict land.  
 
Planning permission will only be granted for new development in the Green 
Belt provided it meets as appropriate the requirements of the NPPF, other 
policies in this DPD, and the following: 
 
1. Extensions  
i.  The extension of a building must not result in disproportionate additions 
over and above the size of the original building.  In the case of residential 
extensions this means no larger than two reasonably sized rooms or any 
equivalent amount. 
 
ii.  The extension of the curtilage of a residential property which involves an 
incursion into the Green Belt will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that very special circumstances apply. 
 
2. Replacement Buildings  
i.  Replacement dwellings in the Green Belt will only be permitted provided 
that the replacement dwelling is not materially larger than the original 
building. 
ii.  The replacement of other buildings shall only be for the same use, and the 
replacement building shall not be materially larger than the one it 
replaces. 
 
3. Established Residential Frontages 
i.  Where an established frontage of residential development exists in the 
Green Belt, planning permission will be granted, subject to compliance 
with all other relevant policies in this plan, for new dwellings on genuine 
infill plots and the replacement of existing dwellings and the extension of 
existing dwellings located on the existing frontage only.   Replacement 
dwellings and extensions to existing dwellings will not be subject to the 
size limitations contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this policy.  
Established frontages of residential development in the Green Belt are 
identified on the Interim Adopted Proposals Map. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
197 
 4. Re-Use and Adaptation of Buildings  
I. The re-use and adaptation of buildings for residential, employment, 
leisure or community use will be permitted, provided the following 
criteria are met: 
i. The building is of a permanent and substantial construction and 
does not require significant rebuilding before it can be put to its 
proposed use; 
ii. The building should not detract from the character and 
appearance of the locality after implementation of the new use. 
The bulk, form and general design of the building must reflect 
its surroundings; 
iii. The proposed use can be fully contained in the building and 
would not require extensive new buildings or inappropriate use 
of open areas; 
iv. The use does not have a materially greater impact than the 
present use on the openness of the Green Belt or amenities of 
the area by reason of noise, visual intrusion, traffic generation, 
fumes, dust or other forms of nuisance. 
 
II. Re-use or adaptation of existing farm buildings for non-agricultural 
purposes will not automatically result in permission being granted to 
erect additional buildings to accommodate the displaced agricultural 
uses. Where permission for re-use or adaptation is granted, the Council 
will consider attaching a condition that removes permitted development 
rights for new farm buildings on the agricultural holding. The following 
factors will be considered when applying such a condition: 
 
i. The openness and landscape value of the agricultural holding 
and surrounding area; and 
ii. The grouping and/or dispersion of existing buildings on the 
agricultural holding and in the vicinity; 
iii. The size of the holding and the ability to disperse new 
agricultural buildings widely within it. 
 
5. Equestrian Facilities 
i. The Council will expect stables to be located in existing buildings 
wherever possible. New buildings will only be permitted where there 
are no suitable existing buildings. 
ii. Stables will only be permitted where they are requisite to the use of 
the land for grazing.  The Council will only permit one stable per 0.6 
hectares (1.5 acres)4 of grazing land and the stable must be on, or 
immediately adjacent to, the grazing land. 
iii. Stud farms, riding schools and other large-scale commercial 
equestrian facilities will only be permitted in the Green Belt where they 
use existing buildings.  
iv. Permission will not be given for additional housing in association with 
stables.

198 
 6. Infilling and partial or complete redevelopment of a previously 
developed site comprising more than a single building, and located 
outside of Established Residential Frontages 
I.  Infilling should: 
 
i. have no greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt and 
the purpose of including land within it than the existing 
development 
ii. not exceed the height of the existing buildings discounting any 
abnormally tall existing structures; and 
iii. not lead to a major increase in the developed proportion of the 
site. 
 
II.  Redevelopment should: 
 
i. have no greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt and the 
purpose of including land within it than the existing development 
taking into account any proposed enclosure of open land 
ii. contribute to the achievement of the objectives for the use of land 
in the Green Belt 
iii. not exceed the height of the existing buildings discounting any  
abnormally tall existing structures 
iv. not occupy a larger area of the site than the existing buildings 
unless this would achieve a reduction in height which would benefit 
visual amenity, and 
v. satisfactorily integrate with its landscape surroundings and, where 
it may be appropriate in order to meet that objective, buildings 
should be sited closer to existing buildings. 
 
The relevant area for the purposes of II iv above is the aggregate ground 
floor area of the existing buildings excluding temporary buildings.  Any 
buildings demolished prior to the grant of permission for redevelopment will 
not count as developed area.   
 
The Council will expect the site to be considered as a whole, whether or not 
all buildings are to be redeveloped, and the floor area limitation at II iv above 
relates to the redevelopment of the entire site.  Any proposals for partial 
redevelopment should be put forward in the context of comprehensive, long-
term plans for the site as a whole. 
 
In granting permission the Council may impose conditions to ensure that 
buildings which are not to be permanently retained are demolished as new 
buildings are erected in order to keep the total development area under 
control so that there is no adverse effect on openness. 
 
7.  Agricultural and Forestry dwellings 
 
I.  Permanent agricultural dwellings 
 
New permanent dwellings will be allowed on well-established agricultural 
units to support existing agricultural activities providing all of the following are Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
199 
 met:- 
 
i. there is a clearly established existing functional need for one or 
more workers to be readily available at most times on the unit. 
ii. the need relates to a full time worker, or one who is primarily 
employed in agriculture and does not relate to a part-time 
requirement. 
iii. the unit and activity concerned:- have been established for at least 
three years; have been profitable for at least one of them; are 
currently financially sound; and have a clear prospect of remaining 
so. 
iv. the functional need could not be fulfilled by another existing 
dwelling on the unit, or any other existing accommodation in the 
area which is suitable and available for occupation by the 
worker(s) concerned. 
v. the proposed dwelling is of a size commensurate with the 
established functional requirement. 
vi. the proposed dwelling would be sited so as to meet the identified 
functional need, and be well-related to existing farm buildings or 
other dwellings, and; 
vii. the relevant requirements of the Council’s policies for management 
of development are met. 
 
In relation to (i) above such need will be considered to exist if workers are 
needed to be on hand day and night in case animals or agricultural 
processes require essential care at short notice, or to deal quickly with 
emergencies that could otherwise cause serious loss of crops or products 
and pose a substantial threat to the financial soundness of the unit.   
 
The protection of livestock from theft or injury by intruders may contribute on 
animal welfare grounds to the need for a new dwelling but will not by itself be 
considered sufficient to justify one.  Requirements arising from food 
processing, as opposed to agriculture, will not be considered justification for 
a new dwelling. 
 
If any dwelling(s) or building(s) suitable for conversion to dwellings have 
recently been sold separately from the farmland concerned this will be 
considered as evidence of a lack of agricultural need. 
 
In relation to (v) above dwellings that are unusually large in relation to the 
agricultural needs of the unit, or unusually expensive to construct in relation 
to the income the unit can sustain in the long term will not be permitted.  The 
relevant consideration will be the requirements of the enterprise rather than 
those of the owner or occupier.  The planning permission for a dwelling will 
be made subject to a condition removing ‘permitted development’ rights for 
enlargement in order to ensure that a dwelling once built does not exceed a 
size commensurate with the established functional requirement.   
 
II.  Temporary agricultural dwellings 
 
If a new dwelling is essential to support a new farming activity, whether on a Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
200 
 newly created agricultural unit or an established one, the Council will only 
permit this to be provided by way of a caravan or other temporary removable 
accommodation. 
 
Temporary accommodation will only be permitted if all of the following are 
met:- 
 
i. there is a functional need for the dwelling which could not be 
fulfilled by another existing dwelling on the unit, or any other 
existing accommodation in the area which is suitable and available 
for occupation by the worker(s) concerned; 
ii. there is clear evidence of a firm intention and ability to develop the 
enterprise and it has been planned on a sound financial basis; 
iii. the relevant requirements of the Council’s policies for the 
management of development are met. 
 
Such accommodation will only be permitted to be present on the agricultural 
unit for a maximum of four years, unless by this time permission has been 
granted for a permanent agricultural dwelling and that dwelling is the subject 
of sustained construction activity.  In such case the Council will grant further 
time limited permissions for the temporary accommodation until the 
permanent dwelling is habitable or the Council considers the dwelling is no 
longer the subject of sustained construction activity. 
 
III.  Forestry dwellings 
 
The Council does not envisage that requirements for forestry worker 
accommodation will arise, but should they do so this policy will equally apply. 
 
IV.  Occupancy restrictions 
 
In order to ensure that any permitted agricultural dwelling is kept available for 
meeting the need for such accommodation for so long as it exists planning 
permission for such accommodation will be subject to an appropriate 
occupancy condition limiting occupation to a person solely or mainly working, 
or last working, in the locality in agriculture or forestry, or a widow or widower 
of such a person, and to any resident dependents.  The Council will not 
agree to the removal of such conditions unless it has been satisfactorily 
demonstrated that there is no longer any need on the particular holding and 
in the area for a dwelling for someone solely, mainly or last working in 
agriculture.  Those seeking removal will be expected to show that for the 
period of two years preceding the planning application for removal of the 
condition, sustained and appropriately targeted efforts to sell or rent the 
premises on terms reflecting the encumbrance of the agricultural occupancy 
condition have been made with no success.  The Council will not consider 
this requirement to have been met unless the property has been marketed 
for the duration of this period at a discount of at least 35% against open 
market price.  The Council will not agree to the removal of occupancy 
conditions from temporary accommodation.

 8.  Definitions and Limitations  
 
In considering whether a proposal complies with the above: 
 
i. account will only be taken of lawful existing buildings,  
ii. for the purposes of paragraph 1 and 2 ‘original building’ means in 
relation to a building existing on 1st July 1948, as existing on that 
date, and in relation to a building built on or after 1st July 1948, as 
so built.  Any building which is itself a replacement building will not 
be considered to be an original building for the purposes of this 
policy and the acceptability or otherwise of any proposals for 
further extension or replacement will be judged by reference to the 
‘original building’ which preceded it.  If the exact size of this 
previous building is unknown the redevelopment of a replacement 
dwelling will be limited to a like for like replacement,  
iii. for the purposes of paragraph 6 a ‘previously developed site’ is 
one which is, or was, occupied by a permanent structure, including 
the curtilage of the developed land and any associated fixed 
surface infrastructure, but excludes the site of agricultural or 
forestry buildings, land that has been developed for minerals 
extraction or waste disposal by landfill purposes where provision 
for restoration has been made through development control 
procedures, and land that was previously developed but where the 
remains of the permanent structure or fixed surface structure have 
blended into the landscape in the process of time.

 PMD7 – BIODIVERSITY, GEOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND 
DEVELOPMENT  
 
Introduction  
 
6.34 The NPPF states that pursuing sustainable development involves 
seeking positive improvements in the quality of the natural 
environment, moving from a net loss of bio-diversity to achieving net 
gains for nature.  It further states that the planning system should 
contribute to and enhance the natural environment by minimising 
impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in biodiversity where 
possible.  Thurrock Council is committed to this vision and will protect 
and enhance all of its designated biodiversity sites, such as Ramsar 
sites, Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Local Wildlife Sites 
and Local Nature Reserves in accordance with the requirements of the 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (2006) and the NPPF.  
The protection and management of the internationally designated 
(Ramsar) site within Thurrock is achieved by a combination of the 
provisions in the Habitat Regulations and Section 28 of the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981 as amended by the Countryside and Rights of 
Way Act 2000. 
 
6.35 With respect to SSSIs, the NPPF indicates that where a proposed 
development on land within or outside a SSSI is likely to have an 
adverse effect on an SSSI, planning permission should not normally be 
permitted.  Where an adverse effect on the site’s notified special 
interest features is likely, an exception should only be made where the 
benefits of the development, at the site, clearly outweigh both the 
adverse impacts that it is likely to have on those features and any 
broader impacts on the national network of SSSIs. 
 
6.36 Designated biodiversity sites are an important constituent of Thurrock’s 
green assets, and contribute to the Borough’s Greengrid. Within the 
Borough, there are a significant number of these sites that contains 
species of principal importance, e.g. UKBAP or Red Data Book 
species. In addition to designated biodiversity sites, there are a number 
of brownfield sites which include biodiversity value and species of 
principal importance. The biodiversity value within these sites also 
contributes to the green assets of the Borough and requires protection 
from the impacts of development. Thurrock Council is committed to 
conserving and enhancing biodiversity and geodiversity on non-
designated sites and also the habitat of species of principal importance.  
 
6.37 Thurrock Council intends to conserve and enhance its green assets, 
through appropriate design and management, and will seek to ensure 
the integrity of the biodiversity network within the Borough. Designated 
Biodiversity Sites within the Borough will be included in the Adopted 
Site Specific Allocations and Policies DPD and identified on the 
Proposals Map.

 Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.38 The Council’s Thurrock Biodiversity Action Plan 2007-2012 , Thurrock 
Biodiversity Study 2006-2011 aims to identify and conserve priority 
specifies and habitats in Thurrock. 
 
PMD7 – BIODIVERSITY , GEOLOGICAL CONSERVATION  AND 
DEVELOPMENT  
1. Development proposals will be required to demonstrate that any 
significant biodiversity habitat or geological interest of recognised local 
value is retained and enhanced on-site.  Where it can be demonstrated 
that this is not possible, and there is no suitable alternative site available 
for the development, developers will be required to show that their 
proposals would mitigate any loss of biodiversity or geological interest.  
In circumstances where it ca n be demonstrated that neither retention on 
site nor mitigation is possible, developers will be required to provide 
appropriate compensation for any significant loss of biodiversity or 
geological interest, such that there is no overall net loss of biodiversity 
habitat or features of geological conservation interest in Thurrock.  The 
Council will seek to achieve net gains in biodiversity where such gains 
would be possible, with particular reference to the desirability of re-
creating priority habitats and the recovery of priority species. 
 
2. The Council will not permit development that would result in the loss, or 
partial loss, of a locally designated biodiversity or geological site, except 
in exceptional circumstances where it can be demonstrated that there is 
no alternative, subject to the sequential approach outlined in (1) above. 
 
3. To enable the Council to determine an application which would result in 
a loss of biodiversity or geological value, the developer will be required 
to submit a detailed justification setting out: 
 
i. why the loss is considered to be unavoidable 
ii. an assessment of what species and habitat would be lost or 
adversely affected as a result of development (including an 
ecological survey where appropriate) 
iii. how the loss or adverse effect is proposed to be mitigated on-
site through habitat restoration or creation; and/or 
compensated for through the acquisition and management of a 
suitable site within the area, or a financial contribution towards 
the purchase and management of such a site or management 
of an existing site to bring it up to a necessary standard. 
 
4. Thurrock Council will require development proposals to incorporate 
biodiversity or geological features into the design as far as possible.  
These may include green roofs, brown roofs and the creation of green 
corridors for wildlife. 
 
  5.  Where it is necessary to secure the biodiversity or geological interest of

 PMD8 - PARKING STANDARDS  
 
Introduction 
 
6.39 The availability and design of car parking are integral to a number of 
challenges in Thurrock, including the need to promote alternatives to 
private car use (modal shift), make the best use of land given the high 
levels of growth being planned and the constraints of the Green Belt, 
and tackle high levels of vehicle crime. These challenges are 
particularly pressing in the Thurrock Urban Area. The Core Strategy 
policy CSTP14: Transport in the Thurrock Urban Area clearly states the 
importance of a policy approach to car parking and the need to link 
availability with levels of accessibility in order to support efforts to 
achieve a modal shift.  The NPPF advises that when setting local 
parking standards local planning authorities should take into account 
accessibility, the type, mix and use of development, the availability of 
and opportunities for public transport, local car ownership levels, and 
the overall need to reduce the use of high-emission vehicles. 
 
6.40 A challenge that has become increasingly evident in Thurrock is the 
need to address the issues in residential areas of degraded street 
scenes and impeded access for service and passenger transport 
vehicles that can happen where limited car parking availability has not 
discouraged car ownership and has instead displaced vehicle parking 
onto surrounding roads5. Indeed, with only 1 in 5 households in 
Thurrock having no car or van, and an average of 1.2 cars or vans per 
household6, it is apparent that to avoid such displacement new 
development will need to provide sufficient residential car parking.  
Research7 has shown that, according to house buyers, attempts to 
restrict parking in order to curb car ownership had little or no impact on 
the number of cars a household would acquire. 
   
6.41 The policy will ensure a level of good quality and safe parking that is 
sufficient for the accessibility needs of development in Thurrock, taking 
into account the levels of accessibility by sustainable transport modes, 
the need to promote modal shift and the need to provide adequate 
access for service and public transport vehicles.

 Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.42 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  recognises the need to 
manage the availability of car parking, especially non-residential, in 
order to promote modal shift and tackle congestion. In particular the 
strategy proposes applying maximum parking standards for new 
commercial development and that in the Thurrock Urban Area the 
Council may apply tighter restrictions.  The Sustainable Communities 
Strategy (Thurrock LSP 2009 ) priority sets out that roads, public 
transport networks and housing will be enhanced so that local people 
have better access to employment opportunities, other amenities and 
affordable housing. 
 
PMD8 – PARKING STANDARDS  
All development will be required to comply with the car parking standards set 
out in the Layout and Standards SPD. For residential developments the 
standards comprise of ranges within maximum and minimum levels of 
provision dependant on defined circumstances.  For non-residential uses 
maximum standards apply. 
 
1. In those parts of Thurrock which have good levels of car parking 
enforcement available, coupled with high levels of accessibility, reduced 
standards for residential and non-residential car parking will be applied.  
 
2. Additionally, in other parts of the Thurrock Urban Area where the Council 
considers the potential substantial modal shift is clearly demonstrated by 
the Transport Assessment/Statement and Travel Plans, the reduced 
maximum standard for non-residential car parking and reduced minimum 
standards for residential car parking will be applied. Where the reduced 
standards are applied, the Council will require developer contributions to 
support the development of controlled parking zones, the enforcement of 
parking restrictions and car-free living, and other measures to reduce 
inappropriate on-street parking.  
 
3. The Council will require developers to use the relevant residential 
carparking standard in conjunction with suitable physical design to reduce 
the risk of inappropriate on-street parking, thereby avoiding a street scene 
dominated by cars while maintaining access for service and emergency 
vehicles.  
 
4. Development will be required to facilitate more equitable access and 
sustainable transport modes through the provision of at least the minimum 
levels of parking, as specified in the Thurrock Parking Standards 
Guidance,  for: 
i. Cycles 
ii. Powered two-wheelers 
iii. Disabled car users 
iv. Electric and other low emission vehicles 
 
5. Subject to the above framework, vehicle parking provision will only be 
permitted where it is safe and of a high design quality, including where it is Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

 either: 
i. Overlooked from within dwellings 
ii. Managed and monitored from commercial premises 
iii. Openly visible from the public highway, or 
iv. Planned on-street provision

 PMD9 - ROAD NETWORK HIERARCHY 
 
Introduction 
 
6.43 The inclusion of this policy is needed to ensure that access 
requirements are appropriately considered when determining planning 
applications. In addition, policy CSTP17: Strategic Freight Movement 
and Access to Ports identifies the need for freight traffic to keep to the 
most suitable routes in order to reduce adverse impacts on amenity, 
the environment, sustainable transport modes, and the integrity of the 
highway itself.   
 
6.44 Relevant local issues focus around congestion on the Strategic Road 
Network, particularly the A13, and on key local roads such as A1306 
and the potential for this to worsen with the growth that needs to be 
accommodated in Thurrock. In addition, many of the roads in Thurrock, 
especially in rural areas, are minor and unclassified and generally 
unsuitable for large vehicles or heavy traffic flows.  
 
6.45 This policy ensures that proposals for development affecting the 
highway will be considered in relation to the road network hierarchy 
and the function of each level of that hierarchy. The aim is to enhance 
the street scene and to mitigate adverse impacts on the transport 
system, which includes impacts on capacity, safety, air quality, and 
noise. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.46 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  aims to deliver network 
efficiency and traffic network management improvements before 
increasing capacity. With regard to HGVs, the strategy recognises the 
need for delivering goods, but that this needs to be reconciled with 
social and environmental concerns and other distribution issues.  The 
Sustainable Communities Strategy (Thurrock LSP 2009 ) priority sets 
out that roads, public transport networks and housing will be enhanced 
so that local people have better access to employment opportunities, 
other amenities and affordable housing. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)

209 
  
Definitions of the Road Network Hierarchy 
  
Level 1 routes (Corridors of Movement) comprise: 
 Strategic Non-Trunk Roads. These serve to facilitate traffic movement between 
major centres within the region. This category would include any roads of 
regional significance as described in the East of England Plan or future 
Government advice on the road network. 
 Rural/Urban Distributors. These allow traffic to move freely and safely between 
local centres and from local centres to the major road network, within some 
local centres these distributors may be defined as streets. 
 
Level 2 routes (Urban and Rural Roads/Streets) comprise roads that serve as main 
connections between substantial rural populations and the minor road network and 
act as through roads to distribute traffic to residential areas within urban 
conurbations. 
 
Level 3 routes (Local Roads and Streets) comprise: 
 Access Roads/Streets.  These provide secondary links to villages and large 
towns forming minor distributors and access to individual properties. 
 Residential Estate Roads/Streets . The layout and design of estate roads is 
covered in the Layout and Standards SPD 
 
 
PMD9 – ROAD NETWORK HIERARCHY  
1. Routes of all levels  
 
The Council will only permit the development of new  accesses or increased 
use of existing accesses where: 
i. There is no possibility of safe access taken from an existing or 
proposed lower category road 
ii. The design of the development minimises the number of accesses 
required.  
iii. The development makes a positive contribution to road safety or 
road safety is not prejudiced. 
iv. The development preserves or enhances the quality of the street 
scene. 
v. The development avoids causing congestion as measured by link 
and junction capacities. 
vi. Measures are taken to mitigate all adverse air quality impacts in or 
adjacent to Air Quality Management Areas. 
vii. The development will minimise adverse impacts on the quality of life 
of local residents, such as noise, air pollution, and the general street 
environment. 
viii. The development will make a positive contribution to accessibility by 
sustainable transport. 
 
These criteria apply to routes of all levels (1, 2 and 3). The following 
principles also apply to particular levels:

Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
210 
 2. Level 1  Routes  - Corridors of Move ment.  
 
i. There is a presumption against new accesses or the increased use 
of an existing direct access onto a Corridor of Movement.  
Development served by side roads connecting to a Corridor of 
Movement will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that 
the Corridor of Movement will not be adversely affected in terms of 
highway safety and traffic capacity . 
ii. Development will not be permitted where it impacts adversely on 
capacity and safety.  
iii. Where the Corridor of Movement comprises an Inter-urban Public 
Transport Route or provides access to one or more of the Borough’s 
ports, new accesses must not have an adverse impact on the free 
flow of traffic.  
iv. Exceptions will be made only for developments of overriding 
national importance, strategic sites allocated in this Local 
Development Plan, and strategic public transport facilities.  
 
3. Level 2 Routes - Rural Roads only 
 
i. The establishment of new accesses or increased use of existing 
direct accesses will not normally be accepted for Rural Level 2, 
except where the access is for small-scale uses permissible in the 
Green Belt which do not adversely affect road safety or limit 
capacity.   
 
ii. The Council will require that the provision of accesses is consistent 
with the Layout and Standards SPD.  In all cases any access that is 
proposed should meet current design standards. 
 
iii. Exceptions to this policy will be made for the working of minerals to 
recognise that minerals can only be worked where they occur. In 
such cases, road improvements may be sought from developers.

 PMD10 - TRANSPORT ASSESSMENTS AND TRAVEL PLANS 
 
Introduction 
 
6.47 A local management of development policy is required to support Core 
Strategy transport policies (especially CSTP14 Transport in the 
Thurrock Urban Area ) and ensure new development plays its role in 
implementing travel planning measures and the intensive application of 
Smarter Choices required by CSTP14.  
 
6.48 The intensive application of Smarter Choices has been found to reduce 
car use by up to around 10%8. This is the scale of reduction required to 
make the growth in Thurrock, especially the urban area, deliverable 
and sustainable9.  
 
6.49 The purpose of the policy is to encourage safe, healthy and sustainable 
travel options. By reducing car travel, Travel Plans/ Assessments can 
improve health and wellbeing, free up car parking space, and make a 
positive contribution to mitigating adverse impacts on the transport 
system, the environment and amenity.  Taking into account any 
proposed mitigation including provision of sustainable transport modes 
and safe and suitable access, the Council will resist development 
where the residual cumulative impacts would be severe.  Depending on 
the circumstances, this may include development proposals that would 
have a significant adverse effect on the free flow and safe movements 
of vehicular and non-vehicular traffic and/or fail to limit the use of motor 
vehicles and promote adequate alternative modes of transport. 
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.50 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021  has clear policies on the 
need for modal shift, especially in the Thurrock Urban Area, to reduce 
congestion through Smarter Choices such as school and workplace 
travel plans.  
 
PMD10 – TRANSPORT ASSESSMENTS AND TRAVEL PLANS  
Transport Assessments, Transport Statements, and Travel Plans must 
accompany planning applications in accordance with the Department for 
Transport guidance in Guidance on Transport Assessments (March 2007). 
 
i. Travel Plans must be consistent with Council policies. They will 
normally be secured through planning obligations, although planning 
conditions might suffice where this will clearly be the best option 
because the outcomes and measures required are simple and very 
clear, such as where the travel plan is for an existing use.  
 
ii. All developments that fall below the thresholds for individual Travel

 Plans will be expected to support the Council’s Smarter Choices 
programme or Area Wide Travel Plans.  
 
iii. Where schools add capacity through development or new schools are 
proposed, they will be required to develop a School Travel Plan or 
revise their existing Travel Plan. 
 
iv. Proposals for residential developments of 25 units or more should be 
accompanied by a ‘Safe Routes to School’ assessment.   
 
v. Development will only be permitted where the Travel Plans, Transport 
Assessments or Transport Statements are agreed by the Council and 
there is adequate provision for existing or planned transport 
infrastructure and other proposed measures.  
 
Proposed mitigation measures will either be implemented in their entirety by or 
on behalf of the developer or will be implemented as part of a wider pooling of 
resources. Developers will be required to make provision for the objectives of 
the agreed Travel Plans to be monitored. Agreed Travel Plans will include 
targets, coupled with penalties if outcomes are not being met. 
 
Where adequate affordable mitigation is not secured or achievable and the 
residual cumulative impacts of development proposals are likely to be severe, 
such developments will be resisted.

 PMD11 - FREIGHT MOVEMENT 
 
Introduction 
 
6.51 Thurrock is known as a logistics hub and there is considerable forecast 
growth in freight movements with development such as London 
Gateway and expansion of Tilbury Port. Road transport is likely to 
remain the main mode for freight movements in the foreseeable future.  
 
6.52 The impact of goods vehicle  traffic using unsuitable roads can be 
significant. This is a particular issue for the minerals and, to a lesser 
extent, the waste industries. Most of the roads in rural areas where 
mineral workings or landfill sites are located are usually minor and 
generally unsuitable for large vehicles. This can lead to localised 
adverse impacts on the environment, road condition, or amenity. 
Problems also arise from widespread on-street HGV parking due to 
insufficient off-street parking for HGVs. 
 
6.53 This policy aims to facilitate the movement of goods and accommodate 
the growth in freight movements in a sustainable way, by encouraging 
modal shift, and mitigating adverse impacts on residents, other 
transport users, the transport system itself, and the environment.   
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.54 The Thurrock Transport Strategy 2008 – 2021 aims to deliver a freight 
modal shift onto rail freight and water borne freight. It also recognises 
that the need for delivering goods should be reconciled with social and 
environmental concerns and other distribution issues, as well as the 
need to mitigate congestion through improving the efficiency of the 
network. The strategy also identifies the need for 24-hour lorry parks.  
 
 
PMD11 – FREIGHT MOVEMENT  
1.  Applicants for development with a need for freight movements exceeding 
the equivalent of 200 daily HGV movements will be required, as part of 
their planning applications, to produce a Sustainable Distribution Plan. This 
should include evidence that commercially viable opportunities for freight 
carried by rail, water, pipeline or conveyor have been maximised, and that 
air quality impacts have been minimised.  
 
i. In addition, applicants for development generating significant HGV 
movements or extending the period over which existing HGV 
movements will continue will be required to carry out a HGV Impact 
Assessment. This will be either stand-alone or as part of the 
Sustainable Distribution Plan and will comprise a technical appraisal of 
routes and their adequacy, taking into account the need to avoid 
sensitive areas such as unsuitable residential areas.  
 
ii. HGVs will be required, through the use of planning obligations, to use 
Corridors of Movement (see Policy PMD9 and its associated map) in Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
214 
 preference to roads further down the Council’s Road Network 
Hierarchy.  
 
iii. Development generating significant levels of HGV traffic will only be 
permitted where they have access to Corridors of Movement on roads 
that are suitable or can be improved to a standard that will make them 
suitable for the level and type of HGV traffic the development is likely to 
generate and where the access would not be contrary to Policy PMD 9. 
 
iv. Through the use of planning obligations, developers will be expected to 
fund any road improvements that are required if existing routes are not 
entirely suitable and contribute towards area-wide transport 
improvement programmes in order to mitigate any potential/wider 
adverse impact of the development. 
 
2. i. For B1, B2 and B8 developments in excess of 30,000 sqm, planning 
obligations for Vehicle Booking Systems will be secured as part of the 
overall Sustainable Distribution Plan, ensuring that the site cannot be 
used by any operator, until a Vehicle Booking System has been set up 
for that operator. This will be used as a mechanism to manage access 
onto designated routes during peak periods in order to manage road 
capacity. Designated routes will include the A13, A1089, A1306 and 
A1014. 
 
ii. B1, B2 and B8 developments in excess of 30,000 sqm will only be 
permitted where adequate facilities are provided for drivers of 
commercial vehicles.  Where 24-hour operation is permitted for such 
developments, provision must be made for overnight parking for goods 
vehicles in accordance with the Layout and Standards SPD 
 
3. Adequate on-site loading/unloading and manoeuvring space will be 
required in all circumstances in accordance with the Layout and Standards 
SPD.

 PMD12 – SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS   
 
Introduction  
 
6.55 Employment and housing growth and its associated development can 
have serious implications for climate change. Thurrock has a 
designated growth of at least 18,500 new homes and up to a further 
4750 dwellings to meet provision to 2026 and beyond and an indicative 
figure of 26,000 new jobs over the plan period which is likely to 
increase emissions from domestic, industrial, commercial and transport 
sectors. Currently, over 70% of all CO 2 emissions in Thurrock arise 
from gas and electricity consumption, which is where stringent 
standards can ensure that growth in total energy consumption within 
the Borough is minimised, whilst still allowing for economic and housing 
growth.  
 
6.56 The East of England is the driest region in England and water resource 
availability is limited. Average household per capita water consumption 
in Thurrock 2006-2007 was 155 litres a day, 5% higher than the 
national average of 148 litres. As such, water is likely to become a 
scarce resource as a result of significant growth pressures coupled with 
climate change.  
 
6.57 This policy will provide an opportunity to promote new techniques in 
design and renewable energy in residential and non-residential 
buildings. To achieve this in Thurrock, the Council will ensure that 
developments will be made sustainable by securing the use of 
sustainable construction techniques. This will help to reduce waste and 
carbon emissions; encourage better use of water and energy; and 
reduce environmental impact and increase efficiency of construction 
industry.  
 
6.58 The Code for Sustainable Homes is an environmental assessment 
method for rating and certifying the performance of new homes against 
a range of design categories including energy performance.  Although 
devised as a voluntary rating system to foster a step change in 
sustainable building practice for new homes the intent was that the 
code would signal the future direction of Building Regulations in relation 
to carbon emissions ultimately leading to the goal that all new homes 
would be ‘Zero Carbon’ by 2016.  However the definition of ‘Zero 
Carbon’ which is separately emerging for the purposes of national 
regulation is diverging from that defined by level 6 of the Code.  The 
Council considers that requiring residential development to comply with 
level 4 of the Code in tandem with other policy requirements set out in 
this DPD and the future national requirement for homes to be ‘Zero 
Carbon’ by 2016 is the most appropriate means to ensure that homes 
in Thurrock are built to a satisfactory standard against a range of 
sustainability considerations.

216 
 6.59 The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment 
Method (BREEAM) is the environmental assessment tool adopted and 
currently used by many local authorities and Government agencies, to 
ensure overall environmental performance of non-residential 
developments are achieved and carbon emissions are reduced. In 
2008 the Building Research Establishment (BRE) introduced 
mandatory minimum requirements for energy and water consumption 
and a new ‘Outstanding’ classification as part of BREEAM. To achieve 
this rating, an overall score of 85% must be achieved.   
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
  
6.60 The  Thurrock Climate Change Evidence Base shows that industrial and 
commercial emissions in Thurrock are particularly high – double 
national levels and 166% higher than regional levels. Industrial and 
commercial gas and electricity consumption accounts for 33% and 21% 
of total CO 2 emissions in Thurrock respectively.  
 
6.61 The Council requires new development to achieve high sustainability 
standards to move non-residential developments towards zero-carbon 
development. In order to give developers adequate time to prepare to 
meet the eventual requirements for zero carbon development, the 
Council seeks to promote improved standards on a phased basis over 
a realistic time period. This approach will move Thurrock and 
developers closer to achieving the Government’s ambition that all new 
non-domestic buildings are zero carbon from 2019, as announced in 
the 2008 Budget.  
 
 
 
PMD12 – SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS  
In determining planning applications for new development, the following 
criteria must be met:  
 
1. Residential  
Proposals for new or conversion to residential development must 
achieve a “Code for Sustainable Homes” level 4 rating, except in 
respect of any of the Code’s requirements that have been officially 
superseded by mandatory national standards. 
 
In meeting the above requirement the Council will require the following  
credits to be achieved as a minimum in the respective design 
categories: 
 
i. External Water Consumption: 1 credit 
ii. Management of surface water run-off from developments: 2 
credits 
iii. Ecology: 4 credits  
 
2. Non-residential (including Expansions or Extensions) over 1000m2  
Proposals for non-residential development must achieve, as a minimum, Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
217 
 the following BREEAM standards (or equivalent), where appropriate: 
 BREEAM Very Good up to 2016; 
 BREEAM Excellent from 2016;  
 BREEAM Outstanding from 2019 (in addition to national 
standards for zero carbon). 
 
These requirements may be relaxed where the developer is able to 
prove that these requirements will be economically unviable, rendering 
development of the site undeliverable. 
 
3.  Proposals for development will be required to submit an Energy and 
Water Statement in support of planning applications. The statements will 
be expected to show how the proposed development would: 
 
i. Minimise water consumption; 
ii. Minimise energy consumption;  
iii. Maximise water efficiency and water recycling 
iv. Maximise the use of recycled materials and sustainably 
sourced materials; and  
v. Minimise waste and maximise recycling during construction 
and after completion.   
 
Further details of these requirements will be set out in the forthcoming 
Design and Standards DPD.

 PMD13 – DECENTRALISED, RENEWABLE AND LOW-CARBON 
ENERGY GENERATION  
 
Introduction  
 
6.62 Decentralised energy is a broad term used to denote a diverse range of 
technologies, including micro-renewables, which can locally serve an 
individual building, development or wider community and includes 
heating and cooling energy. Decentralised energy is supplied from 
local, renewable and/or low-carbon sources (i.e. on-site and near-site, 
but not remote off-site) and is usually of a relatively small scale.10  
 
6.63 The Council seeks to increase the proportion of renewable and low-
carbon energy generation within the Borough to reduce the 
consumption of fossil fuels and the carbon footprint. New development 
presents the best opportunity to secure decentralised, renewable or 
low-carbon energy sources such as on-site renewable energy 
generation technologies and district energy networks which are more 
cost effective to fit at the construction stage. District energy networks 
are defined as networks of district heating, district cooling, and other 
district energy supply systems such as electricity or biogas supply 
systems. District energy networks are supplied from local, renewable 
and/or low-carbon sources. 
 
6.64 The Council supports the provision of on-site renewable and low-
carbon energy generation in new developments and will seek to secure 
its provision. The policy aims to ensure that developers of both 
residential and non-residential developments incorporate on-site 
renewable energy technologies and low-carbon energy technologies to 
provide a proportion of the developments energy requirements to 
reduce subsequent carbon emissions.  
 
6.65 It is not always advisable to refer to specific technologies, as energy 
technologies are evolving rapidly, but for the purpose of this policy 
renewable and low-carbon energy may include wind generation, 
photovoltaic cells, passive solar heating systems, waste heat 
distribution systems, biomass and ground source heat pumps.   
 
6.66 The East of England Plan (2008) Policy ENG1 stipulates that planning 
authorities must maximise opportunities, particularly in major growth 
locations and Key Centres for Development and Change, for 
developments to set new yardsticks of performance in the use of 
energy from on-site renewable and/or decentralised renewable or low 
carbon energy sources and that, as a minimum, 10% of the energy 
consumed in new development should come from such sources.

 Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
6.67 Thurrock’s Annual Monitoring Reports confirm that decentralised 
renewable energy installations to date have been rare, with none in 
2006/07. There is scope to increase this proportion substantially. The 
Thurrock Energy Study (2010) has enabled the Council to identify 
priority locations where there is the potential for district energy 
networks, which could deliver higher proportions of renewable or low-
carbon energy.  
 
PMD13 – DECENTRALISED , RENEWABLE AND LOW -CARBON 
ENERGY GENERATION  
1. New development of 5 or more residential dwellings, or 1,000 sq metres 
or more of non-residential floorspace, must secure, as a minimum, the 
following proportions of their predicted energy from decentralised and 
renewable or low-carbon sources, unless it can be demonstrated to the 
Council’s satisfaction , by way of a full viability assessment, that this is 
not feasible or viable: 
 
 10% from 2010; 
 15% from 2015; and  
 20% from 2020.  
 
2.  Priority Locations  
 
Within the Priority Locations, the Council will: 
 
I. Require all opportunities for establishing district energy networks to be 
taken up, where they would provide higher proportions of renewable or 
low carbon energy to be delivered than in (1) above.     
 
II. Require other developments considered suitable for connection to 
existing or feasible district energy networks to be designed to enable 
connection to such networks. 
 
Where developers consider their proposals unable to feasibly or viably 
deliver, or connect to, district energy networks this will need to be 
demonstrated by way of technical appraisal and open book economic 
viability assessment.  The Council will not permit developments that 
would prejudice the provision of such networks. 
 
3.   Identification of Priority Locations 
 
I. The priority locations are those which meet any, or any combination, of 
the following conditions: 
 residential developments of 100 dwellings or more;  
 residential developments on sites larger than 2 ha; 
 non-residential developments with a total floorspace exceeding 
10,000 sq metres. 
 
II.   Smaller sites in close proximity to an existing or proposed district energy Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
220 
 network are considered priority locations if they meet any of the 
following conditions: 
 sites smaller than 20 dwellings within 50 metres of an existing or 
proposed district energy network, 
 20-30 dwellings within 100 metres of an existing or proposed 
district energy network, 
 31-40 dwellings within 150 metres of an existing or proposed 
district energy network, 
 Sites larger than 40 dwellings within 200 metres of an existing or 
proposed district energy network 
 All commercial and other non-domestic developments within 200 
metres of an existing or proposed district energy network. 
 
III. Priority Locations will be included in the Adopted Site Specific 
Allocations and Policies DPD and identified on the Proposals Map.  
Sites which are not identified as Priority Locations at adoption of the Site 
Specific Allocations and Policies DPD, but which are demonstrated 
subsequently to meet the conditions to provide district energy networks, 
will be subject to the requirements of this policy. 
 
4.  The Developer Contributions SPD and/or CIL Charging Schedule will set 
out requirements for development to contribute to securing decentralised 
energy systems.

 PMD14 – CARBON NEUTRAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
Introduction  
 
6.68 Increases in population and housing stock from growth is likely to 
increase emissions from the domestic and transport sectors, whilst job 
growth of 26,000 is likely to increase carbon dioxide emissions from the 
transport, industrial and commercial sectors. To ensure that growth in 
carbon dioxide emissions from new development is minimised, the 
Council wishes to see development become carbon neutral.  
 
6.69 Carbon neutral development means that any increased carbon dioxide 
emissions from all new development including extensions are balanced 
by savings in carbon dioxide elsewhere, by making payments into a 
Carbon Offset Fund. Any growth in CO 2 emissions will therefore be 
required to be offset through a one-off payment to the Thurrock Carbon 
Offset Fund. 
 
6.70 Developers are required to support planning applications with an 
Energy and Water Statement, as set out in PMD12 Sustainable 
Buildings.  The Council will use this statement to calculate the required 
Thurrock Carbon Offset Fund contribution. A one-off contribution will be 
required for each tonne of CO 2e11, by means of an obligation under 
section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The details of 
this obligation will be set out in the forthcoming Developer 
Contributions SPD. The Thurrock Carbon Offset Fund will be managed 
and monitored by Thurrock Council, and the Council will identify and 
manage the carbon reduction measures the Fund will look to address, 
in accordance with the Thurrock Climate Change Strategy  and the 
associated actions arising from the implementation of this strategy. The 
Thurrock Carbon Offset Fund will be subject to appropriate governance 
requirements and will be properly audited.   
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies  
 
6.71 The  Thurrock Climate Change Evidence Base (2008) shows that 
Thurrock has the highest per capita CO 2 emissions of the comparable 
Unitary Authorities and also shows that CO 2 emissions in Thurrock are 
46% higher than national levels and 58% higher than regional levels, 
based on Defra’s emissions of CO 2 for local authority areas, 2005 data. 
Thurrock Council is preparing a Thurrock Energy Study  which will be 
completed by summer 2010. The study will enable the Council to 
identify priority areas for increased levels of renewable energy and 
decentralised energy networks and to develop a local tariff for the 
Carbon Offset Fund.  
 
 
 
 
                                                
11 Carbon offsets are measured in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO 2e) and may represent

 PMD14 – CARBON NEUTRAL DEVEL OPMENT  
The Council will require developers to demonstrate that all viable energy 
efficiency measures and renewable or low-carbon technology opportunities 
have been utilised to minimise emissions, in accordance with PMD12 and 
PMD 13. Thereafter:  
 
i. Any development (whether new build, conversion or renovation) that 
would lead to a net increase in carbon dioxide emissions, over and 
above existing emissions for the development site, will be required to 
make contributions to the Thurrock Carbon Offset Fund.  
 
The net greenhouse gas emissions from the new development will be 
measured as tonnes per year. Financial contributions to the Thurrock 
Carbon Offset Fund will be based on the methodology set out in the 
forthcoming Developer Contributions SPD and the Design and Sustainability 
SPD.

223 
 PMD15 – FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT 
 
Introduction 
 
6.72 Due to its proximity to the River Thames, the management of flood risk 
in Thurrock should be considered at all stages of the planning process  
in accordance with the NPPF and Planning Practice Guidance.  
Through the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment and Sequential Test, 
Thurrock Council have considered flood risk in relation to strategic 
planning and policy. 
 
6.73 The Sequential test for individual development sites will be addressed 
on a strategic scale during the production of the Site Specific 
Allocations and Policies DPD. When planning permission is sought for 
individual developments on sites allocated in development plans that 
have been informed by the Thurrock SFRA and sequentially tested on 
that basis, developers need not reapply the Sequential Test, but must 
apply the sequential approach when locating development within the 
site.  All other individual development sites will also be expected to 
pass the Sequential Test, with relevant evidence being provided to the 
Council by the developer. 
 
6.74 Following the application of the Sequential Test, Planning Practice 
Guidance may indicate the need for the Exception Test to be applied. It 
is likely given the extensive area of Flood Zones 2 and 3 in Thurrock, 
that the Exception Test will be required for a significant number of 
applications. 
 
6.75 In light of the above, and in accordance with the NPPF, developers are 
therefore required to submit a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment 
(FRA) with all planning applications if:  
 The development site lies within Flood Zones 2 and 3, as 
illustrated by the Environment Agency’s Flood Zone maps; 
 The development site is 1 hectare or greater in area and in 
Flood Zone 1; 
 The development site is in an area of Flood Zone 1 where there 
are known critical drainage problems. 
 
6.76 Site-specific FRAs are required to identify and assess the risks of all 
forms of flooding to and from the development and demonstrate how 
these flood risks will be managed so that the development remains 
safe throughout its lifetime taking climate change into account.  Those 
proposing developments should take the advice from the emergency 
services when producing an evacuation plan for the development as 
part of the flood risk assessment.  The objectives of a site-specific 
FRA, as set out in Planning Practice Guidance, are to establish the 
following: 
 Whether a proposed development is likely to be affected by 
current or future flooding from any source; 
 Whether it will increase flood risk on-site or elsewhere; Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
224 
  Whether the measures proposed to deal with these effects and 
risks are appropriate; 
 If necessary provide the evidence to the LPA so that the 
Sequential Test can be applied; and 
 Whether the development will be safe and pass part (c) of the 
Exception Test if this is appropriate. 
 
6.77 It should be noted that where a site-specific FRA demonstrates that the 
proposed development would result in an increase in flood risk to 
others, development will not be permitted.  
 
6.78 Further advice on producing Flood Risk Assessments is provided in 
Planning Practice Guidance and also by the Environment Agency in 
their Flood Risk Standing Advice to Applicants and Agents available by 
following the links on their website at: www.environment-
agency.gov.uk. 
 
6.79 In addition to the above requirement for a Flood Risk Assessment, 
developers should also note that under Sections 109 and 210 of the 
Water Resources Act 1991, the prior written consent of the 
Environment Agency will be required for any proposed works or 
structures, in, under, over or within 9 metres of the top of the bank of a 
designated Main River or tidal defence, or within 9 metres of the toe of 
a designated flood defence.  
 
6.80 Erection of flow control structures or  any culverting of a watercourse 
will also require the prior written approval of the Environment Agency 
under the terms of Section 23 of the Land Drainage Act 1991. 
Culverting is normally resisted on nature conservation and other 
grounds and consent for such works will not normally be granted 
except for access crossings.  
 
PMD15 – FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT  
1. Applications relating to sites not covered by the Thurrock Sequential Test 
will be required to be supported by a site-specific Sequential Test to 
demonstrate compliance with the NPPF, and associated Planning Practice 
Guidance.  To reflect the nature of Thurrock’s defended floodplain, 
particular reference should be made to the hazard rating for each site 
where covered by the Thurrock Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. 
 
2. Only those applications classified under the ‘minor development’ or 
‘changes of use’ categories will be exempt from both the Sequential and 
Exception Tests, and ‘water compatible’ development will be exempt from 
the Exception Test.  All developments will still be expected to meet the 
requirements for Flood Risk Assessments. 
 
3. Development proposals subject to the Exception Test in Thurrock must 
show that the following criteria have been met (in addition to FRA 
requirements outlined in the NPPF and associated Planning Practice 
Guidance): 
 Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
225 
 I. In addressing that part of the Exception Test requiring demonstration 
that the development provides wider sustainability benefits to the 
community that outweigh flood risk, reference should be made to the 
main assessment criteria outlined in the Thurrock Sustainability 
Appraisal and any opportunities to reduce the overall flood risk posed to 
the community, including schemes to make space for water; 
II. The FRA must demonstrate that the development will be ‘safe’, without 
increasing flood risk elsewhere, and where possible will reduce flood risk 
overall. For Thurrock, this will mean addressing the following points in 
particular:  
i. Flood hazard must be fully considered and reference should be 
made in the site-specific FRA to the SFRA, or site-specific 
modelling. This should be used to inform a sequential approach to 
planning within the site; 
ii. Where it is deemed acceptable to reduce flood storage as a result 
of development, level for level compensation storage must be 
provided to ensure that there is no increased flood risk elsewhere; 
iii. Where appropriate, an emergency plan for the development must 
be submitted that is consistent with the emergency plan for the 
area. This will include evidence that 'more vulnerable' 
development can achieve safe access/egress to a communal 
refuge point or unaffected area accessible to the emergency 
services. In highly exceptional cases where access/egress to a 
place of safe refuge cannot be achieved, these will be considered 
on their individual merits;  
iv. Where appropriate, flood avoidance, flood resistance and flood 
resilience measures must be incorporated into the design of any 
development;  
v. Evidence that surface water management schemes, and other 
flood defence measures that are required on-site in order to allow 
a development to take place will be adequately maintained for the 
lifetime of that development by the site owner;  
vi. Evidence that the proposed development will not interfere with the 
potential for future maintenance or improvements to flood 
defences. 
 
4. Developers may be required to provide Developer Contributions towards 
the improvement of Emergency Planning services and flood defence 
measures within Thurrock as part of flood management mitigation. 
 
5. Developments will be expected to incorporate Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SUDS) to reduce the risk of surface water flooding, both to the 
site in question and to the surrounding area. Where the potential for 
surface water flooding has been identified, site specific Flood Risk 
Assessments should ensure that suitable SUDS techniques are 
incorporated as part of the redevelopment.

 PMD16 - DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS 
 
Introduction 
 
6.81 Thurrock Council needs to be able to assess and understand the 
implications of the planned growth on the Borough’s infrastructure and 
services. In particular, there is a need to ensure that each local 
community has easy access to a full range of services. To create and 
maintain sustainable living conditions and high quality lifestyles for 
existing and future communities, it is essential that growth is properly 
accommodated within the Borough and that such growth can assist in 
creating a better environment for Thurrock. Growth can make a positive 
addition to an area, for example, providing new homes and jobs. It can 
also have an impact on the local community, placing additional 
pressures on local infrastructure and facilities such as local schools, 
road network, open spaces and other essential services.  
 
6.82 Where new development is acceptable in principle, but the proposal 
would give rise to negative impacts that could not be controlled by the 
imposition of planning conditions, developer contributions can help to 
reduce or mitigate its impact on the locality by requiring a developer to 
either deliver or contribute to services/facilities by way of either physical 
works or financial contributions. There are various ways that this may 
be provided, whether on-site, off-site or through financial contributions 
in lieu.  Some of the infrastructure proposals within the Core Strategy 
will be implemented by developer contributions. The Council is 
researching feasible approaches to inform the forthcoming Developer 
Contributions SPD.  
 
6.83 This policy aims to set out the Thurrock’s approach to the delivery of 
developer contributions. This policy will be supported by a Developer 
Contributions SPD that will provide greater clarity on the scope and 
scale of the developer contributions that may be anticipated within 
Thurrock. 
 
6.84 The statutory provisions for planning obligations are found at Section 
106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the Community 
Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended).  The NPPF 
confirms that local planning authorities should consider whether 
otherwise unacceptable development could be made acceptable 
through the use of conditions or planning obligations, and that planning 
obligations should only be used where it is not possible to address 
unacceptable impacts through a planning condition.  The levy 
regulations indicate that a planning obligation may only constitute a 
reason for granting planning permission for the development if the 
obligation is: 
i)  necessary to make the development acceptable in planning 
terms; 
ii)  directly related to the development, and; 
iii) fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the 
development. Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development (as amended)  
Chapter 6 – Management of Development Policies                             Adopted January 2015 
 
227 
 6.85 The Government is currently proposing to revise the way that 
developer contributions are collected. The Community Infrastructure 
Levy (CIL) would enable local authorities to levy a standard charge on 
new development to support infrastructure delivery. Thurrock Council 
will amend its developer contributions regime, as and when new 
legislation, guidance and regulations are issued.  
 
Thurrock Plans and Strategies 
 
6.86 Most development proposals in Thurrock will have essential 
infrastructure requirements, in one form or another, whether it is 
transport improvements or the provision of community or leisure 
facilities. The Council’s Infrastructure Prioritisation and Implementation 
Programme  identifies where deficits in facilities and infrastructure 
provision currently exist within the Borough and advises on the quantity 
and distribution of the new infrastructure that will be needed to serve 
any additional growth in the number of dwellings. The delivery and 
implementation of some of these facilities will be achieved through 
developer contributions from new development. The Council is 
currently producing a Developer Contributions SPD and CIL Charging 
Schedule which will inform the application of this policy. 
 
PMD16 - DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS  
1. Where needs would arise as a result of development, the Council will seek 
to secure planning obligations under Section 106 of the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990 and in accordance with the NPPF and any other 
relevant guidance.    
 
2. Through such obligations, the Council will seek to ensure that 
development proposals: 
i. Where appropriate contribute to the delivery of strategic 
infrastructure to enable the cumulative impact of development to be 
managed.  
ii. Meet the reasonable cost of new infrastructure made necessary by 
the proposal. 
iii. Mitigate or compensate for the loss of any significant amenity or 
resource. 
iv. Provide for the ongoing maintenance of facilities provided as a 
result of the development. 
 
The wide range of matters that may be covered by obligations include:

 of contributions from new development. These will be set out in the 
forthcoming Developer Contributions SPD.  The range of contributions 
that will be utilised in Thurrock include:  
 
i. Standard Charges – to ensure certainty and clarity in the delivery of 
developer contributions, a formulaic approach with a standard charge 
will be utilised where appropriate.  
ii. Maintenance Payments – where appropriate maintenance 
contributions will be sought, usually in the form of a one-off payment. 
iii. Forward or Support Funding – Specific elements of the 
development package may be required to be in place at an early 
stage in the build programme. 
iv. Pooling of Contributions – Pooling of contributions will be an 
appropriate way of collecting together funding from a number of 
developments in an area to facilitate the provision of infrastructure 
needed to meet the cumulative impact of development where a single 
development would not fairly be able to meet the associated costs. 
Cross boundary impacts with other Local Planning Authorities will 
require joint agreement between authorities. Effective and productive 
joint working with neighbouring authorities will be promoted.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
7.1 This Chapter sets out the key mechanisms that the Council will employ to 
maximise the opportunities for the successful implementation of the Core Strategy 
Spatial Vision and Strategic Spatial Objectives. The implementation and performance 
of the policies will be measured against an integrated data set of indicators and 
targets (Monitoring Framework) that fully embed those of the Sustainable Community 
Strategy, Local Area Agreement, the Council’s Corporate Strategy; other linked 
strategies and the Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and Strategic Environmental 
Assessment (SEA). Should the monitoring of policies show significant variance from 
expected results and targets, then this might trigger a review of polices in the LDF.  
 
IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK 
 
7.2 The Implementation Framework sets out how the Core Strategy 
policies are likely to be delivered and how required development will be 
delivered on the ground.   
 
7.3 The Council does not have the power, resources or mechanism to 
implement the Core Strategy alone and implementation of the policies 
will require action by a range of public, private and voluntary sector 
bodies working in partnership.   
 
7.4 The Council will use all of its statutory powers, resources and 
community leadership role to influence events, negotiate and bid for 
resources so as to make its full contribution to the overall success of 
the Core Strategy and Sustainable Community Strategy.  
 
7.5 The Council’s key Implementation Mechanism includes:  
 
Shaping Thurrock Local Strategic Partnership 
The Shaping Thurrock Partnership is key to the delivery of the Core 
Strategy.  It will be the major partnership through which the active 
involvement of all partners, agencies, stakeholders and the wider 
community will be secured.   
 
Thurrock’s Local Area Agreement (LAA)  
The LAA is a contract between Government and Thurrock’s main public 
sector agencies and voluntary groups, with clearly agreed targets to 
improve performance in key areas. The LAA sets out short-term 
priorities, expressed as outcomes, of what the partnership expects to 
achieve by the end of the three-year period (2008-2011).  
 
Each outcome has an Action Plan with indicators that set out how 
progress will be monitored during the life of the LAA.  These indicators 
and targets, where applicable, have been fully integrated into the Core 
Strategy Monitoring Framework.  Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development.(as amended)

232 
 Shaping Thurrock Programme Boards 
Performance information will be supplied regularly to the relevant 
Shaping Thurrock Programme Board.  These Boards are accountable 
for the delivery of their Action Plans.  
 
Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation (TTGDC) 
Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation (TTGDC) has 
regeneration resources, planning control over major developments and 
land assembly powers, and is are prioritising the regeneration of 
particular communities in Thurrock.   
 
Infrastructure Prioritisation and Implementation Programme 2006-
2021  
The Council has produced the Thurrock Infrastructure Prioritisation and 
Implementation Programme (February 2010). This will be the driver for 
providing the full range of social and community, utility and transport 
infrastructure to underpin sustainable residential communities. The 
Implementation Programme will be considered by the Council, TTGDC 
and partners as the basis for negotiating, obtaining and delivering the 
necessary infrastructure to underpin the growth agenda and provide 
the basis for negotiating with public and private sector funding 
providers.   
 
Council Review of its Land Holdings and Implementation of 
Strategies 
The Council will keep its own land holdings under continuous review to 
ensure that opportunities for beneficial use of land that may become 
available are fully optimised.  The Council will ensure that the relevant 
strategies and investment programmes that are its lead statutory 
responsibility, including Housing and Education, are fully coordinated in 
support of the delivery of the Core Strategy.  
 
Thurrock Council Corporate Strategy and Service Plans 
The Council will ensure that its Corporate Strategy and Service Plans 
are fully supportive of the delivery of the over-arching Community 
Strategy and Local Area Action Plans and thereby help to deliver the 
relevant spatial dimension of these, as expressed in the Core Strategy.  
In particular, those aspects of the Council’s service delivery activities

Greengrid, represent a major commitment to secure improvements in 
the quality of the local environment for the people of Thurrock.  
 
The Management of Development Process 
The Council will work with TTGDC to ensure that consideration of 
development proposals and application of the Strategic Spatial, 
Thematic and Management of Development Policies will be 
implemented on a rigorous and consistent basis.   
 
Implementation of the Management of Development Policies (PMD1 – 
PMD16) will be through the Management of Development process Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development.(as amended)   
Chapter 7 – Monitoring and Implementation                                       Adopted January 2015

 itself.  The Council will be able to advise potential developers on 
meeting the specific requirements of the PMD policies, both through 
pre-application discussions and following submission of planning 
applications, to ensure that all PMD policies are fully implemented.  
The Council will also be able to achieve the objectives of policies via 
the use of conditions and/or by way of obligations, where appropriate.   
 
Monitoring of the PMD policies will be achieved through the collation of 
information relevant to specific targets set out in individual policies, 
where appropriate.  Monitoring will also be achieved via planning 
conditions or agreements requiring developers to demonstrate or certify 
that requirements have/will be met, where necessary. Ultimately 
enforcement will be achieved via the service of enforcement or breach 
of condition notices or legal proceedings to enforce the terms of 
obligations as appropriate. 
 
7.6 Each of the Strategic Spatial and Thematic Policies includes detail of 
lead and partner agencies; plans and programmes; mechanisms and/or 
actions required; and broad timescales of implementation.  The 
timescales and details given are correct as of January 2010.  
 
7.7 Table 15, on the following pages, provides the details of the 
Implementation Framework for all the Core Strategy Policies grouped 
by themes in line with those set out in the Thematic Policy Section of 
the Core Strategy.

Preservation of Coalhouse Fort  
Coalhouse Fort has been identified as a key building at risk, in 
need of significant investment to preserve the building.  
 
A viability assessment was produced (July 2009) to inform the 
Council’s bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund. The assessment 
identifies that Coalhouse Fort has the capacity to be 
developed as a Centre for Social Enterprise that will provide a 
heritage attraction that will utilise the historic setting of the Fort 
and its positioning along the Thames Estuary to tell the story 
of the Defence of the Thames through the ages.  
 
A further study will assess how the fort relates to its setting 
and how a gateway can be developed to the East Thurrock 
Marshes.   In 2007, £125,000 of grant 
funding was secured from 
English Heritage and 
Thurrock Council to repair 
part of the gatehouse.

 MONITORING FRAMEWORK 
 
7.8 This section sets out the proposed Monitoring Framework. Monitoring 
is vital to interpreting the current and future state of Thurrock’s social, 
economic, environmental and physical characteristics. The trends 
displayed by the baseline social, economic, environmental and physical 
information will be compared against the relevant Core Strategy Policy 
indicators and targets to determine whether they are performing as 
anticipated. This data will be reported on in the Annual Monitoring 
Report (AMR) which will be submitted to Government for information by 
the end of December each year and be publicly available at 
approximately the same time.                                                            
 
7.9 The Monitoring Framework also highlights the SEA/SA Objectives 
associated with the Strategic Spatial Objectives, ensuring that the 
monitoring of the Core Strategy will also help assess the extent to 
which sustainable development is delivered throughout Thurrock. 
 
7.10 The Monitoring Framework is made up of three types of indicators: 
 
 Contextual Indicators – which provide a background to the 
Borough, including social, economic and environmental factors 
(Table 16) 
 Core Output Indicators  – which are statutory and set by the 
government and; 
 Significant Effect Indicators  – which are there to measure the 
significant effects of the policies/plan.  
 
7.11 Table 17 shows the Core Output and Significant Effect Indicators which 
are
 grouped into themes, in line with those set out in the Thematic 
Policy Section of the Core Strategy.  Some indicators are relevant to 
more than one theme and are therefore repeated.  Where this is the 
case, the repeated indicator is shown in grey and the previous 
reference shown.Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development.(as amended)

Trajectories 
This exercise is an extract from the Colin Bucha nan Infrastructure Prioritisation and Implementation 
commission which has extensively reviewed service needs and means of their delivery in the Borough 
over the past 36 months. The work below is a resu lt of extensive engagement with service providers 
over recent years and is based on information provided by the service providers. It takes the site 
specific housing growth data and applies various standards for provision to both existing and future 
population by zone to arrive at estimates of future surpluses and deficits.  
A4.1 Housing growth commitments 
A4.2.1 Table A4.2 presents the housing growth data made available to Colin Buchanan during 
January 2010, from the draft Core Strategy. These are presented in 5 year tranches – 0 to 5; 6 
to 10; 11 to 15; and beyond 15 years. Year 0 is deemed to be the current year April 2009 to 
March 2010 (hence the first phase amounts to 6 years) with the CS planning horizon running to 
2021, thence 2026.  
A4.2.2 For purposes of grouping local infrastructure needs, CB has placed this growth in zones as 
follows:- 
A. Purfleet 
B. Aveley and South Ocke nd
en; 
C. Lakeside and West Thurrock; 
D. Grays; 
E. Tilbury and Chadwell St Mary; 
F. Stanford le Hope and Corringham; 
G. Rest of Thurrock Borough. 
A4.2.3 These zones (see Figure A4.1) largely mirror the regeneration areas identified in the Core 
Strategy (CS) docume nt though Zon
es B, F and G are not categorised as regeneration areas 
in the CS. The existing populations of  the planning zones are set out in Table A4. 1  and A4.2 
sets out the housi ng comm
itments by zone.

 A4.2.4 Chapter 2 of the CS sets out the policy cont ext for these allocations which exceed by some 4% 
the Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) revised allocations for the Borough (a minimum of 18,500 
by 2021).  
Figure A4. 3 : Planning zones 
 
A4.2.5 The main driver for new infrastructure requirements is population rather than numbers of 
dwellings so we have applied a multiplier to the housing data to calcul ate the new population 
which each zone will be likely to accommodate. The starting point for this is average household 
size as defined by the Office of National Statis tics. The average household size in Thurrock for 
the last 3 decennial census years was as follows in Table A4.3. 
Table A4. 3: Average Household size in Thurrock 1981-2001 
Year Total Pop Total Households  Av. Household Size 
1981 124,855 43,741 2.85 
1991 126,734 49,111 2.58 
2001 143,129 58,478 2.45 
 
A4.2.6 Projecting this forward to the beginning of the CS planning cycl e, and assu ming continued, 
though diminishing reductions, over 15 years,  the following average household sizes have 
been assumed for each of the 5 year intervals.  These have been adopted as the multipliers to 
new dwelling numbers to deriv e new population numbers:- 
 0 to 5 years: 2.4 
 6 to 10 years: 2.35 
 11 to 15 yrs: 2.3 
 beyond 15 yrs: not applicable as no new dwelling numbers factored into planning horizon 
for this  exerc i
se. 
A4.2.7 Applying these multipliers to Table A4.2, t he build up of new population in each zon e woul d be 
as follows in Table A4. 4 . In order to refine the likely future infrastructure requirements for the 
different zones it will be necessary to factor i n
 the types of dwellings provided (that is, flats or 
houses) and the size of dwellings (1, bed 2 bed and so on) and use this information to 
calculate an average household size in different zones. At this stage it has not been possible to apply this level of sensitivity to the analysis because of the lack of data, but it is hoped that in 
future it will be possible to refine the analysis. Table A4. 4: Population growth by zone derived from housing trajectory

A4.2.8 The population growth by zone derived from the housing trajectory shown above in Table A4. 4  
is based on the number of net dwellings that ar e projected to be built in the 15 years from 
2009. The po
pulation growth associated with this policy-based assessment is projected to be 
higher than that estimated in the trend-based 2 006-based population projections published by 
the ONS in 2008.   
A4.2.9 It is expected that the projections based on net dwelling in cre ase will vary from the trend based 
projections to some degree because of the different methodology and because of likely future 
changes in the type and size of  dwellings provided, relative to those built in the past. A 
significant difference arises from the fact that the ONS trend based population and household 
projections show a projected reduction in the av erage household size across the Borough. This 
likely reduction in average household size relates to the existing stock of dwellings as well as 
the future dwellings with the result that the future population in the existing dwelling stock is likely to fall. 
A4.2.10 A further assessment of the differential between the two sets of proje c
 tions is being 
produced. However, owing to the difference in methodology, this cannot be expected to provide a complete match between the two sets of data.   
A4.2 Infrastructure needs trajectories 
A4.2.1 Of the infrastructure categories assessed in  the Council’s infrastructure study, about a quarter 
have some need for close proximity to neighb ourhood level communities, corresponding to the 
zones as defined above, and three quarters are either planned and budgeted on a Borough 
wide basis or regionally/ sub regionally. Those ident ified as of local or zonal significance, thus 
requiring locations in close proximity to the communities they serve, are as follows:-  
 Early Years’ learning; 
 Primary Schools; 
 Open 
Space; 
 Community halls;  
 Libraries; 
 
A4.2.2 The foll owin
g categories of infrastructure are deemed to be Borough wide or beyond, in terms 
of the selection criter ia for 
their location:- 
 Secondary schools; 
 Further education establishments; 
 Healthcare polyclinics; 
 Elderly persons’ care facilities; 
 Sports pitches and built leisure facilities; 
 Waste disposal facilities; 
 Police stations; 
 Ambulance stations; 
 Fire statio ns; 
 
 Transport – please note that transport and other strategic infrastructure is dealt with in the 
main body of the Core Stra tegy.  
A4.2.3 Regionally based infrastructure is not  addres sed in th e infrastructure study:  
 Strategic open space provision;  
 Potable water infrastructure 
 Sewerage 
 Power generation and distribution mains; 
 Telecommuni cation s networks; 
A4.2.4 The approach to each zone has been to identify the population threshold which triggers the 
need for ne w 
local and Borough wide provision, to identify a need based inventory of provision. 
Table A4. 5  to Table A4. 11  now provide the detail of infrastructure required at neighbourhood 
scale within a ll zone
s of Thurrock Borough: 
A4.2.5 The following assumptions have been applied to these calculations, partly based on the 
population threshold s
:- 
 Where relevant, provision ha s been rounded down to whole f acilities, any arithmetical 
additions (e.g. 0.4 of a facility where the form ula requires 2.4 facilities) being moved to the 
subsequent 5 year period to build a cumulative need. 
 2000 additional children of early years age Borough wide, disaggregated to each zone 
proportio natel
y with housing numbers. Each  facility accommodating up to 52 children; 
 4323 additional children of primary school age Borough wide, disaggregated to each zone 
proportio natel
y with housing numbers. 1 primary school can accommodate 420 pupils 
 1 GP per 2000 population; Current deficit of GP’s  in Thurro ck is 1 8, but this estimate is not 
included in these figures. 
 No allowance has been made in these assumptions for Faith Group accommodation.

 A4.2.7 Tables A4.5 to A4.11 detail the local infrastructure requirements generated by the additional 
population in the District, but in planni ng for futu re provisi
on account has to be taken of any 
existing surplus or deficit capacity. In Table A4. 13 below we set out the anticipated level of 
provision for l ocal
 needs infrastructure, based on the existing population, and the current actual 
provision. The table then sets out the surplus / deficit when the existing situation and future 
needs are combined, minus any committed provis ion. A health warning should be added here. 
This table is indicative only and, for example, the overall number of primary schools is not as 
important as the capacity of individual schools and their location relative to demand. Similarly 
with community halls, these need to be located cl ose to the communities they are to serve and 
therefore the indicated over supply does not mean that future development schemes will not 
have to provide a local community hall. 
A4.2.8 From Table A4. 13  it can be seen that there is relatively limited spare capacity within the 
existing infrastructure.

A4.2.9 The above table illustrates that the most pressing needs fo r new social infrastructure at 
neighbourhood level in Thurrock both current; and over the plan period, is early years pre-
school facilities and children’s play space; together with adequate amenity green space and parks and gardens. This amply demonstrates the challenge which will be set by the intention to 
focus future growth in the already densely dev eloped south west of the Borough. The current 
surplus of places at primary school level is  broadly evened out over the plan period with a 
deficit of one unit recorded by 2021. The current  shortage of GPs is largely corrected with 
plans for increases already identified. There is a current surplus of Community Halls which will 
reduce over the plan period though as for open space and primary schools, the main challenge will be locating these in suitable proximit y to the communities they will serve. 
A4.2.10 The infrastructure assessment is an ongoing process and to be updated throughout the plan 
period. Equally, each d e
velopment application will be assessed against the capacity of 
infrastructure likely to be impacted by the development. More detailed assessments of 
provision against need can only be effective at a local planning level. 
A4.2.11  
Table A4. 14  identifies those element s of infrastructure which will need provision at Borough wide level 
to service overall increases in population resu lting from the housing trajectories above. The 
following assumptions have been applied to these calculations: 
A4.2.12 Where relevant, provision has been rounded down  to whole fa cilities, a ny arithmetical additions 
(e.g. 0.4 of a facility where the formula requires 2.4 facilities) being moved to the subsequent 5 
year period to build a cumulative need. 
 2608 additional children of secondary school age Borough wide, disaggregated to each 
zone pro po
rtionately with housing numbers. 1 secondary school can accommodate 1000 
pupils; 
 1 FE college generated at 25,000 population th reshol d, so 2 assu med for new population 
of c.45,000;  
 A polyclinic is assumed to accommodate 8 general practitioners; 
 Dentists reflect PCT estimate of need; 
 Sports hubs generated at 15,000 population threshold hence 2 committed within 10 years; 
 All emergency services based on needs asse ssme nts from relevant  Service Prov iders.

A4.2.13 As with local infrastruc ture, surplus a nd deficit s of borough wide infrastructure have been 
identified and are set out in Table A4. 15  below.  
A4.2.14 The same caveats apply to Borough wide infras tructu re as to local infrastructure. Capacity and 
location of individual facilities is more important than whether there is an arithmetic over or 
undersupply.

A4.2.15 Table A4. 15  shows that for Borough level infrastructure there is almost no surplus capacity to 
utilise in the future. Apparent over supply of one Secondary School switches to a one facility 
deficit by 2021, while a current Further Educat ion facility deficit remains to the end of the 
period. However the position regarding educati on provision is more complex than the table 
indicates because capacity in individual schools varies across the Borough, and it is possible 
that a proportion of future needs can be met through utilising capacity at individual schools. 
When an application is submitted a detailed assessment of the impact of a proposed development can be undertaken.  
A4.2.16 An apparent surplus of health facilities currently reduces to a deficit to 2021,
  reflecting the 
changing needs of health care close to the population served. A current  shortage of sports 
facilities in the Borough is forecast to increase overall, as will the deficit in dental treatment.  Core Strategy and Policies for Management of Development
