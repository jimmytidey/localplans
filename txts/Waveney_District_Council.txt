What is Soundness?  
The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the tests of soundness which a Local Plan must pass. These are:  
 Positively prepared  – the plan should be prepared based on a strategy which seeks to meet objectively 
assessed development and infrastructure requirements, including unmet requirements from 
neighbouring authorities where it is reasonable to do so and consistent with achievin g sustainable 
development .  
 Justified  – the plan should be the most appropriate strategy, when considered against the reasonable 
alternatives, based on proportionate evidence .  
 Effective  – the plan should be deliverable over its period and based on effecti ve joint working on cross -
boundary strategic priorities .  
 Consistent with national policy  – the plan should enable the delivery of sustainable development in 
accordance with the policies in the Framework .  
Representations on the Final Draft Plan should ind icate what test of soundness they relate to and whether they 
consider the plan to be sound or not.    Local Plan Stages

  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Introduction  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 1 Introduction  
Waveney District Council is preparing a new Local Plan for the District  (excluding the 
Broads Authority area) . This document is the fin al publication  draft of the new Local 
Plan.  The Broads Authority are p reparing their own Local Plan.  
 
What is the Local Plan? 
The Local Plan sets out the level of growth which needs to be planned in  the Waveney area and identifies 
where that growth should be located and how it should be delivered. The Plan sets out the planning 
policies which the Council will use to determine planning applications in the Waveney  area.   
The new Local Plan for Waveney will cover the per iod 2014 -2036 .  
Waveney District Council have been working in partnership with Suffolk Coastal District Council for the last 
10 years and most of the services are shared across the two Councils. To build on this decade of 
cooperation, give greater value fo r money and at the same time improve service delivery, including driving 
and investing in growth and infrastructure projects, the two Councils agreed to create one Council.   In 
February 2018 the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Govern ment agreed the shared 
proposals to create a new single East Suffolk Council. The new Council will, subject to parliamentary 
approval come into being, and begin operations on 1st April 2019.  At this point the two existing councils 
will be formally dissolv ed. This Local Plan will continue to provide the vision, strategic priorities, policies 
and proposals, against which planning applications will be determined, for the geographic area currently 
covered by Waveney District until such time as the new East Suf folk Council decide to review the Local 
Plan.  
 
 
Introduction  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
2                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Duty to Cooperate  
The duty to cooperate is a legal duty on local planning authorities, county councils and public bodies to 
engage constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis to maximise the effectivene ss of Local Plan 
preparation in the context of strategic cross boundary matters.   
Waveney has engaged constructively with all partners to date in the preparation of this Local Plan and in 
the preparation of neighbouring authorities Local Plans. The Council ’s main strategic relationships are with 
Suffolk County Council, Great Yarmouth Borough Council, the Broads Authority, South Norfolk District 
Counc il and Suffolk Coastal District Council.  
The Waveney District Council area is its own housing market ar ea and functional economic area, therefore 
the Local Plan needs to meet all the needs for housing and economic development within the District 
boundary . The Council has worked with neighbouring authorities in concluding the boundaries of housing 
market are as and functional economic areas. At present it is considered that housing and economic needs 
can be met within the local housing market and functional economic areas which operate in the area. It 
should be noted that the Broads Authority Local Planning Au thority Area overlaps with the Waveney 
District Council area. The Broads Authority crosses a number of housing market areas, however, it has 
identified an objectively assessed need for housing for each area of the Broads. For the Waveney area, the 
objectiv ely assessed need for the Broads Authority area is 57 dwellings between 2012 and 2036. This 
figure forms part of the objectively assessed need for the Waveney District area. Development within the 
Broads area in Waveney will meet this part of the need.  
In terms of infrastructure provision , the Council has worked 
constructively with infrastructure providers such as the local Clinical 
Commissioning Group and Suffolk County Council. This engagement will 
be ongoing during the implementation of the Local Plan.  
For environmental matters the Council has worked closely with the 
Broads Authority on developing an evidence base on landscape and will 
continue to work with neighbouring authorities to assess the  impact  of 
policies and proposals on internationally protec ted habitat sites.   
The Council has also engaged with the Marine Management 
Organisation, both in the preparation of this Local Plan and in 
production of the East Inshore and East Offshore Marine Plans.  The 
Local Plan is consid ered to be consistent and com plementary to the 
Marine Plans.   
 
Neighbourhood Plans  
Neighbourhood Plans are optional plans prepared by the community which set out the detailed planning 
policies and proposals for their specific area.  
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Introduction  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 3 All the policies in the Local Plan are ‘strategic po licies’ . This means that policies and proposals within 
Neighbourhood Plans should be in conformity with these policies. Some policies provide specific guidance 
for Neighbourhood Plans .  
 
Marine Plans  
The marine environment (up to high water mark) to the ea st of the Waveney District is covered by the East 
Inshore and East Offshore Marine Plans.  These plans need to be considered alongside this Local Plan for 
development s which are within the marine plan areas and for developments which could impact upon the 
marine plan areas.  The marine plans have been taken into account in the preparation of this Local Plan and 
references to the plans have been made throughout the Local Plan where relevant.  
 
Sustainability Appraisal  
Sustainability Appraisal is an iterative process which must be carried out during the preparation of a Local 
Plan. Its purpose is to promote sustainable development by assessing the extent to which the emerging 
Local Plan, when considered against alternatives, will help to achieve relevant enviro nmental, economic 
and social objectives. A sustainability appraisal has been undertaken on all the different policy options and 
site options considered during the preparation of the Local  Plan. The sustainability appraisal also considers 
the cumulative eff ect of the Local  Plan on sustainability objectives.  
 
Sustainable Community Strategy and East Suffolk Business Plan  
The Waveney Sustainable Community Strategy was adopted in 2010 and sets out a vision for the period to 
2028. The vision was to ‘Make Waveney  a great place for anyone to grow up, live, work and visit’ . The key 
priorities identified were, a prosperous and vibrant economy, the greenest county, learning and skills for 
the future, and safe, health and inclusive communities. These priorities were th e same as the Suffolk 
Sustainable Communities Strat egy which was adopted in 2008.  
More recently, the Council, along with Suffolk Coastal District Council has adopted the East Suffolk 
Business Plan. This sets out an up to date vision and prior ities for the  East Suffolk area . The Business Plan 
was adopted in 2015. The headline vision is to  ‘Maintain and sustainably improve the quality of life for 
everyone growing up in, living in, working in and visiting East Suffolk ’. The priorities of the plan are set out 
under the themes of enabling communities, economic growth and financial self -sufficiency. The plan also 
sets out a number of specific planned actions.  
The vision, objectives and strategic priorities of this Local Plan reflect the vision and priorities of t hese 
documents.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 5 Waveney is the most easterly District in England, located in the north east corner of 
Suffolk.   
Lowestoft, situated in the north east of the District is the largest town accommodating approximately half 
of the D istrict’s population. The rural part of the District gains its identity from the four historic market 
towns of Beccles, Bungay, Halesworth and Southwold together with a number of villages and hamlets.  
The District is served by two train lines, the East Suffolk line which connects Lowestoft, Beccles and 
Halesworth to Ipswich and the Wherry Line, which connects Lowestoft to Norwich. The A47 provides road 
connections to Great Yarmouth and onwards to Norwic h and Peterborough and the A12 provides 
connections south to Ipswich and onward to London. The A146 provides links from Lowestoft to Beccles 
and onwards to Norwich. The A143 provides links to the west from Beccles to Bungay and onwards to Diss. 
The Port of  Lowestoft is directly opposite major continental ports and serves the busy sea routes between 
the UK and Europe.

Key issues in Lowestoft, Carlton Colville, Corton, Gisleham, Oulton and 
Oulton Broad  
 
Lowestoft, together with Carlton Colville , Corton,  Oulton and Oulton Broad  represent the largest built up 
area in the District with a combined population of nearly 70,000 people . The town, which is the most 
easterly in England, is sandwiched between the North Sea  to the east and the Broads  National Park  to the 
west. The town is divided north and south by Lake Lothing . The town has good  road connections to Great 
Yarmouth  to the north . Road connections to Norwich, Ipswich and beyond are poor and as a result t he 
town is perceived to be remote and poorly connected . Rail connections to Norwich  are relatively good but 
to Ipswich and beyond are particularly poor with journeys taking around 90 minutes to get to Ipswich.   
Most social problems in the District are more  acute in Lowestoft, particularly  in the central areas. Life 
expectancy is lower  in some of the central wards of Lowestoft than the rest of the District, and death rates 
are higher . The Normanston ward of Lowestoft has the highest proportion of the populat ion which is obese  
in the District and is much higher than the national average. Nine neighbourhoods in the town are within 
the 10% most deprived  in the country and the Harbour and Kirkley wards have unemployment levels which 
are double the regional averag e.  
Lowestoft benefits from a rich natural and built environment . The town has a significant number of 
heritage assets including the historic High Street  and the seafront area  of south Lowestoft.  The High Street 
and Scores have recently been awarded Heritage Action Zone status to acknowle dge the area as a 
conservation a rea at risk. The town has good access to the protected landscapes and habitats of the Broads  
and is in close proximity to the protected habitats along the Suffolk coast  to the south. The landscapes to 
the north and west of the town are particularly attractive and sensitive to change . There are pockets of 
high grade agricultural land  to the north and south of the town. Large parts of central  Lowestoft are at risk 
from flooding . The Council is working with partners to ensure the delivery of strategic flood protection 
measures  to mitigate these risks. It is anticipated these measures will be complete  by 2021.  
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Waveney Context  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 13 Lowestoft’s economy was traditionally based on fishing and manufacturing. These sectors have declined 
significantly in recent years. However, due to planned investments in offshore renewables  in the southern 
North Sea, there is significant poten tial for future jobs growth . The town significantly benefits from the Port 
of Lowestoft from which many offshore companies operate  as well as a small fishing fleet . The port is 
directly opposite major continental ports and serves the busy sea routes betwee n the UK and Europe. It is 
also the closest port to many of the offshore wind farms  planned off the coast of East Anglia. The port 
covers 40 hectares of land and is comprised of a protected outer harbour and an inner harbour beyond the 
Bascule Bridge. The port handles around 100,000 tonnes of cargo each year. It is establishing  itself as a 
renewables centre of excellence  and is home to the construction and operation management bases of 
Galloper and East Anglia ONE offshore wind farms and is the operation an d maintenance base  for Greater 
Gabbard.   
The town’s economy benefits from its strong links to Great Yarmouth , which also profits from the offshore 
sector. Tourism  is an important sector to the town, and its unique position between the Broads and the 
sandy beaches on the North Sea help attract high numbers of tourists  each year. The town is quite self 
contained with 54% of working people living in the town also working in the town. However, an increasing 
number of residents are commuting to Great Yarmouth  for work.  
Traffic congestion  is considered to be an issue which holds back economic growth. In particular,  there are 
issues at the two crossings of Lake Lothing. A third crossing  over Lake Lothing is planned to be in place by 
2022 to help alleviate traffic congestion in the town, improve connectivity and help deliver regeneration 
sites. There are also more localised issues of traffic congestion. Carlton Colville Primary School has a large 
catchment area and is located some distance from the main built up are a of Carlton Colville. As such many 
parents drive their children to school  which creates local congestion and road safety issues.  
Lowestoft town centre  acts as a day -to-day shopping centre for residents of the town and the surrounding 
area. However, its catchment is quite small , given its coastal location and competition from nearby centres 
of Great Yarmouth and Norwich. The town centre has suffered in recent years with highe r levels of vacant 
shop units  and residents consider that the shopping offer could  be better. It is expected that the third 
crossing over Lake Lothing will help reduce the effect of traffic in the town centre and the planned flood 
protection measures will encourage inward investment in the town centre nearer the Bascule Bridge.  
These pr ojects will therefore help address some of the challenges the centre faces.

14                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Key issues in Beccles and Worlingham  
 
Beccles is the largest market town  in the District. Beccles and Worlingham have grown over the years to 
form a single contiguous built up area with a combined population of 13,868  (Beccles 10,123, Worlingham 
3,745). The  town sits close to the Norfolk and Suffolk border and is constrained b y marshland associated 
with the River Waveney  and the Broads  to the north. Part of the town is within the Broads Authority area. 
As a result the town has expanded mostly southwards with some residential areas some distance from the 
town centre with poor ac cess to services and facilities  and open space. The town has good links to 
Lowestoft and Norwich  and is connected by train to Lowestoft and Ipswich.  
Beccles does not suffer from many of the social issues that Lowestoft does. However, there are 
neighbourho ods in the town which are some of the most deprived in the District. The town provides a 
good range of services  to meet everyday needs and acts as a service centre for the surrounding rural 
communit ies in Waveney and South Norfolk . Beccles benefits from a rich historic environment , including 
the Grade I St Michael’s Church and adjacent Bell Tower,  and is in close proximity to valuable natural 
assets. There are some pockets of high grade agricultural  land around the town. The landscape to the west 
and north of the town is more sensitive to development .  
Beccles and Worlingham are well served by employment premises . The main employment area is 
disconnected from the town at Ellough. There is currently no public transport provision to the Ellough 
employment area s and walking and cycling access is also poor. A southern relief road  is under construction 
which will take HGV traffic away from the town centre and this may improve pedestrian and cycle links  to 
the employment area. The road is expected to be completed i n 2018. There are electricity capacity issues  
to the east of the town which are limiting the potential for further development at the industrial areas at 
Ellough. Due to its location on the Broads, tourism  is an important part of the Beccles economy.   
At present most working people in Beccles and Worlingham do not work in the town  (or in the Ellough 
employment area). A third of people commute to other local authority areas including South Norfolk, 
Norwich and Great Yarmouth. 10% travel to Lowestoft. Traffic  congestion  is a concern  for some parts of 
the town, such as around Ingate, and in this location there is a risk it could contribute to air quality 
problems  if congestion significantly worsens .  
Beccles town centre has performed well  in recent years and ha s an increasing number of national multiple 
stores and independent stores and low vacancy rates.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 15 Key issues in Halesworth and Holton  
 
Halesworth is located on the southern boundary of the District on a tributary of the River Blyth. 
Halesworth serves as a small market town with a population of 4,726 . To the east of Halesworth is Holton 
with a population of 832. The village depends on Hale sworth for most services and facilities and the 
gradual expansion of the town has led to an almost contiguous built up area between the two settlements. 
The town provides services for nearby villages including some within the Suffolk Coastal District area , 
including Chediston, Walpole and Wenhaston.  
The average age of the population is above local and regional averages. Whilst the town benefits from 
provision of most essential services and facilities , there is no secondary education provision  in the town. 
Children of secondary education age have to travel to Bungay or Beccles.  
A small part of the central area of the town is at risk from flooding . The floodplain from the River Blyth 
tributaries covers large parts of the farmland to the west of the town. Hale sworth benefits from a rich 
historic environment  where the medieval manorial plan, street pattern and property boundaries survive in 
the present layout of streets. The landscape around the town is a mix of rural river valleys  and tributary 
farmland  charact er which is sensitive to new development . Some of the farmland surrounding the town is 
high grade agricultural land .  
Only 32% of working people in Halesworth work in the town. 14% work in Suffolk Coastal and 14% work in 
Beccles. However, self-containment could potentially be higher  as there are a similar number of people 
employed in the town as there are working people living in the town (i.e. many of the jobs in the town are 
taken by people commuting in to the town from elsewhere).  
  
Waveney Context  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
16                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Key issues in Bungay  
 
Bungay is located in the northwest corner of the District on the Norfolk and Suffolk border. It is 
surrounded by the River Waveney  to the north, east and west and the landscape rises quite steeply to the 
south out of the valley. The River Waveney and ma rshland to the east of the town is part of the Broads 
area. As a result of its geography, Bungay has been forced to grow in a southward direction.  
The town has a population of 5,127 . It benefits from a small town centre  and has provision of a number of 
key services and facilities . It is very close to the Norfolk villages of Earsham and Ditchingham and acts as 
their local service and employment centre. The town also acts as a service centre to a number of smaller 
villages in the northwest of the Waveney D istrict.  
The town benefits from a rich historic environment  with a Norman era castle near the town centre and 
many fine examples of Georgian buildings in the town centre. The character of the town is further 
enhanced by the large areas of grazing land  and open areas within and around the town. The flood zone  
associated with the River Waveney affects some parts of the town and constrains development to the 
north, east and west. The landscape to the south of the town is attractive and sensitive to new 
develo pment .  
The main employer of the town is Clays Printers and this is reflected by the high numbers of people in the 
town employed in  manufacturing . In addition there are some smaller employment premises within the 
town.  
Currently most working people who li ve in Bungay do not work in the town . 41% commute to other local 
authority areas (nearly half to South Norfolk, Broadland and Norwich). Of the 23% which work elsewhere 
in Waveney the majority work in Beccles and the rural areas.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 17 Key issues in Southwold a nd Reydon  
 
Southwold and Reydon are located on the coast approximately 20 kilometres south of Lowestoft. The 
population of Southwold is 1,098  and Reydon is 2,582 . Southwold is surrounded by marshland to the north, 
west and south. This has effectively cons trained the growth of the town. Southwold acts as an important 
tourism destination and as such has a vibrant town centre  with a good range of shops and services. 
However, the increasing presence of national retailers is changing the character of the town. Reydon is 
where most of the local population reside.  
Southwold and Reydon have the highest house prices  in the District. In Southwold, at least 35% of 
dwellings are second homes or holiday homes  which contributes to the high house prices. The population 
of Southwold has an average age of 60  which is much older than other parts of the District. Whilst between 
the two settlements most everyday services  are accommodated, Southwold and Reydon do not benefit 
from any secondary education provision .  
Southwold an d Reydon are set in  an attractive natural environment  and are wholly within the Suffolk Coast 
and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . Southwold is also within the Suffolk Heritage Coast . The 
marshland to the south of Southwold is designated as a Site of Specific Scientific Interest  and there are 
numerous County Wildlife Sites  around the two settlements.  
Southwold also benefits from a rich historic environment , including the grand Georgian buildings  around 
the numerous greens and Southwold Harbour .  
Tourism  is an important sector for Southwold. A third of working residents are employed in either 
accommodation and food services or retail. Whilst 53% of working people who live in Southwold and 
Reydon also work in Southwold and Reydon, there are more jobs in th e two settlements than working 
people who live there. Additionally the majority of workers in Southwold and Reydon commute into the 
two settlements from elsewhere. This could indicate that many people who work in the town cannot afford 
to live in the town  or Reydon. 20% of residents in Southwold and Reydon work from home , which is double 
the District average.

18                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Key issues in r ural areas  
 
The rural area in Waveney is characterised by a small number of larger villages  and numerous small villages  
and hamlets. Kessingland , located on the coast between Lowestoft and Southwold, is the District’s largest  
village with a population of 4,327 . Kessingland have recently prepared a Neighbourhood Plan which sets 
out the vision and planning policies for their community ove r the next 15 years.  
Outside of Kessingland, Barnby and North Cove, Blundeston, Wrentham  and Wangford  are the largest 
villages with reasonable provision of everyday services and facilities . The village of Somerleyton , although 
much smaller, also has a good range of services and facilities . There are numerous other smaller villages  
which have some level of service provision and these include Brampton, Homersfield, Ilket shall St. 
Lawrence, Lound, Mutford, Ringsfield, Rumburgh, Shadingfield and Willingham, We sthall and Wisset t. 
Elsewhere, the rural areas are characterised by small dispersed hamlets with limited services and facilities.  
Access to primary schools can be an issue in the rural areas, with many children, including in some larger 
villages such as W rentham, having to take the bus to primary school  in nearby villages or towns.  
In recent years, many rural settlements have lost services and facilities  and have very limited access to basic 
services and facilities . The rural areas are generally less depr ived than neighbourhoods in  Lowestoft and 
the market towns . House prices are higher  in the rural areas than the District average.  
The rural areas benefit from a rich historic environment , including Somer leyton Historic Park and Garden 
and Homersfield, Wissett and Somerleyton conservation areas.  
There are some agricultural and tourism jobs in the rural areas but generally limited employment 
opportunities  and most residents depend on nearby towns for employment. However, there is some 
eviden ce of reverse commuting where people employed in rural industries are living in towns.  
Mobile phone coverage  is an issue and  Broadband  is essential for economic development and remains poor 
in the rural areas. Speeds tend to be slow with maximum speeds ra rely exceeding 10mbs and many areas 
are struggling to achieve speeds of 3mbs .

Vision and Objectives  
1.1 The vision for Waveney in 2036 for this Local Plan is based on the short term vision contained within the 
Council’s Business Plan – the East Suffolk Business Plan – and also on the long term need to tackle the 
issues detailed in the previous section . It al so takes into account the comments made by stakeholders and 
the public through consultation  on the Local Plan.  
 
By 2036 the quality of life for everyone growing up in, living in, working in, and visiting 
Waveney will have been sustainably improved. Waveney will have a healthy economy, a 
healthy population and a healthy environment. The District will have experienced  significant 
levels of growth, but this growth will not have breached environmental limits and will have 
been supported by adequate infrastructure.  
Waveney will have a stronger, more diverse economy benefiting from the growth of offshore 
renewable energy  and better infrastructure such as transport connections, 
telecommunications and flood risk protection . The stronger economy will have reduced 
deprivation and increased local earnings. Tourism will remain an important year -round part of 
the District’s econo my and visitor numbers and overnight stays will have increased. Waveney’s 
town centres will be vibrant and meet the needs of local residents, businesses and visitors 
alike.  The District’s cultural offer will have been improved to the benefit of visitors an d 
residents alike.  
There will be sufficient housing of the right types and tenures to meet the needs of the 
population and people moving to the District. The health of the population will have been 
improved through increased opportunities for people to pa rticipate in active lifestyles.  
Waveney’s valuable built , historic  and natural environment will have been protected, 
maintained and enhanced including the protected landscapes of the Broads  National Park  and 
the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The deli very of key recommendations in the Council’s 
Green Infrastructure Strategy will have ensured improvements to open space and ecological 
networks will have benefited the health of the population as well as that of wildlife habitats. 
The high quality design o f new developments will be noticeable to those living in and visiting 
the area and new development will have respected the rich historic assets of the District.  
Climate change emissions per capita will have decreased as people choose more sustainable 
metho ds to commute to work and for leisure purposes due to the District’s settlements 
becoming more self -sufficient. More properties will benefit from protection from flooding, 
and coastal communities will continue to adapt to coastal change. The District will continue to 
have clean air and the water quality of the District’s rivers will have improved .  Vision Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Overall Spatial Strategy  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 21  The Lowestoft Area (Lowestoft, Carlton Colville, Corton, Gisleham, 
Oulton and Oulton Broad)  
Lowestoft will be a clean, attractive and vibrant town with an enha nced economy and reduced 
deprivation.  The suburban areas and villages will retain their individual identities and their 
communities will be strengthened with new infrastructure provision.   
Lowestoft, along with nearby Great Yarmouth will be important centr es in the construction, 
operation and maintenance of offshore renewable projects. The Port of Lowestoft will be a n 
offshore renewables centre of excellence supporting the employment of a significant number 
of people.  
The town will benefit from improved in frastructure, including a third crossing over Lake 
Lothing and strategic flood risk protection , both of which are essential to allow the town to 
continue to grow and thrive . The population will be healthier with new  opportunities for 
participation  in sport  through the creation of a sports and leisure complex at Oakes Farm, 
Carlton Colville and high quality open spaces within new developments. The area  will have 
accommodated the majority of the District’s growth and will have expanded in size with well 
desig ned, sustainable extensions to the urban area which have their own identity.  
The town centre will be more vibrant with a viable retail offer together with improved leisure 
offer including a greater number of cafés, pubs and restaurants. The derelict central areas 
around Lake Lothing will have been successfully regenerated providing a significant number of 
homes in close proximity to the town centre and employment areas. The town’s tourist offer 
will have been maintained and improved through improvemen ts along the coast  from Corton 
down to Pakefield , including the creation of a destination park at the East of England Park, 
celebrating the most easterly point of the country. The sensitive landscapes and habitats 
which surround the town will have been pre served and enhanced through new developments.  
The town will have also benefited from heritage -led regenerat ion of the historic High Street , 
supported though the Heritage Action Zone initiative.   
 Beccles and Worlingham  
Beccles will have continued to fulf il its role as the largest market town in the District serving its 
local population including Worlingham and the surrounding smaller towns and villages in 
Waveney and South Norfolk such as Ringsfield, Gillingham and Toft Monks. Beccles, together 
with Worli ngham will have grown at a rate similar to that experienced over the last 20 years 
and the larger population will support and improve the town centre and services and facilities 
in the town  to the benefit of residents and tourists alike. New development  will have been 
supported by good infrastructure and services including a country park.   
The sensitive natural environment to the north of the town will have been protected. The 
separate identities of the two settlements will also have been preserved. New dev elopment 
will be of an exceptional quality of design including greener environments serving both 
existing and new residents. The delivery of the Southern Relief Road will have opened up new Overall Spatial Strategy  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
22                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  opportunities for growth and will have diverted heavy goods traffi c from the sensitive town 
centre. Additionally, access to the Ellough employment area by modes other than the car will 
have been improved.  
 Halesworth and Holton  
Halesworth will provide a more significant role as a service centre to the south of the Dist rict 
benefiting surrounding villages in Waveney and Suffolk Coastal such as Wisset t, Walpole and 
Wenhaston. Together with Holton, it will be the third  largest built -up area  in the District after 
Lowestoft and Beccles and Worlingham. The historic town centr e will be vibrant and will have 
been supported by new housing and retail development. The town will have enhanced sports 
and leisure facilities following the completion of the Halesworth Campus and improved 
facilities at Dairy Hill together with  additional  health facilities a nd an enhanced employment 
offer.  This will  have helped attract younger people and families to the town. The separate 
identities  of Halesworth and Holton and the sensitive landscape surrounding them will have 
been protected.  
 Bungay  
Bungay will have continued to act as a service centre in the north west of the District 
supporting the large villages of Ditchingham and Earsham in South Norfolk as well as smaller 
villages in Waveney. It will have a larger number of employment premises wh ich will help 
make the town more self -sufficient and will have experienced modest levels of housing growth 
which will have helped support the town centre. The open areas within the town will have 
been protected, as will the sensitive landscapes outside of the town.  
 Southwold and Reydon  
Southwold will continue to prosper as a unique historic town and tourist destination. Reydon 
will continue to function as part of the Southwold and Reydon area , providing local services 
and some employment development. New  housing growth in the area will have provided 
homes with a range of tenure s and will have made homes more affordable for those working 
in the area. The sensitive built , historic  and natural environment of the area will have been 
protected from and enhance d by new development.  
 Rural Areas  
Through allowing more growth than in recent years, settlements in the rural areas will become 
more sustainable and more vibrant. Through the provision of a wide range of types and 
tenures of housing, new homes will be mo re affordable in the rural areas, allowing people 
with a local connection or those who work in the rural areas to live in the rural areas. New 
housing will also help support existing services and facilities in the rural areas such as small 
rural schools an d pubs. New development in rural villages will have increased the coverage of 
high -speed broadband.

Scale of Growth  
1.3 Waveney is an attractive place to  live and work and more people migrate into the District from elsewhere 
in the UK than leave. Additionally, households in Waveney are getting smaller, so even with no population 
growth there is a ne ed for more housing. If the Council  does not plan to meet the housing needs arising 
from these two factors, there is a risk that needs will not be met, resulting in a situation where demand 
continues to outweigh supply. This will push up house prices making it more difficult for younger people to 
enter the housing market. By not planning for this growth there is also a greater risk that housing 
developments could be built in inappropriate locations.   
1.4 If the Council  does not plan to meet the business growth needs in the District, there is a risk that 
investme nt will be targeted elsewhere, meaning workers in Waveney will increasingly need to travel 
further afield for work. If the Council does not plan for the needs of new retail development there is a risk 
that the vitality and viability of our town centres wil l decline.  
1.5 The National Planning Policy Framework requires Local Plans to meet ‘objectively assessed needs’ for 
housing and economic development. An ‘objectively assessed need’ is a technical calculation of how many 
houses and jobs are needed in an area ov er a period of time.  
1.6 The Council has commissioned and produced a series of evidence documents which assess the amount of 
growth needed for housing and economic development. The key studies are:  
 Strategic Housing Market Assessment (PBA, 2017)  
 Employment La nd Needs Assessment (NLP, 2016) and Employment Land Needs Update 
(Waveney District Council , 2017).  
 Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (Carter Jonas, 2016)  
1.7 The Strat egic Housing Market Assessment  identifies an objectively assessed need for 8,223 new homes  
over the plan period for the entire District (including the Broads Authority area), which equates to 374 per 
year . The study has calculated this based on demographic projections (based on trends over the period 
2010 -2015). Of the 374 new homes needed annu ally, 208 need to be affordable to meet local need. 
However, it is unlikely that this level  of affordable housing could be viably delivered.

1.8 As of April 2017,  3,033 homes have been completed or have permission and are expected to complete 
within the plan period. This gives a residual need of 5,190  new homes that need to be planned for in this 
Local Plan. Policy WLP1.1 makes clear that housing targets are minimu ms.  
1.9 Allocations for housing in this Local Plan exceed the minimum level of housing needed  by approximately 
12% . The over allocation  will help enable more affordable homes to delivered, particularly given the 
significant need referred to above. An over -allocation also provides confidence that the overall objectively 
assessed need will be met even if some allocated site s fail to come forward  or there are delays to delivery . 
In addition there will be further development which comes forward on sites not identi fied in the Plan. 
These sites will either be within the Settlement Boundaries defined by Policy WLP1.3 or through the 
exceptions provide d by Policies WLP8.6, WLP8.7, WLP8.8 or WLP8.11 or on Neighbourhood Plan 
allocations.   
1.10 The Strategic Housing Market Asse ssment also identifies a need for 905 additional spaces in care homes 
and nursing homes over the plan period. These will primarily be delivered on larger allocations or on 
windfall sites.  The exact nature of this type of provision is likely to change and adapt over the plan period, 
therefore the Plan does not have a specific target for this sector but will rather take a more permissive and 
flexible approach to delivery.   
1.11 The Employment Land  Needs update (WDC, 2017) identified a growth of 5,000 new jobs over the period 
2014 -2036 in Waveney. This was based on a December 2016 model by Experian adjusted to take into 
account the likely impact on local employment from growth in the offshore wind s ector. As well as jobs in 
the offshore sector, m ost jobs growth will be sectors such as health and social care, tourism, retail and 
construction.  
1.12 Around 500 net new jobs will be in sectors requiring new employment premises such as office, factories 
and wa rehouses (falling under use classes B1, B2 and B8 of the use classes order). Considering the jobs 
forecast and the past trends in take up of employment land, the study identifies a need for 43 hectares of 
new employment land development (use classes B1, B2  and B8).  
1.13 Between 2014 and 2017 there was a n increase in 6.3 hectares of employment land, and based on existing 
planning consent s there is projected to be a net loss of 0.2 hectares.  Like housing, this Local Plan has 
allocated more employment land than is  needed  (53.6  hectares are planned to come forward compared to

Lowestoft and Ellough will be developed within the lifetime of the Local Plan. However , it is expected there 
will be some development on these sites. Like housing, it is necessary to allocate slightly more land than is 
required to provide choice and flexibility and in case some sites do not come forward.  
1.14 The Retail and Leisure Needs Assess ment (2016) estimates that by 2032, there will be a need for at least 
another 2,197sqm of food store development and 11,063sqm of non -food types of retail development 
However, the study states  that forecasts of need beyond five  years need to be treated wit h caution due to 
the uncertainties in expenditure growth forecasts and market share beyond this time -frame.  
1.15 The study forecasts need based on population growth and forecasts of expenditure on food and non -food 
products. It takes into account the amount of  shopping undertaken on the internet and the leakage to 
other centres such as Norwich.  
1.16 In the five year period there is no need for new non -food retail and only a need for 850sqm of food store 
development. Since the study was completed planning permission  has been given for a large out of cent re 
retail warehouse complex in s outh Lowestoft comprising 4,090sqm of non -food retail and an Aldi food 
store of 1,155sqm. Planning permission has also been given f or a replacement Lidl store in n orth Lowestoft 
providi ng a gain of 111sqm of food floorspace and 27sqm of non -food floorspace (which has recently 
completed). These commitments mean that there is a remaining need for 6,946sqm of non -food retail 
over the plan period and 1 ,564sqm for food store retail developmen t over the plan period (deep 
discounter floorspace such as that provided by Aldi and Lidl does not have the same expenditure per sqm 
as other superstores, therefore only counts approximately half towards the convenience need). The study 
also identifies the  need for more restaurants and cafés, hotels, gyms and a new multiplex cinema to 
support a growing population.

Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Overall Spatial Strategy  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 29 1.17 National planning policy states that development should be distributed in a way which reduces the need to 
travel, promotes regeneration of brownfield sites, promotes and retains existing services and supports 
rural areas. When considering how development i s distributed, it is also necessary to consider the effects 
on existing infrastructure and the environment.  
1.18 The distribution of growth strategy detailed in Policy WLP1.1 aims to ensure the vision for the Local Plan is 
delivered alongside the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework.  
1.19 By allocating just over half of future development to Lowestoft, the strategy reflects the role of Lowestoft 
as the largest town in the District and its potential for future economic growth. It enables a continui ng 
focus on regeneration of the central areas of the town , whilst allowing for some sustainable extensions for 
the town. With the majority of development allocated to the largest settlement, the need for travel should 
be minimised. This strategy also recog nises Lowestoft Town Centre as the main town centre within the 
District catering for the town’s needs and some of the needs of the rest of the District.  
1.20 The strategy allows for reasonable levels of development in the market towns. All of Waveney’s market 
towns have good employment opportunities, a good range of services and facilities and attractive town 
centres making them sustainable locations for growth. Beccles and Worlingham as the second largest built 
up area  in Waveney is allocated a greater proport ion of growth. This growth will help support and enhance 
the services and facilities in the town and support the town centre as the second largest retail centre 
within the District. Halesworth and Holton are also allocated higher proportions of growth refl ecting 
Halesworth’s status as a market town with good transport links, provision of employment facilities, shops 
and other services and facilities. Bungay and Southwold and Reydon are proposed to take more modest 
levels of growth , reflecting the environmen tal constraints to growth around the towns.  
1.21 Importantly, the strategy reflects the need to support the numerous villages across Waveney. The strategy 
therefore allocates a more significant level of growth to villages than has been experienced in previous 
Local Plans. This reflects the fact that the sustainability circumstances of villages has changed with more 
people being able to work from home and using the internet for services such as shopping and banking. It 
also reflects the fact that without develop ment, the population of villages will decline due to the trend of 
increasingly smaller households. More significant levels of development will allow people with a local 
connection or those who work in the rural areas to live in the rural areas. New housing  should also help 
support existing services and facilities in the rural areas such as small rural schools and pubs and help 
extend super -fast broadband into these areas.  
1.22 Employment land development (use classes B1, B2 and B8) and retail and leisure develo pment is 
concentrated on the towns with a distribution reflecting the housing growth. This enables some balance 
between jobs and homes and homes and retail provision. Employment land growth has been skewed 
towards Lowestoft and Beccles where the Employment  Land Needs Assessment identified the greatest 
potential demand for growth. The distribution for retail growth also reflects the advice on distribution 
contained within the Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment. This balance will help to reduce the need to 
travel and therefore create more sustainable patterns of development.  
1.23 Appendix 3  of this Local Plan summarise s the amount of housing for each settlement expected to be 
delivered over the plan period and when it will be delivered. Appendix 3  also details the amount of 
employment land allocated in each area.  Overall Spatial Strategy  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
30                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP1.1 – Scale and Location of Growth  
In the period 2014 to 2036, the Council will:  
 Make provision for the delivery of a minimum 8,223 dwellings  in Waveney  (374 per 
year) .  
 Maximise opportunities for economic growth, with the aim of achieving a minimum of 
5,000 additional jobs in Waveney.  
To deliver this, make provision for:  
o 43 hectares  of employment land for B1/B2/B8 uses.  
o 2,200m2 (net) of convenience (food) and 11,000m2 (net) of comparison (non -
food) retail floorspace.  
In order to sustainably deliver the growth targets set out above, new residential development will be 
distributed across the District approximately as follows:  
 Lowestoft Area  - 56% of housing growth  
 Beccles and Worlingham - 16% of housing growth  
 Halesworth and Holton - 8% of housing growth  
 Bungay - 6% of housing growth  
 Southwold and Reydon - 4% of housing growth  
 Rural Area - 10% of housing growth (See Policy WLP7.1 for more detail on the 
distribution across r ural villages)  
 
Employment land development will be focused mainly in Lowestoft and Beccles and distributed 
approximately as follows:  
 Lowestoft Area  - 60% of employment land development  
 Beccles - 25% of employment land development  
 Other Market Towns and Ru ral Areas - 15% of employment land development  
 
60-70% of retail and leisure development will be focused in Lowestoft Town Centre as the District’s main 
town centre. Beccles as the next largest town  centre  should accommodate approximately 15% of retail and 
leisure development. The remaining proportion of devel opment should come from within District Centres 
(Oulton Broad and Kirkley), Local Centres (including new Local Centres on large housing allocations) a nd 
other Market Towns  Town Centres  commensurate with the level of housing and employment growth.  
Provision has been made in this Local Plan through site allocations and policies to deliver this scale and 
strategic distribution of growth. Neighbourhood Pla ns can allocate additional growth to meet local needs 
at a scale which does not undermine the overall distribution strategy.

Settlement Boundaries  
1.24 Central to local planning is delivery of sustainable development. Resolution 42/187 of the United Nations 
General Assembly defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The UK Sustainable Development 
Strategy Securing the Future sets out five ‘guiding principles’ of sustainable development:   
 living within the planet’s environmental limits;  
 ensuring a strong, healthy and just society;  
 achieving a sustainable economy;  
 promoting good governance; and  
 using sound science responsibly.  
1.25 Paragraphs 18 to 219 of the  National Planning Policy  Framework, taken as a whole, constitute the 
Government’s view of what sustainable development in England means in practice for the planning 
system.  
1.26 The Council considers that the strategy, policies and site allocations set o ut in this Local Plan will achieve 
sustainable development in Waveney.  
1.27 At the heart of the National Planning Policy Framework is a presumption in favour of sustainable 
development. This means that Local Pla ns should meet the development needs of the area unless the 
adverse impacts of doing so would outweigh the benefits when assessed against the Framework . For 
decision making, the Framework states that development which accords with the Local Plan should be 
approved without delay . Where the Local Plan is a bsent, silent or relevant policies are out -of-date,  the 
Framework states that permission  should be granted  unless the adverse impacts of doing so would 
outweigh the benefits when assessed against the policies in the Framework.  
 
 
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Overall Spatial Strategy  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 33 Policy WLP1.2 – Presumptio n in Favour of Sustainable Development  
Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Local Plan (and, where relevant, with policies in 
Neighbourhood Plans) will be approved wherever possible without delay, unless material considerations 
indic ate otherwise.  
Where there are no policies relevant to the application , or relevant policies are out of date at the time of 
making the decision, planning permission will be granted unless:  
 The proposal would undermine the achievement of the vision and  the strategic 
priorities /objectives set out in this Local Plan;  
 The adverse effects of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the 
benefits, when assessed against national planning policy; or  
 Specific national planning policies indicate that dev elopment should be refused .  
 
1.28 This Local Plan makes provision for more than enough development to meet needs over the plan period 
and therefore satisfies the presumption in favour of sustainable development for plan making. In order for 
the vision and strategy to be successful , it is necessary that the Local Plan controls and limits development 
in certain locations. The Local Plan also needs to give clear signals to developers, the community and 
infrastructure providers about where development will take  place and where it will not take place. 
Furthermore, to meet objectives on preserving natural resources and the countryside, the Local Plan must 
ensure undeveloped land in the countryside is not unnecessarily lost to development in excess of the 
needs acc ommodated by the Local Plan. Settlement boundaries are a useful and positive tool in meeting 
these objectives.  
1.29 Settlement boundaries define the built up area of settlements, and subject to the other policies of this 
Local Plan, indicate where development f or housing, employment and town centre development would be 
suitable. They therefore allow for flexibility in the Local Plan by potentially allowing more development 
than is planned for by the allocation of specific sites, at the same time as avoiding the loss of further 
undeveloped land in the countryside and further urban sprawl. Limiting development beyond settlement 
boundaries lowers land values in these l ocations by removing the ‘ hope value’ for high value developments 
such as market housing. This allo ws the Council to develop ‘exception site policies’ which allow for certain 
types of development such as 100% affordable housing schemes or schemes for the relocation of homes at 
risk fr om coastal erosion which would no t otherwise be viable if they were competing for land with market 
housing.  
1.30 Policy WLP1.3 defines settlement boundaries and restricts the development of new residential, 
employment and retail uses outside of settlement boundaries.  Overall Spatial Strategy  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
34                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP1.3 – Settleme nt Boundaries  
Settlement boundaries are defined on the Policies Map. Land which is outside of settlement boundaries 
and allocations in the Local Plan and Neighbourhood Plans is considered as the Countryside.  
New residential1, employment2 and town centre3 development will not be permitted in the Cou ntryside 
except where specific p olicies in this Local Plan indicate otherwise.  
Neighbourhood Plans can make minor adjustments to settlement boundaries and allocate additional land 
for residential, employment and  town centre development providing that the adjustments and allocations 
do not undermine the overall distribution strategy outlined in Policy WLP1.1 and woul d not be contrary to 
the other p olicies of this Local Plan.  
Neighbourhood Development Orders can pe rmit development outside of settlement boundaries providing 
that the overall distribution strategy outlined in Policy WLP1.1 is not undermined and the development 
woul d not be contrary to the other p olicies of this Local Plan.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 35 Infrastructure  
1.31 The provision of new and improved infrastructure is essential to ensure the growth planned in the District 
is sustainable. Infrastructure includes a wide range of facilities and services including schools, medical 
facilities, community facilities, open spa ce, roads, railways, cycle paths and flood defences.  
1.32 New growth can place extra pressure on existing infrastructure and create a need for new services and 
facilities.  
1.33 The Council has produced a number of evidence bases to support the Local Plan, includin g:  
 Local Plan Infrastructure Study  (2018)  which assessed what infrastructure is needed to support 
the growth outlined in the Local Plan.  
 Waveney Water Cycle Study (2017) outlines the water infrastructure needs to support 
development.  
 Waveney Local Plan:  Suffolk County Transport Model (SCTM) - Preferred Option Traffic 
Forecasting Report(2018 ) identifies areas of the network where transport mitigation measures 
may be needed to accommodate growth.  
 Waveney Open Space Needs Assessment (2015) and the Green In frastructure Strategy (2015) 
outline needs for open space and green infrastructure across the District.  
1.34 The infrastructure needs identified for each town and village are outlined in the section of the Local Plan 
relevant to that settlement. Appendix 1  of this document provides a summary of all the infrastructure 
needed in the District  and how and when it is expected to be delivered to support growth .  
 
 
Overall Spatial Strategy  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
36                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  1.35 There are three strategic pieces of infrastructure which are expected to be delivered during the plan 
period. These are the Lake Lothing Third Crossing, the Lowestoft Flood Risk Management Project and the 
Beccles Southern Relief Road. The Lake Lothing Third Crossing will link the A12 via Waveney Drive  on the 
south side of Lake Lothing, to Denmark Road and P eto Way  on the north side of Lake Lothing. It is 
expected to cost nearly £92 million of which £73 million has been secured from the Department for 
Transport. The Lowestoft Flood Risk Management Project involves reducing flood risk from all sources in 
Lowes toft through a range of measures. The Beccles Southern Relief Road is now under construction and is 
intended to improve the centre of Beccles by diverting heavy goods vehicles and commercial traffic away 
from the centre, and improve connections to the Ello ugh industrial estates, enhancing the potential for 
business growth.   
1.36 Outside of the District there are plans to upgrade the A12 including a bypass of the four villages of 
Marlesford, Little Glemham, Stratford St Andrew and Farnham. This project will increase accessibility to 
Waveney from Ipswich and help support the development of Sizewell C. Also outside the District there are 
plans to make significant improvement s to the A47 which links Lowestoft to Peterborough via Great 
Yarmouth and Norwich. Some of these works include improvement s to junctions in Great Yarmouth. The 
Council will work with partners to ensure the delivery of these key projects both inside and outside of the 
District and ensure that following completion they are a success and bring s ignificant benefits to the 
District.   
1.37 The A146 which links Lowestoft to Beccles and onwards to Norwich is expected to see significant increases 
in traffic . Although there are no plans in place at present, the Council will support future plans for 
improvements to this route including a bypass of the ‘Barnby Bends’ between Lowestoft and Beccles.   
1.38 New development has a responsibility to contribute towards the cost of new infrastructure. Infrastructure 
is often funded by developers either through secti on 106 planning obligations or the Community 
Infrastructure Levy. Section 106 planning obligations are bespoke agreements made between the Council 
and the developer where the developer either delivers new infrastructure or contributes money to fund 
infrast ructure to meet the need that development generates. The Community Infrastructure Levy is a 
standard per sqm charge on most types of new development which the Council pools together to deliver 
necessary infrastructure.  
1.39 Waveney has had a Community Infrastr ucture Levy in place since August 2013, and is currently the main 
way in which the Council collects funds from development. The rates of the Levy are set out in the  
Council’s Charging Schedule. The Council intends to retain the Levy  for most infrastructure  funding. The 
Council will however, need to review the Levy , particularly with respect to the larger sites allocated in the 
Local Plan . This is because these sites will have on -site infrastructure which will be more effectively 
secured through section 106 planning obligations.   
1.40 Policy WLP1.4 sets out the strategic approach to infrastructure delivery across the District. The policy seeks 
to ensure that developments will be well supported by new and improved infrastructure.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Overall Spatial Strategy  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 37 1.41 Most needs generated by new develo pment will necessitate improvements to existing infrastructure 
rather than completely new provision. Therefore, most infrastructure provision will take place outside of 
development sites. This infrastructure will be funded by th e Community Infrastructure L evy.  
1.42 Housing s ites of 1 hectare or more are generally large enough to provide useable open space on site. The 
provision of new open space on site increases the opportunities and accessibility for play, physical activity 
and recreation which contributes si gnificantly towards the health and well -being of the population. This 
will be secured through planning conditions and/or section 106 planning obligations.   
1.43 Other on -site infrastructure is only likely to be necessary in much larger developments where a new 
primary school may be needed for example. However, there are specific local needs where smaller 
development can enable the delivery of locally needed infrastructure on site. Examples include new 
community centres or village halls.  On-site infrastructure wi ll generally be secured throu gh section 106 
planning obligations.   
1.44 Sustainable transport infrastructure and considerations are dealt with specifically under Policy WLP8.21.  
1.45 Effective telecommunications, including broadband and mobile phone signals are  essential for economic 
development . However, coverage remains poor in  some areas, particularly outside of the towns. In these 
locations s peeds tend to be slow with maximum speeds rarely exceeding 10mbs and many areas struggling 
to achieve speeds of 3mbs.  New development, particularly in the rural areas, presents an opportunity, to 
improve telecommunications. Policy WLP1.4 sets out a proactive approach to improving 
telecommunications infrastructure and requires all new development to provide the fastest possibl e 
broadband to premises within the development.

The Council will work with partners including, Suffolk County C ouncil, Parish and Town Council s, Highways 
England, Environment Agency,  Anglian Water  and the Great Yarmouth an d Waveney Clinical 
Commissioning Group to ensure that the growth outlined in this Local Plan is supported by necessary 
infrastructure. The Council will work with partners to ensure the timely delivery and the success of:  
 The Lake Lothing Third Crossing  
 The Lowestoft Flood Risk Management Project  
 The Beccles Southern Relief Road  
 A12 improvements between Lowestoft and Ipswich  
 A47 improvements between Lowestoft and Peterborough  
 Improvements to the A146 between Lowestoft and Norwich.  
Developers must consider the infrastructure requirements needed to support and service the proposed 
development. All development will be expected to contribute towards infrastructure provision to meet the 
needs generated.  
Off-site infrastructure will generally be funded by the Com munity Infrastructure Levy . On-site 
infrastructure will generally be secured and funded through section 106 planning obligations.   
Open space should be provided on residential development sites of 1 hectare or more in size and be based 
on the needs identif ied in the Waveney Green Infrastructure Strategy and Open Space Needs Assessment.  
New primary schools should be provided on sites where there is inadequate  capacity within local 
catchment schools and there is no potential to expand the local schools to ac commodate the pupils arising 
from the development. New primary schools should be provided in locations which are central and within 
walking distance to the catchments they will serve.  
Development will not be permitted where it would have a significant eff ect on the capacity of existing 
infrastructure , and therefore potential risks to the natural environment  which cannot be mitigated. 
Specifically, developers should  provide evidence to  ensure there is capacity in the water recycling centre 
and the wastewate r network  in time to serve the development . Where there is no capacity in the water 
recycling centre, development may need to be phased in order to allow improvement works to take place.  
The Council will work with the telecommunications industry to maximi se access to super -fast broadband, 
wireless hotspots and improved mobile signals for all residents and businesses. All new developments 
must provide the most viable high -speed broadband connection.  If a fibre connection cannot currently be 
provided, infrastructure within the site should be designed to allow for fibre provision in the future.

40                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  2 Strategy for  the Lowestoft  Area  
2.1 The Lowestoft area comprises Lowestoft and the parishes of 
Carlton Colville, Corton, Gisleham, Oulton and Oulton Broad. 
The Lowestoft area is expected to accommodate the majority 
of the District’s development over the next 20 years. The ke y 
focus of the Local Plan is to continue the promotion of 
regeneration in Central Lowestoft and expand it to include 
coastal areas of the town and beyond to Corton. 
Regeneration in Central and Coastal Lowestoft will deliver a significant amount of new hous ing as well as 
new economic development including new industry, retail and leisure. However, there will be a need for 
the town to expand outwards to accommodate new housing and employment land development.  
2.2 In total, land has been allocated in this Local P lan for over  4,000 new homes in the Lowestoft area. This is 
in addition to the 1,568 which currently have planning permission. However, not all of the 4,000 homes 
allocated will be delivered within the plan period. Over the plan period , in total , it is expected that the  
Lowestoft area will grow by 5,2 06 new homes. Lowestoft is expected to take the largest share of new jobs 
created over the next 20 years. The Local Plan allocates 38 hectares of new employment land. However, it 
is unlikely that all of this employment land will be delivered within the plan period.  
2.3 When looking at the physical expansion of the urban area of Lowestoft there are a number of constraints 
to growth. The town can only grow on a north -south axis due to the North Sea to the e ast and the Broads 
to the west. The northern and particularly the southern extremes of the town are now some distance from 
the town centre and therefore there are limits on how much further the town can grow sustainably 
outwards. As such new development ne eds to be of a scale which can deliver new services and facilities. A 
further issue is to manage and limit to coalescence of the town with surrounding villages such as 
Blundeston, Corton, Gisleham , Hopton (in Norfolk) and Kessingland to ensure each settlem ent retains its 
individual identity.   
2.4 A further constraint is that much of the land surrounding Lowestoft is high grade agricultural land. Much of 
the land to the south of the town being the highest grade, Grade 1 agricultural land. The landscape to 
much o f the north of the town is also particularly sensitive to development, with the exception of the sites 
allocated for development.  
2.5 Considering the above, the focus for development on the edge of the town is to deliver a mix of strategic 
scale developments and a number of smaller scale housing and employment developments to support the 
town.  
                                                             
4 Sites with planning permission or on Local Development Framework allocations which are expected to complete before 2036.  This does 
not include  sites with planning permission on  allocations which have been rolled forward into this Local Plan such as the Kirkley Waterfront 
and Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood site.  New homes  in Lowestoft  Total

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 41 2.6 A strategic new development to the north of  the town (in the parish of Corton) , the North of Lowestoft 
Garden Village (Policy WLP2.13)  will deliver a significant amount of new housing over the longer term, 
supported by essential community facilities. These extra community facilities will be of sign ificant benefit 
to the population of Corton whilst retaining the character and identity of the existing settlement. The site 
will also deliver employment land where the demand is greatest due to the sub -regional linkages with 
Great Yarmouth. To the south o f the town another strategic development  (Policy WLP2.16)  is proposed 
which will deliver a new, more centrally located primary school for Carlton Colville, parking for the existing 
primary school in the short term, a country park and flood risk mitigation in line with the Lowestoft Flood 
Risk Management Project.   
2.7 Due to its proximity to the European protected sites, the growth in Lowestoft will require mitigation and 
planning applications will require project level Habitat Regulations Assessment.  More detai ls are found in 
Policy WLP8.34.

Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for the Lowestoft Area  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 43 Central and Coastal Lowestoft Regeneration  
2.9 Lowestoft has long been identified as a priority area for regeneration. As discussed above the town faces 
significant challenges with issues relating to poor eco nomic performance, and high levels of deprivation. 
These issues are at their most acute within the central parts of the town. It is these parts of the town 
which also have the greatest potential for positive transformation.  
2.10 Central and Coastal Lowestoft benefits from the town centre, port, the beach and Broads, extensive areas 
of waterfront , a rich historic environment  and good public transport links. It also benefits from substantial 
redevelopment opportunities on former industrial sites which are curren tly underutilised or derelict. 
Central Lowestoft will also experience significant change over this plan period with the planned Third 
Crossing over Lake Lothing and strategic flood protection measures.  
2.11 To address the need for regeneration the last Local P lan included an Area Action Plan (2012) for the Lake 
Lothing and Outer Harbour area of Central Lowestoft. This development plan document provided a spatial 
policy framework for revitalisation of the area. It included specific policies to manage and support  
development of the area, together with specific site allocations for the development of different parts of 
the area. The plan set out to provide 1, 585 new homes, new industry and new retail and leisure facilities.  
2.12 Progress has been made on many of the al locations in the Area Action Plan. Planning permiss ions have 
been granted for 1,181  new homes on the Kirkley Waterfront and Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood site. 
New offices have been constructed on Riverside Road. Existing engineering businesses have expa nded in 
the PowerPark and East Anglia ONE and Galloper windfarms have announced investment in the town.  
2.13 However, there is still more work to be done. This Local Plan replaces the Area Action Plan in its entirety. 
However, it carries forward many of the pr oposals in order ensure a planned approach to the regeneration 
of Central Lowestoft is achieved. This Local Plan also widens the scope by considering how the existing 
regeneration proposals fit with the wider part of Central Lowestoft including the town ce ntre and the 
coast from Corton to South Beach.   
 
Strategy for the Lowestoft Area | Wave ney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
44                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan   
 1 Improve connections and permeability within the area. Including ensuring the third 
crossing supports connections through central Lowestoft and to the town centre, creating 
better pedestrian and cycle connections between the Broads, East of England Park and  North 
Denes and South Beach through to Pakefield.   
 2 Create a better relationship to the waterfron t, particularly along the south side of Lake 
Lothing.   
 3 Support Lowestoft Port and capitalise on the growth of offshore renewables and offshore 
related engineering.   
 4 Enhance the vitality and viability of Lowestoft Town Centre.  
 5 Bring back underutilised and derelict land into positive use.  
 6 Enhance the tourism offer of the area.  
 7 Enhance the quality of design , the public realm  and the historic  environment, particularly 
around the Historic High Street.  
 8 Deliver new housing in an accessible location bringing a better mix of tenures and types of 
housing to the area.   
 9 Reduce the need to travel by car.  
 10 Improve the natural, historic and built environmental quality of the area.   
2.14 To deliver th ese high level objectives, the P lan and table below identify the main themed opportunity 
areas, the links between them and the overall spatial objectives for those areas. For some areas specific 
site allocations are identified, many of these are rolled forward from the Lake Lothing and Outer Harbour 
Area Action Plan. It is expected that development proposals should be broadly in line with the spatial 
objectives for each themed opportunity area. Any Nei ghbourhood Plans and Neighbourhood Development 
Orders prepared in Lowestoft or Oulton Broad, provide an opportunity to add further detail to these high 
level objectives and identify further specific development proposals to deliver them. A strategy for the  
town centre area (including the following themed areas; Retail Core and Enhanced Leisure Area, Peto 
Square Leisure Area, Heritage and Community Shopping Area, Office and Town Centre Service Area and 
Town Centre Residential Area) is also being prepared whi ch will provide further detail including land -use 
and non -planning measures to help improve the vitality and viability of the town centre. Planning 
measures identified in the masterplan could be adopted through a Neighbourhood Plan or a 
Supplementary Plann ing Document.  
2.15 For some areas there are specific proposals and policies in this Local Plan which will help deliver these 
spatial objectives . Figure 6  shows site s proposed for allocation in Central Lowestoft. These specific 
allocations together with other s ite specific designations are covered in this section under Policies WLP2.2

2.16 Large parts of the area around Lake Lothing are at risk from flooding. The National Planning Policy 
Framework states that Local Plans should use a sequential test to steer new development to areas with 
lowest probability of flooding. However, the Framework  also states that if it is not consistent with wider 
sustainability objectives to do this, development can be allocated in areas at risk from flooding, providing 
the exception test is passed which ensures development is safe from flooding for its lifetime.  It is 
considered that the sustainability benefits of regenerating Central Lowestoft outweigh the potential flood 
risk of this area. The Core Strategy (2009) and the Lake Lothing and Outer Harbour Area Action Plan (2012) 
applied the sequential test and exc eptions test to the regeneration of Lake Lothing and justified the 
delivery of 1,500 homes, employment, retail and leisure development in this location. It is considered that 
the roll forward of these regeneration objectives into this Local Plan also meet those requirements. 
Individual proposals on regeneration sites will need to follow the sequential approach within the site and 
be subject to a site -specific flood risk assessment and accompanied by a flood evacuation plan which will 
demonstrate the develop ment will remain safe in the event of a flood.

50                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  PowerPark  
Employment development  
2.17 There is huge potential for growth in Waveney associated with the development of off shore wind farms. 
The East Anglia Array which is located just off the coast of Lowestoft will be one of the largest wind farms 
in the world with a capacity of up to 7GW. The first phase of this scheme has consent and the Outer 
Harbour which forms part of t he PowerPark has been chosen as the construction management and 
operations and maintenance base for the phase. The second phase is now being considered for consent 
and four further phases are being progressed to planning. In total it is estimated that at l east 1,500 new 
direct and indirect jobs will be created in Waveney as a result of these developments.  
2.18 In addition to offshore wind, there are also opportunities for growth from other offshore related sectors, 
including oil and gas and other offshore renewa bles.  
2.19 The PowerPark Demand and Need Report (BVG Associates, 2009) identifies that the PowerPark is well 
placed to capitalise on growth in the offshore energy sector. The study advises that a mix of energy sectors 
including offshore wind, offshore research  and development, and marine engineering will deliver the 
maximum economic and employment benefit from the PowerPark. Responding to this, the Area Action 
Plan identified the site as the main focus for a cluster of offshore related businesses. This Local Pl an 
continues this approach.  
2.20 The allocation borders the East Inshore Marine Plan area. The Policy helps support the objectives of the East 
Marine Plan and is consistent with East Marine Plan policies EC3 and WIND1 and WIND2. These policies and 
the objectiv es of the East Marine Plan should be considered in developing proposals in this area.  
2.21 The PowerPark is already home to a number of offshore related companies including Greater Gabbard 
Wind Farm, East Anglia Offshore Wind and Sembmarine SLP. The PowerPark i s also home to OrbisEnergy 
which provides office space for businesses focused on the energy sector. The objective for this site is to 
further enhance this cluster through new development and redevelopment and re -use of existing premises 
within the site. Th ere is limited vacant land available within the site for new development, so most 
development will involve the redevelopment or re -use of existing premises. The Council has prepared a 
relocation strategy and will continue to support and facilitate existing  businesses operating in the area that 
are not in the energy sector to relocate to other areas within the town. Additional employment land has 
been allocated by Policies WLP2.1 3 and WLP2.1 8 in north Lowestoft which could accommodate businesses 
wishing to r elocate.  
2.22 The site includes part of the both North Lowestoft and South Lowestoft Conservation Areas. Therefore 
proposals should have regard to the National Planning Policy Framework with respect to conservation 
areas and the local provisions set out in Pol icy WLP8.39 of this Local Plan. The site also contains some non -
designated heritage assets. Careful consideration should be given to the significance of these heritage 
assets and any potential harm from development in line with Policy WLP8.37. Where possib le these assets 
should be retained as part of new development. Proposals should have regard to WLP8.38 Locally Listed 
Buildings and Non -Designated Heritage Assets.   Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for the Lowestoft Area  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 51 Policy WLP2.2 – PowerPark  
Land comprising the PowerPark (23.37 hectares) as defined on the Policies Map is allocated for 
employment development (use classes B1, B2 and B8) and port related development. Associated and 
ancillary uses necessary to support the offshore energy and engineering sectors will also be permitted.  
Proposa ls involving the redevelopment or change of use of existing premises, to uses not falling within the 
uses allocated in the paragraph above will not be permitted.  
The Council will work with Suffolk County Council, Associated British Ports, the Environment A gency , the 
Marine Management Organisation  and landowners to:  
 Improve the general appearance of the site through improvements to the public realm, 
landscaping improvements and on -site branding.  
 Improve cycle and pedestrian conne ctivity to and through the si te and ensure sufficient 
car parking is available.  
 Provide wayfinding and orientation facilities including signposting to the town centre, 
the Scores, the historic High Street, the East of England Park and Ness Point.  
 Improve the visibility and appearance  of the waterfront. This should include 
improvements to the current fencing treatment and ensure proposed flood walls are 
attractive and allow for visibility of the waterfront.  
New development and redevelopment within the site should be developed in accor dance with the 
following site specific criteria:  
 Provision should be made for cyclists including covered secure cycle parking and 
showering facilities for employees.  
 Development should  avoid and if necessary  mitigate any impact on the Outer Harbour 
Kittiwa ke Colony and Ness Point County Wildlife Site.  A completed ecological 
assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as part of any 
planning application s. 
 Proposals should respect the cultural heritage of the area and ensure  where po ssible  
buildings which are non -designated heritage assets are retained as part of any 
redevelopment.  
 All new development will be subject to a site specific flood risk assessment. A flood 
evacuation plan and details of mitigation measures to the satisfactio n of the Council’s 
Emergency Planners must be submitted with any planning application s.

Mixed use including restaurants, drinking establishments and leisure uses  
2.23 The area around Station Square to the north of the Bascule Bridge provides a  key gateway to the town 
with a historic t ownscape which benefits from a conservation a rea and a number of listed and locally listed 
buildings including the  Grade II listed  Customs House  (known as ‘Port House’ on the National Heritage List 
for England) , the Tuttles Building and the Railway Station.   
2.24 The area contains a number of secondary town centre related service, retail and catering businesses but 
suffers from the effects of through traffic on the A47/ A12. It is expected  that the effects of traffic in t his 
location will be reduced once the planned third vehicular crossing is in place.  The delivery of the third 
crossing is therefore essential to improving the general amenity and therefore the attractiveness of this 
area and the town centre as a whole to t he market.  
2.25 The Lake Lothing and Outer Harbour Area Action Plan proposed this area to be the focus of new retail 
development in the town. However, this involved longer term proposals to move the station. This now 
looks unlikely to be achieved and the overal l need for retail development across the District is now smaller 
than previously forecasted. However, there is still potential for significant improvements to be made in this 
location and potential for new development which will support the town centre and  complement the 
existing cluster of leisure uses in the locality. The Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (2016) states that 
Peto Square has the potential to accommodate significant new retail, leisure and mixed use development 
over the medium to long term .  
2.26 The planned strategic flood defence measures which form part of the Lowestoft Flood Risk Management 
Project will have the effect of protecting this site from flooding in the current 1 in 200 year event. As such 
there may be scope over the plan period fo r development defined by national planning policy as ‘more 
vulnerable’ such as hotels, drinking establishments and houses to take place in this area.  
2.27 Policy WLP2.3 continues to allocate the area around Station Square and the Custom House for leisure and 
retail uses. Providing flood risk issues are overcome the policy recognises the potential for hotel 
development and residential development in this area. The main objectives of the policy are to support 
and enhance the town centre, improve the general appea rance of the area and protect the areas valuable 
heritage. There is uncertainty at present as to the amount of development which could be accommodated 
on this site and when it could be delivered. As such any development delivered on the site will be in 
addition to the targets set out in Policy WLP1.1.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 53 2.28 To guide development in this sensitive location a development brief in the form of a Supplementary 
Planning Document or as part of a Neighbourhood Plan will be prepared.  
Policy WLP2.3 – Peto Square  
Land comprising Peto Square (6.8 hectares) as defined on the Policies Map is allocated for mixed -use 
development including restaurants (use class A3), drinking establishments (use class A4) leisure uses (use 
class D2) and retail (use class A1).  
Once strat egic flood defence measures are in place residential and hotel development will be supported 
on this site as part of mixed use developments  subject to a site specific flood risk assessment 
demonstrating the development will be safe in accordance with  the Exceptions test .  
The Council will work with Suffolk County Council, Associated British Ports, Network Rail, the Environment 
Agency, landowners and local businesses to:  
 Reduce the impact of traffic on the site as part of the measures associated with the 
third vehicular crossing of Lake Lothing.  
 Improve the visibility and appearance of the waterfront. This should include 
improvements to the current fencing and ensure proposed flood walls are attractive 
and allow for visibility of the waterfront.  
 Improve faci lities and the appearance of the railway station, including bringing vacant 
parts of the station back in to use.  
 Improve pedestrian and cycle links to the seafront.  
New development and redevelopment within the site should be developed in accordance with t he 
following site specific criteria:  
 The Custom House and surrounding area should be sympathetically brought back into 
active use. The space between the Custom House and the waterfront should be 
developed as a high quality public space.  
 Development should preserve an d enhance the character of the conservation a rea. 
 New public realm treatments should be consistent with the existing areas of public 
realm at Royal Plain and Station Square.  
 Development should facilitate improved pedestrian connections through t he site.  
 All new development will be subject to a site specific flood risk assessment. A flood 
evacuation plan and details of mitigation measures to the satisfaction of the Council’s 
Emergency Planners must be submitted with any planning application.  
A Ne ighbourhood Plan or Supplementary Planning Document should be prepared to provide further detail 
on how the site should be developed.

Mixed use including residential development, employment development, primary 
school, playing field and local retail centre  
2.29 Kirkley Waterfront and the proposed Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood comprise predominantly 
underutilised or underused brownfield land on the south bank of Lake Lothing between Riverside Roa d and 
Stanley Road. The site was originally allocated in the Lake Lothing and Outer Harbour Area Action Plan for 
1,380 new homes and associated community uses and new employment development.  
2.30 The site covers some 60 hectares. Figure 8  shows the different pa rts of the site.  
Figure 8 - Kirkley Waterfront and Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood site  
 
© Crown copyright [and database rights] 201 8 OS100042052  
2.31 Much progress has already been made towards the regeneration of this area. Outline planning permission 
has been granted for 1,180 new homes, new retail, and leisure facilities, a playing field and a primary 
school. In the Riverside Road area, new offices h ave been constructed for Essex and Suffolk Water and 
Waveney District Council and Suffolk County Council. However, the Jeld Wen Factory site remains 
underutilised and a long lease on the site means it may not be available for redevelopment until the early 
2020s. As such Policy WLP2.4 continues to allocate this area for mixed use development, with the 
objective of achieving a comprehensive approach to the delivery of 1,380 new homes and new 
employment development.  
2.32 The planned third vehicular crossing of Lak e Lothing will traverse the eastern part of the site providing 
better north -south connections and further helping to stimulate regeneration in the area. A pedestrian 
and cycle bridge at Brooke Peninsula connecting to Normanston Park is also proposed which will further 
help reduce the need to travel by car. This pedestrian and cycle bridge will provide the site with access to a 
multi -functional open space at Normanston Park which reduces the amount of open space needed on the 
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for the Lowestoft Area  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 55 site and enhance its deliverabil ity. The regeneration of the site is also likely to significantly benefit from the 
planned strategic flood defence measures for Lake Lothing.  
2.33 Most of the residential development on the site should be provided in the west of the site including on the 
forme r Sanyo site, the Brooke Business Park and Jeld Wen Playing Fields, the former SCA Recycling Site, 
and the former Witham Paints Factory site. This area generally has less probability of flooding. This part of 
the site is currently accessed from School Road  and Heath Road. These roads are not considered suitable 
for accommodating the entire amount of residential development on the site. A new access road is 
required through the site from Waveney Drive to service these developments. The construction of this 
access road will likely result in the loss of a small area of the Brooke Yachts and Jeld Wen Mosaic  County 
Wildlife Site. Parts of the County Wildlife Site support good populations of common lizard, however, much 
of the site is of poorer quality and heavily  overgrown limiting its habitat value for lizards. The area of 
County Wildlife Site likely to be lost to accommodate the access road is largely overgrown. To mitigate this 
impact the remaining County Wildlife Site area should be enhanced to support an incr eased level of 
biodiversity and enhanced habitat for common lizards  and other priority species .  
2.34 Waveney has an ageing population and t he Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) identified a 
significant need for new  sheltered and extra care housing  and new care homes . This large site, which will 
likely be delivered by a number of developers provides an opportunity to deliver a retirement community 
comprising a care home and /or a proportion of extra care/ sheltered dwellings . These will form part of the 
total housing allocated on the site. The development should be designed  utilising dementia friendly design  
principles (see Policy WLP8.31 on Lifetime Design).  
2.35 New employment development on the site should be focused along the waterfront of the former Jeld W en 
Factory site. This area has a higher risk of flooding and is therefore less suitable for residential 
development. The waterfront is also valuable for employment development which could support the 
offshore wind and engineering sectors and supplement the  proposals at the PowerPark. There are a small 
number of existing businesses operating out of Brooke Business Park. The outline planning permission for 
this site promotes residential development over much of the Brooke Business Park. The Council will 
suppo rt existing businesses to help them relocate. The Council will also support and require the continued 
use of the slipways at Brooke Peninsula by local people and businesses as part of the development.  
2.36 The development of the area should exhibit exceptional  urban design. It should score particularly well 
against Building for Life criteria (see Policy WLP8.29). Developers are encouraged to seek Built for Life 
Quality Mark for housing development on the site.  
2.37 A Development Brief for the site has been adopted as a Supplementary Planning Document. The brief 
provides further detail to guide the development of the site and planning applications for development on 
the site should be in accordance with the guidance and the outline masterplan detailed in the brief. T he 
Development Brief will be kept under review and may be amended in line with Policy WLP2.4 to take into 
account changing circumstances. This review could take place through a revised Supplementary Planning 
Document or as part of a Neighbourhood Plan.  Strategy for the Lowestoft Area | Wave ney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
56                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP2.4 – Kirkley Waterfront and Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood

Residential development should be predominantly located to the west of the site including on the former 
Sanyo site, the Brooke B usiness Park and Jeld Wen Playing Fields, the former SCA Recycling Site, and the 
former Witham Paints Factory site.  
The primary school, playing field and local centre should be located centrally within the residential 
development around the main access roa d.  
New employment development/redevelopment (falling under use classes B1, B2 and B8) and port related 
development should be focused on the waterfront area of the former Jeld Wen Factory Site. Proposals 
involving the redevelopment or change of use of exis ting employment premises on Riverside Road, 
Lowestoft Enterprise Park, and Quayside Business Centre, falling within Use Classes B1, B2 or B8, for uses 
not falling within Use Classes B1, B2 or B8 will only be permitted where:  
 Marketing evidence is provided which demonstrates the premises have been marketed 
for a sustained period of 12 months in accordance with the requirements set out in 
Appendix 4; and  
 The proposed use is compatible with the surrounding employment uses in terms of car 
parking, access, noise , odour and other amenity concerns.  
New development and redevelopment within the site should be developed in accordance with the 
following site specific criteria:  
 The site should be configured around a legible street pattern which incorporates key 
views o f the waterfront and provides good walking and cycling environments.  
 Residential development should be designed to densities of between 40 and 90 
dwellings per hectare.  
 A central transport node with sheltered bus waiting facilities should be provided wit hin

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 57  Employment development should consider neighbouring residential uses and 
landscaping and buffers should be employed to avoid amenity issues .  
 Development should provide a continuous east -west waterfront pedestrian and cycle 
route across the site. Signage and wayfinding measures should be provided to help 
navigation between the seafront and the Broads. The waterfront path should include a 
mult ifunctional hard surfaced public space.  
 A new access road from the Jeld Wen Playing Fields is required to serve the majority of 
the residential development.  
 A network of children's play areas totalling 1 ,800sqm should be provided in accessible, 
well-over looked locations throughout the residential parts of the site.  
 Development should facilitate the enhancement of the Brooke Yachts and Jeld Wen 
Mosaic County Wildlife Site to mitigate the loss of part of the site which is needed to 
facilitate the construct ion of the access road. A completed ecological assessment 
undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as part of any planning 
application.  
 Development should support and enhance ecological networks throughout the site.  
 Slipways on the Brooke Peninsula should be retained and made available for use by the 
public and businesses.  
 All new development will be subject to a site specific flood risk assessment. A flood 
evacuation plan and details of mitigation measures to the satisfaction of the  Council’s 
Emergency Planners must be submitted with any planning application.  
 
A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be submitted with any planning application.  
Development on the site should also be in conformity with the guidance and the outline masterplan 
detailed in the Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood and Kirkley Waterfront Development Brief. Revisions 
may be made to the Development Brief through a revised Sup plementary Planning Document or as part of 
a Neighbourhood Plan.  
On-site infrastructure, including the primary school, playing field and pedestrian/cycle bridge will be 
secured and funded through Section 106 planning obligations.  More details are included  in Appendix 1.

Destination park  
2.38 Lowestoft is home to Britain’s most easterly point, Ness Point. However, the point has poor connections 
and is surrounded by impermeable industrial land. There is existing open space to the north  of Ness Point 
which is connected to Ness Point by the promenade and has heritage value with a collection of historic 
fishing net drying racks  which form part of the North Lowestoft Conservation Area . The space also has 
ecological value. However, this spac e is underutilised and poorly maintained.   
2.39 The Area Action Plan recognised the potential to create a major new contemporary park adjacent to the 
seafront walkway to celebrate the eastern most point of Britain and to provide a new cultural/events 
space for Lowesto ft and connect to the existing  public areas around the Ravine to the historic High Street 
by way of the Scores. Policy WLP2.5 seeks to continue the approach of the Area Action Plan in revitalising 
this area and making it a destination par k and touri st destination.  
2.40 Since the preparation of the Area Action Plan, engagement has taken place with the local community to 
further help shape proposals for the area. In April 2017 it was announced that £1 million funding had been 
secured to help deliver the par k through the Coastal Communities Fund.  
Policy WLP2.5 – East of England Park  
Land comprising the East of England Park (7.87 hectares) is allocated as a destination park together with 
supporting uses, including : 
 A pavilion/ café/orientation facilities at Ness Point ;  
 Landmark structure/sculpture to celebrate the most easterly point ; and  
 Play facilities .  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 Protect and incorporate the historic net drying racks into improveme nts to the open 
space.  
 Provide landscaping and public art to soften the visual impact of the Birds Eye Factory.  
 New steps and ramps should be provided from the open space on to the promenade.  
 High quality lighting, sculptures and banners should animate the seafront . 
 Provide signage and wayfinding measures to integrate the park with the wider town.  
 Integrate landscaping with the North Denes Caravan Park.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part  of any planning application.  
 Proposals should be accompanied by a Heritage Impact Assessment which appraise s the 
impact on the conservation a rea including, the Scores and the High Street.

Residential development, marine -focused employment development and tourism   
2.41 The Western End of Lake Lothing refers to the area to the south west of Lake Lothing between Stanley 
Road and South Elmham Terrace. The area is currently characterised by small scale industrial uses and 
under-utilised land. There is limited public access to the area and the waterfront in this location.  
2.42 Much of the site is already developed, so most new development will involve redevelopment of existing 
buildings. Access to the site is currently a constrain t, and further intensification of development off South 
Elmham Terrace is unlikely to be suitable unless improvements to visibility splays are improved. There is an 
opportunity through redevelopment to provide better access from Crompton Road and Stanley R oad.  
2.43 The Lake Lothing and Outer Harbour Area Action Plan allocated this site for mixed use development 
including waterfront tourism, small scale residential development of 57 homes and employment 
development. Since the adoption of the Area Action Plan pla nning permission has been given for 44 homes 
off South Elmham Terrace. However, the development of these homes is conditional on improvements to 
South Elmham Terrace. Policy WLP2.6 continues to allocate this area of land for 57 homes, together with 
improve d waterfront employment premises and waterfront tourist uses.  
2.44 A Concept Statement for the site has been adopted as a Supplementary Planning Document. The 
document provides further detail to guide development of the site and planning applications should be in 
accordance with the guidance and the outline masterplan. The Concept Statement will be kept under 
review and may be amended in line with Policy WLP2.6 to take into account changing circumstances. This 
review could take place through a revised Supplement ary Planning Document or as part of a

allocated for mixed -use development including:  
 
 57 dwellings;  
 Marine -focused employment ; and  
 Tourism uses.  
New development and redevelopment within the site should be developed in accordance with the

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 61 Former Battery Green Car Park  
Retail and leisure development  
2.45 The Former  Battery Green Car Park occupies a prominent site facing on to the A12 at Battery Green Road. 
The former car park has recently closed due to serious structural deterioration and low demand from 
visitors  and is currently being demolished . 
2.46 The site, which si ts within the town centre, offers a prime site for redevelopme nt for town centre uses. 
The 0.87  hectare site could accommodate a number of the development needs identified in the Retail and 
Leisure Needs Assessment including new comparison and convenience retail, leisure uses such as a cinema 
and a town centre hotel. Development of this type on this site will have a significant positive impact on the 
vitality and viability of Lowestoft Town Centre. At this stage the exact mix and level of development has 
not been established. Policy WLP2.7 therefore allocates the site for a mix of potential town centre uses. 
There may also be potential for residential develop ment (falling within either use  classes C2 or C3) as part 
of a mixed use scheme. However, this use sh ould be ancillary and any planning application for the site 
which includes residential uses must be supported by information which demonstrates there will be no 
significant impacts on residential amenity from industrial and port related activities taking p lace on the 
adjacent PowerPark site.  
2.47 Given the prominent location of the site, redevelopment will need to be carefully planned and designed. It 
will be particularly important to establish visible links and connections to the main pedestrianised London 
Road North and the Marina street. This will ensure the wider town centre will benefit from the 
development from linked trips. An active frontage should be provided along Gordon Road to ensure the 
street provides a welcoming link between the town centre, the d evelopment and employment uses on the 
PowerPark. Large blank walls should be avoided adjacent to public thoroughfares to ensure the 
development is attractive from main public viewpoints.  
2.48 The site is opposite the G rade II listed St Margaret’s House. The red evelopment of this site provides an 
opportunity to enhance  the setting of this building.  
Policy WLP2.7 – Former Battery Green Car Park  
The Former Battery Green Car Park (0.87 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
comprehensive red evelopment of town centre uses including retail and leisure development falling within 
Use Classes A1, A2, A3, A4, C1 and D2.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 
 New development should be designed to the highest possible architectural standard 
and create a landmark building for the town.  
 Visual links and connections should be provided to London Road North and the Marina 
street.  
 Blank walls should be avoided adjacent to public viewpoints.  
 An active frontag e should be provided along Gordon Road.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.

62                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Former Lowestoft Hospital  
Residential development  
2.49 The area to the north west of the  town centre currently provides housing which has good links to the town 
centre and helps support the shops and services the town centre provides.  Within this area is the former 
Lowestoft Hospital which lies between Alexandr a Road, Milton Road East and Tennyson Road.  
2.50 The former hospital site is proposed for redevelopment for residential uses . The site is a brownfield site 
with excellent accessibility to the shops and services provided by the town centre.  The development of the  
site therefore has the potential to help support these shops and services as well as ensuring residents do 
not need to travel far to access day -to-day needs.  Given the history of the site, residential accommodation 
with an element of care such as sheltere d housing or extra -care housing (use class C2) will be strongly 
supported.  
2.51 It is considered that the site could accommodate approximately 45 homes. These could take the form of 
apartments or terraces in converted buildings and new build terraces and apart ments. Following detailed 
appraisal and design there is scope for flexibility in terms of exact  number of units.  
2.52 Some of the buildings on the site date back to the late Victorian period and early 20th Century and 
constitute a non -designated heritage asset . The most sensitive part of the site is the south elevation of the 
original hospital building (which fronts Milton Road East) constructed in 1882  which features an attractive 
colonnaded facade . The 1927 wing frontage on to Alexandr a Road which includes a war memorial i s also 
sensitive.  The other frontages onto Tennyson Road and the 1930s frontage onto Alexandr a Road to the 
north of the site are less sensitive but do provide an attractive frontage onto the street.   
2.53 Considering the above, any redevelopment s hould aim to retain and re -use the original 188 2 hospital 
building, the 1927 wing building on Alexandr a Road , and the other early 20th Century frontages on 
Alexandra Road and Tennyson Road  where it is viable and feasible to do so . Some degree of openness t o 
the south of the site should be retained so that the principal elevation of the original 1882 hospital 
building can be appreciated from Milton Road East.   
Policy WLP2.8 – Former Lowestoft Hospital  
The Former Lowestoft Hospital (0.72 hectares ) as defined  on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
comprehensive residential redevelopment of approximately 45 homes.  Residential accommodation with 
an element of care  will be strongly supported.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site spec ific criteria:  
 
 The 188 2 original hospital building,  the 1927 wing which fronts on to Alexandr a Road 
and the other early 20th Century frontage s on Alexandra Road and Tennyson Road 
should be retained and re -used as part of any scheme.  If it is not viable or feasible to do 
this, the facades of these buildings should be retained as part of the redevelopment.  
 Part of the site between Milton Road East and the 1882 original hospital building should 
be retained as public open space so that the south elevation of the hospital building can 
be appreciated from the highway.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 63 Historic High Street and Scores  
2.54 The historic High Street and Scores form some of the oldest parts of 
Lowestoft. The area is part of the North Lowestoft Conservation Area 
and exhibits numerous historic buildings, many of which are listed. 
However, the quality of the historic environment is under threat from 
insensitive development, poorly maintained buildings and a lack of 
investment.  
2.55 The area sits within one of the most de prived in Lowestoft and is within 
the 10% most deprived in the country. The area suffers from numerous 
social problems including anti -social behaviour, shorter life expectancy 
and low levels of employment and education.  
2.56 The area currently has a number of purposes. The southern end of the High Street around the Triangle 
Market is part of Lowestoft Town Centre and provides a secondary shopping area and a leisure focus with 
a number of cafés, restaurants and pubs. The area of the High Street to the north of R ant Score has more 
of a local shopping centre character, providing day -to-day provision to the surrounding residential 
properties. However, there are a number of unique shops and a couple of pubs and a restaurant which 
serve a wider population and visitors  to the area.  
2.57 The Scores have a more mixed residential and employment purpose.   
2.58 As detailed above , the objectives for this area are for heritage led -regeneration which enhances the 
heritage experience of this area and support s the existing shops, cafés and restaurants. The Council aims 
for the area to have a strong heritage narrative with improved connectivity between the town centre, the 
High Street and the East of England Parks including Ness Point.  
2.59 The area falls within the recently designated North Lo westoft Heritage Action Zone. The key aims of the 
five year scheme are to restore the old High Street's historic character for the people who live there and to 
boost tourism. Work will include providing quality spaces for the community, re -connecting the o ld town 
to modern Lowestoft, and bringing under -used and vacant land and property back into use for housing and 
retail.  
2.60 The southern end of the High Street around the Triangle Market is identified as part of the town centre 
under Policy WLP8.18. To this e nd proposals in this part of the High Street should be in conformity with 
Policy WLP8.19 relating to the vitality and viability of town centres. The Retail and Leisure Study (2016) 
identifies the potential to expand and enhance the Triangle Market to suppo rt this part of the town centre.  
2.61 Retail and service provision in the northern part of the High Street outside of the Town Centre area 
defined by Policy WLP8.18 should receive some protection in order for it to continue to fulfil a role of a 
local shopping  centre. However, due to the higher number of vacancies in this part of the High Street a 
more flexible approach is needed which will allow for conversion to open market residential properties to 
avoid vacant shop frontages further deteriorating.

appearance of the area, the Council will proactively support new open market residential development 
within the Historic High Street and Scores area.  
2.63 Proposals for development within the area should be in accordance with Policy WLP8.3 9 on Conservation 
Areas and have regard to the North Lowestoft Conservation Area Appraisal. Historic shop fronts are a ke y 
part of the character of the conservation a rea and these should be retained and enhanced as part of 
development. Guidance on shop front design is found in the Built Heritage and Design Supplementary 
Planning Document. Proposals for development affecting designated heritage assets such as the numerous 
listed buildings in the area  will be determined in accordance with policy set out in the National Planning 
Policy Framework.  
 
Policy WLP2. 9 – Historic High Street and Scores Area  
The Historic High Street and Scores Area is defined on the Policies Map.  
The His toric High Street and Scores should be conserved and enhanced through heritage -based 
regeneration to complement the town centre, provide local shopping services and facilities and support 
local tourism and links between the town centre and the East of Engl and Park.  
Proposals to enhance and expand the Triangle Market will be supported.  
New development should enhance connections and legibility between the High Street and the East of 
England Park and provide environmental improvements.  
Changes to shop front s should respect the historic character of the area and have regard to the guidance 
within the Built Heritage and Design Supplementary Planning Document.  
New open market housing of exceptional design will be supported in the historic High Street and Score s 
area  where it does not  individually or cumulatively, have a  significant adverse impact on the historic 
character, appearance, retail function, viability and vitality of the area . Conversion of ground floor 
premises  in A class uses to open market housing will only be permitted where the original shop front is 
retained and enhanced .  
Within the High Street frontage outside of the area which falls within Lowestoft Town Centre as defined by 
Policy WLP8.18,  proposals for change of use of ground floor A1 retail  premises to uses A2, A3, A4 and A5 
will only be permitted when there would be, either individually or cumulatively, no significant adverse 
impact on the character, appearance, retail function, viability and vitality of the centre . Within this area  
proposa ls for change of use of ground floor premises from A use classes to non A class uses other than 
open market housing as indicated above will not be permitted.  
A design guide will be prepared to ensure new development within the area is of exceptional urban design 
and enhances the historic environment of the area.

2.64 The Port of Lowestoft, currently owned by 
Associated British Ports, is an important 
regional and local asset. The Port services 
traffic to and from Northern Europe, 
Scandinavia and the Baltic States. The Port has 
experienced a significant increase in traff ic in 
recent years and offers a wide range of facilities 
for container, bulk and general cargo handling. 
Increasingly it is also servicing the emerging 
offshore renewables sector as well as the 
established oil and gas sector.  
2.65 The Inner Harbour Port Area a s defined on the Policies Map covers the part of the Port of Lowestoft on the 
banks of Lake Lothing. It also contains South Quay which is just to the west of the Bascule Bridge on Lake 
Lothing. South Quay is a heavy lifting quay in separate private ownersh ip and is valuable in supporting 
offshore renewables, engineering, oil and gas sectors and Sizewell.  
2.66 Policy WLP2. 10 protects and supports the enhancement of these areas for uses associated with the Port. 
The Inner Harbour Port Area is located in close pro ximity to other uses such as residential, retail and 
leisure uses. It is therefore important to minimise the conflict between these uses.   
 
Policy WLP2. 10 – Inner Harbour Port Area  
The Inner Harbour Port Area is defined on the Policies Map.  
Within the Inne r Harbour Port Area land and buildings will be retained in port and other associated uses. 
Proposals involving the redevelopment or change of use of existing premises, to uses not related to the 
port will not be permitted.  
New development  within the Inner Harbour Port A rea should ensure that technology, equipment, and 
business practices are utilised in order to minimise noise and other amenity issues.  
New development on South Quay should include landscaping and public realm treatments which improve 
the app earance of this key gateway to the town centre.  
New development next to or opposite the Inner Harbour Port Area should ensure potential conflicts are 
mitigated through the layout, use and environmental credentials of new buildings. Developers should liais e 
with port operators to ensure that potential conflicting uses are addressed prior to any application for 
planning permission.

2.67 Oulton Broad District Shopping Centre is located around Bridge Road in Oulton Broad. The  area is shared 
between the Broads Authority and Waveney District Council’s Local Planning Authority areas. There are 
around 50 retail units currently in operation (2016 monitoring data).  
2.68 The Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (2016) and annual monitoring suggests Oulton Broad should 
continue to be identified as a 'District Centre' where shops and services will be protected and prevented 
from changing to other uses. Planning Policy Statement 4 (PPS4) 'Planning for Sustainable Economic 
Growth' (no w deleted), defines District Centres as a ‘group of shops, separate from the town centre, 
usually containing at least one supermarket or superstore, and a range of non -retail services, such as 
banks, building societies and restaurants, as well as local pub lic facilities such as a library'. There is 
currently no definition for District Centres in the National Planning Policy Guidance or the Framework.  
2.69 The Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment says that the area has a relatively good mix of independent 
stores f or its size but an under provision of banks and building societies. It was principally identified as a 
‘top-up’ food shopping destination in the household survey. The assessment suggests that there is 
potential to increase the convenience food offer as wel l as increase the number of cafés and restaurants 
to cater for the needs of the local population and the wider tourist market. The assessment also identifies 
the potential to increase the linkages between the centre and the Broads.  
2.70 The increase in the num ber of takeaways has been a cause for concern in Oulton Broad, with late opening 
times often being associated with anti -social behaviour that harms the amenity of local residents and the 
environmental quality of the area. Concern has been raised that a con tinuation of this trend could reduce 
the centre's retail provision making it less attractive for local residents and thereby potentially affecting 
the viability of the remaining shops.  
2.71 Policy WLP2.1 1 is included within both the Waveney District Council Lo cal Plan and the Broads Local Plan 
to reflect the centre’s location across both planning authority areas. The policy intends to protect the 
existing shopping and service offer in the Centre and promote new restaurants and cafés where they 
would not undermi ne the viability of the Centre. The policy resists  changes of use to A4 (drinking 
establishments) and A5 (hot food takeaways) in order to address amenity concerns.  
2.72 It is acknowledged that some changes of use can take place without planning permission under  the 
Permitted Development Order 2015 which allows some flexibility of uses within the area (dependent on 
size, final proposed land use and wh ether the site is located in a conservation a rea or not). The inability of 
the Council to control such proposals h ighlights the need to give particular scrutiny to proposals that 
continue to require the submission of a planning application.

2.73 Kirkley District Shopping Centre , known locally as Kirkley Village Centre, is located along London Road 
South between Parade Road South and Lorne Park Road. There are currently nearly 80 units within the 
area in retail or leisure uses. The centre currently has a good range of independent stores and cafés. The 
smaller convenience stores in the cen tre predominantly cater for day -to-day and top -up shopping.  
2.74 The Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (2016) and annual monitoring suggests Kirkley should continue 
to be identified as a 'District Centre' where shops and services will be prot ected and prevented from 
changing to other uses. The assessment suggests that there is potential to increase the convenience food 
offer as well as increase the number of cafés and restaurants to cater for the need s of the local population 
and the wider tou rist market.  
2.75 A key objective for this area is to increase the use of the centre by tourists visiting the nearby seafront. A 
greater range of restaurants and cafés and signage from the seafront will help support this.  
2.76 Policy WLP2.1 2 intends to protect the  existing shopping and service offer in Kirkley and promote new 
restaurants and cafés where they would not undermine the viability of the centre.  
2.77 It is acknowledged that some changes of use can take place without planning permission under the

Residential development, employment development, primary school and local 
shops  
2.78 This bro ad area of land comprising approximately 71  hectares sits to the east  of the A47 (formerly A12) to 
the north of Lowestoft within the parish of Corton. The development of this area is a longer term ambition 
of the Local Plan and development is not expected to start until after  2026. The site is allocated for 
approximately 1,300  new homes and 8 hectares of employment land together with community facilities, 
including a 2 form entry pr imary school, open space and a local shopping centre. During the life of this 
Local Plan (2014 -2036) it is expected that approximately 740 homes will be delivered with the remainder 
being constructed between 2036 and 2044.  
2.79 Out of all the areas north of  Lowestoft with the potential for future  major  development, this area of land 
will likely have the most limited impact on the landscape. The site is  mostly  flat with the A47  to the west 
and the water treatment works  to the north which undermine s the existing quality of landscape in this 
location. The site has access to the strategic road network which provides regular bus services between 
Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth. The development is of a scale that can provide  most services to cater for 
day-to-day needs. I t is also of a scale which can deliver a significant amount of land for new businesses 
which can provide employment for future residents on the site and further afield in Lowestoft and Great 
Yarmouth.  
2.80 It will be possible to access initial phases of develo pment from Corton Long Lane. However, longer term 
there will be a need for a new  or improved  access from the A47 trunk  road . The addition of an extra 
junction on to the A47 may cause increased safety issues along the trunk road. Therefore, mitigation 
would  be required to increase safety elsewhere along the stretch of road.  
2.81 Community facilities including the primary school and local shopping centre should be provided within a 
central location on the site.  
2.82 Waveney has an ageing population and t he Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) identified a 
significant need for new  sheltered and extra care housing  and new care homes . This large site, which will 
likely be delivered by a number of developers provides an opportunity to deliver a retireme nt community 
comprising a care home and /or a proportion of extra care/ sheltered dwellings . These will form part of the 
total housing allocated on the site.  The development should be designed utilising dementia friendly desig n 
principles (see Policy WLP8.31  on Lifetime  Design).   
2.83 Delivery of new employment development can often be challenging due to the financial viability of 
development. Housing development on the site should help facilitate  the delivery of employment 
development .  Strategy for the Lowestoft Area | Wave ney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
72                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  2.84 The site should be designe d using garden city principles5 with significant amounts of landscaping, tree 
planting and green infrastructure . The development of the area should exhibit exceptional urban design. It 
should score particularly well against Building for Life criteria (see Policy WLP8.29). Developers are 
encouraged to seek Built for Life Quality Mark for housing development on the site.  
2.85 A detailed masterplan will need to be prepared to guide the development of this site. The masterplan will 
need to set out how the scheme wi ll meet garden city principles and exhibit excellent urban design. The 
masterplan will need to set out detailed proposals for access, phasing , the distribution of land -uses across 
the site  and the approach to infrastructure delivery . This should be prepare d either as part of a 
Neighbourhood Plan or as a Supplementary Planning Document. No development will be permitted on the 
site until the masterplan has been prepared.  
2.86 The site has a high potential for archaeology and any planning application s must be supp orted by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  The site may be the home of the former medieval village of Thorpe. It is suggested that this may 
have been located to the north of Doles Wood to the south of the site. As such some archaeological work 
should be undertaken to inform the masterplan. This could involve,  field  walking and metal det ecting, 
geophysical survey and possibly trenching . 
2.87 The site should help facilitate an off -road pedestrian and cycle link between the built up area of Lowestoft 
and Hopton to the north. There is extensive movement  of commuters  between Great Yarmouth and 
Lowestoft and the provision of a continuous off -road cycle link will help encourage modal shift.

 2 form entry primary school  including a pre -school ;  
 A local shopping centre comprising a convenience store, cafés, a pre-school  setting , 
community centre  and other local services ;  
 Playing field , play areas  and green infrastructure ; and  
 8 hectares of employment development (falling under use classes B1, B2 and B8)  
A masterplan should be prepared and adopted as either a Supplementary Planning Document or as part of 
a Neighbourhood Plan. No development will be permitted on this site until the masterplan has been 
prepared.   
The masterplan should:  
 Set out detailed arrange ments for access on to the site.  
 Set out the distribution of land -uses across the site. The primary school, local shopping 
centre  and retirement community  should be located centrally on the site.  
 Ensure there is no adverse effect on the o peration of the water treatment works.  
 Set out the approach to phasing of development across the site.  
 Set out detailed urban design guidance and demonstrate how the principles of garden 
city developments can be met on the site.  
 Include an assessment of  ecology and identify key ecological networks and habitats to 
be preserved and enhanced through the development.  
 Be informed by evidence of archaeology .  
 Set out the approach to infrastructure delivery on the site.  
Housing development on the site should h elp facilitate  the delivery of the employment land.  
On-site infrastructure, including the primary school and open space will be secured and funded through 
Section 106 planning obligations. More details are in Appendix 1.

Residential development  
2.88 The site (5.70  hectares) consists of undeveloped land on Parkhill and part of the site of the former 
Lothingland Hospital to the rear. The part of the site of the former Lothingland Hospital is being used 
informally for stora ge of building materials and equipment at present.   
2.89 The site has good access to existing services and facilities in Oulton and in the future will have good access 
to the primary school, community centre, medical centre and retail facilities which are to be  provided on 
the Woods Meadow development. The site is also in close proximity to the Mobbs Way Employment Area. 
There are bus stops nearby which provide access to the town centre. Development of the site is expected 
to have a limited impact on the landsca pe and the site is not used for agriculture.  
2.90 Vehicular access is possible from Parkhill. Union Lane is a narrow road of a rural character and is not 
appropriate to provide vehicular access to this site. Pedestrian and cycle access should be provided to 
Union Lane. The pavement on Parkhill stops short of the potential access point to the site by some 200 
metres. The pavement should be extended to the access point of the site.  
2.91 The site should be developed at an average density of 30 dwellings per hectare. The area around Union 
Lane has a more rural character therefore development on the northern and western parts of the site 
should be of a lower density  with greater spacing between detached buildings and more generous back 
gardens.  
2.92 The site is not within the catchment of any equipped children’s play space. Therefore, the development 
should include the provision of a local equipped area for play, approximately 0.4 hectares in size.  
2.93 Due to the overgrown nature of parts of the site, an  ecological assessment will be required to support any 
planning application on the site.  Suffolk Wildlife Trust have completed an initial survey on the site and 
found some parts of the site provide suitable habitats for a number of species. The survey reco mmended 
further assessments including breeding birds, barn owls, reptiles and bats.  
2.94 Given the recent uses on the former Lothingland Hospital site, there is a risk of ground contamination. 
Therefore, a full site investigation report should be submitted wit h any planning application which includes 
reports on intrusive surveys, a risk assessment and remediation method statement.  
2.95 The north western part of the site is a historic burial ground  associated with the former Oulton 
Workhouse . Development will need to  avoid this part of the site and should enhance the site of the burial 
ground. This could include providing a commemoration on the site and interpretation boards detailing the 
history of the burial ground and the Oulton Workhouse.

2.96 This site ( 6.37 hectares) sits  between Hall Lane and Union Lane in the parish of Oulton on the outskirts of 
the built up  area of Lowest oft. The southern part of the site fronting on to Hall Lane is currently used as a 
small paddock. The northern part of the site is currently arable fields.  
2.97 The site has good access to existing services and facilities in Oulton and in the future will have good access 
to the primary school, community centre, medical centre and retail facilities which are to be provided on 
the Woods Meadow development. The site is also in close proximity to the Mobbs Way Employment Area. 
There are bus stops nearby which provi de access to the town centre. Development of the site is expected 
to have a limited impact on the landscape and is on Grade 3 agricultural land.  
2.98 Vehicular access is possible from Hall Lane. Union Lane is a narrow road of a rural character and is not 
appro priate to provide vehicular access to this site. Pedestrian and cycle access should be provided to 
Union Lane and Hall Lane.   
2.99 Development of the site has the potential to impact upon the setting of the Grade II* listed Manor House 
to the east of the site. To mitigate this , existing field boundaries should be retained an d enhanced to the 
south of the site.  
2.100  The site has a high potential for archaeology and any planning application must be supported by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  
2.101  There are a number of trees on the site and hedgerow s between the fields which make up the site and 
along  the Hall Lane and Union Lane frontages. Trees and hedgerows on the site should be retained and 
incorporated into the layout of the development except where they need to be removed to allow for 
access.  
2.102  Hall Lane and Union Lane currently provide an attract ive transition from the suburban character of Oulton 
to the more rural character to the west heading towards Camps Heath. Development on this site should 
maintain this transition.  
2.103  The site is not within the catchment of any open space provision for toddle rs. As such a Local Area for Play 
should be provided on the site. This open space should be 0.04 hectares in size.

Mixed use including residential development, primary s chool, country park, 
allotments and  local shops  
2.104  The site (54.88  hectares) comprises a number of arable fields south of The Street in Carlton Colville  and 
Gisleham .  
2.105  The site is a logical extension to the existing built up area. The  overall  sensitivity of the landscape is low 
and development could improve the existing exposed edge of the settlement around the Ullswater 
development. The site has good access to employment opportunities in South Lowestoft Industrial Estate 
and the nearby retail facilities.  
2.106  A development of 900 homes on this site provides the opportunity t o deliver a new primary school in a 
more central location serving pupils in the s outh Lowestoft and Carlton Colville area. This will help reduce 
the need to travel to the existing Carlton Colville Primary School in the future. Additionally, the site 
provid es an opportunity to deliver parking and drop -off space for parents at the existing Carlton Colville 
Primary School to relieve pressure on the existing streets around the school. Parking could be shared with 
the proposed country park.  The site also provide s an opportunity to provide safe pedestrian and cycle 
access to the existing school.   
2.107  Waveney has an ageing population and t he Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) identified a 
significant need for new  sheltered and extra care housing  and new care homes . This large site, which will 
likely be delivered by a number of developers provides an opportunity to deliver a retirement community 
comprising a care home and/or a proportion of extra care/sheltered dwellings . These will form part of t he 
total housing allocated on the site.  The development should be designed utilising dementia friendly design 
principles (see Policy WLP8.31 on Lifetime Design).  
 
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for the Lowestoft Area  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 79 2.108  The Environment Agency has indicated that the development of land in this location could pr ovide an 
opportunity to deliver flood risk mitigation measures for the Kirkley Stream. Land on the northern part of 
the site is within flood zone 3 associated with the Kirkley Stream . Therefore the n orthern part of the site is 
required to incorporate flood  mitigation as set out in the Lowestoft Flood Risk Management Project. This 
section of the site should incorporate the needs of flood mitigation, form part of the surface water 
drainage strategy for the site and should also include the provision of local e quipped area for play and 
allotments . The flood risk mitigation will have the benefit of reducing  flood risk to a number of existing 
properties along The Street.  
2.109  A country park should also be provided on the western part  of the site. A Scheduled Monument  exists on 
the north western corner of the site. A Heritage Impact Assessment has been prepared which indicates 
that the open countryside in this location is important to the setting of this heritage asset. The open 
countryside in this area is also important  to the setting of the Grade I listed Churc h of Holy Trinity, 
Gisleham. A country p ark in this location therefore helps retain the setting of these two assets and 
significantly reduces the level of harm potentially caused by the development on the se tting of the assets. 
A country p ark will also help reduce pressure from dog walking and recreation on nearby protected 
habitats such as Kessingland beach. The c ountry p ark should include a fenced neighbourhood equipped 
area for play, together with a landscaped a rea for dog walking and other recreation.  It should retain an 
open character which is important to the setting of the Scheduled Monument  and retain views from the 
monument to the Grade I listed church in Gisleham.  
2.110  The southern boundary of the site is very  exposed to landscape and it will be important not to create a 
hard exposed edge, as the current Ullswater development does. Therefore land should be set aside on the 
southern boundary to allow for hedgerow and tree planting to soften the edge of the devel opment.  
2.111  The development of the area should exhibit exceptional urban design. It should score particularly well 
against Building for Life criteria (see Policy WLP8.29). Developers are encouraged to seek Built for Life 
Quality Mark for housing development o n the site. A slightly higher density of 35 dwellings per hectare  is 
proposed on this site to ensure the viability of infrastructure and affordable housing provision.  This also 
allows for the more effective use of high grade agricultural land.  This is a si milar net density to the modern 
residential areas  to the north of the site.  The north part of the site around the primary school could have a 
more urban character with higher densities comprising terraced town houses and low -level apartments.  
The southern and western parts of the site should exhibit a more rural char acter with lower densities and a 
greater proportion of 1 and 1.5 storey buildings.   
2.112  Vehicular access to the site should be provided from The Street. Concerns have been raised about existing 
park ing on The Street and potential conflict with the increased traffic associated with the development. 
Therefore the Transport Assessment should investigate this further and consider measures to re duce  the 
level of parking on The Street. This could include providing a parking court on the site for properties on 
The Street which do not have off -road parking available.  
2.113  Two rights of way run through the site, one from Low Farm Drive and one from The Street. The layout of 
the site should be designed so that these public rights of way can be accommodated in the development 
and link to the rights of way to the south of the site. Pedestrian access to the site and the proposed new 
primary school should also be made available from Ullswa ter and Shaw Avenue.  Strategy for the Lowestoft Area | Wave ney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
80                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  2.114  The site has a very high potential for archaeology and any planning application must be supported by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of devel opment on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  
2.115  Appro ximately 26 hectares  of the site  is within a Minerals Consultation Area  as defined by the Suffolk 
Minerals Core Strategy (2008). A ccording to  the British Geological Survey data  there is potential for this to 
be an exploitable resource. As such  material will need to be tested for quality and some prior extraction or 
use of the material on site may be necessary, depending on the economic value of the material  in line with 
the Mine rals Core Strategy requirements.  
2.116  The site is currently home to a successful livery/horse riding business. The development should facilitate 
the relocation of this business to elsewhere on the landowners holding.  
2.117  An illustrative  masterplan has been prepare d as shown in Figure 1 1 to show how the requirements of the 
site allocation policy can be met. Development  proposals should have regard to this masterplan. However, 
it may be necessary to depart from  the illustrative  masterplan depend ent on the results of the 
archaeological survey if any remains need to be preserved in situ.  A more detailed masterplan will be 
required to be submitted with any outline planning application for the site. The detailed masterplan should 
be informed by consultation with the commu nity.

 Country p ark (at least 15 hectares) ;  
 Allotments, flood mitigation and play space; and  
 Local shops comprising a convenience store .  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be  developed at a density of approximately 35  dwellings per hectare. 
Housing density should be higher to the north of the site close to the primary school 
and lower towards the west and south of the site.  
 Vehicular access should be off The Street. Pedestria n and cycle accesses should be 
provided from Ullswater, Shaw Avenue, Low Farm Drive and Gisleham Road.  
 The northern part of the site should not be developed and instead used for flood

drainage and open space including the provision of a local equipped area for play and 
allotments.  
 The primary school should be provided to the north of the site in an accessible location 
to the existing community of Carlton Colville as well as  the new community.  
 The Country p ark should  be located to the west of the site and provide protection to the 
setting of the Scheduled Monument and Grade I listed Holy Trinity Church. It should 
include a fenced neighbourhood equipped area for play and a open landscaped area for 
dog walking and other recreation.  
 Land should be set aside on the southern boundary to allow for hedgerow and tree 
planting to soften the edge of the development.  
 Existing public rights of way should be accommodated within the development and link 
to public rights of way to the south of the site.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 83 Land at South Lowestoft Industrial Estate  
Employment development  
2.118  The site ( 20 hectares) sits between H adenham Road and 
Church Road to the south of South Lowestoft Industrial 
Estate. The site is currently used for agriculture.  
2.119  The site forms part of the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft 
Enterprise Zone and was originally allocated in the Site 
Specific Allocation Development Plan Document in 2011. 
Prior to that part of the site had planning permission for 
industrial uses which expired .  
2.120  Suffolk County Council are currently developing p art of 
the site off Hadenham Road for a  number of small start -
up units.   
2.121  The site is flat with screening to the west. It is unlikely that development on the site would impact on the 
landscape given the already detracting features of the existing industrial estate and existing buildings 
already present on the Church Road frontag e. The site has good access on to Hadenham Road and is close 
to the strategic road network. Future employees will have good access to existing and future retail and 
leisure facilities located close to the site.  
2.122  The Employment Land Needs Assessment (2016) identified that demand for  employment land was higher 
in north Lowestoft. However, there i s still likely to be demand in s outh Lowestoft, particularly given its 
good links to Sizewell to the south and the existing cluster of businesses present in the area.  The existing 
industrial estate has low levels of vacancies and a good proportion of units remain in employment use (B1, 
B2, and B8 uses). However, this site allocation is very large and considering the overall need for 
employment land it is unlikely that all of this site will be developed within the plan period to 2036. 
However, given the nature of the site and to give flexibility to what parts of the site could come forward, it 
is considered appropriate to continue to allocate the entire Enterprise Zone a rea. Furthermore, the land 
has limited potential for any other uses except for its existing agricultural use.  
2.123  Church Road is considered unsuitable to be used for vehicular access. Therefore, access to the site should 
come from Hadenham Road only. However,  pedestrian and cycle access should be provided on to Church 
Road.  
2.124  The site has a high potential for archaeology and any planning application must be supported by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, an d should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.

2.125  The site (2. 80 hectares) is situated at the end of Mobbs Way which is an Existing Employment Area. To the 
west of the site is the Woods Meadow housing development which is currently under construction.  
2.126  The site forms part of the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone and parts of the site benefit 
from partially implemented historic planning permissions. A small part of the site has already been  
developed.   
2.127  The site is relatively flat and is well screened from the residential development to the north, south and the  
development under construction to the west. The site is easily accessible from surrounding residential 
areas and benefits from the existing employment development to the east.  
2.128  There is potential for archaeology to be found on the site and any planning ap plication will be subject to a 
condition requiring a programme of archaeological work.   
2.129  Although the site is already screened, further landscaping should be provided along the western and 
northern boundaries to minimise any noise and disturbance to nearby residential properties.

Sports and  leisure  
2.130  Oakes Farm (30. 23 hectares) is a large area of arable 
farmland stretching from the western boundary of Carlton 
Colville along the southern edge of the A146.  
2.131  The site was originally allocated for sports and leisure 
development in the Site Specifi c Allocations Development 
Plan Document  (2011) . The site provides an excellent 
opportunity to provide a comprehensive sports 
development to meet needs of the existing population and 
the growing population as identified in the Playing Pitch 
Assessment (2014 ).  
2.132  Progress has been made on bringing the site forward and a masterplan is being prepared. The 
development is expected to provide the following facilities  together with other commercial sports and 
leisure activities :  
Phase 1   Phase 2   Phase 3  
 Full sized 3G football pitch  
 A compact athletics facility  
 Four floodlit tennis

 4 mini soccer pitches  
 Tarmac perimeter track  
 Car park extension for 20 
vehicles  
2.133  The sports element of the site will be accommodated on approximately 20.75 hectares on the southern 
part of the site. An area of land needs to be reserved for any future road scheme to bypass the Barnby 
bends.  
2.134  To enable the delivery of the sports faciliti es referred to above, approximately 6.23 hectares of the site is 
made available for enabling development. This development will release approximately  20.75 hectares for 
the sports development and provide a financial contribution towards the delivery of the  sports facilities. 
Enabling development should relate well to the sports development to the south and could comprise 
leisure and commercial uses, tourist uses or a limited amount of residential development necessary to 
deliver the sports development. Deve lopment on this part of the site will not be commenced until the land 
for sports and leisure use has been made available for use.

Policy WLP2.1 9 – Oakes Farm, Beccles Road, Carlton Colville  
Land at Oakes Farm, Beccles Road, Carlton Colville (30. 23 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is 
allocated for sports and leisure uses.  
The site should deliver at least 20.75 hectares of s ports pitches , non -pitch sports and other sports and 
leisure facilities to relevant standards together  with changing facilities and car parking.  
Approximately 6.23 hectares of the site fronting on to Beccles Road is to be developed for complementary 
comme rcial development to enable the delivery of the sports development. As part of any mixed -use 
scheme a limited amount of residential development may also be permitted on this land in order to deliver 
the sports development.  Development on this part of the s ite should not be commenced  until the 20.75 
hectares of  land has been made available for sports and leisure use.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 Existing rights of way should be retained.  
 A cycle route  should be provided from Wood Lane to Chapel Road.  
 The route of any future A146 Barnby Bypass should be protected.  
 The County Wildlife Site, hedgerows, ditches and trees should be conserved and

Housing and Open Space  
2.137  Gunton Park  (3.85 hectares)  is the current home of the Lowestoft and Yarmouth Rugby Club. There is a car 
park and single -storey clubhouse to the east of the site, while the rest of the area consists of flat, grassed 
playing pitches.  
2.138  The site was originally allocated for housing and open space  in the Site Specific Alloca tions Development 
Plan Document (2011) to help facilitate the relocation of the Lowestoft and Yarmouth R ugby Club to a 
location where they can improve and expand their facilities. An outline planning application has been 
submitted, but progress on this application has stalled due to difficulties in securing an alternative site. The 
Local Plan therefore reallo cates the site for the same purpose.  
2.139  This site is only being reallocated  for housing on the strict condition that an open space, of a greater size 
and quality is provided in the form of playing pitches for Rugby in another, at least equally accessible, and 
suitable location  for the club . In terms of assessing the quality of replacement provision, regard will be had 
to the number of pitches provided and the range of facilities provided. Profits from the sale of the land for 
housing should contribute towards  funding this improved facility, but housing development should not 
take place on the site until an alternative location for playing pitches has been agreed and delivered.  
2.140  Some open space has already been lost to development in this area, as the former ten nis courts to the 
northeast of the site have recently been developed for housing. In addition, the open nature of this site 
contributes to the semi -rural low density character of the area  and the gap between the built up area of 
Lowestoft and the built up area of Corton . Open space also benefits existing resident s on Corton Long Lane 
and Old Lane. This points to a need to protect some open space in this location, and it is therefore not 
considered appropriate to develop the entire site for housing. An area of publicly accessible open space 
should be retained on the site.  
2.141  The surrounding character of development on the edge of Corton and Lowestoft has a distinctly low 
density. Therefore a slightly reduced density of 25 dwellings per hectare is considered app ropriate in this 
location.  
2.142  The site is located close to the edge of the Lowestoft , and has good access to services and facilities. The 
Tesco supermarket is within walking distance, and the site is well linked to pedestrian and cycle routes and 
the public transport network. The footpath that runs along the southern boundary of the site should be  
maintained to at least its existing width. Vehicular access should preferably be off Old Lane, and 
improvements to the current access would be required.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for the Lowestoft Area

Worlingh am 
3.1 The strategy for Beccles and Worlingham is to continue to 
fulfil their  role as the second largest built up  area in the 
District.  In doing this the Council will seek to retain the 
individual identities of the two settlements. The growth 
proposed in this Local Plan over the next 20 years is similar to 
that experienced by Beccl es and Worlingham over the last 20 
years. However, this Local Plan seeks to plan for the 
development in a more strategic way to ensure a greater 
range of infrastructure and services are provided to support the growth.  
3.2 In total land has been alloca ted in t his Local Plan for 1,530  new homes in Beccles and Worlingham of which 
1,335  are expected to be completed over the plan period to 2036. Beccles and Worlingham (and Ellough) 
are expected to take the second largest share of new jobs created over the next 20 y ears. The Local Plan 
allocates nearly 20 hectares of new employment land in the area. Although not all of this land is expected 
to be developed in the plan period, new employment land development will help make Beccles and 
Worlingham more self -sufficient.  
3.3 The Southern Relief Road opens up new opportunities for growth in the town. Not only does it mitigate the 
traffic impacts of new employment development at Ellough, including the Enterprise Zone, it will also 
support new residential development to the sout h of the town.  
3.4 The strategy for Beccles and Worlingham takes advantage of the benefits the Southern Relief Road brings 
by allocating a strategic developm ent between the existing built up  area and the road. This development 
provides a logical extension to t he town that can be well planned with significant amounts of green space 
and supporting infrastructure and should be developed using garden city principles (see section on North 
Lowestoft Garden Village, Policy WLP2.1 3). The landscape to the south of the t own is of low landscape 
quality and lower agricultural land grade making it a sensible location in the town to focus growth. The 
existing southern part of the built up area of Beccles and Worlingham suffers from a lack of services and 
facilities. The infra structure provided on the new development will provide significant benefits for those 
already living in south Beccles and Worlingham.  
3.5 For employment growth, this Local Plan maintains the focus on the Ellough industrial area and the 
Enterprise Zone. It also promotes an additional area of employment land which could be delivered in the 
shorter term as part of housing development on land al located by Policy WLP3.1.

Mixed use including residential developme nt, primary school, country park, 
indoor/outdoor sports facilities , allotments, local shops, community centre and 
employment development  
3.8 This site (8 9.80  hectares) is bordered by Ellough Road to the east, 
the Beccles Southern Relief Road to the south, M&H Plastics to 
the west and the built up edge of Beccles and Worlingham to the 
north. Industrial sites are nearby to the east and southeast. 
There is a former scrapyard near the centre of the site and 
woodland on part of the western edge but the majority o f the 
site is in agricultural use. The land is Grade 3 or urban 
classification agricultural land.   
3.9 The large open field making up the eastern part of the site has 
undergone significant changes over time and lacks any landscape 
features. The industrial buil dings to the east and southeast and 
the housing to the north break up long views of the site resulting 
in a low quality landscape. There is potential through the layout 
of development to create long views across to Beccles Church 
from the high point on thi s site. The fields to the west of Oak Lane retain some landscape features such as 
field boundaries, hedgerows and woodland. The neighbouring M&H Plastics industrial buildings detract 
from the quality of the landscape in this area. The construction of the B eccles Southern Relief Road will 
alter the character of the landscape, introducing a harder edge and enclosing the edge of the garden 
neighbourhood .  
3.10 The site presents an opportunity to develop a comprehensive mixed use development including housing, 
employment land and community facilities such as a primary school, shops, allotments and indoor/outdoor 
sports facilities . Comprehensive planning of the si te will promote contact with nature, healthy lifestyles 
and wellbeing for all through the  delivery of substantial green infrastructure including public open space, a 
country park and integrated landscaping schemes. The site is allocated for 1,250 homes. It  is expected that 
1,055  homes will be delivered during this plan period.   
3.11 Waveney has an ageing population and t he Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) identified a 
significant need for new  sheltered and extra care housing  and new care homes . This la rge site, which will 
likely be delivered by a number of developers provides an opportunity to deliver a retirement community 
comprising a care home and/or a proportion of extra care/sheltered dwellings . These will form part of the 
total housing allocated o n the site.  The development should be designed utilising dementia friendly design 
principles (see Policy WLP8.31 on Lifetime Design).  
3.12 Built development on the site should make efficient use of land in order to maximise the land available for 
open space, c ommunity facilities, allotments, playing fields etc. This will contribute to the character of the 
garden neighbourhood . Housing should therefore be developed at a density of 30 dwellings per hectare.  
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Beccles and Worlingham  
www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 95 3.13 The development should utilise garden ci ty principles5. The development of the area should exhibit 
exceptional urban design. It should score particularly well against Building for Life criteria (see Pol icy 
WLP8.29). Developers are encouraged to seek Built for Life Quality Mark for housing development on the 
site.  
3.14 A development of this scale provides the opportunity to deliver a new primary school to serve the new 
development and existing homes in the ar ea. Community facilities should be provided alongside the 
primary school including indoor/outdoor sports facilities , a community centre and retail provision to create 
a community hub. These uses should be co -located in a central position where they are accessible for new 
and existing residents by sustainable modes of transport.   
3.15 Open space, including a country park, should be provided on site. This should include equipped play areas, 
allotments and amenity green space. Green buffers should be provided ar ound the proposed employment 
land in the southeast corner and along the western edge of the site near to M&H  Plastics. A landscaped 
strip should be provided along the entire southern edge of the site in order to soften the appearance of 
the development in the landscape and also to provide a screen between the development and the 
Southern Relief Road. The layout of green infrastructure on the site should reference existing and historic 
field boundaries and help create distinct character areas within the deve lopment. The site travers es both 
Beccles and Worlingham p arishes. The layout of open space on the site should be used to help protect the 
separate identities of the existing built up  areas. This should involve the provision of an extensive multi -
functional  country park . The provision of a extensive country park will help mitigate recreational impact on 
nearby protected habitats.   
3.16 A permeable and legible network of roads and pedestrian and cycle paths should be created throughout 
the site  providing pedestria n and cycle links through to the existing built up  area . Roads and access points 
should be designed to encourage people to travel into Beccles westward along the Southern Relief Road 
and up London Road. This will help reduce traffic on Ellough Road and on to Ingate where there is 
potential for air quality issues.  
3.17 Employment land is needed in the area and 5 hectares of employment land should be provided in the 
southeast corner of the site, near to the existing employment uses. B1 (a) office  uses only should take place 
near the allocated housing land. A landscaped buffer should separate the employment land from housing.  
3.18 An outline  masterplan has been prepared as shown in Figure 1 3. Development  proposals should have 
regard to this masterplan.  The masterplan has  an accompanying report , the Beccles and Worlingham 
Garden Neighbourhood Masterplan Report (2018)  and proposals  for development should have regard to 
this.  A comprehensive approach to development is essential to the success of this allocation. Preferably 
the site will come forward through a single, comprehensive outline planning application for the entire site.  
However, this may not be practical for the landowners concerned.  In these circumstances it will be 
essential that individual planning applications d o not threaten a comprehensive approach.   
3.19 Planning applications must support the delivery of the community facilities, access and utilities across the 
entire garden neighbourhood in accordance with the principles set out in the Beccles and Worlingham 
Garde n Neighbourhood Masterplan Report. The key areas below are in need of particular consideration:  Strategy for Beccles and Worlingham | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
96                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan   Community facilities.  These will include a primary school, employment land, local centre, formal 
sports and play provision and wider landscape framework. These must be placed in locations and 
on land that are most advantageous for their requirements and be accessible to both the new 
community of the Garden Neighbourhood and the existing communities in Beccles and 
Worlingham.   
 Access . This will include public tran sport, pedestrians, cyclists, car drivers and other vehicles. 
Landowners will be expected to enter into a legal agreement with the Local Planning Authority to 
make provision for connections across boundaries during the implementation process. Planning 
cond itions will require access across development land to adjoining boundaries to achieve 
integrated and comprehensive development of the new community.  
 Utilities and services . These will include gas, water, foul and surface water drainage, broadband 
and elec tricity. Landowners will be expected to enter into an agreement with the Local Planning 
Authority to make provision for connections across boundaries. Planning conditions will require 
utility routes and connections across development land to adjoining boun daries.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 97 3.20 In delivering a comprehensive approach to development in line with the indicative master plan it may be 
necessary for  landowners to sign up to land value equali sation agreements.  The Council can help facilitate 
discussions and if necessary secure equalisation through bespoke section 106 planning obligations.  The 
Council will not support any planning application for development which could undermine a 
comprehensiv e approach to delivery  or frustrates the delivery of any other part of the site.   
3.21 A detailed masterplan will be required to be submitted with any planning application for the site. The 
detailed masterplan should be informed by consultation with the communi ty.  
3.22 Neighbourhood Plans for Beccles, Worlingham and Ellough can play a role in shaping the detailed design of 
development in this area, promoting local distinctiveness.   
 
Policy WLP3.1 – Beccles and Worlingham Garden Neighbourhood

set out in the Beccles and Worlingham Garden Neighbourhood Maste rplan  Report . 
Development which would undermine comprehensive development of the site will not 
be permitted.  
 Strategy for Beccles and Worlingham | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
98                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan   The primary school and community hub should be located in a central location within 
the site which has good accessibility from the new community  as well as the existing 
community of south Beccles and Worlingham.  
 Any C2 uses and retirement housing should be provided in a central location on the site, 
close to the new services and facilities.  
 The country park  including a cycle path should  be provid ed along the boundary of the

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 99 Land W est of London Road, Beccles  
Residential development  
3.23 This site (10.99  hectares) lies to the southwest of 
Beccles. A petrol station occupies part of the site in 
the northeast corner. The remainder is in 
agricultural use. London Road (A145) forms much 
of the eastern boundary and provides vehicular 
and pedestrian access. A cycle path, the cemetery 
and houses adjoin the site to the north. Part of the 
cemetery is in the Beccles Conservation Area. The 
built up area of Beccles lies opposite the site to the 
east. To the west lies open countryside with 
scattered housing. Open countryside and the 
railway line lie to the south.   
3.24 The site has good access to existing servi ces, facilities, schools and employment opportunities in Beccles 
and the surrounding area via footpath, public transport, cycle and road links. The site offers moderate 
landscape value but is considered to be reasonably well contained in the landscape. Lan dscaping around 
the edges of the site would help to integrate development into its surroundings. Redevelopment of the 
petrol station site can offer enhancements to the stree t scene and the setting of the conservation a rea and 
development should aim to maxi mise these benefits.  
3.25 The site is not within the catchment of any local equipped children’s play space. Therefore, the 
development should include the provision of a local equipped area for play, approximately 0.4 hectares in 
size.  
3.26 There are existing hedger ows and trees on the site which should be retained and incorporated into the 
layout of the development except where they need to be removed to allow for access.   
3.27 The site has a medium to high potential for archaeology and any planning application must be s upported 
by the results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.   
3.28 The petrol station use will require  remediation work to make the site safe for residential use. A full site 
investigation report should be submitted with any planning application which includes reports on intrusive 
surveys, a risk assessment and remediation method statement.

Land at London Road, Beccles (1 0.99  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 2 80 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific cr iteria:  
 The site should be developed at a density of approximately 30 dwellings per hectare.  
 A play space equivalent to a local equipped area for play of approximately 0.4 hectares 
in size should be provided.  
 Vehicular access should be off London Road.  
 Pedestrian and cycle connections should be provided to the foot and cycle path to the 
north of the site.  
 A landscaped buffer of a minimum of 10 metre s in width should be provided on the 
south and west boundaries.  
 Natural features on the site such as the pond,  trees and hedgerows should be retained 
and incorporated into the layout of the development.  
 A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be submitted with any planning 
application.  
 Any planning application is to be supported by the results of a programm e of 
archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the 
impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  
 A full site investigation report assessing the risk of ground contaminati on should be 
submitted with any planning application.

Employment development  
3.29 The site (13.40  hectares) sits south of Benacre Road on part of the former Ellough Airfield. It is surrounded 
by exis ting employment uses. The site is currently used for agriculture.  
3.30 The site forms part of the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft Enterprise Zone and was originally allocated in 
the Site Specific Allocations Development Plan Document (2011) . The area is flat and has a very low 
landscape quality with few natural features and many landscape detractors in the vicinity. Further 
employment development on this site would relate well to the existing employment uses on the 
surrounding industrial estates. Development of th e site will benefit from the Beccles Southern Relief Road 
which is currently under construction.  
3.31 This site allocation is very large and considering the overall need for employment land it is unlikely that 
much of this site will be developed within the pla n period to 2036. Furthermore, there are constraints to 
electricity supply which limit the potential for development in the Ellough area. This means it is unlikely 
that development will be viable or feasible on this site in the early parts of the plan peri od. However, given 
the nature of the site and to give flexibility to what parts of the site could come forward, it is considered 
appropriate to continue to allocate the entire Enterprise Zone area to provide a longer term option for 
employment development to support Beccles and Worlingham. Furthermore, the land has limited 
potential for any other uses except for its existing agricultural use.  
3.32 Although the site has a low landscape quality, there will still be a need for landscaping on the site to help 
enhan ce the landscape of the area and screen the development to avoid an exposed edge.  
3.33 There is a small overgrown area with some mature trees to the north of the site. This should be retained as 
part of any development and made a feature of as an open space fo r local employees to enjoy.  
3.34 There is potential for archaeology to be found on the site and any planning application will be subject to a 
condition requiring a programme of archaeological work.  
3.35 There are public rights of way which follow the eastern and so uthern perimeter of the site. These should 
be retained and the development should provide links into them.

104                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  4 Strategy for Halesworth and 
Holton  
4.1 The strategy for Halesworth  and Holton is to increase the 
level of housing within the town which will help deliver 
enhanced health and sports facilities and new employment 
opportunities. This will help attract younger, working age, 
people to the town and provide more balance to the 
demographics of the population. The increased levels of 
development will help support the town centre and enhance 
its role as a service centre for  Holton and other  nearby 
villages.  
4.2 The Local Plan also aims to protect the individual identities of 
Haleswort h and Holton through the selection of sites for 
development and through the indicative masterplans for 
development between the two settlements.  
4.3 The Local Plan allocates land for 48 0 new homes in addition to 
the 282 which already have permission or complet ed since the 
beginning of the plan period. 2.5 hectares of land has also 
been allocated for employment development.  
4.4 The main site for development is the Halesworth /Holton  
Healthy Neighbourhood, which seeks to deliver 215 new 
homes, a new retirement commun ity and associated 
healthcare facilities, new sports facilities on the proposed 
Halesworth Campus and improvements to the existing Dairy 
Hill playing fields. The delivery of this site will be an important 
part of delivering the overall strategy for the tow n.  
4.5 For Holton, a small site is allocated to provide a small amount 
of additional local housing. However, the village will benefit 
from the enhanced facilities provided in Halesworth.  
4.6 Due to its proximity to the European protected sites, the 
growth in Halesworth will require mitigation and planning 
applications will require project level Habitat Regulations 
Assessment.  More details are found in Policy WLP8.34.

Mixed use including residential development, health care facility and retirement 
community, sports fac ilities and education / training facility  
4.8 The site (22.05  hectares) comprises the former Halesworth Middle School site, North Suffolk Skills Centre, 
Dairy Hill playing fields and agricultural land to the east. The site is bordered by Norwich Road to the we st 
and Harrisons Lane and Bungay Road to the north. Land on the former middle school site and Dairy Hill site 
is flat but the agricultural land to the east slopes down towards the village of Holton. Agricultural fields on 
this site are surrounded by mature  trees and hedges.   
4.9 The development of this site will help deliver the vision of the Halesworth Campus and Halesworth Health 
to provide additional sporting and health facilities in the town . The plans of these organisations will help 
promote healthier life styles for new residents and existing residents alike. The development of the site will 
include new and improved sports fields, a 3G pitch, a sports hall, community and training facilities, health 
care facilities, a retirement community and 215 new homes.  The housing provided on the site will have 
excellent access to these new facilities. The site also has good access to existing facilities in the town 
centre, Cutlers Hill Surgery, the railway station and employment premises. Although the site sits within t he 
gap between Halesworth and Holton and is within tributary valley farmland landscape character area, the 
fields comprising the eastern part of the site are well screened with mature vegetation which will limit the 
impact on the landscape and the potentia l for coalescence between Halesworth and Holton. The 
Halesworth Playing Fields Association will also implement its own plans to improve the existing sports 
facilities at Dairy Hill, which will contribute towards the Halesworth Healthy Neighbourhood.  
4.10 The no rthwest portion of the site on part of the former middle school site will be developed to provide 
high quality care and accommodation for elderly residents as well as health facilities for the community. 
New sport facilities will be located in the centre p art of the site, with new housing to the east of the site. 
Sports facilities on Dairy Hill will be retained in their current location. New housing and the retirement 
community on the site should help enable the delivery of the sports and community faciliti es. As such the 
proposed 3G pitch to the south of the existing North Suffolk Skills Centre should be delivered prior to the 
construction of the 100th house on the site. Access to the residential element of the development should 
be from Harrisons Lane. Loa m Pit Lane should not be used for vehicular access but should facilitate cycle 
access.   
4.11 The landscape in this location is sensitive to development. There is mature planting around the edges of 
the site which will need to be retained and enhanced to ensure there is only limited impact on the 
landscape.  
4.12 Town Farm, a Grade II listed building sits within the site. The development should be laid out in such a way 
to limit the impact on the setting of this listed building.  
4.13 Any planning application must be suppor ted by the results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, 
including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological 
remains and proposals for managing those impacts.   Strategy for Halesworth and Holton  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

should be retained and enhanced as part of the development and provide links to the development 
recently approved off Hill Farm Road.  
4.15 The Apollo Youth Club is located on the site of the former middle school and provides a valuable facility for 
children and teenagers from Halesworth and the surrounding area. A replacem ent for the Apollo Youth 
Club will be  provided as part of the Haleswort h Healthy Neighbourhood.  
4.16 An indicative masterplan is provided in Figure 15 showing how the site could be developed. Development 
proposals should have regard to this indicative masterplan.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 109 Policy WLP4.1 – Halesworth /Holton  Healthy Neighbourhood  
The Halesworth /Holton  Healthy Neighbourhood (22.05  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is 
allocated for a comprehensive mixed use development c omprising:  
 215 dwellings ;  
 Health Care Facility and Retirement Community (approximately 2.3 hectares) ;  
 Sports Facilities including, playing pitch, 3G pitch, and indoor sport facilities 
(approximately 8.6 hectares); and  
 Education/Training Facility .  
The s ite should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 Residential development will be located on the northern and eastern parts of the site, 
which has an area of 7 hectares. The site will be developed at a density of approximatel y 
30 dwellings per hectare.  
 The health care facility and retirement community will be located on the north western 
parts of the site.  
 The sports facilities will be located on the central parts of the site. Sports facilities on 
the site should include a 3 G artificial pitch for all weather sports provision. This should 
be enabled by residential development on the site and should be completed before the  
completion of the first 100 dwellings.  
 Redevelopment of the site will include replacement of the Apollo Youth Club.  
 The North Suffolk Skills Centre will be retained on the site to be used for educational, 
voluntary and community purposes. This includes providing accommodation for local 
community organisations.  
 Existing facilities at Dairy Hill, including th e sports pitches, martial  arts school, tennis 
courts,  bowling green and children’s p lay space, will be retained.  
 Access to the residential development should be from Harrisons Lane.  
 Existing trees and hedges on the site will be retained. There should be tree planting 
along the eastern edge of the site totalling 2. 5 hectares to minimise landscape impact of 
the site.  
 Development should be designed to encourage walking and cycling. Existing public 
rights of way on the site will be retained and new pedestria n access provided to include 
connectivity both within the site and with neighbouring parts of Halesworth. Loam Pit 
Lane should provide pedestrian and cycle access to the site.  
 A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be submitted with any planning 
application.  
 Any planning application is to be supported by the results of a programme of 
archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the 
impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing thos e 
impacts .  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.  Strategy for Halesworth and Holton  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

Residential development  
4.17 The site (9.17 hectares) is located south of Chediston Street on sloping land on the west side of the town. 
The site is currently used for arable agriculture.  
4.18 The site is just 600 metres from the town centre and therefore has excellent access to services and 
facilities. The site has good access to employment premises in the town, the railway station and the 
primary school. With development to the south of the site and to the east, the site constitutes a logical 
extension to the town.  
4.19 The site sits within tributary valley farmland landscape character, which is sensitive to development. The 
site slopes upwards from Chediston Street to the south with high banks on parts of the northern and 
eastern boundary of the site. The site will therefore need to be caref ully designed and landscaped to limit 
the potential impact on the landscape. It may be necessary to restrict building heights to 1 or 1.5 storeys 
on the crest of the hill .  
4.20 The area to the west of Halesworth suffers from a lack of open space and children’s play areas. The 
location of the site means that residential development would be outside of the catchment for local play 
spaces. It is therefore important that residential development includes provision of a new play space 
equivalent to a neighbourhood equipped area for play. The open space should not be positioned in a 
peripheral location, which will limit its value to the community.  
4.21 The site  is within a Minerals Consultat ion Area  as defined by the Suffolk Minerals Core Strategy (2008).  As 
such the County Council, as Minerals Planning Authority will need to be consulted on the planning 
application.  Consideration should be  given to using some of the on -site mineral resourc e in any resulting 
development in order to reduce the amount of material transported on and off the site.   
Policy WLP4.2  – Land A djacent to Chediston Street, Halesworth  
Land adjacent to Chediston Street, Halesworth (9.17 hectares) as identified on the Polici es Map is 
allocated for a residential development of 200 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 This site should be developed at a density of approximately 30 dwellings per hectare.  
 Development sho uld include provision of an open space of not less than 0.8 hectares in 
size, including a neighbourhood equipped area play space. The open space should be 
designed to have a street frontage on three sides or have a street corner position.  
 A landscaping sch eme should be prepared to integrate the site within the landscape.  
 A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be submitted with any planning 
application.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as p art of any planning application.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 111 Land North of Old Station Road, Halesworth  
Residential development  
4.22 The site (0.51 hectares) is located on land to the north of Old 
Station Road. The site is bordered by development to the south 
and east and to the west has planning permission for a self build 
development.  
4.23 The site is well contained within the landscape and development 
on the site would not intrude further into the countryside than 
development already permitted. The site is within walking 
distance of nearby employment premises on Norwich Road. The 
site also has good access to the primary school and the proposed 
facilities within the Halesworth /Holton  Healthy Neighbourhood 
as described in Policy WLP4.1. The site therefore presents a 
sustainable opportun ity for a small scale development.  
4.24 Housing to the south of the site is low density of approximately 15 dwellings per hectare. There is planning 
permission for further housing development on land to the west of the site. The surrounding landscape 
only has l imited capacity to accommodate new development. Low density development of 20 dwellings 
per hectare will be in keeping with surrounding residential development and will reduce the impact of new 
housing upon the surrounding landscape. Retention of trees and  hedges on the site and the use of 
appropriate landscaping will also help to reduce the impact of development on the landscape.  
4.25 The site has potential for archaeology and a programme of archaeological work will be required as part of 
any planning permissi on.  
 
Policy WLP4.3 – Land North of Old Station Road, Halesworth  
Land to the north of Old Station Road, Halesworth (0.51 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is 
allocated for a residential development of 10 dwellings.  
The site should be developed i n accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 This site should be developed at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Development should include the retention of existing trees and hedgerows.  
 A planning condition relating to archaeo logical investigation will be attached to any 
planning permission.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.

112                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Land West of  Lodge Road, Holton  
Residential development  
4.26 The site (0.70  hectares) is situated behind a recent development of affordable and market housing on 
Lodge Road, Holton.  
4.27 The existing development to the south and west of the site and the mature screening surrounding the rest 
of the site means development  will only have a limited effect on the landscape. The site has good access to 
services and facilities in the village of Holton, including the primary school. Lodge Road is currently part of 
the National Cycle Network Route 1.  
4.28 The Gavelcroft, a Grade II li sted building, is located to the north west of the site. Development on the site 
is unlikely to impact on the setting of Gavelcroft. Retention of existing vegetation around the edge of the 
allocated site will help avoid impact on the listed building.  
4.29 New residential development on this site should complement existing dwellings on this site and residential 
areas to the east, which are of a low density. New housing should reflect its rural edge of centre location 
and so development should be at a lower densi ty of 20 dwellings per hectare. New dwellings should be of 
an appropriate height and massing which reflects the recently completed dwellings to the south and west 
of the site, which means that they should be of no more than two storeys in height and be of similar 
proportions.  
4.30 There is potential for archaeology to be found on the site and any planning application will be subject to a 
condition requiring a programme of archaeological work .  
 
Policy WLP4.4 – Land West of  Lodge Road, Holton  
Land at Lodge Road , Holton (0.70  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a residential 
development of 15 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site should be developed at a density of approxim ately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Development should retain trees and hedges that surround the site.  
 Dwellings should be no more than two storeys in height.  
 A planning condition relating to archaeological investigation will be attached to any 
planning perm ission.   
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.

Housing and Community Centre / Pre -School  Setting  
4.31 The site (1. 44 hectares) is located to the west of Saxons Way on the south east side of the town. The site is 
currently not in use and is overgrown.  
4.32 The site was originally allocated for housing and a community centre/customer access centre in the Site 
Specific Allocat ions Development Plan Document  (2011) . The site has not come forward to date as it has 
only very recently been marketed for development and sold to a developer. The site is of considerable 
importance because it is one of the last remaining development oppo rtunities in close proximity to the 
town centre.   
4.33 Existing community buildings in the town such as the London Road office and the Rifle Hall struggle to 
deliver modern fit for purpose facilities to meet the needs of the existing community and the growing 
community of Halesworth and Holton.  To accommodate the level of growth planned for Halesworth and 
Holton a new pre -school setting is required.  This site, with its close proximity to the town centre makes it 
the most suitable site to provide these facilities . The proximity to the town centre means that there is 
potential for linked trips which will help enhance the vitality and viability of the town centre and reduce 
the need to travel.   
4.34 Given the above, in order to ensure there is a positive p lanning framewo rk for this site to deliver essential 
community facilities, this Local Plan reallocates the site.   
4.35 The community centre should provide meeting facilities for local groups as well as office and business 
facilities for the Town Council and other local organi sations.  The pre -school can be combined into the 
same complex.  The community buildings and the pre -school should be accommodated on approximately 
0.44 hectares of the site.   
4.36 To help facilitate the delivery of the community facilities and the pre -school, ho using is also allocated on 
the site.  A comprehensive approach to the development of the site, for both housing and community use s, 
will be required. Housing should be located on the southe rn part of the site (approx. 1 ha). Based on the 
proximity to the tow n centre and surrounding densities, the site should be developed for approximately 40 
dwellings at a density of 40 dwellings per hectare.  
4.37 Part of the sit e is located within Halesworth C onservation Area and development on the site could impact 
upon views of  St. Mary’s Church, which is a Grade II* listed building and there are a number of other listed 
buildings adjacent to the site. Development will need to be designed in order to protect and enhance the 
setting of the conservation area and listed building.   
4.38 Three species of reptile have been  historically  recorded on this site, as well as UK BAP Priority Species of 
birds. Any future development must take account of wildlife and  seek to avoid impacts and  include 
suitable mitigation measures  where necessary .  
4.39 Good footpath and cycle provision should be provided through the site, linking development with the town 
centre and the wider rights of way network.  Strategy for Halesworth and Holton  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
114                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP4.5  – Land at Dairy Farm , Saxons Way, Halesworth  
Land at Dairy Farm , Saxons Way, Halesw orth (1.44  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated 
for a residential development of 40  dwellings  and a community centre and pre -school setting .  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The south of the s ite (1 hectare ) should be developed for 40 dwellings at a density of 40 
dwellings per hectare.  
 Housing development on this site should help to facilitate the community centre and 
pre-school on the northern part of the site (0. 44 hectares).  
 Good footpath a nd cycle provision should be provided through the site, linking 
development with the town centre, residential areas and wider rights of way network.  
 
An ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as part of any plannin g 
application. No vegetation clearance should take place until the results of the assessment are completed 
and any necessary mitigation measures are in place. Clearance of scrub should be undertaken outside of 
the bird breeding season and any loss of BAP s pecies habitat should be compensated for.

Employment development  
4.40 The site (2.64  hectares) lies just to the north of the Norwich Road Industrial Estate. The site is currently in 
agricultural use.  
4.41 The site provides a logical extension to the existing industrial areas to the north of Halesworth. The site is 
relatively well contained wi thin the landscape which is of reduced quality in this location due to the pylons 
which run to the west of the site. Development on the site would provide valuable extra jobs to support 
the local economy and the growing population of Halesworth and Holton.   
4.42 The pavement on Norwich Road stops short of the site boundary. This should be extended to provide 
pedestrian access to the site.  
4.43 Although the site is well contained within the landscape, a significant amount of planting will be required 
to screen the de velopment from the farmhouse which lies to the west of the site to protect its amenity. 
Access to the farmhouse must be retained through the development.  
4.44 A Suffolk Wildlife Trust survey has revealed that there are great crested newts contained within the 
compound of the substation to the south of this site. A survey will be needed to determine whether they 
are using the southern meadow as a habitat. The Trust recommend that part of this site be set aside for 
species that prefer thick hedge and bramble scru b, this could be combined with the landscaping referred 
to above. Ecological surveys, including for bats, breeding birds, newts and reptiles should also be 
undertaken.  
4.45 The site has a high potential for archaeology and any planning application must be suppo rted by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts. There is potential for archaeology to be  found on the site and any planning application will be 
subject to a condition requiring a programme of archaeological work.

5.1 The strategy for Bungay allows for a modest level of growth 
which protects the sensitive landscape around the town 
which is well related to the Broads. New employment land has 
already been permitted to the south of the town as part of a 
mixed use developme nt which will help improve the self -
containment of the town.  
5.2 The Local Plan allocates land for 485 new homes  (of which 
150 already have planning permission)  in addition to the 72 on unallocated sites which already have 
permission or completed since the be ginning of the plan period. New housing will help contribute funding 
towards the delivery of a new fit for purpose community centre for the town as well as support the shops 
and services of the town centre.

Residential development  
5.4 The site ( 4.65  hectares) lies to the south of the built up area of Bungay and adjoins built development on 
the northwest and northeast edges. St Johns Road (A144) bounds the site on the southwest edge and 
fields adjoin the site to the south. The site is curren tly in agricultural use.  
5.5 The site represents a natural extension to the south of the town with good access to the road network and 
public transport. The high school is within walking distance and a primary school is within 1 km. Local 
services and facilit ies are within walking distance. Vehicular access should be off St Johns Road . 
5.6 A watercourse  known as the Tin River  bounds the site on the north eastern boundary and the east ern part  
of the site is at risk from flooding. As part of planning permission for a major mixed use development on 
the opposite side of St Johns Road a drainage attenuation pond  has been approved on the eastern part of 
the site . The Tin River and the adjacent hedgerow  also has some value as biodiversity habitat.  These areas 
are not suitable for development and should be retained as land for drainage attenuation and public open 
space which is compatible with flood water. Adjoining houses should have their primary frontage facing on 
to this open area to create a strong an d positive relationship including overlooking of the open space and 
an attractive urban edge.  
5.7 To the south of the site lie open fields, along with the Grade II listed Dukes Farm and Barn, around 130 
metres to the south. A substantial landscaping scheme will be required on the southern boundary to 
soften the development in views across the countrysi de and to help preserve the setting of the listed 
buildings. The landscaping should support biodiversity connectivity to and from the Tin River. Furthermore, 
built development  and landscaping  should be laid out on the site to maintain views of the listed b uildings 
when leaving the town and travelling south on the A144.  
5.8 The northwest edge of the site is used as an informal pedestrian/cycle way. Provision of a pedestrian and 
cycle route through the  site would connect St Johns Hill  and Kings Road  with  existing  development to the 
east and north of the site , improving  connections  with the swimming pool and high school.  
5.9 The site has a high potential for archaeology and any planning application must be supported by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evalu ation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  
5.10 The site is in an area of high landscape sensitivity and moderate landscape value. To mitigate the  impact in 
the landscape, buildings on the southeast edge of the site should not be greater than 1.5 storeys. The 
neighbouring properties on Fairfield Road and Kerrison Road to the northwest are either single or 1.5 
storeys. Therefore buildings on the nort hwest edge of the site should not be greater than 1.5 storeys.  
5.11 An indicative masterplan has b een prepared as shown in Figure  17. Development proposals should have 
regard to this masterplan.

Land east of  St Johns Road, Bungay ( 4.65  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for 85 
dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the fol lowing site specific criteria:  
 The site should be developed at a density of approximately 30 dwellings per hectare .  
 Vehicular access should be from St Johns Road.  
 A landscaped strip a minimum of five metres wide should be planted along the 
southeast  bound ary of the site.  This planting should  support biodiversity connectivity to 
and from the watercourse known as Tin River.  
 Houses and landscaping adjacent to St Johns Road should be laid out and developed in a 
manner that does not obscure views of the listed Dukes Farm and Barn from St Johns 
Road.  
 Land adjacent to the Tin River should  be retained as land for drainage attenuation and 
public open space, as shown on the masterplan in Figure  17. Houses adjacent to this 
area should  have their primary frontage facing the Tin River.  
 The hedgerow on the north  eastern  boundary of the site by the Tin River should  be 
retained.  
 A pedestrian and cycle route should  be provided through the site , linking St Johns Road 
to Kerrison Road and Mead ow Road.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as pa rt of any planning application.  
 A flood risk assessment demonstrating the development is safe and does not increase 
flooding outside of the developed  part of the site  will be required as part of any 
planning application.  
 A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be submitted with any planning 
application.  
 Any planning application is to be supported by the results of a programme of 
archaeological e valuation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the 
impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those

5.12 The site ( 21 hectares) lies to the south of the built up 
area of Bungay. Bungay High School adjoins the site 
at the northwest corner and immediately to the east 
lies the swimming pool. The site  is currently in 
agricultural use. Open countryside lies to the east, 
south  and west. The eastern part of the site was 
originally allocated under Policy  BUN1 in the Site 
Specific Allocations Development Plan Document 
(2011). This land now has outline planning permission 
for a mixed use development including up to  150 
dwellings, o pen space, 3 hectares  of employment land  and associated infrastructure. It has been included 
as part of this allocation to ensure it is delivered in a comprehensive way  with land to the west allocate d 
under this policy which does not currently have the ben efit of planning permission .  
5.13 The site form s an extension to the built up area of Bungay. The site lacks distinctive landscape features and 
its landscape sensitivity and value is not high. There is good access to local services, facilities and 
employment l and. The allocation includes a parking and turning area for school buses which will alleviate 
school traffic in the roads to the north of the high school. As the development of the site will effectively 
‘land -lock’ the Bungay High School, a n extension to t he school playing field  is necessary to future -proof the 
growth of the school.   
5.14 Vehicular access to the site should  be via the A144.  The site provides an opportunity to provide a more 
suitable access for school buses to the high school.  Therefore a turning  area and drop -off for buses should 
be provided on the site.   
5.15 Existing boundary hedges provide biodiversity value and should be retained. There is a G rade II listed 
building around 300 metres to the south of the site . Cycle connectivity should be provided across the site 
to serve the development and allow for future cycle links to be developed  to the west . Pedestrian and 
cycle links should also be included  between the existing residential development, the swimming pool  and 
new industrial units.   
5.16 A mix of small and medium sized employment units should be provided. To minimise traffic impact on the 
town centre, the majority of the units should be B1 and B2 uses. B8 (storage and distribution) uses will 
only be acceptable s ubject to traffic generation considerations, including the potential impact on the town 
centre. The employment land should be located near the southern edge of the site, to reduce conflict with 
residential uses. The employment uses should be delivered prio r to or at the same time as the residential 
development.

www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan                 125 5.17 A new pre -school setting is required within Bungay to serve the population growth.  The provision of 
employment premises on this site, together with the sites close relationship to the Bungay High Sch ool 
means it is a suitable location for a new setting.  
5.18 The Green Infrastructure Strategy identifies there is a shortfall of allotments and space for informal ball 
games in Bungay . 1.2 hectares  of open space should be provided on the allocation, including a  
Neighbourhood Equipped Area for Play (NEAP). Applying the recommended standard for allotments in the 
Waveney Open Space Needs Assessment (2015), this  allocation would require 0.25 hectares  of allotment 
space to meet its needs.  
5.19 The site slopes toward St Jo hns Road and drainage of the site will require careful management. The outline 
planning permission on the site includes drainage attenuation measures on the opposite side of St Johns 
Road. Policy WLP 5.1 has been designed to accommodate this drainage attenuation. Any planning 
application on this site should be accompanied by a surface water drainage strategy.  
5.20 The site has potential for archaeology and any planning application must be supported by the results of a 
programme of archaeological evaluation,  including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the 
impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those impacts.  
5.21 The sloping nature of the site means that the development must be carefully designed and landscaped in 
order to avoid an intrusive appearance in the landscape an d help integrate development in to its 
surroundings. A landscape strategy shou ld be provided which takes  account of the topography of the site 
and planting. This could involve low -rise buildings on p arts of the site. A landscaped buffer should be 
provided on the southern edge of the site to soften the appearance of the development and help preser ve 
the setting of the G rade II Listed Manor Farm.

Land west of St Johns Road, Bungay  (21 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map  is allocated for a 
comprehensive development of  400 dwellings , 3 hectares of employment land, a pre -school setting and 
open space.  
The site should be developed in accordance wi th the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 30 dwellings per hectare. Lower 
density development will be appropriate where it is adjacent to the southern edge of 
the site.  
 The employment land should prov ide a mix of small and medium sized B1 (business and 
light industrial) and B2 (general industrial) units. B8 uses will only be acceptable where it 
is demonstrated that the traffic impact (in particular heavy goods vehicles will not have 
an adverse impact o n the town centre.  
 The employment land must  be developed at the same time, or in advance of, the 
residential development.  
 The employment land should be located to the south of the site. A suitable buffer 
should be provided between the employment land and t he residences to safeguard 
residential amenity.  
 Vehicular access should  be from St Johns Road . 
 A parking and turning area for buses should be provided adjacent to the High School.  
 An extension to the school playing field of 2 hectares should  be provided.  
 1.2 hectares  of open space  should  be provided on site , including a neighbourhood 
equipped area for play  and a levelled  area for informal ball games . 
 0.25 hectares of allotment land should  be provided on site.  
 Natural features on the site such as trees and hedgerows should be retained and 
incorporated into the layout of the development.  
 A 10 metre wide landscape belt should be provided along the southern edge of the site.  
 Any planning application should  be supported by a landscape strategy which 
demonstrates  how the development is integrated in to the landscape through the 
design of the buildings and use of landscaping.  
 Pedestrian and cycle routes should  be provided which connect to the swimming pool; 
the employment land; existing residential de velopment to t he north; public r ights of 
way immediately to the south and west of the site; and allow for onward connections to 
the west of the site.  
 A Transport Assessment and Travel Plan should be submitted with any planning 
application.  
 Any planning application is to  be supported by the results of a programme of 
archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the 
impacts of development on archaeological remains and propos als for managing those 
impacts.  
 A completed ecological assessme nt undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as pa rt of any planning application.

128                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  6 Strategy for Southwold and 
Reydon  
6.1 The main strategy for Southwold and Reydon is to allocate 
more housing to increase the range of affordable homes in 
the area whilst protecting the sensitive bu ilt and natural 
environment. Currently more people work in the area than 
live in the area and there is a significant amount of in 
commuting in to Southwold from outside of the Southwold 
and Reydon area. More homes in the Southwold and Reydon 
area, particul arly affordable homes, will allow people who 
work in the area to live in the area.   
6.2 There is limited scope within Southwold itself to accommodate new housing. Therefore, the focus for 
housing is in Reydon. Like Southwold, Reydon has limited scope to expand  as it is within  the Suffolk Coast 
and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. However, the site allocated by Policy WLP6.1 does not 
extend development further into the countryside to the west than existing development to the north and 
south and therefo re represents an opportunity to deliver a significant number of homes to support 
Southwold and Reydon with a more limited impact on the landscape than other potential options for 
growth.  
6.3 Easton Bavents, which is within the parish of Reydon, is under threa t from coastal change. Since 201 1 
three properties have already been lost to erosion and a further three are at risk within the next 20 years. 
A further property could also be at risk within that timeframe. The three properties already lost were not 
able to relocate under the provisions o f Policy DM22 of the Development Management Policies 
Development Plan Document (2011). The Council issued these properties with a letter of legitimate 
expectation which states that if they were to apply for planning permission for a relocated property they  
would be treated in the same way as if their property still existed. Policy WLP8.26 of this Local Plan 
continues the approach of Policy DM22. However, relocation has proved difficult, with residents, with the 
support of the Council struggling to find suit able, affordable land to relocate the properties to. Allocating 
additional land for development in the Southwold and Reydon area offers the opportunity to secure plots 
for relocation. Policy WLP6.1 allocates l and for 22 0 homes of which 7 plots should be re served for 
relocation.  
                                                             
9 Sites with planning permission which are  expected to complete before 2036. This figure includes a proposal to develop 69 homes at St 
Georges Field on the St. Felix School site. This proposal has a resolution to grant planning permission subject to a section 106 agreement.  New homes  in Southwold and

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 129 6.4 Southwold Harbour is a unique c onserva tion a rea which needs careful management. The Local Plan for 
Waveney has for many years contained a specific policy for the management of the Harbour, and this Local 
Plan rolls that approach for ward.  
6.5 Due to its proximity to the European protected sites, the growth in Southwold and Reydon will require 
mitigation and planning applications will require project level Habitat Regulations Assessment.  More 
details are found in Policy WLP8.34.  
 
Infrastructure  
6.6 To deliver and support the growth plans outlined within this section the following new and improved 
infrastructure will be required.

Residential development  
6.7 The site ( 9.8 hectares) is located on the western edge of Reydon, between Keens Lane to the south and 
Copperwheat Avenue to the north east.  
6.8 Reydon is within the  Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstandin g Natural Beauty, therefore, all of the 
landscape surrounding the settlement is of value and is of some sensitiv ity to development. This site, 
however, will not encroach further in to the countryside to the west than what is already established by 
developm ent to the north and south. Therefore, out of all the potential options for development in the 
Southwold and Reydon area, this site is likely to have the least impact on development. The site is also 
located within convenient cycling and walking distance o f services, shops and facilities in both Reydon and 
Southwold.   
6.9 This large allocation provides a unique opportunity to secure land for the relocation of properties at risk 
(or already lost) from coastal erosion to a sustainable location. 7 plots (equal to those which have been lost 
since 2011) should be set aside for relocation. Owners of properties at risk from erosion are not obliged to 
take on these plots, they can use the benefits offered by Policy WLP8.26 to re locate elsewhere. If plots are 
not taken u p after a period of five years following the completion of the development the plots can be 
made available for the provision of affordable housing.  
6.10 The impact on the landscape will need to be carefully considered in drawing up plans for the site. Given 
the sensitivity of the landscape, sufficient landscaping will be required in and around the site to help it 
integrate with the landscape and create an acceptable settlement edge. Therefore a lower density 
development of 2 5 dwellings per hectare which allows for landscaping and more spacing between 
detached buildings is considered appropriate.  
6.11 The site is surrounded by mature trees and hedgerows, particularly along its southern edge, many of which 
are protected. Development proposals should retain existing tre es and hedgerows both within and 
bordering the site, particularly along its southern and eastern boundaries. Where possible, development 
should enhance and strengthen local networks of trees and hedges, which will protect the landscape and 
local wildlife h abitats.  
6.12 The site is accessed from Copperwheat Avenue and The Crescents.  Suffolk County Council as the Highway 
Authority have identified a need for improvements to The Crescents as well as a pedestrian crossing of 
Wangford Road.  
6.13 To the south west of the si te is Gorse Lodge which is a Grade II listed building. The design of the 
development will need to respect the setting of this listed building as much as is practical.  
6.14 The south west of Reydon suffers from a lack of open space and children’s play areas. The  site’s location 
means that residential development would be outside of the catchment for local play spaces and open 
space. It is therefore important that residential development includes provision of an open space, which 
includes a neighbourhood equipped area for play. The space should be approximately 0.8 hectares in size 
and designed and located so as to be overlooked by surrounding properties to provide natural surveillance 
and be well landscaped to create an attractive space. The space should form an e xtension to the Barn 
Close play space which is currently not very well overlooked. A further smaller space of approximately 
400sqm equivalent to a local area for play should be provided to the south of the site.  Strategy for Southwold and Reydon  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
132                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  6.15 Any planning application must be supported by the results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, 
including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological 
remains and proposals for managing those impacts.   
Policy WLP6.1 – Land West of Copperwheat Avenue, Reydon  
Land to the west of Copperwheat Avenue, Reydon (9.8 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is 
allocated for a residential development of 2 20 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteri a: 
 The site should be developed at a density of approximately 25 dwellings per hectare.  
 Development should respect the character of the surrounding Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty. This includes planting trees and hedges to the west of the site and 
limiting the height of new dwellings to no more than two storeys.  
 A landscaping scheme should be prepared to integrate the site within the landscape.  
 Development should retain existing trees and hedgerows that line the edge of the site.  
 Development should limit the impact upon the setting of Gorse Lodge, which is a Grade 
II listed building.  
 Development should include the provision of an open space of 0.8 hectares which 
includes a neighbourhood equipped area for play. The site should be located to act as 
an extension to the play space located off Barn Close. A smaller play space of 400sqm 
should be located to the south of the site.  
 Development should retain existing public rights of way that border the site to the south 
and west.  
 A Transport Assessment and  Travel Plan should be submitted with any planning 
application.  
 Development will include improvements to The Crescents as well as a pedestrian 
crossing of Wangford Road  to be defined through a Transport Assessment . 
 Any planning application is to be suppor ted by the results of a programme of 
archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should demonstrate the 
impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  
 A completed ecological assessment underta ken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.  
 7 plots should be made available on the site for the relocation of properties under 
threat from coastal erosion. Development on these plots will only be permitted if:  
o The development replaces a permanent residential building which is affected 
by erosion within 20 years of the date of the planning application ; and  
o The existing site is either cleared and made safe or put to a temporary use 
beneficial to the local communit y; or  
o The development is for affordable housing if the plot has not been used for the 
replacement of a dwelling at risk from erosion within a period of 5 years from 
the completion of the rest of the development.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 133 Southwold Harbour  
6.16 Southwold Harbour lies at the mouth of the River Blyth with Walberswick on its southern side. The 
informal character of the harbour area contrasts with the ordered neatness of Southwold itself, but both 
epitomise this part of the Suffolk Heritage Coast and justify their location  within the Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty and the Harbour Conservation Area.  
6.17 Blackshore Road, currently classified as a Restricted Byway, provides access to the northern shore of the 
River Blyth. The road is constantly being damaged by flooding and th e increasing level of commercial and 
visitor traffic. The state of the roadway acts as a constraint to development and contributes to the 
character of the area.  
6.18 The traditional fixed landing stages are part of the heritage of Southwold Harbour and make a s ignificant 
contribution to its character. Since the area is now full, and due to the size of the harbour and the 
sensitivity of the landscape, further moorings will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances. This 
could be where existing moorings becom e permanently inaccessible due to flooding or as a result of 
alterations or repairs to the sea walls.  
6.19 The fisherman's stages are of particular note. In the interests of preserving and enhancing th e traditional 
character of the H arbour Conservation Area, a s far as possible fishermen's stages should be maintained 
and repaired to a standard that will preserve and prolong the life of these important structures. When the 
need for replacement occurs, fixed landing stages should be used. Carefully designed pontoo ns reflecting 
the traditional materials and design of the fishermen's landing stages would also be acceptable. The 
replacement of landing stages and extensions to them require planning permission as well as a Marine 
Licence from the Marine Management Organ isation. In addition, applicants must apply to the Environment 
Agency for consent for works in, under, over or within 9 metres of the top of the bank of a main river, as 
required by the Water Resources Act 1991.  
6.20 Most of the buildings along the road between  Blackshore and Ferry Road are needed by the people who 
work in the area for storage of equipment and boat repairs. The quality of buildings in the area is not high, 
but being mostly of timber construction they are part of the character of the area. The qu ality of the 
surrounding landscape has to be balanced against the needs of a working harbour and flooding 
implications. Any further buildings in the harbour area are likely to detract from its character and 
consequently be detrimental to the landscape and setting. Replacement huts should be similar to the 
existing huts, to prevent any adverse impact on the landscape and to retain the character of the harbour.  
6.21 The entire harbour area is within Flood Zone 3b, the functional flood plain. The National Planning Policy 
Framework and Guidance restricts development in these locations to only water compatible development 
and essential infrastructure. Examples of water compatible uses include docks, marinas and wharves, ship 
building and repairing and dockside fish pr ocessing. Therefore national planning policy would not permit 
changes of use of the fishing huts to uses that are non water compatible.   Strategy for Southwold and Reydon  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
134                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP6.2 – Southwold Harbour  
Southwold Harbour is identified on the Policies Map.  
Proposals for replacement and/or  extensions to existing landing stages or pontoons will be permitted, 
provided that there is no detrimental visual impact on the harbour, the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Southwold Harbour Conservation Area and no impact  for navigation 
within the harbour waters. Additional moorings will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances.  
Proposals for replacement huts and other buildings on either side of Southwold Harbour will only be 
permitted where the existing structure i s beyond repair and the appearance of the replacement is closely 
related to the size, shape, design and materials used on the existing hut. Proposals for additional buildings 
at Southwold Harbour will not be permitted.  
In some circumstances extensions to w ater compatible and essential infrastructure land uses in the 
harbour will be permitted where it can be demonstrated that it:  
 Will not increase the risk of flooding elsewhere;  
 That it will not affect the structural integrity of a flood defence; and  
 That it is needed for the applicant's employment at the harbour and such development 
cannot be accommodated elsewhere.

7.1 The strategy for the  rural area s is to deliver approximately 
10%  of the District’s housing growth, supported by 
infrastructure, tourism, small scale employment, and retail 
and leisur e development. Rural communities  are dynamic in 
the sense they reflect historical patterns of development, are 
often well linked through social networks and as the 
population and technology change over time so do the needs 
and aspirations of these settlements. In recent years there has been limited development in the rural parts 
of the District.  
7.2 New housing development in rural settlements will primarily be delivered through housing allocations  (411 
dwellings) . These will be supplemented with sites that come forward that have not been allocated but may 
comply with other policies in the Local Plan. These are referred to as ‘windfall sites’. The Rural Settlement 
Hierarchy sets out the framework for the distribution of new residential development while the District -
Wide Strategic Planning Policies set out in Section 8 will guide the decision making process for these types 
of proposals. The District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies will support and facilitate non -residential 
development such as proposals for employment, re tail and leisure in rural areas.

7.3 The National Planning Policy Framework encourages an approach to housing delivery in rural areas where 
it will enhance or maintain the vitality of rural settlements. New development can support new and 
existing services and facilities and provide a wider c hoice of quality new homes where they are needed. 
The Framework encourages development in locations where people can access services and facilities and 
where there is a choice of transport modes including walking, cycling and public transport. Growth is al so 
supported where development in one settlement can support people living in communities nearby.  
7.4 The overall objective of the rural strategy is to deliver development that reflects the character of a rural 
settlement and contributes towards sustainable d evelopment that will support their needs and enable 
them to grow and prosper in the long term. Most new housing development is identified through site 
allocations  both in this Local Plan and in Neighbourhood Plans , however, District -Wide Strategic Planning  
Policies will support planning decisions related to residential proposals on sites not allocated in the Local 
Plan.

7.5 A hierarchy of settlements covering the rural ar eas has been devised to focus housing growth in the larger 
villages where there is relatively better provision of day -to-day services. These larger villages are generally 
able to accommodate larger amounts of development without unduly impacting upon the c haracter of the 
village. The hierarchy identified in Policy WLP7.1 allows for appropriate levels of development in smaller 
villages to help protect and support the existing services and in some cases improve them. The Policy 
supports limited  amounts of dev elopment elsewhere in  other rural settlements in  the Countryside  that is 
not within or adjacent to the settlement boundaries of classified villages . In these locations growth is Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

7.6 This section of the Local Plan identifies the strategy for each larger and smaller village and identifies where 
there are new allocations for development in the rural areas.  
Policy WLP7.1 – Rural Settlement Hier archy and Housing Growth  
Approximately 1 0% of the District’s housing growth will take place in the rural areas.   
Approximately 70% of new housing development in the rural areas will be in the larger villages, 20% in the 
smaller villages and 10% elsewhere in other rural settlements in the Countryside. The development 
requirements in the larger and smaller villages  in the rural area  will be delivered through site allocations in 
this Local Plan.

Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 141 7.7 The parishes of Barnby and North Cove are located between Lowestoft and Beccles north of the A146. 
Most residents in the parish es live in the villages of Barnby and North Cove, which when viewed from The 
Street appear as one built up  area. The villages are set within two landscapes of differen t character with 
the north being defined by the Broads and the south being flat, open countryside contained by the A146 
along the south extent of the built up area. The location on the A146 enables good access to services, 
facilities and employment areas i n Beccles and Lowestoft by both private vehicle and public transport.  
7.8 The strategy for Barnby and North Cove is to retain the rural character of the settlement s, in particular the 
influence of the Broads landscape whilst allowing for a reasonable level of  growth to help support existing 
services and facilities and to provide a greater choice of accommodation in the village s. Therefore 
development is allocated south of the existing settlement boundary by Policy WLP7.2 where it can be 
contained within the la ndscape and be designed to reflect the existing character of the village.  
7.9 To accommodate the new planned development, Barnby and North Cove Community Primary School will 
need to expand by at least 15 places. Barnby and North Cove are currently served by W orlingham Water 
Recycling Centre. This Water Recycling Centre is already over capacity. Therefore new sewage flows should 
be diverted to Beccles Water Recycling Centre. Localised improvements to the foul sewerage network will 
also be required.  
 
Land B etwe en The Street and A146, Barnby  
Residential development  
7.10 The site (2.80 hectares) is located on the south fringe of Barnby. The land is currently used for agricultural 
purposes and can be accessed from The Street.  
7.11 The site is well related to the existing bu ilt up area of the village and is well contained in the landscape by 
existing properties to the north and the A146 to the south. Development of the site will have a limited 
impact on the wider landscape and will not have a significant adverse impact on the  setting of the Broads.  
7.12 The adjacent residential area has a housing density of approximately 16 dwellings per hectare. A majority 
of new dwellings in this area are disproportionately large and reflect the recent patterns of residential 
development. Since 2 009, fourteen of a total of sixteen dwellings delivered in the villages have been three 
bedrooms or larger. This has contributed towards a shortfall of small dwellings in the area. Therefore the 
delivery of smaller dwellings on the site will be supported.  
7.13 The A146 is located along the south boundary of the site. Noise generated by traffic is to be considered as 
part of any proposal. The existing trees along this route should be protected and reinforced to reduce the 
impact of noise and provide screening.  
7.14 Footways within the development should provide direct connections to the existing pedestrian network. 
This could usefully be supported with improvements to the unsigned cycle route along The Street that 
connects the site to other destinations in the villag e including the primary school and the recreation area 
at Pinewood Gardens.  Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
142                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.15 The nearest equipped play space is located at Pinewood Gardens in North Cove which is the only 
significant open space for outdoor recreation activities in the village. This site li es some distance from the 
play area. Therefore an equipped play space equivalent to a local equipped area for play should be 
provided on the site. This open space should be not less than 0.2 hectares in size and be located and 
designed to have good natural  surveillance and complement the character of The Street.  
7.16 There is potential for archaeology to be found on the site and any planning application will be subject to a 
condition requiring a programme of archaeological work.   
Policy WLP7.2 – Land Between The Street and A146, Barnby  
Land between The Street and the A146 , Barnby  (2.80 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is 
allocated for a residential development of 50 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specif ic criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal should be designed to provide a mix of housing types and sizes. The 
priority will be for smaller two and three bedroom dwellings which reflect the scale of 
properties located in the area of Mill Lane.  
 On the frontage on to The Street, dwellin gs should consist of varied designs and be set 
back from the road with off -street parking.  
 The existing footway along The Street should be extended along the frontage of the site.  
 Landscaping should be provided along the frontage of The Street to complem ent and 
enhance the streetscape.  
 Trees located along the south boundary should be  protected and reinforced with 
additional planting.  
 A play space equivalent to a local equipped area for play together with ancillary open 
space and landscaping should be pr ovided. This open space will be of an area not less 
than 0.2 hectares. The site should be positioned to have a street corner location with 
one frontage facing onto The Street.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person wil l be 
required as part of any planning application.

144                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.17 Blundeston  is located approximately three miles 
north west of Lowestoft. The village is well 
connected to the strategic road network including 
the A47 linking Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth 
and the B1074 towards Norwich. Employment is 
available in Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth and 
new development proposed in the  Local Plan 
could improve the attractiveness of the village as a 
place to live and support the community.  
7.18 The village has literary links to Charles Dickens and there are several distinctive buildings of heritage value 
that contribute towards the character  of the village including Plough Inn and St Mary the Virgin Church. 
Recreational activities are focused around the village hall where there is equipped play provision and 
sports pitch facilities.   
7.19 During the first half of the plan period the redevelopment of the former Blundeston Prison site will deliver 
a significant amount of new housing in the village to meet local needs as well as a pre -school, retail and 
employment units. The strategy for Blundeston is therefore to allocate a small amount of additional  
development with the majority delivered once the Blundeston Prison development is complete in order to 
enable the community to accommodate this growth and reduce the potential impact on the character of 
the village.   
7.20 This additional development  will help support the existing services and facilities within the village. To 
support the new development  in Blundeston and surrounding Parishes,  to Blundeston Primary School will 
need to expand to accommodate at least 23 new places. Localised improvements to the foul sewerage 
network will also be required.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 145 Land South of Lound Road, Blundeston  
Residential development  
7.21 The site (0.88 hectares) is located in Blundeston on Lound Road in the north west  area of the village. The 
north pa rt of the sit e has been used for horticulture  in the past and the south part of the site is greenfield 
and used for grazing.  
7.22 The site is set within the built up area and is contained within the wider landscape by existing development 
and trees along Flixt on Road. Compared to other potential sites for development around the village the 
site is considered to have a minimal  impact on the landscape setting and character of Blundeston. This 
small site  provides  an opportunity to provide housing that will contrib ute towards meeting local need and 
without adversely affect the setting or character of the village.  
7.23 The site is most closely related to the adjacent built up area to the east which is characterised by well 
established two storey semi -detached dwellings. The housing density in the surrounding residential area is 
approximately 18 dwellings per hectare and is characterised by dwellings with  a small footprint relative to 
the size of the plot. Existing properties near the site are set back from the road and ha ve off -street car 
parking which should be reflected in any development proposal.  
7.24 Along the south boundary is an unpaved public right of way lined by established trees. Lound Road does 
not have footways and an opportunity exists for the development to util ise this public right of way to 
improve connectivity to facilities in the village.  
7.25 There is bend in Lound Road and access to the development should be located away from the bend to the east.  
7.26 There is potential for archaeology to be found on the site and a ny planning application will be subject to a 
condition requiring a programme of archaeological work.  
Policy WLP7.3 – Land South of Lound Road, Blundeston  
Land at Lound Road, Blundeston (0.88 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 16 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 20  dwellings per hectare.  
 The size of the building footprint in relation to the size of the plot will reflect the 
character of properties located to the east along Lound Road.  
 Direct access to the public right of way located  along the south boundary of the site 
should be provided.  
 Trees along the south boundary of the site should be protected.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.

146                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Land North of Pickwick Drive, Blundeston  
Residential development  
7.27 The site (2.29 hectares) is located on the north extremity of Blundeston. This site is potentially accessed 
from Pickwick Drive (via Market Lane) and The Pippins. The site is fallow and has b een used for 
horticultural purposes in the past.  
7.28 The site is an extension of the existing built up area but is contained within the wider landscape and relates 
well to recent development in this part of the village.  
7.29 The adjacent residential area has a hou sing density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare. The area to 
the west of the site is characterised by single storey dwellings with frontages set back from the road and 
the dwellings to the south in the vicinity of Pickwick Drive are characterised by  recent development 
consisting of two storey dwellings. A mix of dwelling types on the site would complement both of these 
areas.  
7.30 The site has access to the existing road network, however, the access point from Pickwick Drive is narrow 
and designed to sup port shared use. This access may need to be upgraded. There is further opportunity 
for access into the west of the site via The Pippins.  
7.31 The site is contained within the wider landscape by the undulating terrain and trees in the area. Adjacent 
grazing plots along the east boundary help integrate the site into the surrounding landscape. New 
development has the potential to create a prominent  settlement edge to the north and east. A scheme 
designed to have a street frontage facing out to the countryside coupled with landscaping would act to 
soften the potential impact on the landscape. Existing hedgerows along the east flank of the site link i nto 
the hedgerow network that extends northwards from The Loke. The hedgerows should be protected and 
opportunities to enhance the hedgerow for biodiversity are encouraged.  
7.32 The site contains several different habitats that could support biodiversity. To id entify the biodiversity 
value of the site and any necessary  mitigation measures , an ecological assessment will be required as part 
of any planning application.  
7.33 The site is some distance from the play facilities located near the village hall. There are no footways or 
cycle routes to provide safe access for children to these  community facilities in the centre of the village. 
Therefore, an equipped play area with ancillary open space should be provided on site. It is important this 
is designed to be well over looked and related to the surrounding development.  
7.34 Two public rights of way connect to The Pippins located at the north west corner of the site. These routes 
form part of a wider footpath  network extending to Oulton and the Waveney Valley. A development t hat 
enables access to the public rights of way would benefit the wider area.  
7.35 The site has potential for archaeology and a programme of archaeological work will be required as part of 
any planning permission.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 147 7.36 An underground sewerage pipe traverses the sit e. Discussions with Anglian Water should be undertaken 
prior to a planning application being submitted to identify if mitigation measures are required.  
Policy WLP7.4 – Land North of Pickwick Drive, Blundeston  
Land at Market Lane , Blundeston  (2.29 hectares)  as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 45 dwellings.   
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 25  dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal should be designed to provide a mix of housing types and sizes and reflect 
the residential character of the surrounding area.  
 A play space equivalent to a local equipped area for play and ancillary open space 
totalling not less than  0.2 hectares is to be provided on site. The open space should be 
designed to have a street frontage on three sides or have a street corner position.  
 Direct access to the public rights of way located at the north west corner of the site 
should be provided .  
 Landscaping and tree planting will be required to mitigate the impact of the 
development on the character of the adjacent countryside and amenity when viewed 
from public rights of way . Hedgerows on site should be  protected and planting to 
enhance the co nnectivity and value  of the hedgerows will be required to support 
biodiversity.  
 An ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as 
part of any planning application.  
 A maximum of 25 new dwellings can be accessed via Pic kwick Drive with the remainder 
accessed via The Pippins.  
 Planning permission for residential development will not be granted until 2025.

7.37 Kessingland is the largest village in Waveney with a range of shops and services and employment provided 
by tourism and a number of small business units.  
7.38 Kessingland has recently prepared a Neighbourhood Plan which was ‘made’ by Waveney District Council in 
January 2017. The Neighbourhood Plan sets out a vision and strategy for the village which the District 
Council strongly supports. The Neighbourhood Plan  allocates 3 sites for housing, totalling 105 houses. The 
Neighbourhood  Plan also allocates land for an Early Years Centre and a care facility. All allocations are 
shown on the Policies Map.  
7.39 Given the significant levels of housing allocated by the Neighbou rhood Plan which will help support and 
enhance service provision in the village, it is not considered necessary to allocate further development to 
Kessingland in this Local Plan.

Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
150                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.40 Somerleyton is small compared to other villages categorised as Larger Villages by Policy WLP7.1. Over the 
period 2001 to 2011 the population declined by 26. However, compared to other villages, the village has a 
good range of services and facilities, and a  railway station which provides links to Lowestoft and Norwich.  
7.41 The village reflects the design aspiration of Sir Morton Peto who contributed significantly to the prosperity 
of the District in the 19th Century. Somerleyton Hall provides the backdrop for t he village. The heart of the 
village is characterised by ornate thatched roof buildings set around a village green. These form part of the 
Somerleyton Conservation Area which is a key feature of the village to be preserved and enhanced.   
7.42 The strategy for S omerleyton is for new development to provide a variety of housing types and tenures to 
meet local housing need and support local services and facilities. Given the exceptional quality of design of 
the historic buildings in the village any new development s hould also be of an exceptionally high standard.  
7.43 New development will contribute towards the improvement of existing community facilities such as a 
replacement village hall. New development will support the primary school and  new drop -off provision will 
be required. Localised improvements to the foul sewerage network will also be required.  
 
Land North of The Street, Somerleyton  
Residential development  
7.44 The site (0.65 hectares) is located within the built up area of the village. The land consists of areas 
classified as greenfield and brownfield. The part of the site fronting onto The Street is a former petrol 
station. Ancillary chemical storage tanks are located on the north part of the site. Part of the site is 
undeveloped and fallow.  
7.45 The site is considere d appropriate  for development because it is well located in the village, is partly 
brownfield land, is well contained in the wider landscape and will provide new residents with good access 
to the primary school and other facilities in the village. The site  is located close to a number of listed 
buildings but with mitigation the potential impact on these is likely to be less than other potential options 
for development in the village.  
7.46 The adjacent residential area has a housing density of approximately 15 dw ellings per hectare. This part of 
the village is characterised by distinctive two storey dwellings related to  the Somerleyton Estate. Modern 
development along The Street adjacent the site consists of bungalows and these are out of keeping with 
the characte r of the wider settlement.  
7.47 The site is located within the conservation a rea and there are listed buildings adjacent the site to the south 
and west. The Rosary is set within an expansive garden and flanked by locally listed buildings to the east 
and west. The setting and character of these could be adversely affected by insensitive development. To 
mitigate this impact, dwellings should be relatively low level, no higher than 2 storeys, have rear gardens 
backing onto the former post office, Japonica and The Nook to provide separation between the buildings.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 151 7.48 The Forge, a locally listed building situated within the site,  is to be retained. Consideration should be given 
to how this building can be re -used to benefit the site and the village. Buildings either sid e of The Forge are 
also locally listed and a heritage asset assessment will be required.  
7.49 North of the site are the community allo tments. These form part of the conservation a rea and contribute 
towards the setting of the dwellings which front onto the vill age green. Along the edge of the allotments 
are hedgerows. These should be protected and reinforced to protect the character of the area and reduce 
the potential for creating an exposed settlement edge facing the open countryside to the north.  
Policy WLP7 .5 – Land North of The Street, Somerleyton  
Land north of The Street, Somerleyton (0.65 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 10 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following sit e specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 15 dwellings per hectare.  
 Building heights  should be  no higher than 2 storeys.  
 Dwellings should  be designed to have gardens backing onto properties located 
southwest of the site.  
 Hedgerows and trees located along the site boundaries should be  protected and 
reinforced where possible.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualif ied person will be 
required as part of any planning application.  
 A heritage asset assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required 
as part of any planning permission. The locally listed ‘Forge’ located on site is to be 
protected.  
 A co ndition relating to a contamination investigation will need to be attached to any 
planning permission.  
 
Mill Farm Field, Somerleyton  
Residential development  
7.50 The site ( 1.9 hectares) is located in the central part of Somerleyton. The land is used for agric ulture and 
can be accessed from Station Road.  
7.51 Development of this site is likely to have the most minimal  impact on the character of the village and 
setting of listed buildings compared to other possible sites for development in the village. The land is well 
related to existing development and has good access to existing community facilities. Landscaping will  be 
required to preserve the open character of the area and contribute towards integrating new dwellings into 
the existing settlement.  Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
152                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.52 Given the location of the site within the vill age on the edge of the conservation area and adjacent to the 
Somerleyton Es tate Historic Park and Garden, the design of development on this site needs to be 
exceptional. Scheme and dwelling design should be innovative and reflect the historical quality and 
aspirations of the village but preferably expressed in a modern context. D esign should therefore be 
innovative but reflective of the historical character and should not necessarily be a pastiche of past styles. 
It should provide evidence of a progression of design ideas and styles which document the village’s history 
and develop ment.  
7.53 The north part of th e site contributes towards the conservation a rea and the setting of several listed 
buildings. The combination of woods, open space, countryside and agricultural buildings contribute 
towards the openness a nd rural setting of Somerl eyton . The north part of the site is to be set out as open 
space that provides a sense of openness but includes a well conceived landscaping scheme to complement 
the wooded area to the east and existing trees on the open space adjacent to the west. To posi tively 
contribute towards the setting of the open space and integrate the development into the village, dwellings 
along the north boundary should be designed to have their primary frontage facing onto the open space.  
7.54 Any scheme should be designed to provid e a mix of property sizes and tenures that can meet local housing 
need. Therefore, the majority of new dwellings on the site will be of a scale which is reflective of the 
terraced properties located along Station Road and the Morton Peto cottages along The  Street with similar 
sized back gardens. This can be provided through a mix of detached, semi -detached and terraced 
properties.  
7.55 To minimise the  impact on the Somerleyton Estate Historic Park and Garden, p roperties on the east side of 
the site should  be no higher than 1.5 storeys.  This will protect the conservation a rea, character of the 
village and enhance the green infrastructure network in the village and biodiversity.  
7.56 The village hall, primary school and public house are within walking distance a nd connected by existing 
footways. There is no footway along Station Road where the main recreation space and railway station are 
located. The footway should be extended from The Street to the entrance of the site and ideally to the 
recreation ground. To i mprove connectively to the primary school, the site should be designed to have 
pedestrian and cycle access through the proposed open space to the north of the site to connect the 
development to The Street.  
7.57 The site has a high potential for archaeology and  any planning application must be supported by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.   Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 153 Policy WLP7.6 – Mill Farm Field, Somerleyton  
Land at Mill Farm F ield, Somerleyton ( 1.9 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for  a 
residential development of 35 dwellings and open space.  
The site should be developed in accordance with th e following site specific criteria:  
 The residential part of the site will be developed at a density of approximately 20 
dwellings per hectare.  
 The open space on site is to be no less than 0.2 hectares.  
 Any proposal should be designed to provide a mix of housing types and sizes. The 
priority is for two and three bedroom dwellings that reflect the residential character of 
properties located in the area to the north.  
 Properties must be  of an exceptional design. Proposals that use standardised designs 
which are not distinctive and fail to provide any reference to the existing character of 
the village will not be supported.  
 The majority of housing is to be of a scale which reflects the terraced housing located 
west of the site along Station Road and of the Mo rton Peto cottages found elsewhere in 
the village.  
 A public right of way is to be provided in the south west part of the site to enable 
pedestrian and cycle access to Station Road.  
 The north part of the site, land opposite Morton Peto Close across to The  Street is to be 
designed as a open space that is well related to its surroundings and makes a positive 
contribution to the village. Properties must be  designed to have their primary frontages 
facin g onto the open space.  Landscaping , including tree plant ing that complements 
existing trees located to the east and west and providing a sense of openness to 
complement the open character of the farm opposite , will be required.  
 A public right of way is to be provided in the east part of the open space to connect  the 
development to The Street.  
 Hedgerows and trees on site should  be protected where possible.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.  
 A landscaping and tree planting scheme is required to screen the development along 
the east boundary.  
 Any planning application is to be supported by the results of a programme of 
archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should demon strate the 
impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  
 A heritage impact  assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required 
as part of any planning application . 
A design code/brief should b e prepared for the site either as part of a Neighbourhood Plan or as a 
Supplementary Planning Document. The Neighbourhood Plan has one year from the adoption of the Local 
Plan to provide a design code/brief for the site before Waveney District Council prod uces a Supplementary 
Planning Document. No development will be permitted on the site until either a  design code/brief  or 
Supplementary Planning Document  has been prepared.  Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 155 7.58 Wangford is located  on the A12 and has good access to Lowestoft, Southwold and Halesworth. The main 
limitation in the village is the lack of a primary school. Public transport connects people with larger service 
centres where additional facilities are available and acts to s upport  the tourism offer in Southwold. 
Wangford provides a good base for visitors to the area to explore the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, 
the Heritage Coast and the surrounding countrysi de. 
7.59 The village skyline is dominated by St Peter and St Paul’s Church and is complemented by other protected 
buildings reflecting its heritage and location on the historical London to Great Yarmouth road. A 
conservation a rea covers a large part of the vill age. 
7.60 Wangford is set within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The River Wang 
runs to the west of the village where a significant amount of land is also designated as County Wildlife 
Sites.   
7.61 The strategy for Wangford is to ena ble a limited amount of housing development to support people in the 
village with a variety of housing tenures and types while not compromising the village’s setting within the 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  
7.62 To accommodate growth in the village local ised improvements to the foul sewerage network will be 
required.

156                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Land North of Elms Lane, Wangford  
Residential development  
7.63 The site (0.89  hectares) is located north east 
of the village and is an extension of the 
existing built up area. The land is used for 
agriculture and can be accessed from Elms 
Lane.  The site is located within the Area of 
Outstanding N atural Beauty and close to the 
conse rvation a rea. 
7.64 This site is considered to have only a limited 
impact on the character of the Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty and is unlikely 
to have a significant adverse impact on 
heritage asset s in the vicinity. There is good 
access to facilities in th e village and a small 
development will support the community 
which has experienced little development in 
recent years.   
7.65 There are views of the open countryside when heading north along Elms Lane from the built up area. 
Framed within these views are a numbe r of listed buildings. Dwellings should  therefore  be of a smaller 
scale and on the eastern edge of the site, no higher than 1.5 storeys. A landscaping scheme will need to be 
submitted with any planning application.  
7.66 Elms Lane is narrow and there is limited opportunity to extend the pedestrian network along  the road. Any 
development proposal should include a footway network that enable s safe access to the footway along the 
south side of Elms Lane.  
7.67 The site has a high potential for archaeology and any planning  approval will include a condition requiring 
the results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impacts.  
7.68 The site contains a strategic trunk water main close to the west and north boundaries of the site. 
Developers are advised to divert the pipe or ensure that any structures are located at least 3 metres from 
the pipe.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 157 Policy WLP7.7 – Land N orth of Elms Lane, Wangford  
Land north of Elms Lane, Wangford (0.8 9 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for  a 
residential development of 16 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal should be designed to provide a mix of housing types and sizes. The 
priority is for smaller two and three bedroom dwellings . 
 Hedgerows and trees located along the site boundari es should be protected and 
reinforced where possible.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.  
 A landscaping scheme will be required. Hedgerow and tree planting along  the east 
boundary of the site should be provided to  connect existing hedgerows either side of 
the site and provide screening from the open countryside to the north east.  
 Any planning application should be supported by a Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment that identifies the impact on the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and 
conservation ar ea, and any necessary mitigation works.

Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 159 7.69 The village is located on the A12 between Lowestoft and Southwold and has historically expanded along 
the road network, creating a built up area characterised by development bra nching out from the village 
centre.  
7.70 The historical development of Wrentham is reflected in the numb er of listed buildings and the 
conservation a rea in the village.  
7.71 Public transport connects the village to larger service centres.  
7.72 Wrentham is rural in cha racter and lies just to the west of the  Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Wren River stretches through the village north to south creating an area 
at risk from flooding along its length.  
7.73 The strategy for Wrentham is to allow  for a reasonable level of growth to help support the shops and 
services in the village. A mix of housing types and tenures will provide choice in the market and enable 
new housing to meet the needs of the community.  
7.74 To support growth in Wrentham localised  improvements to the foul sewerage network will be required. 
Currently, Wrentham is within the catchment of Reydon Primary School. However, with the growth 
allocated to Reydon, it is unlikely there will be capacity to accommodate the growth from Wrentham a s 
well. It is likely therefore that children from the new developments will travel to primary schools in either 
Brampton or Kessingland. New development will also help deliver improvements to tennis courts in 
Wrentham and improvements to the playing field as identified in the Playing Pitch Assessment (2014).  
 
Land N orth of Chapel Road, Wrentham  
Residential development and open space  
7.75 The site (4.82  hectares) is located at the north west periphery of the village. The site is used for agriculture 
and can be a ccessed from Chapel Road.  
7.76 The site is reasonably contained in the wider landscape  by existing development to the north, east and 
south  and is unlikely to significantly affect the open character and setting of the village. The site provides 
an opportunity t o deliver a variety of housing types and tenures in a location that has good access to the 
strategic road network and facilities in the village centre.  
7.77 There is an equipped play area located to the south at the end of Bonsey Gardens. The facility lies some  
distance from  the site, is poorly overlooked, requires improvement and is not suitable to provide for the 
needs of the proposed development. Therefore a recreation area should  be provided that is well designed 
and integrated into the residential surroundi ngs to positively contribute towards the perception of the 
development and provide a focal point in the area. To be an attractive destination and provide greater 
value to the area, the open space should include an equipped play area equivalent to a neighbo urhood 
equipped area for play and an ancillary open space to support natural play and be used for informal and 
amenity uses. The open space should be locate d towards the south of the site so it can also benefit the 
existing community.  
7.78 The site is closely r elated to the conservation a rea that stretches along Priory Road to the north of the site 
and along the High Street to the east of the site. Several  heritage assets are located along Priory Road to Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
160                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  the north  including Priory Farm, The Priory and several lo cally listed buildings . These have prominent rear 
frontages and views from the north across the site. To preserve their setting , development to the north of 
the site should be restricted . Landscaping along this boundary will contribute towards mitigating p otential 
impact on these properties. The northern edge of the site is also at risk from flooding. Paddocks located 
immediately east of the site contribute towards the setting of existing residential properties and create a 
sense of openness in the area. Th ese paddocks are to be preserved and any development should be 
designed innovatively to make use of this setting.  The landscape to the west has a more open character 
and to minimise the impact on the landscape dwellings along this boundary should be no hig her than 1.5 
storeys.   
7.79 The site has potential for archaeology. An archaeological condition will be required to support any 
planning application.   
 
Policy WLP7. 8 – Land North of Chapel Road, Wrentham  
Land north of Chapel Road, Wrentham  (4.82  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 60 dwellings and open space.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The residential part of the site will be develope d at a density of approximately 30 
dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal should be designed to provide a mix of housing types and sizes including 
single and two storey dwellings.  
 Dwellings in the north part of the site and along the west boundary should be  no higher 
than 1.5 storeys.  
 Low density development is to be supported with a landscaping scheme to provide 
openness on site and provide screening along the west boundary of the site.  
 An equipped play area equivalent to a neighbourhood equipped area for  play and 
ancillary open space for amenity use will be provided of a size not less than 0.5 
hectares. The ancillary open space should have landscaping that lends itself to natural 
and informal forms of play.  
 The public open space is to be located at the s outh side of the site and designed to have 
street frontages on three sides ideally being on a corner plot.  
 Hedgerows and trees located along the site boundaries should be  protected and 
reinforced where possible.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertak en by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.  
 A footway along the frontage of the site with Chapel Road should be provided.  
 A Transport Statement should be submitted with any planning application.

Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 163 7.80 The parish of Brampton with Stoven is set in the countryside in the central area of the District. A dispersed 
pattern of development characterises the area with the largest settlement located at the junction of 
Southwold Road and the A145. Smaller clusters  are located around Moll’s Lane, the railway station and 
along Southwold Road.  
7.81 The settlement located on Southwold Road has a primary school and a village hall, however, the latter is 
separated from the residential area by the A145 and no pedestrian cross ing is provided. Other than the 
railway station there are no services or facilities located in the other settlement clusters and access to 
these is limited by the narrow road network. A bus route connects the Southwold Road area to Beccles and 
Southwold.   
7.82 The strategy for Brampton is to focus development on the Southwold Road/A145 area. The dispersed 
nature of facilities in the existing village does not create a community focal point and makes a limited 
contribution towards the identity of the village. New residential development will facilitate the delivery of 
a community facility including a replacement village hall, equipped play area, small playing pitch and 
additional parking to support the primary school. New dwellings will consist of a variety of hous ing types 
and tenures to meet local housing need.  
7.83 To support new development in the village and surrounding villages the Brampton Primary School will 
need to expand by at least 12 places. Localised improvements to the foul sewerage network will be 
require d. Development could be supported with improved parking facilities at Brampton railway station to 
encourage park and ride journeys.

164                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Land South of Southwold Road, Brampton  
Mixed use including residential development, village hall and open space  
7.84 The site  (3.04  hectares) is located on the south east fringe of the village. The site is greenfield and used for 
agriculture. Access can be obtained from Southwold Road.   
7.85 The site is considered to offer the best opportunity to provide housing in the area and assis t with the 
delivery of community facilities that are well related to the local residents. Consideration should be given  
towards the setting of The Old Rectory, Brampton Hall and the Church of St. Peter which are all located in 
the local area. However , if d esigned with a good landscaping scheme, the site is relatively contained in the 
wider landscape and can be brought forward without having any significant adverse impacts. The site has 
good access to the  A145  which connects the village to Beccles and larger  service centres further afield. A 
limited bus service connects the village to Beccles and Southwold and bus stops are connected by public 
footway to the site.   
7.86 The existing village hall is located to the west of the residential area and is separated by th e A145. No safe 
crossing is provided. Adjacent the village hall is the Brampton Bowls Club and an amenity green space. The 
location of these facilities has created a settlement that is devoid of a facility that can function as a 
community focal point in a location that is well related to the residential area and easy to access for 
residents. The intention of the allocation is for the residential development to facilitate delivery of a 
replacement village hall, an equipped play area and a playing pitch. In o ne location, these complementary 
facilities can help create a hub in the village for indoor and outdoor activities.   
7.87 Opposite the site is Brampton Primary School. Development of the site will be required to provide 
footways which connect new dwellings to t he recreational facility and enable safe crossing to the school.  
The footway should also be extended along Southwold Road to connect the site to the existing 
development.  
7.88 By the nature of its rural location, the school has a large catchment. Many pupils a re driven by their 
parents from surrounding villages creating issues with temporary car parking in the vicinity of the primary 
school. A parking area associated with the village hall could provide a solution , if designed with a 
turnaround area as part of t he scheme , to improve road safety.   
7.89 The open space required on the site will be a significant community resource and its design should reflect 
this. Any scheme should be designed so the village hall and the residential properties face onto the 
equipped pla y area and playing field. This will provide natural surveillance of the site. To help integrate the 
community facility with the existing village, one of the open space frontages should face onto Southwold 
Road.   
7.90 There is a risk new development could create  a prominent and exposed settlement edge that could 
adversely affect the rural character of the village. Any scheme should be designed to have a landscaping 
and tree planting scheme that will integrate the development into the surrounding countryside and r etain 
the rural character of the area. Any planting scheme should be designed to utilise existing hedgerows and 
trees that define the historical field boundary patterns and enhance habitats that support biodiversity.   Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 165 7.91 An underground sewerage pipe traverses  the west part of the site while overhead telephone cables are 
also present. Discussions should be had with stakeholders to identify if there are any issues that need to be 
mitigated.  Figure 27 shows  how the uses on the site should be laid out.

166                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP7. 9 – Land S outh of Southwold Road, Brampton  
Land south of Southwold Road, Brampton (3.0 4 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for 
mixed use development including 50 dwellings, replacement village hall and recreational open space.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The resi dential part of the site will take no more than 2.0 hectares of the site area and 
be developed at a density of approximately 25 dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal should be designed to provide a mix of housing types and sizes.  
 A village hall will be pro vided on the site. This is to be located near the primary school. 
As part of the car park design, a turning area should be provided that can be shared with 
the primary school. Covered  cycle parking facilities should  be provided. Car parking 
provided on sit e is not to exceed 24 spaces.  
 An open space of not less than 0.8 hectares is to be provided on site. This will include an 
equipped play space equivalent to a local equipped area for play and an area that can be 
used as a playing pitch and support informal  activities. The open space should be 
adjacent the village hall and be designed to have residential properties facing onto it. 
The open space and village hall area should be designed to have three primary street 
frontages including good visibility from Sou thwold Road.  
 A footway should be extended along Southwold Road to connect the site to the existing 
development to the west.   
 Proposals for the village hall, equipped play area and playing pitch should  be designed 
as part of the masterplan for the entire s ite. These should  be delivered concurrently 
with the residential development.  
 The farm access to the agricultural land located at the north east of the site from 
Southwold Road is to be retained.  
 Hedgerows and trees along the boundary should  be protected  where possible. A 
landscaping and tree planting scheme will be required along the south and east 
boundaries of the site.  
 A Transport Statement should be submitted with any planning application.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be 
required as part of any planning application.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 167 Land at Toodley Farm, Station Road, Brampton  
Residential development  
7.92 The site (0.55  hectares) is located west of Brampton railway station in the central area of the District. The 
site can be accessed from Station Road.  
7.93 The site is in a rural location with limited access to services and facilities. The site is positioned within 
walking di stance of Brampton railway station where train services provide access to Beccles and 
Halesworth and further afield Lowestoft and Ipswich. A bus service operates between Beccles and 
Southwold and stops are located close to the site on Station Road . This pr ovides a choice of transport 
modes for residents and contributes towards rural sustainability. There is currently demand for self build 
plots in the District especially in the countryside. Given this is very close to the rail station it provides an 
opportu nity to accommodate some of this demand in a reasonable sustainable location. The site therefore 
is considered to be appropriate for allocation of 8 self build plots.  
7.94 The railway station could be enhanced with improvements to the car park to encourage peo ple to use the 
station from the surrounding rural area.   
7.95 The site is partly contained within the landscape by residential development to the north and east. The site 
is partially screened by a farm building adjacent to the north west of the site but to the  south and west the 
site is exposed to the open countryside. Landscaping will be required to integrate the development into 
the rural surroundings. West of the site is Shingle Hall which is Grade II listed. This side of the site is 
exposed and landscaping and tree planting should be used to mitigate potential impact on views from the 
Hall.  
Policy WLP7.1 0 – Land at Toodley Farm, Station Road, Brampton  
Land at Toodley Farm,  Station Road,  Brampton  (0.55  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is 
allocated  for a residential development of 8 self build or custom build dwellings.   
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 Trees located along the street frontage should be protected where possible.  
 Landscaping and tr ee planting will be required along the west and south boundary.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as 
part of any planning application.

7.96 Homersfield is a small village in the north west of the District.  
7.97 The village is set within the water meadows of the River Waveney and has a w ealth of heritage assets and 
a conservation a rea. Much of the area is within a flood zone which together with the sensitive historic 
environment means there is little potential for new development in the village. The  main strategy for the 
village will be to protect and enhance the historic environment through the application of Policies WLP 8.37

170                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.98 Ilketshall St Lawrence is of rural character with the A144 dividing the built up area creating two distinct 
residential areas on either side of the road. Some of the built up area also falls within Spexhall parish. 
Residents have access to a primary school, village hall, public house and playing field. The primary service 
centre in the area is Halesworth while public transport provides access to Beccles, Bungay, Halesworth and 
Southwold.  
7.99 The strategy  for Ilketshall St Lawrence is to deliver residential properties to provide a mix of housing 
tenures needed in the area to consolidate the village and avoid the sense of ribbon development along the 
A144. New development will support the primary school and  benefit from good road access to Halesworth 
and Bungay.  
7.100  To accommodate growth in the village localised improvements to the foul sew erage network will be 
required and the primary school will need to expand.  
 
Land South of Hogg Lane, Ilketshall St Lawrence  
Residential development  
7.101  The site (1.76  hectares) is located east of the existing village and will form an extension of the existing built 
up area. The site is currently used for agriculture and can be accessed from Hogg Lane.  
7.102  The site has good access to the main road network and residents are within walking distance of the 
primary school and a bus stop without having to cross the A144. The site is well related to the existing built 
up area and will not create a sense of ribbon development.  
7.103  The village is characterised by low density development and the adjacent residential area has a housing 
density of approximately 14 dwellings per hectare. Considering this, development on this site should have 
a density reflecting the average plot sizes of the surroundin g area . This will enable a scheme to be 
designed that is in keeping with the size of the village and the rural character which presides in the area. A 
landscape scheme within the residential area to provide a sense of openness and complement the rural 
setting should be created.  
7.104  There is no public play space in the village to support the community. An equipped play space equivalent 
to a local equipped area for play or a locally landscaped area for play would support the development and 
have wider community benefits. The type of open space should be decided through discussions wit h the 
local community to identif y how best to meet the needs in the village.  
7.105  The site is partly contained within the landscape by development to the west and existing hedgerows and 
trees around the site. To reduce the potential for creating a prominent settlement edge facing into the 
open countryside, a landscaping scheme will be r equired. Existing hedgerows along the boundary of the 
site should be protected and reinforced where possible to fit in with the small scale surrounding field 
pattern .  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 171 7.106  The agricultural fields located south of the site remain in use. Access to these fields is gained from a farm 
access off Hogg Lane located along the north boundary of the site. Provision will need to be made to 
ensure this access is retained to support the existing farm.  
 
Policy WLP7.1 1 – Land South of Hogg Lane , Ilketshall St Lawrence  
Land s outh of Hogg Lane, Ilketshall St Lawrence  (1.76 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is 
allocated for a residential development of 25 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be d eveloped at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal is to provide a mix of housing sizes.  
 The footway will need to be extended along Hogg Lane and connect into the pedestrian network 
serving the development.  
 The existing farm acc ess off Hogg Lane is to be protected.  
 A play space equivalent to a local equipped area for play  of 0.4 hectares  is to be provided on site.  
 Any proposal should be designed to include landscaping within the site and around the east and 
south boundaries. Existing hedgerows and trees located along the boundaries of the site should  
be protected and reinforced with additional planting where possibl e. A landscaping scheme will be 
required to support any planning application.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as 
part of any planning application.

Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 173 7.107  Lound is a small village of linear character. The settlement is strongly influenced by its rural surroundings 
with the church being the dominant landmark. The pond opposite the Village Mai d pub lic house 
contributes to the setting and character at the north end of the settlement. The location of the village 
enables good vehicular access to services and facilities in Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth while Blundeston 
is located a couple miles to t he south. Community facilities in the village include a village hall, public house, 
café, amenity green space and a bowling green. The village is primarily reliant on services and facilities 
available in Lowestoft and Gorleston, however cycle routes to lar ger settlements in the area are relatively 
poor.   
7.108  The strategy for Lound is to enable a limited amount of development to retain the existing level of 
population of the village in order to support local services without compromising the village’s rural 
char acter. Residents in the area will be supported by employment development in north Lowestoft while 
the village is well positioned for residents of working age to benefit from investment and growth in the 
Great Yarmouth area. To accommodate growth in the vil lage localised improvements to the foul sewerage 
network will be required.  
 
Land East of The Street, Lound  
Residential development  
7.109  The site (0.4 3 hectares) between The Street and Millennium Green is located in the south of Lound. The 
land is fallow and c an be accessed from The Street.  
7.110  The site is small and provides an opportunity to provide a limited number of dwellings in keeping with the 
scale and character of the village. Compared to other areas adjacent to the village the site is well related to 
the existing built up area and contained within the landscape. A quality designed scheme will allow the 
housing to be well related to the historical environment and support the limited facilities in the village.  
7.111  The village is characterised by older, smaller and more traditional terraced properties with larger terraced 
properties having been built at a later date. Nearer the site recent development has included larger 
detached and semi -detached properties that are incompatible with the historical development p attern and 
character of the village. The site is narrow and to make best use of the site and consolidate the residential 
area a linear development extending away from The Street is considered appropriate.  
7.112  Within the village there are issues related to on -street car parking which has an adverse impact on amenity 
and the character of the village. To ensure this is not exacerbated, any development will need to provide 
adequate car parking that does not require vehicles to park on The Street.  
7.113  The site is conta ined within the landscape by residential development to the north and west, St John the 
Baptist Church to the south east and Millennium Green bounds the south side of the site. Hedgerows flank 
the east boundary which provides amenity to the surroundings. T hese hedgerows form part of the green 
infrastructure network providing habitat to support biodiversity along the public right of way between 
Church Lane and Blacksmith’s Loke.  Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
174                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.114  The St John the Baptist Church located to the south east is Grade II* listed. A heritage impact assessment 
will need to be undertaken to identify potential impact on the listed building and its setting and include 
mitigation measures that may be required.  
7.115  The site is in an area of high archaeological sensitivity and potential. An arc haeological field evaluation will 
be required at an appropriate design stage prior to the granting of any planning permission to allow for 
preservation in situ, where appropriate, of any sites of importance that might be defined (and which are 
currently un known) and to allow archaeological preservation or mitigation strategies to be designed.   
 
Policy WLP7.1 2 – Land East of The Street, Lound  
Land east of The Street , Lound (0.4 3 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 10 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 22 dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal should be designed to reflect the older chara cter of the village north of the site 
along The Street.  
 Dwellings  nearest The Street should be set back from the road. The frontage should be 
approximately in line with the rear elevation of the dwelling adjacent the north of the site. 
Properties should ha ve frontages that face onto Millennium Green located to the south.  
 Car parking should be provided on -plot.  
 Hedgerows and trees located along the east boundary and the public right of way should  be 
protected.  
 A landscaping scheme will be required along the  north boundary of the site.  
 A heritage asset assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as part of 
any planning application. Any scheme will need to be designed to mitigate impact on the setting 
of St John the Baptist Church.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as 
part of any planning application.  
 Any planning application is to be supported by the results of a programme of archaeological 
evaluation, including appropriate f ieldwork, and should demonstrate the impacts of development 
on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those impacts.

176                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.116  Within the parish of Mutford there are three distinct clusters of residential development, Chapel Road, 
Church Road and Hulver Road. Each is characterised by its rural setting with the south part of the village 
located within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths A rea of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Community facilities are 
available in the Chapel Road area and consist of a village hall, equipped play area, playing field and a tennis 
court.  
7.117  The Chapel Road and Church Street settlement clusters are most closely relat ed to Carlton Colville  where 
services and facilities are available, while the Hulver Road area  also has good access to the B1127 
providing connections to Beccles. With no public transport available, all residents are reliant on private 
vehicles to access s ervices and facilities.  
7.118  A limited amount of residential development is to take place in the Chapel Road area that will not 
significantly extend into the surrounding countryside , retaining the character of the village. This will help 
maintain the population  of the village and help support local services and facilities. To accommodate 
growth in the village localised improvements to the foul sewerage network will be required.  
 
Land N orth of Chapel Road, Mutford  
Residential development  
7.119  The site (0.32  hectares) is located on the east fringe of the residential cluster based around Chapel Road 
and Mill Road  just outside of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . The land is used for agriculture and 
can be accessed from Chapel Road.  
7.120  The site will enable a small number of dwellings to be provided in a location that is contained in the 
landscape and well related to existing development on Chapel Road. The site has good access to 
community facilities on Mill Road.  
7.121  The residential area opposite has a housing  density of approximately 15 dwellings per hectare. Dwellings 
located in the area to the west are characterised by a mix of two storey dwellings and single storey 
bungalows with large  sized plots relative to the footprint size of the buildings. North of th e site there are 
two storey semi -detached dwellings and adjacent the south boundary of the site is a 1.5 storey dwelling 
and some agricultural buildings. Dwelling frontages are set back from the road and off -street parking is 
provided.  
7.122  To the east, south a nd west the site is contained within the landscape by existing development. The site is 
exposed to the open countryside to the north  and is located close to the Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty . To integrate development into the surroundings landscaping such as tree planting will be required 
to reduce the likelihood of creating a prominent settlement edge. Along the street frontage hedgerows 
should be protected except where needed for the provision of access.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 177 7.123  The site has a high potential for archaeolo gy and any planning application must be supported by the 
results of a programme of archaeological evaluation, including appropriate fieldwork, and should 
demonstrate the impacts of development on archaeological remains and proposals for managing those 
impa cts.  
 
Policy WLP7.13 – Land N orth of Chapel Road, Mutford  
Land north of Chapel Road, Mutford  (0.32  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 6 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the f ollowing site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Development should consist of 3 pairs of semi -detached dwellings.   
 Car parking should be p rovided on -plot to the side of the dwellings.  
 Hedgerows along the front of the site should be protected except where their removal is required 
for access drives.  
 A landscaping scheme should be prepared to integrate the site within the landscape.

Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 179 7.124  Ringsfield is located to the south west of Beccles. The area is characterised by its rural setting and flat open 
fields that surround the village. Within the settlement there is a primary school, village hall, public house 
and an equipped play area alongside the playing field. The village is located close to Beccles wh ich provides 
an array of services and facilities which are accessible using public transport and a good road network in 
the vicinity.  
7.125  The strategy for Ringsfield is to enable development which supports the existing services and facilities in 
the village an d which reflects the character of the area. A mix of housing tenures will enable choice in the 
market and help meet any local housing needs. Future development in the south of Beccles and 
employment in the Ellough area will provide employment opportunities  for people living in the wider area.  
7.126  To accommodate the new development planned in Ringsfield, the Ringsfield Primary School will need to 
expand by at least 5 places. Localised improvements to the foul sewerage network will also be required. 
New developme nt will be able to support improvements to and refurbishment work to the Ringsfield 
Village Hall. New development will also help deliver improvements to the village’s tennis courts and 
improvements to the playing field as identified in the Playing Pitch As sessment (2014).  
 
Land North of School Road , Ringsfield  
Residential development  
7.127  The site (2.56 hectares) is located at the west end of the village. The site is used for agriculture and can be 
accessed from School Road.  
7.128  This is the only site proposed in Ringsfield and provides an opportunity to deliver new housing to support 
the community. The potential for development to have an adverse impact on the landscape and character 
of the settlement is low. The site is well connected to the road network and a re gular bus service provides 
access to Beccles where services and facilities are available. The bus stops are accessible by public 
footway. The site is located opposite the primary school and community facilities including the village hall, 
public house , sports pitch facilities and equipped play area are within walking distance.  
7.129  The adjacent residential area has a hou sing density of approximately 15  dwellings per hectare. Given the 
very rural location of this site  on the edge of the settlement, a slightly low er density would be appropriate 
to help mitigate the impacts of the development . There should be a good mix of dwelling sizes on the site 
including terraced, semi -detached and detached properties. All properties should have generous front and 
back gardens,  and space should be provided for landscaping on street frontages.  
7.130  The school’s rural location means many pupils are driven in by car.  As such, c ar parking and congestion has 
become a serious issue in the area during school drop -off and pick -up times. This  site provides an 
opportunity to deliver car parking opposite the primary school to help mitigate these issues.  
7.131  A footpath should connect this site to the  existing development north of S chool Road.  Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
180                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.132  The site is exposed to the open countryside along its no rth and west boundaries. There are low level 
hedgerows along these boundaries but these are fragmented in places. New development could create a 
prominent and exposed settlement edge adversely affecting the rural surroundings. New development 
should theref ore be integrated into the countryside using a quality landscaping scheme to reinforce 
existing hedgerows and use tree planting along the north boundary to enhance the existing wooded area 
located east of the site. This will provide screening and improve c onnectivity within the green 
infrastructure network and benefit biodiversity.   
 
Policy WLP7.1 4 – Land N orth of School Road, Ringsfield  
Land north of School Road, Ringsfield (2.56 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential de velopment of 30 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal is to provide a mix of housing sizes and types .  
 A landscaped car park of at least 24 spaces must be provided on the site opposite the primary 
school.  
 The footway on the north side of School Road should be extended to connect the site to the 
existing development.  
 Hedgerows and trees located along the  north and west boundaries should  be protected and 
reinforced with additional planting. A landscaping scheme will be required to support any planning 
application.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as 
part of any planning application.

182                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  7.133  Rumburgh is a small rural community located in the west of the District, an area characterised by small 
dispersed settlements and a strong rural character. The settlement is focused around two areas linked by 
linear development along The Street. The larger  of the two areas supports a public house and an equipped 
play area while a cricket pitch is located south of the village. These facilities support nearby communities in 
a relatively quiet part of the District.  
7.134  A limited amount of residential development in Rumburgh will help maintain the population of the village 
and support the local public house. To accommodate growth in the village localised improvements to the 
foul sewerage network will be required.  
 
Land East of Mill Road, Rumburgh  
Residential development  
7.135  The site (1.40 hectares) is located in the west part of the village. The site is used for agriculture and can be 
accessed from The Street and Mill Road.  
7.136  This is the only allocation in Rumburgh. The west part of the village is very rural in cha racter and low levels 
of development are expected to come forward during the plan period. This site provides an opportunity to 
deliver a limited amount of housing in a rural location which will help consolidate the village and provide a 
central amenity are a to complement the playing field.  
7.137  The adjacent residential area has a housing density of approximately 10 dwellings per hectare. The rural 
location and size of the village means that a similar density should be achieved on this site. This lower 
density s hould not be achieved at the expense of the provision of smaller properties on the site. Dwelling 
frontages should follow The Street and Mill Road and footpaths should be provided along these frontages. 
Adequate space should be given to landscaping and fro nt and rear gardens. Landscaping should retain the 
sense of openness in this part of the village and include the provision of an amenity space in the north 
west corner of the site , at a prominent road junction . Adjacent the north east corner of the recreat ion area 
are the Pleasure Ground Cottages. These buildings are Grade II listed. While most of the development in 
the immediate surroundings is modern the recreation area contributes towards the setting of these listed 
buildings. Open space on the north wes t corner of the site will therefore further benefit the setting of the 
area and the village more generally . 
7.138  The site is exposed to the east. To reduce the potential for a prominent settlement edge exposed to the 
open countryside a landscaping scheme will b e required. Hedgerows are present along the boundaries of 
the site and should be protected and reinforced where possible. This will help retain the low density  rural 
character of the village.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Strategy for Rural Areas

Land east of Mill Road, Rumburgh (1.40 hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 10  dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 10  dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal is to provide a mix of housing sizes and types.  
 The frontages of the dwellings should follow The Street and Mill Road. Footpaths should be 
provided along these frontages.  
 Any proposal should be desig ned to include a landscaped amenity space at the north west of the 
site fronting onto the road opposite the existing play area. This is to be supported with 
landscaping within the site.  
 Hedgerows and trees located along the boundaries of the site should be  protected and reinforced

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 185 7.139  Willingham  lies within the parishes of both Shadingfield and Willingham  St Mary . It is situated in the open 
countryside and located on the A145 providing connections to Beccles, the primary service centre for the 
village. The A145 divides the village in two with the village hall on one side and recreational facilities on the 
other. E xisting facilities in the village include a village hall, public house, basic equipped play area and a 
playing field. A limited bus service is available and the nearest railway station (Brampton) is located 
approximately two miles to the west.  
7.140  The strateg y for the village is to provide a limited amount of development as well as a mix of housing types 
to retain the social structure in the village. Development will be contained within the surrounding 
landscape and reflect the character of the existing built up area.  
7.141  To accommodate growth in the village localised improvements to the foul sewerage network will be 
required. An extension to the primary school in Brampton will accommodate children from the new 
development.  
 
Land East of Woodfield Close, Willingh am 
Residential development  
7.142  The site (0.57 hectares) is located east of the existing built up area. The site is used for agriculture and can 
be accessed from Woodfield Close.  
7.143  The site is well contained within the landscape and is well related to the existing built up area. A bus stop is 
located nearby and community facilities are within walking distance. The site is suitable for small scale 
development in an attractive setting.  Compared to other potential sites in the village, development at this 
location will not adversely affect the character of the settlement and has potential to deliver a small 
number of dwellings to support the community.  
7.144  The site is elongated and well con tained by its surroundings. A scheme should be designed to ensure it is 
not isolated from the village. The most appropriate access to the site is from Woodfield Close, however, 
any scheme design will need to consider how the dwelling(s) located at the nort hern end relate to 
Sotterley Road.  
7.145  Woodfield Close is a shared surface with no footways. The existing pedestrian network extends along 
Sotterley Road and connects to Woodfield Close. To improve access to the site the footway along Sot terley 
Road should be extended .  Strategy for Rural Areas  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

The site should be developed in acco rdance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Any proposal is to provide a mix of housing sizes. The size of the building footprint relative to the 
size of the plot shou ld reflect development located to the north.  
 A landscaping scheme should be prepared to integrate the site within the landscape.  
 A footway will be required to connect the development to the existing pedestrian network  along 
Sotterley Road . 
 A completed ec ological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as

a playing field. The public house located in the 
village is currently closed and for sale. Larger 
service centres with services and facilities are 
located several miles in each direction with 
connectio ns provided along the A145 to Beccles and to Bungay and Halesworth via the A144. A bus service 
links the village with Beccles and Halesworth and Brampton railway  station is located a mile to the north 
which provides connections to Lowestoft and Ipswich.  
7.148  Development  at a density in keeping with the character of the existing built up area will support facilities 
within the village and provide housing tenures required to meet housing need in the community. To 
accommodate growth in the village localised improve ments to the foul sewerage network will be required.  
 
Land West of Lock’s Road, Westhall  
Residential  development  
7.149  The site ( 0.97  hectares) is located in the east part of the village. The land is used for agriculture and can be 
access ed from Lock’s Road.   
7.150  The site is well related to the existing built up area. The re is good access to the site.  It is adjacent the 
village recreation area and reasonably contained within the wider landscape. The allocation is of a density  
that reflects the rest of the village a nd will provide new housing to support a rural community where little 
development has taken place in recent years.  
7.151  The adjacent residential area has a housing density of approximately 17 dwellings per hectare. This part of 
the village is characterised by two stor ey terraced and semi -detached dwellings facing north and west. 
Development on this site should reflect the density, scale and massing of surrounding development. The 
village is rural in character and this contributes towards the setting of many of the existing dwellings. Over 
development of the site would be inappropriate and potentially have an adverse impact on this rural 
character. Low density development is reflective of the infrastructure constraints including water, 
sewerage and broadband that  exist in the village.  
7.152  The village hall, allotments and the recreation ground are located adjacent to the site. The recreation 
ground is not well overlooked by residential properties and new development provides an opportunity to

Properties should be designed to face onto the recreation ground.  
7.153  Development will be exposed to the open countryside when viewed from the north and there is potential 
for a prominent and exposed settlement edge to be created if a scheme is not supported with a quality 
landscaping scheme. Any scheme will be required to have a landscaping scheme that protects existing 
hedgerows and uses hedgerow reinforcement and tree plantin g to provide screening and integrate the site 
into the rural surroundings.  
Policy WLP7. 17 – Land West of Lock's Road, Westhall  
Land west of  Lock’s Road, Westhall ( 0.97  hectares) as identified on the Policies Map is allocated for a 
residential development of 18 dwellings.  
The site should be developed in accordance with the following site specific criteria:  
 The site will be developed at a density of approximately 20 dwellings per hectare.  
 Dwellings should  be of a scale and have a plot size reflective of exis ting properties located on 
Wangford Road and Lock’s Road.  
 Any scheme is to be designed to have residential properties facing onto the recreation ground 
located to the west of the site.  
 Hedgerows and trees located along the site boundaries should  be protected and reinforced where 
possible. A landscaping scheme will be required to provide screening along the north east 
boundary of the site.  
 A completed ecological assessment undertaken by a suitably qualified person will be required as 
part of any p lanning application.  
 A planning application will need to be supported by a surface water drainage strategy.

Planning Policies  
Housing  
8.1 The National Planning Policy Framework requires local planning authorities to deliver a wide choice of high 
quality homes to meet the full, objectively assessed needs for market and affordable housing within the 
housing market area over the plan period. Local planning authorities should plan for a wide choice of 
homes based on current and future demographic and migration trends, market trends and the needs of 
different groups within the community in order to widen opportunities for home ownership and create 
inclusive and mixed communities.   
8.2 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) is a key piece of evidence  in assessing housing need and 
planning for housing delivery. The assessment has been carried out with Babergh, Mid Suffolk and Suffolk 
Coastal District Councils and Ipswich Borough Council. The assessment identifies the need for affordable 
housing and the  type and mix of housing required to meet the needs of the housing market area.   
 
Housing Mix  
8.3 The National Planning Policy Framework requires local planning authorities to identify the size, type and 
range of housing required. The National Planning Practic e Guidance states that once identified, the 
objectively assessed need should be broken down by household size and type.  
8.4 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) applies a model to provide this break down of sizes and 
types of housing. A key finding was the nee d for smaller units across the D istrict in the form of 1 and 2 
bedroom properties. The assessment identified that across all tenures at least 35 -40% of new housing 
should be 1 or 2 bed properties. This is consistent with the finding s of the prev ious Strategic Housing 
Market Assessment which confirms a long term need for more smaller properties. Previous Local Plan 
policies have required between 30% and 40% of new units to be 1 or 2 bed and monitoring through the 
Authority  Monitoring Report sugges ts this approach has been successful. Provision of smaller properties in 
rural areas is particularly important given affordability problems and under -occupancy of existing 
properties.  
8.5 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) provides a useful starti ng point for the consideration of 
the size and types of dwellings to be provided. However, needs can change and vary from site to site as 
local requirements change. There also may be a particular market demand for certain types of property in 
a specific lo cation. Therefore, some flexibility is required. It is therefore advisable for developers to have 
pre-application discussions with the local planning authority to help determine the exact mix of properties 
on a development site.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 193 8.6 Policy WLP8.1 sets out the  Council’s approach to securing a mix of dwellings on development sites. It 
requires at least 35% of dwellings to be 1 or 2 bed dwellings, and requires consideration of the findings of 
the Strategic Housing Market Assessment.  
8.7 The Strategic Housing Market A ssessment also identified the need for different types of specialist housing 
including, sheltered housing and extra care housing. The Strategic H ousing Market Assessment identified a  
potential  need for 1,197 sheltered and extra care housing.  The Strategic Housing Market Assessment also 
identifies a need for 905 additional spaces in care homes and nursing homes over the plan period.  Larger 
sites, which are often developed by a number of developers, provide an opportunity to help deliver this 
need through the  provision of a retirement community. The affordable housing policy (Policy WLP8.2) 
requires a proportion of affordable housing to be of this type. Given the growing market for this type of 
product it is likely that the market will deliver this type of hou sing on some of the other sites allocated in 
this Local Plan.  
8.8 Neighbourhood Plans may identify specific localised needs for certain types of dwellings  where supported 
by evidence which is consistent with the methodology and findings of the Strategic Housi ng Market 
Assessment . Neighbourhood Plans can take a  more detailed approach to housing mix and type to that set 
out in Policy WLP8.1.  
Policy WLP8.1 – Housing Mix  
The mix of sizes and types of units on any particular site should be based on evidence of loc al needs 
including the Strategic Housing Market Assessment and in consultation with the local planning authority.  
Proposals for new residential developments will be permitted where at least 35% of new dwellings on the 
site are 1 or 2 bedroom properties.  
Neighbourhood Plans can set out  a more detailed approach to housing type and mix which reflect s local 
circumstances  and is supported by evidence .

194                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Affordable Housing  
8.9 House prices in Waveney continue to grow and remain high compared to average household incomes. This 
means housing is unaffordable to many people in the District.  
8.10 Affordable housing is defined by the National Planning Policy Framework as social rented, af fordable 
rented and intermediate housing  (including shared ownership, shared equity and discounted homes for 
sale) , provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. Starter homes are a type of 
affordable housing made exclusively avail able at 80% of market value to first time buyers under the age of 
40, who often have difficulty in buying their own home.  
8.11 The National Planning Policy Framework requires Local Planning Authorities to plan to meet the full 
objectively assessed need for aff ordable housing. The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (2017) 
calculates the affordable housing need in Waveney to be 208 dwellings per year. This amou nts to 55% of 
the total annual need for housing . The Whole Plan Viability Assessment (2018) demonstrate s that this level  
of affordable housing would make  housing developments financially unviable . An affordable housing 
requirement  which is harmful to viability is likely to create a barrier to development and impede delivery 
of any type of housing , or underm ine the delivery of key infrastructure by reducing the amount of funds 
developers can contribute towards infrastructure . The Council has over allocated sites for housing in this 
Local Plan to help address this need. Furthermore , Policy WLP8.6 also allows  affordable housing schemes 
in the Countryside where residential development would not normally be permitted.  
8.12 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment provides further guidance on the type of affordable housing 
needed. The study indicates that 50% of afforda ble housing should be affordable rented, 30% should be 
shared ownership and 20% should be Starter Homes  (discounted homes for sale) . Policy WLP8.2 applies 
this breakdown  but provides flexibility with respect to the overall tenure balance for intermediate t enures 
(shared ownership and starter homes) .  
 
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 195 8.13 The National Planning Practice Guidance states that affordable housing can only be a requirement  on 
schemes above 10 units.  
8.14 The Whole Plan Viability Assessment identifies differences across the District  in how much affordable 
housing  a development could provide whilst remaining financially viable. The assessment finds  Lowestoft is 
the least viable part of the District  and developments can generally provide 20% of dwellings as affordable 
housing . Southwol d and Reydon is the most viable area and developments can provide 40%. The 
remaining parts of the District  are able to provide 30% affordable housing  whilst remaining viable.   
Figure 35 Affordable housing areas  
 
8.15 As the requirement  for affordable housing, together with other policy requirements and the level of 
community infrastructure levy have been thoroughly tested at the plan making stage, it is considered that 
sites will be able to viably meet the requirements of the policy.  In exceptional circumstances , some sites 
may not be able to  viably deliver affordable housing to levels required . This could be d ue to changes in the 
housing market and the overall economy  or unforeseen , abnormal costs. Policy WLP 8.2 therefore allows , 
in exc eptional circumstances , for a reduction or variation in affordable housing requirements to ensure 
development remains viable  and the housing supply overall is not threatened . In these circumstances, a 
comprehensive viability assessment will be required whi ch is in line with the d etailed guidance on the 
assessment of viability in Appendix 5.  These viability assessments will not be kept confidential except in 
District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
196                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  exceptional circumstances.  Before reducing the overall provision of affordable housing, the tenure an d 
type of affordable housing should be first adjusted to secure viability.  
8.16 Irrespective of viability, r eductions in affordable housing provision on sites which are not allocated in this 
Local Plan or a Neighbourhood Plan and which do not make up part of t he five year supply of housing, will 
not be permitted. These schemes may be sufficiently viabl e and able to  provide affordable housing if 
brought forward at a later date . If there is no need for development at the time of application (due to the 
provision of a five year supply of housing) there would often be little benefit of the development coming 
forward early without affordable housing.  Some unallocated site s may have  wider susta inability benefits 
(for example the redevelopment of long -term derelict sit es, or proposals for enabling development).  In 
these cases, where a comprehensive viability assessment in line with the guidance in Appendix 5 is 
submitted, which demonstrates the site is not viable in the present market, a reduction or variation in the 
level of affordable housing may be permitted.   
8.17 Affordable housing should preferably be provided on the site in order to create mixed communities. 
However, exceptionally on smaller sites , it may be preferable for a commuted sum to be paid for provision 
elsewh ere in the locality.  
8.18 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment identifies a significant need for new sheltered accom modation 
and extra -care housing . Policy WLP8.2 therefore states these types of housing should be provided as part 
of the affordable housing pr ovision where  there is a local need and where practicable.  
8.19 Neighbourhood Plans may identify specific localised needs for affordable housing. Where local evidence 
has been prepared of affordable housing need and viability, Neighbourhood Plans can require a  higher 
proportion of affordable housing to be provided to that set out in Policy WLP8.2.   
 
Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 197 Policy WLP8.2 – Affordable Housing  
All new housing developments on sites with a capacity of 11 dwellings or more must make provision for a 
proportion of the total dwellings to be affordable housing  as follows:   
 Housing developments in the Lowestoft  and Kessingland area (excluding Corton) must provide a 
minimum of 20% affordable housing ; 
 Housing developments in the Southwold and Reydon area  must provide a minimum of 4 0% 
affordable housing;   
 Housing developments in the remainder of the District  must provide a minimum of 30% 
affordable housing;  
Of these affordable dwellings, 50% should be for affordable rent  and 50% should be for intermediate 
tenures including shared own ership and discounted homes for sale . Sheltered and extra -care housing 
should be included as affordable units where needed and where practicable.  
Affordable housing should be preferably delivered on the site  as part of a mixed tenure scheme. 
Exceptionally,  on smaller sites, it may be agreed between the local planning authority and the developer 
for a commuted sum to be paid towards the provision of affordable housing elsewhere.  
Affordable housing should be indistinguishable from market housing in terms of the location, external 
appearance, design, standards and build quality and should meet all requirements of the design policies.  
In exceptional circumstances t he level and tenure of affordable housing may be varied where it can be 
satisfactorily demonstrate d through the preparation of a viability assessment in line with the guidance in 
Appendix 5, that a different tenure mix or lower percentages of affordable housing are required to ensure 
the site remains financially viable. Affordable housing provision wil l only be reduced on sites which are 
necessary to the overall supply of housing in the District unless the scheme has wider sustainability 
benefits.  
Neighbourhood Plans can set out higher requirements for affordable housing provision where local 
evidence o f need and viability support this.

198                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Self Build and C ustom Build  
8.20 Self build and custom build housing is currently under represented in the housing market in Waveney and 
England as a whole. Self build projects are defined as those where someone directly organises the design 
and construction of their own home. This covers a wide range of projects including a traditional DIY self 
build home to projects where the self builder employs someone to build their home for them. Community -
led projects can also be defined as self build. Custom build homes are where a person works with a 
developer as an individual or a group to help provide their  own home. The developer may help to find a 
plot, manage the construction and arrange the finance for the new home. This is more of a hands -off 
approach but the home is tailored to match the individual ’s requirements.  
8.21 Self build and custom build housing can help increase the supply and variety of housing on the mark et. It 
can also improve the overall design quality of new housing. As such the Government is keen to promote 
the sector. The National Planning Policy Framework states that Local Planning Authorities should plan for 
the needs of people wishing to build thei r own homes. The Self Build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 
requires Local Planning Authorities to keep a register of people who are interested in building their own 
homes. The Housing and Planning Act 2016 places a duty on Authorities to grant permissio n for sufficient 
serviced plots  to meet demand evidenced by the register.  
8.22 There are currently 127 people  and 1 group  on the register in Waveney. Policy WLP8.3 sets out the 
Council’s approach to encouraging self build and custom build developments. In orde r to meet the need 
identified above, 5% of plots  on all sites above 100 units should be made available for self build or custom 
build housing. Based on the sites allocated in this Local Plan, this will deliver approximately 260 serviced 
plots over the life time of the Plan. This will meet the need of the existing people on the register plus 
potential future additions to the register. Where  serviced  self build or custom build plots are made 
available on a site and are not taken up after a minimum of  12 months , the developer will be free to build 
out these plots themselves. The plots should be marketed in accordance with the marketing principles set 
out in Appendix 4 and the minimum 12 month marketing period should not start before the plots are 
serviced and de velopment can commence.  The Policy also supports solely self build and custom build 
developments where they are in conformity with the other  relevant  policies of this plan.   
8.23 Self and custom builders should be able to design and build their homes to their o wn requirements. This 
will create individual homes and can foster creative and innovative designs, where this is desired. Where 
groups of self or custom build plots come forward it is important that the individual designs contribute 
positively to their sur roundings and there is a degree of coherence in the design and appearance of the 
group. As such, where groups of plots are concerned, a design code should be agreed which establishes 
some design principles to which each plot should adhere , whilst still all owing for freedom and creativity for 
individual plots. This will also provide greater certainty for self and custom builders that their individual 
designs will be granted permission. Design codes can address matters such as building heights; massing; 
posit ion on plot; plot coverage; materials palett e; landscaping; parking; and waste management amongst 
others. Proposals of five plots and above should have a design code in place agreed with the Local Planning 
Authority.   Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 199 Policy WLP8.3 – Self Build and Custom Build  
Proposals that would make a proportion of serviced dwelling p lots available for sale to self builders or 
custom builders will be supported where in compliance with all other  relevant  policies of this Local Plan.  
Developments of 100 or more dwellings will be expected to provide a minimum of 5% self or custom build 
properties on site  through the provision of serviced plots. Once completed and available for development, 
the serviced plots should  be marketed for a period of not less than 12 months. Marketing should be in 
accordance with the principles set out in Appendix 4. If, following this period, any of the serviced plots 
remain unsold, they may be built out by the developer.  
Proposals for 5 o r more self build or custom build dwellings in a single site location should be developed in 
accordance with a set of design principles to be submitted with any application and agreed by the Local 
Planning Authority.

200                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Conversion of Properties to Flats  
8.24 Conversion of larger properties to flats and 
smaller units can provide much needed smaller 
units of accommodation. However, where high 
concentrations of conversions to flats or houses 
in multiple occupation have taken place this can 
bring about amenity is sues. These include on 
street parking, bin storage and increased levels of 
activity and disturbance. In some cases high 
numbers of flats can be associated with low levels 
of owner occupation which can result in lower 
maintenance standards and environmental  decline. The cumulative conversion of larger dwellings to flats 
can reduce the number of larger family dwellings in an area which can result in unbalanced communities.  
8.25 Some areas of Lowestoft  have been subject to high numbers of flat conversions and are c onsidered to be 
at saturation point when considering the above issues. In these areas further conversions should be 
resisted. The point at which saturation occurs will vary according to historical and local characteristics of 
the street, but 20% of propert ies converted to flats has been held to be a general guide.   
Policy WLP8.4 – Conversion of Properties to Flats  
Flat Saturation Zones are identified on the Policies Map.  
No further conversions to self -contained flats/houses in multiple occupation will be pe rmitted in Flat 
Saturation Zones on Lyndhurst Road, part of Denmark Road, part of London Road South and part of Kirkley 
Cliff Road, Grosvenor Road, Cleveland Road and Windsor Road where saturation levels are exceeded.  
Outside the Flat Saturation Zones plan ning permission will be granted for conversion of existing buildings 
to fully self -contained accommodation where the saturation figure for the street does not exceed 20% and 
residential properties are above average size (i.e. ab ove 160sqm original gross fl oorspace and include at 
least 5 bedrooms), no longer suited to family occupation or have a long established use (i.e. 10 years or 
more) as a House in Multiple Occupation or flats. The property should be located in a commercial, mixed 
use or other area clos e to services and facilities, be able to meet existing standards for parking, amenity 
areas, refuse bin storage and sound insulation and have no significant detrimental impacts to adjoining 
family houses.  
Exceptional circumstances will need to be demonstra ted for the conversion to Houses in Multiple 
Occupation or bedsits, as opposed to self -contained flats, to be permitted.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 201 Gypsies and Travellers  
8.26 Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (2015) emphasizes the need for Local Planning Authorities to use their 
own evidence to plan positively for gypsy and traveller needs. Waveney District Council along with 
Babergh, Mid Suffolk and Suffolk Coastal District Councils and Ipswich Borough Council have commissioned 
a Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommo dation Assessment. This identifies a requirement 
for 17 additional pitches  for gypsies and travellers in Waveney  over the period 2016 -2036.  
8.27 The Planning Policy for Traveller Sites defines gypsies and travellers as: “Persons of nomadic habit of life 
whateve r their race or origin, including such persons who on grounds only of their own or their family’s or 
dependants’ educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excluding 
members of an organised group of travelling showpeople or circus people travelling together as such” . 
8.28 Policy WLP8.5 sets out a criteria based policy to support the development and extension of gypsy and 
traveller sites. Given the differing accommodation needs and limited potential for development within 
built up areas, the Policy allows for development of gypsy and traveller sites within the Countryside where 
residential development would not normally be permitted. However, there should still be good access to 
services and facilities and limited impact on the l ocal character of the area. The impact on the landscape 
should be assess ed using policy WLP8.35  Landscape Character, especially where rural sites are involved.  
8.29 Neighbourhood Plans can positively allocate new sites for gypsy and travellers to help accommoda te local 
needs.  
Policy WLP8.5 – Gypsy and Traveller Sites  
New sites to meet the accommodation needs of gypsies and travellers will be permitted within Settlement 
Boundaries and within the Countryside where:  
 The site will provide accommodation for gypsies and travellers, as defined in Planning 
Policy for Traveller Sites (August 2015 and any updates);  
 Schools, services and shops are within easy travelling distance, preferably by foot, cycle 
or public transport;  
 The site is (or can be) served by adequate wate r and sewerage connections;  
 The site is not located within Flood Zones 2 or 3;  
 There will be no adverse impact on the amenity of nearby residents or operations of 
adjoining land users; and  
 The development respects the scale of and does not dominate the nearest settled 
community and avoids placing an undue pressure on local infrastructure.  
Neighbourhood Plans can allocate new sites for gypsy and travellers to help accommodate local needs.

202                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Affordable Housing in the Countryside  
8.30 Housing development in r ural areas in recent times has been constrained to protect the intrinsic quality of 
the countryside and promote sustainable patterns of movement. However, there is significant demand to 
live in villages across the Country. The desirability of the countrysi de as a place to live, together with low 
supply of new premises means that house prices in the rural areas are higher than the District average. 
This means that homes in rural areas can be unaffordable for existing residents which can then undermine 
family  and social networks.  
8.31 This Local Plan aims to allocate a greater proportion of housing in general to the rural areas. This new 
housing will include an element of affordable housing in line with Policy WLP8.2. However, in some 
circumstances this may not be  enough to meet local need which can change frequently over time. 
Additionally, not enough affordable housing will be delivered through Policy WLP8.2 to meet needs. 
Although the Local Plan allows for extra windfall development within settlement boundaries of villages, 
there are unlikely to be opportunities of a scale which will deliver affordable housing.  
8.32 The National Planning Policy Framework encourages Councils to allow for small scale developments of 
affordable housing in the countryside on the edge of villages to meet local affordable housing need. This 
land would generally otherwise be unsuitable for residential development. This therefore lowers the land 
value and makes solely affordable housing schemes more viable. To further support viability, the 
Framework supports the provision of a small amount of market housing on these sites where necessary. 
These proposals are commonly referred to as rural exception sites.  
8.33 Policy WLP8.6 allows for affordable housing schemes in the Countryside adjacent to villa ges. Proposals 
must meet an identified local need by accommodating households who are either current residents, have 
existing family connections to the area or have employment reasons for being in the area. This will 
preferably be in the form of a local ho using needs assessment. Developers are encouraged to work closely 
with the Council’s Housing team to ensure appropriate evidence is provided with any planning application.  
Affordable housing provision on exception sites should have a tenure mix which  is reflective of local 
housing needs identified in the local housing needs assessment.  
8.34 Affordable housing on exception sites can be provided by many different providers including the Council, 
housing association s and housing cooperatives. Affordable housing could also be provided by self  build co -
operatives providing it is secured as affordable  housing in perpetuity. If self build affordable housing takes 
the form of low -impact development where there is limited or benign environmental impact due to the 
materials used, management of land and lack of provision for motorised vehicles, the requirements for the 
development to be a djacent to a village could be relaxed.  
8.35 Affordable housing proposals may contain an element of market housing to facilitate their delivery. A 
proposal should start from a position of 100% affordable housing with any market housing element being 
justified o n the basis of a viability assessment  which is prepared in accordance with the guidance in

Policy WLP8.6 – Affordable Housing in t he Countryside  
Proposals for the development of affordable housing in the Countryside will be permitted where:  
 It is demonstrated there is an identified local need for affordable housing and this 
cannot be met through existing housing allocations in the Lo cal Plan or relevant 
Neighbourhood Plan;  
 The scheme is adjacent to Corton, a Larger Village, a Smaller Village or other rural 
settlements within the Countryside;  
 The scheme incorporates a range of dwelling sizes, types and tenures appropriate to the 
ident ified local need;  
 The location, scale and design standard of a scheme will retain or enhance the character 
and setting of the settlement.  
A limited amount of market housing will be permitted as part of affordable housing developments in the 
Countryside whe re it is required to cross -subsidise the affordable housing. Where market housing is to be 
provided on site this will be subsidiary to the affordable housing element of the proposal and the amount 
of market housing required will need to be demonstrated thr ough a viability assessment  in accordance 
with the guidance in Appendix 5 . The amount of market housing on the site should be no more than one 
third of dwellings on the site.  
Where exception sites are brought forward with an element of market housing, both  housing tenures 
should be built to the same design standards which contribute towards the character of the area. Market 
housing should be reflective of the size of the affordable dwellings proposed on the site.

204                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Small Scale Residential Development in the Countryside  
8.37 Approximately 10% of new housing to be delivered in the rural areas of the District is to be located in 
settlements within the Countryside. Small scale developments can support communities by delivering 
housing types and sizes that are need ed locally and provide opportunities for members of the existing 
community to live nearby and retain their social connections. The National Planning Policy Framework 
advises against isolated dwellings in the Countryside. However, there are occasions where small scale 
development could occur which could provide social and economic benefits to the Countryside, with 
limited impacts on the environment or character of the area. Policy W LP8.7 therefore is intended to 
provide a limited amount of housing in the Cou ntryside . However, it is not intended to enable 
development that will adversely affect the intrinsic character of a settlement or the surrounding 
landscape.   
8.38 Policy WLP8.7 allows for small scale development of up to three homes within clearly identifiable small 
gaps in a built up frontage, on land which is surrounded by residential development (including its curtilage) 
on two sides (including the opposite side of the highway). This approach allows for development which 
does not encroach further into the cou ntryside and is enclosed by surrounding residential dwellings , 
therefore limiting the effect on the landscape and character of the area.  
8.39 The strategy set out in Policy WLP7.1 allows for small sites for housing to be developed in other rural 
settlements in the Countryside through Neighbourhood Plans or Neighbourhood Development Orders. For 
some small Parish Councils or Parish Meetings, Neighbourhood Plans or Development Orders may not be a 
feasible option due to lack of resources. Therefore, Policy WLP8.7 a lso allows for small scale development 
of up to five homes on the edge of these settlements where there is demonstrable public support.  
8.40 In assessing whether there is demonstrable public support, planning applications should be supported by 
evidence of pre -application consultation which shows that there is genuine support from the local 
community and the Parish Council or Parish Meeting. Any relevant concerns raised by the community or 
the Parish Council or Parish Meeting should be addressed by the develope r. If during the consultation 
stage of the planning application, planning objections are raised by the community, the application should 
be amended to address any relevant concerns. If all planning concerns raised by the community and the 
Parish Council or  Parish Meeting have not been addressed the application will not be supported. To ensure 
the overall strategy for the District and the rural areas is met, the Council will not support development 
which cumulatively, when considered against other developmen ts within the Countryside, would 
undermine the overall distribution of development set out in Policies WLP1.1 and WLP7.1.  
8.41 Sites suitable for small scale development provide opportunities for custom and self build dwellings. 
Where these are of good design and in keeping with the surrounding properties and character of the area 
they will be supported.   
8.42 The design of all small scale developments in the Countryside will need to respect and respond to the local 
context and character of the area as detailed in D esign Policy WLP8.29. Proposals should take into 
consideration the impact on the character and setting of the existing settlement and the landscape in line 
with Policy WLP8.35.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 205 Policy WLP8.7 – Small Scale Residential Development in the Countryside  
Small sc ale residential development in the Countryside of up to three dwellings will be permitted where:  
 The site constitutes  a clearly identifiable gap within a built up area  of a settlement 
within the Countryside ;  
 There are existing residential properties on two sides of the site; and  
 The development does not extend further into the undeveloped Countryside than the 
existing extent of the built up area surrounding the site.  
 
Small scale residential development in the Countryside of up to and including five dwelli ngs will also be 
permitted where:  
 There is clear and demonstrable local support;  
 The scheme demonstrates meaningful and robust consultation with the Parish Council, 
local community and other stakeholders;  
 Following consultation, it can be demonstrated that  any planning impacts identified by 
the local community have been fully addressed and therefore the scheme is supported 
by the community;  
 The site is adjacent or wi thin the built up area of the settlement  within the Countryside ; 
and 
 The scheme when considered cumulatively with other developments in the Countryside 
would not result in a level of development which would be contrary to the strategy 
outlined in Policies WLP1.1 and WLP7.1 .  
For all small scale development in the Countryside the design of the scheme will need to respect and 
reflect the character of the settlement and existing built up frontage including:  
 Housing density is reflective of the density in the village and surrounding built up area; 
and  
 The ratio of the building footprint to the  plot area is consistent with existing properties 
nearby which characterise the village.

206                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Rural Workers Dwellings in the Countryside  
8.43 The accommodation needs  of rural workers employed full time in agriculture, horticulture, forestry and 
other rural busin esses can usually be met in existing properties either on the site or in nearby settlements. 
Occasionally it is essential for a worker to be in close proximity to the business, for example, where animal 
or agricultural processes require essential care at s hort notice, or where there is a need to deal with 
emergencies that could otherwise cause serious loss of crops or produce. The lack of available properties 
in the countryside can therefore occasionally necessitate the need for a new dwelling to serve this  
purpose.  
8.44 Policy WLP8.8 allows for the development of a new dwelling in the Countryside for rural workers where it 
is essential for them to be in close proximity to their business. However, to avoid the proliferation of 
isolated dwellings in the Countrysi de the policy sets strict tests to ensure the dwelling is actually needed, 
the business is viable and there is no other suitable accommodation available which could serve the 
business.  
8.45 Applications will be assessed taking account of the history of the enterprise. Evidence will need to 
demonstrate whether there are existing dwellings within the site/holding or nearby which could fulfil the 
need. If any dwellings or buildings on the holdin g suitable for conversion have been sold on the open 
housing market this is likely to constitute lack of evidence of essential need. To assess whether the existing 
business is viable, financial information from the last three years prior to the planning ap plication will be 
required which show that the business was profitable for at least one of those years.  
8.46 Where planning permission is granted for a rural worker s dwelling, occupancy restriction conditions will be 
imposed to ensure the dwelling is used for that purpose and remains available for that purpose in the 
future. To avoid new isolated market housing in the countryside, which is contrary to the policy conta ined 
within the National Planning Policy Framework, proposals to remove occupancy restriction conditions will 
rarely be approved. Where applications are made for the removal of an occupancy condition, evidence will 
be required to demonstrate that there is no longer a need for the accommodation for either the business 
or for the wider local area. Evidence of marketing should be provided, following the guidelines in Appendix 
4. In addition to this, the dwelling should be made available to a minimum of three r egistered social 
landlords on terms which would prioritise its occupation by a rural worker as an affordable dwelling.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 207 Policy WLP8.8 – Rural Workers Dwellings in the Countryside  
Proposals for permanent dwellings in the Countryside for rural workers where they are to support an 
existing and viable rural business will only be permitted where:  
 There is a clearly established functional need and this could not be fulfilled by another 
existing dwelling or accommodation in the area which is suitable and available  for the 
occupied workers or could be converted to do so;  
 The need relates to a full time worker, or one who is primarily employed in the rural 
sector , and does not relate to a part time requirement;  
 The unit and the rural activity concerned has been estab lished for at least three years, 
has been profitable for at least one of them and is financially sound and has a clear 
prospect of remaining so;  
 The proposed dwelling is sensitively designed, landscaped and located to fit in with its 
surroundings and of a scale that reflects its functional role to support the agricultural 
activity.  
Where a rural dwelling is permitted, the occupancy will be restricted by condition to ensure that it is 
occupied by a person, or persons, currently or last employed in local rura l employment. Applications for 
the removal of an occupancy condition related to rural work ers will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that:  
 There is no longer a need for accommodation on the holding/business and in the local 
area;  
 The property has been marketed to ensure proper coverage within the relevant  sector 
for at least one year at a price which reflects the existence of the occupancy condition; 
and 
 The dwelling has been made available to a minimum of three Registered Providers 
operating l ocally on terms that would prioritise its occupation by a rural worker as an 
affordable dwelling and that option has been refused.

208                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Replacement Dwellings and Extensions in the Countryside  
8.47 Existing dwellings in the countryside contribute towards the range of dwelling types and sizes required to 
support a diverse community. Many of these make an important contribution towards the rural character 
of an area and it is important this is protected. However, housing needs to be adaptable to meet changing 
requirements of family life. It is recognised that  there is some need for the replacement or extension of 
existing dwellings and this is a form of development in the Countryside that may be allowed as an 
exception to normal policies of control.  
8.48 Policy WLP8. 9 seeks to ensure that replacement dwellings and extensions to existing dwellings are of an 
appropriate scale, siting and design to not adversely affect the setting of the dwelling and wider 
countryside. Proposals should also be considered against the Historic Environment and  Natural and Built 
Environment policies (Policies WLP8.34 to WLP8.40) . To avoid isolated new homes in the Countryside, 
dwellings to be replaced must have been last used for residential purposes and have not been abandoned.  
Policy WLP8. 9 – Replacement Dwellings and Extensions in the Countryside  
Proposals for the replacement of an existing dwelling in the countryside with a new dwelling will be 
permitted where:  
 The existing dwelling is not a building of architectural or historical value w hich makes a 
positive contribution to the locality;  
 There is no increase in the number of dwelling units;  
 It can be demonstrated the property was last used for residential purposes and has not 
been abandoned; and  
 The replacement dwelling is of a scale and design which is sensitive to its countryside 
setting, with its height being similar to that of the original dwelling.  
Proposals for the extension of dwellings in the countryside will be permitted where:  
 They are in keeping with the height, scale and character of the original dwelling and will 
not adversely affect the character and appearance of the building, the plot of land on 
which it is located and the rural setting;  
 The proposed extension is considered along with the cumulative impact of existing 
extensions on the original dwelling.  
Extensions to converted agricultural buildings which detract from the original form and character of the 
building will not be supported.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 209 Residential Annexes in the Countryside  
8.49 The National Planning Policy Framework se eks to avoid isolated new homes in the Countryside and Policy 
WLP1.3 restricts new residential development in the Countryside. Residential annexes, can sometimes be 
regarded as new dwellings and therefore are subject to these policies of restraint.   
8.50 Wavene y has an ageing population which will mean increasing numbers of people will need to benefit 
from care. The provision of an annex to a house can allow an elderly or dependant relative to live with 
some degree of independence whilst benefiting from care and  support from relatives . The provision of an 
annex can also allow for living arrangements/ household types that cannot b e accommodated in a 
traditional dwelling  or through extension under policy WLP8.29.  
8.51 It is therefore important to specifically allow for  the provision of annexes in the Countryside. However, 
there is a risk that the provision of annexes in the Countryside could harm the character of the rural area 
and increase pressure for the annex to be let or sold as an individual dwelling in the future . To avoid this 
Policy WLP8.10 supports the provision of annexes in the Countryside where they form an extension to an 
existing dwelling in accordance with policy WLP8.9 or involve the conversion of an existing outbuilding. 
The policy also allows for a det ached annex providing it is situated in such a location which would remove 
the possibility of it being let or sold as an individual dwelling in the future .  
8.52 Applications should demonstrate how the annex has been designed to prevent the creation of an 
indep endent dwelling including the future use of the unit. The design of the annex should reflect the 
character of the existing dwelling and be subordinate in size, scale and provision of accommodation to the 
existing dwelling. In all cases, there will be no bo undary treatments that physically separate the 
accommodation from the main dwelling or a separate vehicular access, and this will be managed by 
condition. In all cases, restrictions will be applied limiting the occupation of the residential ancillary 
accom modation by condition/planning obligation to remain ancillary to the main dwelling, preventing the 
sale of the residential ancillary accommodation on the open market separate to the main dwelling .  
Policy WLP8.10 – Residential Annexes in the Countryside  
In the Countryside residential annexes will be permitted where :  
 The annex forms an extension to the existing dwelling . 
 Only where a physically attached annex is not feasible will consideration be given to the 
conversion of a suitable existing detached outbu ilding within the curtilage, and only 
where this is not feasible will consideration be given to new build detached residential 
ancillary accommodation which is closely related to the existing dwelling.  
 Residential annexes must be designed to reflect the ch aracter and setting of the original 
dwelling.  The size, scale, design, location and provision of accommodation in the annex 
must be subordinate to the existing dwelling.

210                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Conversion of Rural Buildings to Residential Use  
8.53 There are a number of architectura l and historically valuable rural buildings in the Countryside which 
occasionally become redundant or disused. Preferably these buildings should continue to be used for 
commercial purposes to support the rural economy. However, residential conversions may sometimes also 
be appropriate. The National Planning Policy Framework supports the re -use of redunda nt or disused 
buildings in the C ountryside, where for residential purposes, it would enhance the immediate setting. 
Conversion of buildings in the C ountrysi de can sometimes also help safeguard heritage assets.  
8.54 Policy WLP8.11 supports the conversion of redundant rural buildings to residential use where the 
development secures or safeguards a heritage asset. The Policy also allows for conversion of buildings 
which are locally distinctive and of architectural merit. It is unlikely that modern farm buildings would be 
considered locally distinctive and of architectural quality and therefore would not qualify for conversion 
under this policy. Conversion should not r esult in a residential curtilage which is harmful to the rural 
character of the area, and the aim should be about enhancing the quality of the setting in line with the 
requirements of the Framework.  
8.55 Some complexes of rural buildings can be quite large and  it is important that the conversion of farm 
buildings does not result in an unsustainable level of residential development in the Countryside which is 
contrary to the strategy set out in Policies WLP1.1 and WLP7.1.  
8.56 Proposals for residential use in flood zone 2 and 3 will require a site specific flood risk assessment. 
Proposals should also be considered against relevant Climate Change, Design, Natural Environment and 
Historic Environment policies (WLP8.24 – WLP8.40).  
8.57 The conversion of rural buildings to residential use should be designed to maintain or enhance the form, 
structure and character of the rural building and retain any important architectural features. Wherever 
possible proposals should utilise existing openings and keep new openings to a minim um. Where proposed 
extensions and alterations are essential they should not dominate the original building in size, scale, or use 
of materials. Essential extensions and alterations should not detract from the original  building  being 
retained. Proposals for  residential use should not domesticate rural buildings through the addition of 
features such as porches, chimney stacks and inappropriate fenestration.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies

The conversion of redundant rural bui ldings in the Countryside to residential use will be permitted where it

 The building is locally distinctive and of architectural merit ; 
 The conversion requires only minimal alteration;  
 The design maintains or enha nces the structure, form and character of the rural

 The conversion enhances the immediate setting of the area;  
 The site is s erved by an appropriate existing access; and  
 The development when considered cumulatively with other developments in the

212                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Employment  
8.58 Projections for employment growth from the Employment Land Needs Assessment Update  (2017)  indicate  
a need to plan for 5,000 new jobs over the period to 2036. It is estimated that to meet this target, 43 
hectares of employment land needs to be identified and developed.  
8.59 There is some uncertainty about the number of jobs which need to be plan ned for and the amou nt of 
employment land required to support them. Economic projections themselves at a local level have 
limitations and cannot foresee new emerging sectors. The additional assumptions in the employment land 
evidence base around the impact of offshore wind ar e also uncertain as there are many variables which 
could affect the total number of jobs and demand for land. The conversion of jobs forecasts to land 
requirements is also subject to uncertainty as land and floorspace requirements can differ widely between  
sectors and over time as working patterns change. Furthermore, just because the number of jobs in some 
sectors decline over time (for example manufacturing) this does not necessarily mean that floorspace 
requirements will also decline. This is illustrated  in the Employment Land Needs Assessment Update which 
shows that over the period 2001 -2016 there was a net increase of over 50 hectares of employment land at 
the same time as limited growth in jobs.  
8.60 It is therefore essential that the Local Plan ensures a flexible and responsive supply of land for employment 
development and a good range of existing employment premises in the right locations.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 213 Existing employment areas  
8.61 Central to meeting jobs needs and securing a 
supply of premises to accommodate these i s 
protecting suitably located and designed existing 
premises in employment use. Rental and freehold 
values for non -employment uses are often much 
higher than employment uses. This means 
premises in existing employment uses can become 
under threat from conv ersion. Additionally, 
replacement new -build employment premises are 
difficult to make financially viable.  
8.62 The conversion of existing employment premises to other uses reduces the supply of employment 
premises and reduces the choice in the market for premi ses, particularly for smaller local businesses. 
Furthermore, where non -employment uses are introduced into areas with a high concentration of 
employment uses, compatibility problems can arise. The noise and odours of surrounding employment 
uses may not be compatible with the new non -employment use leading to nuisance complaints which 
could undermine other existing employment uses in the locality. Additionally, some non -employment uses 
which attract large numbers of customers can introduce problems with car parking which can make it 
difficult for HGVs and other industrial traffic to circulate around the employment area.  
8.63 However, not all employment premises need to be protected from conversion. Some premises are located 
in areas where there are already a good mix of uses or in areas close to residential properties where an 
alternative use may be more appropriate.  
8.64 Policy WLP8.12 identifies existing employment areas and protects premises in employment uses within 
these areas from conversion and redevelopment to other uses. Premises within these areas can only be 
converted to a non -employment use (B class use) if marketing evidence demonstrates there is no demand 
for employment use for a period of 12 months. Details on the requirements of marketing evidence are 
found within Appendix 4. 
8.65 The identification of existing employment areas has been based on evidence in the Existing Employment 
Areas Review (2017). This study identified all areas where there are clusters of employment uses and 
made recommendations on the mo st appropriate areas to be protected. The existing employment areas 
are identified on the Policies Map.  
8.66 The Policy also protects new premises constructed on sites allocated within this plan and new premises 
constructed el sewhere during the life of the P lan, including those currently with planning permission for 
employment uses.   
8.67 Outside of existing employment areas, existing premises will be able to convert to any use subject to 
compliance with other planning policies in the Local Plan.

214                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  8.68 Policy WLP8.12 als o allows for quasi -retail uses such as car showrooms, tyre and exhaust centres and 
builders merchants on the main road frontages of employment areas. These uses are often not suitable in 
town centre locations due to their size and characteristics. If locat ed within existing employment areas, 
conflicts between industrial traffic and general traffic can occur. Therefore a more appropriate location is 
on the main road frontages of these areas. These uses can sometimes improve the appearance of 
industrial areas , and by allowing them on existing employment areas, it provides a suitable developed 
location for these uses which are difficult to accommodate in the town centre.   
 
Policy WLP8.12 – Existing Employment Areas  
Existing Employment Areas are identified on th e Policies Map.  
Within Existing Employment Areas  proposals involving the redevelopment or change of use of existing 
employment premises falling within use classes B1, B2 or B8, for uses not falling within use classes B1, B2 
or B8 will only be permitted whe re: 
 Marketing evidence is provided which demonstrates the premises have been marketed 
for a sustained period of 12 months in accordance with the requirements set out in 
Appendix 4; and  
 The proposed use is compatible with the surrounding employment uses in terms of car 
parking, access, noise, odour and other amenity concerns.  
Exceptionally, quasi -retail uses (not falling within use class A1) may be permitted on the main road 
frontages of Existing Employment Areas which have good access to a range of transport options. Such 
development should not be detrimental to the efficient and effective use of the remainder of the Existing 
Employment Area.  
New development for employment uses which takes place during the plan period (including sites currently 
with consent for employment uses) will be treated as Existing Employment Areas for the purpose of this 
policy.   
Outside of Existing Employment Areas  the redevelopment or change of use of existing employment 
premises falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 will be permitted.  
Neighbourhood Plans may identify additional premises or cluster s of premises outside of Existing 
Employment Areas within use classes B1, B2 and B8 for protection from redevelopment or change of use if 
local evidence supports it.

8.69 Given the uncertainty over land requirements  for employment  land  there is a need for flexibility to allow 
additional land to come forward for the development of employment premises where there a need  can be 
justified .  
8.70 Policy WLP8.13 allows new employment development adjacent to Existing Employment Areas for new a nd 
expanding businesses. The Policy requires it to be demonstrated that there is an additional need for the 
employment development over and above the needs identified in the Local Plan or there is no suitable 
land available within Existing Employment Areas, existing employment allocations or within settlement 
boundaries. In demonstrating an additional need, evidence submitted with a planning application should 
provide information on latest economic forecasts or bespoke forecasts for the relevant sector. The  
evidence of need should also justify the locational requirements for the development. In demonstrating 
there is no suitable land within Existing Employment Areas, allocations or within the settlement boundary, 
a review of land and premises available will be required together with evidence of the specific locational 
requirements of the proposed development. The review of land and premises availability should assess 
whether the alternative land or premises are suitable (with regard to specific locational req uirements), 
available (the landowner is willing to sell at market value) and achievable (whether the alternative land is 
viable to develop).  
8.71 Proposals adjacent to existing employment areas will be considered carefully against the natural and 
historic envi ronment policies in this Local Plan ( Policies WLP8.34 to 8.40 ).  
 
Policy WLP8.13 – New Employment Development  
Proposals for new employment development falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 will be permitted 
within Existing Employment Areas.  
Proposals for new employment development falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 outside of Existing 
Employment Areas but within Settlement Boundaries will be permitted where it would not have an impact 
on surrounding land uses.  
Proposals for new employment develop ment falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 will be permitted 
adjacent to Existing Employment Areas and outside of Settlement Boundaries where it would not have an 
impact on surrounding land uses and where:  
 An additional need for employment development h as been demonstrated; or  
 There is no land available within Existing Employment Areas, existing employment

216                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Conversion and Replacement of Rural Buildings for Employment Use  
8.72 The overal l spatial strategy of this Local Plan seeks to support and enhance the rural areas of the District 
and allocates more housing to the villages of the District than previous Local Plans have. In addition to 
agriculture there are a limited number of employmen t premises in the countryside in Waveney which help 
support the rural economy. Examples include the large 2 Sisters Food Group factory near Flixton, Becks 
Green between Bungay and Halesworth and Wren Business Centre on the edge of Wrentham. The 
National Pl anning Policy Framework encourages economic growth in rural areas and states that Local Plans 
should support growth and expansion of all types of business through conversion and new buildings and 
promoting the diversification of agriculture.  
8.73 Policy WLP8.13  on new employment development will allow new development in rural areas where 
existing employment areas are defined, such as the examples above. Furthermore, Neighbourhood Plans 
can specifically allocate land for employment uses. To further support employ ment development in the 
rural areas, Policy WLP8.14 allows for the conversion, and in some circumstances the replacement of 
buildings in the Countryside to employment use. There is a large stock of f arm and other buildings in the 
Countryside. Conversion an d replacement of rural buildings allows new employment development to take 
place without the need to develop greenfield land which could potentially have a negative impact on the 
character of the C ountryside and rural villages.  
8.74 Rural buildings in the Count ryside are often also heritage assets. Therefore, proposals will be considered 
carefully against the historic environment policies of the Local Plan ( Policies WLP8.37/8.38/8.39)  as well as 
national planning policy on the conservation of heritage assets.

The conversion of rural buildings to employment use falling within uses classes B1, B2 and B8 will be 
permitted where:  
 There is good access to the strategic road network or w ould not generate significant 
traffic movements;  
 The proposal would not conflict with neighbouring uses; and  
 The proposal reflects the form and character of the existing building.  
The replacement of rural buildings to employment use falling within uses cla sses B1, B2 and B8 will be 
permitted where:  
 The proposal is of a similar size and scale to the building that is being replaced;  
 There is good access to the strategic road network or would not generate significant 
traffic movements;  
 The proposal would not c onflict with neighbouring uses;  
 The building to be replaced is of permanent design and construction; and  
 The proposal will result in a significant environmental gain in terms of improvements to 
visual amenity, landscape impact, pollution prevention or the setting of historic assets.

8.75 Waveney is home to a diverse range of natural and cultural tourist attractions and the tourism industry is a 
vital part of Waveney’s economy. The East Suffolk Business Plan strives to build on the strength of the 
tourism economy and sets out the aims of increasing visitor numbers outside of the main tourist season 
and delivering and supporting cultural and sporting events for greater tourism opportunities. Supporting 
the industry is of great importance but it must not be at the expense of the assets and attractions that 
draw people in to the area.  
8.76 The National Planning Policy Framework is generally supportive of tourism and states that local plans 
should support sustainable rural tourism which benefits the rural eco nomy whilst respecting the character 
of the countryside. The East Marine Plan recognises the importance of tourism in coast areas and seeks to 
support tourism proposals and minimise harm resulting from development on tourism.  The Broads 
Authority’s Broads Plan (2017) and Tourism Strategy (2016) both seek to support year -round tourism in a 
sustainable way.  
8.77 The Employment Land Needs Assessment Update (2017) predicts a significant growth in jobs in the 
tourism sector and recent Waveney Authority  Monitoring Rep orts show a steady number of planning 
approvals for tourism development in Waveney.

218                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  New Self Catering Tourist Accommodation  
8.78 Self catering tourist accommodation plays a vital role in Waveney’s tourism sector. There is a broad 
spectrum of accommodation available including camp sites, chalets, log cabins, caravan sites and glamping 
sites, in different sizes and in varying locations. This creates a richness and diversity of choice for places to 
stay which can ser ve a great variety of visitors.  
8.79 It is desir able to provide a diverse range of accommodation, including in rural areas. Policy WLP8.15 
therefore allows for a flexible approach for small sites of up to 10 units to be applied. These smaller sites 
can be accommodated anywhere in the rural area subject to compliance with other policies of the Local 
Plan. Sites larger than this will require better transport links and facilities. Therefore medium sized self 
catering accommodation sites of between 11 and 79 units will also need to provide good access to the  A or 
B road network and public transport.   
8.80 In the interests of sustainable travel, larger developments of 80 units and above must be located in or 
close to Lowestoft, one of the market towns, or one of the coastal resorts  of Corton, Kessingland or 
Southwo ld. They will need to demonstrate good connectivity with other tourist destinations and 
amenities, particularly by public transport, walking and cycling. A Transport Assessment must be provided 
for sites of this scale. Large developments should also provid e on site commercial, recreational or 
entert ainment facilities to serve day -to-day needs of tourists.   
8.81 On medium and large scale sites proportionate amounts of secure, covered cycle storage should  be 
provided. This should be similar to the cycle parking re quirements for C3 residential set out in the Suffolk 
Guidance for Parking (2015) of 2 spaces per unit/pitch of accommodation.  Bicycle hire services for visitors 
will also be supported.  
8.82 Tourist accommodation , particular accommodation in the form of permanen t buildings  can sometimes 
come under pressure to be occupied for full time residential use. New tourism accommodation should 
therefore be restricted so that it is retained for the benefit of the tourism economy in the District and not 
lost to residential u se. Furthermore, tourist accommodation comprising permanent buildings will only be 
permitted within Settlement Boundaries as defined by Policy WLP1.3, through conversions of existing rural 
buildings or on larger scale schemes where on -site facilities are p rovided such as a restaurant, shop or club 
house. This should limit the impact and future pressure for full -time residential use.  
8.83 Planning conditions and/or legal agreements can be used to apply restrictions to new development. 
Enforcing against breaches of holiday occupancy conditions can be extremely challenging and it is 
preferable to prevent breaches occurring in the first instance. It is therefore important to set out precise 
and enforceable conditions or legal agreements which discourage residential use and which can be 
effectively enforced. As such, planning conditions or legal agreements should require new self catering 
tourist accommodation units to be vacated for a specified and continuous period of at least six weeks of 
the calendar year. In orde r to facilitate year round holiday use, the Local Planning Authority will allow 
proposals to vacate half the site at one time, and the rest of the site later that year.   Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 219 8.84 The valuable character of the Waveney landscape is one of the assets which helps support the local 
tourism industry. It is therefore important that tourism development does not harm this asset on which it 
depends. Policy WLP8.3 5 and National Planning Polic y Framework will be used to assess the impact of 
tourism development in the landscape.  The Framework places strong protection on national designations 
such as the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Heritage Coast. The Framework states that 
planning  permission should be refused for major developments in these areas except in exceptional 
circumstances. The above considerations for new development should also be applied to extensions to 
existing tourism accommodation.   
 
Policy WLP8.15 – New Self Cateri ng Tourist Accommodation  
Small scale (10 pitches/units or fewer) self catering tourist accommodation developments will be 
supported in principle across the District. Medium sized sites (11 -79 pitches/units) will require good access 
to A or B roads and publ ic transport. Covered cycle storage proportionate  to the size of the site must be 
provided on site. Large sites (80+ pitches/units) will be supported where:  
 They are in or close to Lowestoft, the market towns, or the coasta l resort towns of the 
District;  
 A Transport Assessment has been submitted demonstrating no significant impacts on 
the highway network;  
 Safe and convenient access to public transport and local services and amenities are 
provided;  
 Covered cycle storage proportionate  to the size of the sit e is provided on site; and  
 Commercial, recreational or entertainment facilities are provided on site.  
Self catering tourist accommodation comprising permanent buildings will only be permitted within the 
Settlement Boundaries defined by Policy WLP1.3 ; throu gh the conversion of rural buildings  of permanent 
structure;  or on large scale sites where commercial, recreational or entertainment facilities are provided 
on site.  
New self catering tourist accommodation will be restricted by means of planning conditions  or a legal 
agreement which permits holiday use only and restricts the period the accommodation can be occupied.

220                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  New Hotel and Guest Houses  
8.85 Hotels and guest houses provide valuable accommodation for visitors to the District and the National 
Planning Policy Framework states that town centres are the preferred location for such tourism and leisure 
uses. However, hotels and guest houses can also make an important contribution in supporting tourism in 
the seafront areas of the District’s  coastal towns of Corton, Kessingland, Lowestoft and Southwold. 
Therefore, Policy WLP8.16 allows for an exception to Policy WLP8.18 New Town Centre Use Development 
for new build hotels and guest houses to allow them to be supported in seafront locations in  the coastal 
towns.   
8.86 Some parts of Lowestoft have been subject to high numbers of conversions to flats which has generated 
residential amenity issues and also removed larger dwellings suitable for families from the housing stock. 
Further conversions to fla ts or Houses in Multiple Occupation are resisted in these areas. Conversions to 
new guest houses and hotels can sometimes exacerbate these problems. At the same time, some of these 
areas are well located for the seafront tourist areas and can make a valuab le contribution to the tourism 
economy in the District. As such, the creation of new hotels and guest houses in these areas must be 
carefully controlled to avoid further environmental problems.  
8.87 Policy WLP8.16 therefore requires proposals to demonstrate th ere will be adequate and appropriate off -
road car parking  in line with the Suffolk Guidance for Parking (2015) (and any updates).  The policy also 
requires off -street bin storage and for the property to be  of a size which will provide sufficient space for 
quality serviced accommodation. The requirement for mos t family homes is less than 160 sqm and 
therefore this is deemed to be an appropriate threshold for the conversion to hotels and guest houses.  
Policy WLP8.16 – New Hotels and Guest Houses  
New build hotel s and guest houses will be supported in  town centres and  seafront locations in Corton, 
Lowestoft, Kessingland and Southwold.  
 
In streets where further conversions to flats or Houses in Multiple Occupation would not be permitted , 
conversion of properties to  create new hotels and guest houses will only be allowed where:  
 
 Adequate on -site car pa rking is provided for guests and staff ;  
 Adequate off-street bin storage is provided  for the number of guests/residents ; and  
 The property is abo ve average size (i.e. above 160 sqm original floorspace)  
 
New hotels and guest houses will be restricted by means of planning conditions or a legal agreement 
which permits  tourism use only.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 221 Protection of Existing Tourist Accommodation  
8.88 The existing  stock of hotels, guest hous es, bed and breakfast businesses  and self catering accommodation 
provide an important role in support of the District’s tourism economy. However, as stated above, tourist 
accommodation can sometimes come under pressure for conversion into residential prope rties. This is 
particularly an issue in the countryside where new residential development is more strictly controlled.  
8.89 Policy WLP8.17 sets out an approach to protect existing tourist accommodation from conversion to 
residential where the tourist use may c ontinue to be viable. The policy resists change of use apart from 
exceptional cases where a lack of demand for the tourist accommodation is clearly and satisfactorily 
demonstrated. As a minimum, planning applications for change of use will need to provide marketing 
evidence demonstrating the premises have been marketed for a sustained period of 12 months, in 
accordance with the requirements as set out in Appendix 4.  
Policy WLP8.17 – Existing Tourist Accommodation  
Existing tourism accommodation will be protected.  
Change of use will only be considered in exceptional circumstances where it can be fully and satisfactorily 
demonstrated that there is no demand for the tourist accommodation.  
Marketing evidence must be p rovided which demonstrates the premises have been marketed for a 
sustained period of a minimum of 12 months in accordance with the re quirements set out in Appendix 4 .

222                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Retail, Leisure and Town Centres  
8.90 Town centres in Waveney form the heart of local communities and offer a range of community, shopping, 
employment and leisure uses in accessible locations which are well served by public transport. Lowestoft is 
the District’s largest town centre, followed b y Beccles. Bungay and Halesworth town centres cater for 
more local needs and Southwold town centre provides a strong tourism function.  
8.91 The National Planning Policy Framework places great emphasis on maintaining and improving the viability 
and vitality of town centres and states that local p lans should be positive in promoting competitive town 
centres and should contain policies for managing centres over the plan period.  
New Town Centre Use Development  
8.92 The National Planning Policy Framework makes clear tha t town centres are the preferred location for the 
development of retail (including financial and professional services), leisure (including, restaurants, 
drinking establishments, takeaways, cinemas, theatres and other buildings used for leisure), offices, 
tourism and cultural and community uses. The Framework states that l ocal plans should meet the assessed 
need for these town centre uses in full.   
8.93 The Framework sets out a sequential approach to  the development of  Town Centre uses where 
development should b e considered on town centre sites before edge of centre sites and finally out of 
centre sites. The Framework states that local plans should allocate land to meet needs in town centres and 
if that is not possible, edge of centre sites and finally set polici es for meeting needs in other accessible out 
of centre locations which are well connected to the town centre.   
8.94 The Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (2016) identifies a need for 6,946sqm of non -food retail 
development and 1,564sqm for food store retail d evelopment over the plan period once existing 
commitments have been taken into account. The assessment also identifies the need for new leisure 
development including a multiplex cinema in Lowestoft, new restaurants, cafés and drinking 
establishments in all  town centres, and increased hotel provision in Lowestoft and Beccles. For retail and 
leisure development Policy WLP1.1 Scale and Location of Development focuses most development in 
Lowestoft and Beccles, with smaller amounts in Halesworth, Bungay and Sout hwold. Some of the need in 
Lowestoft could be accommodated on the Battery Green site allocated under Policy WLP2.7 and the Peto 
Square site allocated under Policy WLP2.3. There are no identified sites for retail and leisure development 
in other parts of th e District. However, some of the food store need and non -food store need will be met 
on larger residential allocations in Beccles and Lowestoft in the form of small local shopping centres.  
8.95 There is very little scope for new office development within town centres. It is expected that the need for 
new office development as identified in the Employment Land Needs Assessment (2016) and the 2017 
update will be delivered mostly on business park style sites on sites allocated in this Local Plan. Proposals 
for new  office development in addition to that allocated on sites in this Local Plan should consider the 
requirements of both Policy WLP8.18 and Policy WLP8.13 on new employment development.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 223 8.96 For sites outside of the town centre and not allocated in the Local Pla n, the Framework requires an impact 
assessment of the proposed development on existing, committed and planned public and private sector 
investment in town centres. The impact assessment should also consider the impact of the proposal on 
town centre vitalit y and viability, including local consumer choice and trade in the town centre and wider 
area, up to five years from the time the application is made. For major schemes where the full impact will 
not be realised in five years, the impact should also be asse ssed up to ten years from the time the 
application is made. The Framework sets a national threshold of 2,500sqm of development where the 
impact assessment applies. However, the Framework makes clear that local p lans can set a local threshold. 
The Retail an d Leisure Needs Assessment states that in W aveney a lower threshold of 350 sqm would be 
appropriate. The Retail Impact Threshold Advice for Waveney District (2018) provides  further  analysis an 
evidence for setting an appropriate retail impact threshold base d on the health and size of town centres in 
the District, the average size of retail units and recent planning permissions for retail. This additional work 
confirms that the 350 square metre retail impact threshold is appropriate for the whole District.  
8.97 Policy WLP8.18 designates Town Centre Boundaries and Primary Shopping Areas. The Policy requires a 
sequential approach to the development of town centre uses on the basis of these designations in line 
with the National Planning Policy Framework . However, som e town centre use development will be 
permitted in the Oulton Broad District Centre, Kirkley D istrict Centre, Local Shopping C entre s, the North of 
Lowestoft Garden Village, Land South of the Street Carlton Colville and the Beccles and Worlingham 
Garden Nei ghbourhood, in line with Policies WLP2.11, WLP2.12, WLP2.13, WLP2.16 and WLP3.1 
respectively.  
8.98 Given the lack of sites at present to accommodate needs, the policy sets out a flexible approach to ensure 
needs can be met in the future if  sufficient  sites can still not be found within the town centre  and within 
the above areas . To ensure new proposals do not undermine the viability and vitality of town centres and 
significant adverse impacts on existing, committed and planned public and private secto r investment in 
town centres is avoided, new developments over 350sqm will need to be accompanied by an impact 
assessment.

224                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP8.18 – New Town Centre Use Development  
Town Centre Boundaries and Primary Shopping Areas are identified on the Policies Map.  
New t own centre use development (falling within use classes A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, C1, D2 and B1a) will be 
permitted within Town Ce ntre Boundaries.  
Where there are no suitable or available sites within town centres for the proposed development, town 
centre use development will be permitted on edge of centre sites. For retail developments edge of centre 
sites should be within 300 metres of the Primary Shopping Area. For development of other town centre 
uses, edge of centre sites should be within 300 metres  of the Town Centre Boundaries.  
Where there are no suitable or available sites within town centres or edge of centre sites for the proposed 
development, town centre use development will be permitted on out of centre sites providing:  
 The location is access ible by public transport and is accessible to pedestrians and 
cyclists;  
 The site has good links to the Town Centre, or links can be improved; and  
 The site will not impact upon other neighbouring uses, in terms of traffic, parking, and 
amenity issues.  
 
Development on out of centre sites which are also outside of Settlement Boundaries will only be permitted 
where:  
 An additional need for retail or leisure development has been demonstrated to justify 
the development; and  
 There is no suitable  and available l and within the Settlement B oundaries.  
 
Planning applications for town centre use development on edge of centre, and out of centre sites over 
350sqm should be accompanied by an Impact Assessment which demonstrates the proposal will have no 
significant adver se impact on the vitality and viability of the town centre, and no significant adverse impact 
on any town centre investments.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 225 Vitality and Viability of Town Centres  
8.99 Town centres currently face many challenges, particularly competition from the intern et and out of centre 
retail parks. Town centres in Waveney also face tough competition from Norwich which is a regional retail 
centre. It is therefore critical that the Local Plan protects and enhances the vitality and viability of the 
District’s town cent res.  
8.100  To help support the vitality and viability of town centres the National Plannin g Policy Framework states 
that l ocal plans should define the extent of town centres and primary shopping areas, based on a clear 
definition of primary and secondary frontages in designated centres, and set policies that make clear 
which uses will be permitted in such locations. Town Centre Boundaries and Primary Shopping Areas are 
defined by Policy WLP8.18. Primary frontages are where most shops are concentrated.  Seco ndary 
frontages have a greater mix of uses including banks, building societies, estate agents, pre-schools, 
restaurants and cafés. The Framework also promotes town centres which provide customer choice and a 
diverse offer of retail and services.  
8.101  The Retai l and Leisure Needs Assessment (2016) included health checks of all of the District’s town 
centres. The assessment found that overall town centres were performing fairly well although Lowestoft 
was found to have above average rates of vacant units and was in need of some environmental 
improvements . There was a suggestion that all town centres needed more leisure provision and that their 
offers could be strengthened with the inclusion of more cafés and restaurants.  
8.102  Policy WLP8.19 seeks to control changes of use within town centres and sets out the uses which are 
appropriate within primary shopping frontages and secondary frontages to maintain the vitality and 
viability of town centres . In primary  shopping  frontages the policy aims to ensure a dominate retail 
appearance which supports high levels of footfall.  As such the policy restricts proposals which would 
undermine this character by creating stretches of the frontage which do not comprise of use classes A1 or 
A3. In coming to a view of whether a proposal wo uld result in a concentration of non a1 or A3 uses the 
Council will have regard to the total number and proportion of different use -classes along the immediate 
frontage and the continuity along the frontage of non A1 and A3 uses.  The same considerations wi ll apply 
when considering proposals for non -town centre uses on secondary shopping frontages.   
8.103  It is acknowledged that some changes of use can take place without planning permission under the 
Permitted Development Order 2015 which allows some flexibility o f uses within the area (dependent on 
size, final proposed land use and wh ether the site is located in a conservation a rea or not). The ability of 
the Council to control such proposals highlights the need to give particular scrutiny to proposals that 
contin ue to require the submission of a planning application.   District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
226                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP8.19 – Vitality and Viability of Town Centres  
Primary and Secondary Shopping Frontages are identified on the Policies Map.  
Within Primary Shopping Frontages, proposals to change the use of  ground floor premises from use classes 
A1 retail or A3 cafés and restaurants to other uses will only be permitted where:  
 The proposal would not result in a concentration of non A1 or A3 uses in the immediate 
street frontage;  
 The proposal would not detrac t from the dominant retail appearance of the street 
frontage; and  
 The proposal does not involve ground floor C3 residential development or A5 hot food 
takeaways.  
Within Secondary Shopping Frontages, proposals to change the use of ground floor premises fro m use 
classes A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, D2 and sui generis leisure uses to other uses will only be permitted where:  
 The proposal would support the  vitality and viability of the t own centre; and  
 The proposal would not re sult in a concentration of non t own centre uses in the 
immediate street frontage.  
Neighbourhood Plans can set their own requirements for the mix and use of units within Primary Shopping 
Frontages and Secondary Shopping Frontages providing the effect of the requirements supports the 
vitality and via bility of the town centre.  
 
District Shopping Centres  
8.104  There are two District Shopping Centres in the District and these are covered by Policies WLP2.1 1 and 
WLP2.1 2 in the Lowestoft section.  
  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 227 Local Shopping Centres  
8.105  Local shopping centres are smaller than town and District  centres and perform a more limited role. They 
serve the immediate surrounding area and provide local residents with day -to-day goods and services. 
These might include a small supermarket, post offic e, pharmacy, newsagent and other shops selling food 
and beverages. There are local shopping centres in the following locations:   
 Carlton Road, Hollingsworth Road, High Street, London Road (Pakefield), Oulton Road, 
Snape Drive, The Green, Village Rise and W estwood Avenue in Lowestoft  
 Ashburnham Way and  Famona Road, Carlton Colville  
 High Street and Field Lane, Kessingland  
 Hillside Avenue, Worlingham  
 High Street, Wrentham  
8.106  The Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (2016) found that local shopping centres within t he District are 
reasonably healthy and perform a valuable role in providing shops and services for their surrounding areas, 
most of which are located within walking distance. Policy WLP8.20 seeks to protect the retail and service 
role that local shopping c entres provide.  
8.107  It is acknowledged that some changes of use can take place without planning permission under the 
Permitted Development Order 2015 which allows some flexibility of uses within the area (dependent on 
size, final proposed land use and whether  the sit e is located in a conservation a rea or not). The ability of 
the Council to control such proposals highlights the need to give particular scrutiny to proposals that 
continue to require the submission of a planning application.  
Policy WLP8.20 – Local  Shopping Centres  
Local Shopping Centres are identified on the Policies Map.  
Within Local Shopping Centres limited retail, leisure , community service and facilities  and office 
development will be permitted where it is of an proportionate scale to provide essential services to the 
surrounding area.  
Within Local Shopping Centres proposals for change of use of ground floor premises from use classes A1 
(retail), A2 (financial and professional), A3 (restaurants and cafés), A4 (drinking establishments) and A5 
(hot food takeaways) to uses other than retail, community, leisure and offices will not be permitted.   
Proposals for change of use of ground floor A1 retail premises within Local Shopping Centres to uses A2, 
A3, A4 and A5 will only be permitted when there w ould be, either individually or cumulatively, no 
significant adverse impact on the character, appearance, retail function, viability and vitality of the centre, 
on highway safety or on the amenity of neighbouring areas.  
 District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
228                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Sustainable Transport  
8.108  In Waveney,  the car is the most used method to travel to and from work. Cycling levels are above average 
for the county and walking is also popular. Bus and train use is below county and national averages.  
8.109  The Suffolk Local Transport Plan 2011 -2031 sets out a priorit y to support the growth of businesses, 
reducing the demand for car travel, making efficient use of transport networks and improving 
infrastructure.  
8.110  The Waveney Local Plan: Suffolk County Transport Model (SCTM) - Preferred Option Traffic Forecasting 
Report (2018)  identified that a number of junctions within  the District, particularly in s outh Lowestoft 
would be close to capacity by 2036 and would therefore increase congestion.  
8.111  Active travel such as walking and cycling positively contributes to public health  and reduces the reliance on 
private vehicles. To encourage people to walk and cycle for convenience and enjoyment it is important 
that routes are delivered so they are direct, well connected to key local destinations and easy to follow. 
The Suffolk Walkin g Strategy (2015) and the Waveney Cycle Strategy (2016) set out the value and benefit 
of these activities, how existing provision can be improved to encourage greater participation and making 
use of opportunities afforded by a quality public realm and publ ic right of way network. Delivery of these 
strategies will be critical in mitigating the impacts of congestion.  
8.112  Policy WLP8.21 sets out requirements which should help improve the use of sustainable transport options 
and reduce the risk of congestion. The Policy sets out basic principles for encouraging sustainable modes 
of transport. It also requires developers to h ave regard to the Waveney Cycle Strategy and subsequent 
updates.  
8.113  Parking provision in new developments can have an impact on the use of private cars and also the success 
of the development. Suffolk County Council has published parking provision guidance a nd Policy WLP8.21 
requires this guidance to be taken into account. To support the use of low emission vehicles, electric 
vehicle charging points are to be provided in accordance with the standards set out in the Suffolk Guidance 
for Parking published by Su ffolk County Council and subsequent updates. Due to the potential increase in 
the use of electric vehicles developers are encourag e to provide each house with on plot  parking with at 
least one electrical charging point accessible from either the driveway o r garage. For houses with 
communal parking, flats and other developments, developers are encouraged to provide ducting and 
electricity supply to each car parking space to enable the installation of a charging point in the future.  
8.114  Large scale developments c an have significant impacts on local transport networks. The National Planning 
Policy Framework states that for developments which are likely to generate significant new movements, 
Transport Assessments and Travel Plans or Transport Statements should be pr epared. Transport 
Assessments and Statements assess the potential transport impacts of developments and identify 
mitigation measures to promote sustainable development. Transport Assessments are thorough 
assessments of the transport implications of develop ment, and Transport Statements are a less detailed 
evaluation to be used where this would be more proportionate to the potential impact of the 
development. Travel Plans are long -term management strategies for encouraging sustainable transport Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 229 and mitigatin g the traffic impacts of a development. Suffolk County Council as the Highway Authority can 
provide advice on the scope and content of Transport Statements, Assessments and Travel Plans. Given 
the potential impacts of traffic on European protected habitats , particularly the Broads Special Area for 
Conservation, Transport Assessments should evaluate the potential increase in traffic on streets within 
400m of protected sites.  Where vehicle movements are likely to significantly increase in these locations, 
further assessment on air quality and impact on habitats will be required to inform project level Habitat 
Regulations Assessments.   
 
Policy WLP8.21 – Sustainable Transport  
Development proposals should be designed from the outset to incorporate measures that w ill encourage 
people to travel using non -car modes to access home, school, employment, services and facilities.  
Development will be supported where:  
 It is proportionate  in scale to the existing transport network;  
 It is located close to, and provides safe pedestrian and cycle access to services, facilities 
and public transport;  
 It is well integrated into and enhances the existing cycle network including the safe 
design and layout of new routes and provision of covered, secure cycle parking;  
 It is well integrated into and enhances the existing pedestrian routes and the public 
rights of way network;  
 It reduces conflict between users of the transport network including pedestrians, 
cyclists , users of mobility vehicles  and drivers and does not red uce road safety;  
 It will improve public transport in the rural areas of the District;  
 It includes facilities for charging plug -in and other ultra -low emission vehicles; and  
 The cumulative impact of new development will not create significant adverse impac t 
on the existing transport network.  
 
Developments should connect into the existing pedestrian and cycle network. Where possible, proposals 
are to include measures set out in the Waveney Cycle Strategy (2016 and subsequent updates) and 
demonstrate they hav e considered how the scheme will encourage people to walk and cycle to access 
services and facilities where practical.  
 
Subject to design considerations under Policies WLP8.29, WLP8.30  and WLP8.31, new developments will 
be required to provide parking that meets the requirements set out in the Suffolk Guidance for Parking 
issued by Suffolk County Council (2014 and subsequent updates).  
 
Transport Statements will be required for residential developments between 50 -80 dwellings. Transport 
Assessments and Travel  Plans will be required for residential developments larger than 80 dwellings.

230                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Community Services and Facilities  
8.115  Community facilities and services are an integral part of neighbourhoods and communities. Built 
community facilities can include local shops,  meeting places, schools, medical facilities, sports venues, 
cultural buildings, public houses and places of worship. They provide places for people to meet and 
socialise, support community activities, encourage people to be active, access everyday goods a nd foster a 
sense of identity and well -being to those who live and visit there. To protect the long -term character and 
vibrancy of communities, local services and facilities that are easily accessible need to be supported and 
retained where possible. This applies equally to all settlements. The National Planning Policy Framework 
reflects this by setting out the need to positively plan for and promote the retention and development of 
local services and facilities.  
Built Community Services and Facilities  
8.116  To help retain community facilities, community groups can nominate non -residential buildings or land 
within their communities which is important to them as 'assets of community value'. Once an asset is 
listed, if the owner of the asset decides to sell, within  five years of the listing, they must inform the local 
authority of their intention to do so. The community then has up to six weeks to express an interest in 
becoming potential bidders to buy the asset. Once an expression of interest has been received, a further 
four and a half month pause in the sale process is triggered. This gives potential bidders a total of six 
months to raise the funds required to purchase the asset. At the end of the period, the owner may sell it to 
whoever and at whatever price the y choose. However, the listing of an asset does not provide protection 
against a change of use or redevelopment of the land or buildings. This can mean the value of the asset is 
greater due to its potential to be converted to non -community uses. This can f rustrate the ability of the 
community to raise sufficient funds to purchase the asset. Therefore Policy WLP8.22 gives strong 
protection to these assets from changes of use and redevelopment proposals.  
8.117  There is a need to also provide a level of protection to community services and facilities which have not 
been identified as assets of community value. These facilities could still be important to members of the 
community and help enhance the sustainability of a locality. However, there is a need for flexibil ity to 
allow the change of use or redevelopment in certain circumstances such as a lack of community need, lack 
of viability or reprovision of the building in an equally or more accessible location.  
8.118  In demonstrating that there is no community need for the  facility or an alternative community use, 
evidence should be submitted with a planning application which provides details of consultation with the 
local community and an analysis of service provision in the locality which demonstrates that accessibility t o 
similar services and facilities will not be adversely affected.  
8.119  In demonstrating that the community service or facility is not viable in its current use or an alternative 
community use, applicants will need to provide evidence that premises have been mar keted in a manner 
agreed with the Council for at least 12 months for the current use or alternative community use facility in 
line with the requirements in Appendix 4. The evidence will need to clearly show there has been no 
interest in continued use as a community facility.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 231 8.120  It should be noted that the General Permitted Development Order 2015 allows for some changes of use to 
take place without the need for planning permission. For public houses, these permitted development 
rights are removed when they are  designated assets of community value. Policy WLP8.22 applies where 
planning permission is required.  
 
Policy WLP8.22 – Built Community Services and Facilities  
Proposals for new community services and facilities will be supported if the proposal meets the needs o f 
the local community, is of a proportionate scale, well related to the settlement which it will serve and 
would not adversely affect existing facilities that are easily accessible and available to the local community.  
Proposals to change the use, or redevelop for a non-community  use, a facility registered as an asset of 
community value will not be permitted.  
Proposals to change the use or redevelop for a different use existing built community facilities which are 
not r egistered as an asset of community value will only be permitted if:  
 It can be demonstrated there is no community need for the facility and the building or 
site is not needed for an alternative community use on site; or  
 It can be demonstrated that the curre nt, or an alternative community use is not viable 
and marketing evidence is provided which demonstrates the premises have been 
marketed for a sustained period of 12 months in accordance with the requirements set 
out in Appendix 4; or 
 Development would invo lve the provision of an equivalent or better replacement 
community facility either on site or in an alternative location in the vicinity that is well 
integrated into the community and has equal or better accessibility than the existing 
facility which meets  the needs of the local population.

232                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Protection of Open Space  
8.121  Protecting and promoting the improvement of 
existing open spaces is important for the well -being 
of local communities. Quality open spaces which 
are easily accessible and support uses for a  wide 
cross -section of the community are essential to 
support the physical and mental health of the 
population. Open spaces also help support 
biodiversity, the aesthetic quality of the public 
realm and built environment and mitigate flood risk.  
8.122  The National Planning Policy Framework places strong emphasis on the need to protect existing open 
spaces and other community facilities. The Waveney Open Space Needs Assessment (2015) identifies 
existing open space provision and its condition and the Wave ney Playing Pitch and Outdoors Sports 
Facilities Assessment (2014) assessed the need for outdoor sports facilities to support people living in the 
District. These assessments highlight existing issues and the types of open space shortfalls which exist in 
different locations. The Waveney Green Infrastructure Strategy (2015) sets out a comprehensive approach 
to delivering open space and improving the green infrastructure network by improving connectivity and 
the provision of the right types of open space in t he right locations.  
8.123  Policy WLP8.23 protects open space identified on the Policies Map from development, unless the 
development is ancillary to the open space, it is surplus to requirements, or will be replaced by equivalent 
or better provision.  Any open s pace that falls within the Broads Authority Executive Area has been 
protected through the Broads Authority Local Plan and will be subject to its policies.  
8.124  To demonstrate whether an open space proposed for development is surplus to requirements, applicants  
are expected to undertake an open space needs assessment. This should follow the approach taken in the 
Waveney Open Space Needs Assessment and consider the provision of open space with the same use 
within the site catchment area, alternative open space us es and how the site relates to existing provision 
for each respective type of open space use in the locality. The contribution an open space makes towards 
local amenity, public realm, biodiversity and the wider green infrastructure network should be consid ered 
as part of an open space needs assessment.  
8.125  The Framework allows local  communities through local p lans and Neighbourhood Plans to identify green 
areas of particular importance to them for special protection. By designating land as Local Green Space 
local communities are able to rule out new development other than in very special circumstances. This is a 
stronger test than the requirements of Policy WLP8.23. The Council does not have enough evidence to 
designate Local Green Spaces across the District in  the Local Plan but will encourage Parish and Town 
Councils to consider designating green areas which are demonstrably important to them as Local Green 
Spaces in Neighbourhood Plans.

There will be a presumption a gainst any development that involves the loss of open space or community 
sport and recreation facilities.  
Open spaces are identified on the Policies Map.  
Proposals for the development of open spaces will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances wher e: 
 The proposal is ancillary to the open nature of the area and will enhance local character, 
increase local amenity and be of greater community or wildlife benefit;  
 An open space assessment demonstrates the site is surplus to requirements including 
its ability to be used for alternative open space uses; or  
 The loss resulting from the proposed development will be replaced by equivalent or 
better provision in terms of quantity, quality and in a location that is equally or more 
accessible to the community.

234                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Climate Change  
8.126  Waveney with its extensive coastline, tidal inlet, estuary and river valleys, is particularly vulnerable to the 
effects of climate change.  
8.127  Climate change is a result of global warming, a process caused by an increase of greenhouse gas emi ssions 
into the earth’s atmosphere. Climate change can affect weather patterns and sea levels, both of which can 
result in damage to the natural and built environment.  
8.128  The planning system can respond to climate change by limiting increases in greenhouse ga ses through 
supporting renewable energy development, locating development in areas which reduce the need to 
travel and encouraging greater use of sustainable transport measures. The planning system can also 
reduce the risk posed by climate change by reduci ng the proportion of properties at risk from flooding and 
coastal erosion.  
8.129  The East Marine Plan s aim to facilitate action on climate change adaptation and mitigation . Policy CC1 of 
the East Inshore and Offshore Marine Plan s seeks to ensure  development prop osals take account of 
climate change in their design and how they will reduce impacts on climate change adaptation methods 
elsewhere . 
Flood Risk  
8.130  Flood risk is a significant issue in Waveney. Within Waveney there are approximately 3,900 properties that 
fall within a flood zone as recognised by the Environment Agency. Of these, 73% are within Lowestoft.  
8.131  The National Planning Policy Framework seeks to mitigate the risk of flooding by restricting vulnerable new 
development within areas at risk from flooding. I t does this by requiring development proposals in areas at 
risk from flooding to be subject to a sequential test where it has to be proven there are no suitable areas 
of land with a lesser risk of flooding and an exception test which identifies sustainabil ity benefits of 
development and ensures the development is safe for its lifetime.  
8.132  The Framework requires Local Planning Authorities to prepare a Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to inform 
the Local Plan. A Strategic Flood Risk Assessment was prepared in 20 08 and identified areas at risk from 
flooding both now and in the future after taking climate change into account. Since the publication of the 
2008 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, new flooding models have been prepared by the Environment 
Agency  as well a s modelling from other risk management authorities . As such the Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment has been  updated to get the most up to date understanding of risk.  
8.133  The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment should be used in assessing the flood risk of new develop ment 
proposals. All sources of flooding should be considered including surface water flooding and flooding from 
sewers.  
 Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 235 8.134  The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment has been used in assessing potential sites for allocation in this Local 
Plan. The only sites at ris k from flooding which have been allocated are those within Central Lowestoft 
where the regeneration needs of that area necessitate development within a flood zone. The policies 
allocating these sites require that they are safe from flooding. Furthermore, p lans are in place for a 
strategic flood risk defence for Central Lowestoft which will significantly reduce the risk in these locations.  
8.135  As the Local Plan has allocated more than sufficient land for housing, which is considered a more 
vulnerable use, there  is limited justification for additional development proposals for housing in areas of 
flood risk. Therefore, residential developments which are not on allocated sites will not be permitted in 
areas identified as being at risk from flooding within the Stra tegic Flood Risk Assessment. However, there 
may be occasions where there is a particular additional need for housing as identified through the 
preparation of a Neighbourhood Plan. In these situations, housing could be allocated on a site at risk from 
flood ing providing it is demonstrated that there are no other available sites at a lower risk of flooding 
within the Neighbourhood Area and that there are sustainability benefits and that the development can be 
made safe for its lifetime.  
8.136  Feedback from Anglian Water suggests that there is limited capacity for combined sewers to accept new 
surface water flows from new development and that sustainable drainage systems should be the 
preference for dealing with surface water. Sustainable drainage systems can take up  large areas of land on 
development sites and therefore significantly influence the layout. However, this should not be to the 
detriment of good urban design. Sustainable drainage systems should be integrated into the green 
infrastructure provision on the site and complement the overall landscaping scheme of the site . 
Sustainable drainage systems should not be surrounded by palisade fencing and where restrictions to 
access are required due to safety considerations, these should be innovatively designed by l ow impact 
barriers such as landscaping or planting.  
8.137  Well designed drainage systems can deliver environmental improvements including water quality, 
biodiversity and flood risk. Discharges of surface water should be designed to deliver water quality 
improvements to help meet the objectives of the Water Framework Directive. Sustainable drainage 
systems can provide enhancements to aquatic biodiversity. Riparian and floodplain woodlands provide 
flood risk and biodiversity benefits. Developments should be  designed to deliver these benefits wherever 
possible.  
8.138  Work in, under, over or within 8 metres of any fluvial main river, flood defence structure or culvert and 
within 16m of any tidal main river, flood defence structure or culvert may require an environme ntal permit 
for flood risk activities under the Environmental Permitting Regulations (England and Wales) 2016. A 
permit for works on the floodplain beyond the 8/16m distance  may also be need ed if the work  is likely to 
divert or obstruct floodwaters, damage  any river control works or affect drainage. This permit is in addition 
to planning permission.  A Marine License will be required for any works below the high water mark.   District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
236                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP8.24 – Flood Risk  
Development proposals should consider flooding from all sources and take in to account climate change. 
Proposals at risk of flooding (taking in to account impacts from climate change) should only be granted 
planning permission if it can be demonstrated that:  
 There are no available sites suitable  for the propose d use in areas with a lower 
probability of flooding;  
 The development provides sustainability benefits which outweigh flood risk; and  
 A site specific flood risk assessment has been submitted which demonstrates that the 
flood risk can be satisfactorily mitig ated over the lifetime of the development. This 
should address as a minimum: finished floor levels; safe access and egress; an 
emergency flood plan; flood resilience/resistance measures; any increase in built or 
surfaced area; and any impact on flooding el sewhere  including on the natural 
environment . 
 
New residential development on sites not allocated in this Local Plan or a Neighbourhood Plan will not be 
permitted on sites at risk from flooding.  
 
Developments should use sustainable drainage systems to drai n surface water. Sustainable drainage 
systems should be integrated into the landscaping scheme and the green infrastructure provision of the 
development and not detract from the design quality of the scheme.  They should deliver water quality and 
aquatic bi odiversity improvements wherever possible.  
 
No surface water connections should be made to the foul system and connections to the combined or 
surface water system should only be made in exceptional circumstances where there are no feasible 
alternatives (th is applies to new developments and redevelopments). Foul and surface water flows should 
also be separated where possible.  
 
Neighbourhood Plans can allocate land for development, including residential development, in areas at risk 
of flooding providing it c an be demonstrated:  
 There are no available sites suitable  for the proposed use within the Neighbourhood 
Area;  
 The development provides sustainability benefits which outweigh flood risk; and  
 Evidence is provided that it is possible for flood risk to be mit igated to ensure 
development is safe for its lifetime.  
 
The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment should be the starting point in assessing whether a proposal is at risk 
from flooding.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 237 Coastal Change  
8.139  Waveney’s coastline suffers from some of the most dramatic losses of land in the country through coastal 
erosion. Natural processes of erosion, accretion and flooding will continue to affect the coastline and 
estuaries. The nature and extent of coastal man agement measures will be influenced by and will 
significantly impact upon coastal communities, the local economy, the natural environment and 
infrastructure of the area.  
8.140  The National Plannin g Policy Framework states that local p lans should reduce the risk  from coastal change 
by restricting inappropriate development in vulnerable areas or development which  causes  detrimental 
physical change s to the coast. It states that local p lans should identify Coastal Change Management Areas 
which cover areas likely to be affected by physical changes to the coast. The National Planning Practice 
Guidance states that a Coastal Change Management Area should be defined where change is likely to be 
significant over the next 100 years. The Guidance states that Shoreline Manage ment Plans should be taken 
into acco unt. The Framework states that local p lans should be clear as to what development will be 
appropriate in the Coastal Change Management Areas and in what circumstances. The National Planning 
Practice Guidance states that permanent, new residential development will not be appropriate within a 
Coastal Change Management Area but some commercial and community development may be 
appropriate with the area depending on the level of risk and the sustainability of the proposals.  
8.141  The Marine and Coastal Access Act (2009) sets out provisions for the creation of a continuous, signed and 
managed path around the entire English coast. The Framework states that development should not 
undermine this objective.  
8.142  Shoreline Management Plans se t out how the coastline should be managed. Shoreline Management Plans 
determine appropriate, strategic policies for coastal management that balance the many and often 
competing aspirations of stakeholders with proper regard for economic and environmental s ustainability. 
The primary output is an 'intent for management' over a 100 year timeframe. This overarching vision is 
converted to policy statements for discrete lengths of coast with shared attributes broken down into short, 
medium and long -term time band s. Two plans cover the Waveney Coast, SMP6 covers the area from the 
Kelling Hard in North Norfolk to Lowestoft Ness and SMP7 covers the coastline from Lowestoft Ness to 
Felixstowe. The plans identify the indicative future coastline in 100 years time based on the management 
measures set out in the Plan.  
8.143  Policy WLP8.25 defines a Coastal Change Management Area for Waveney. This is based on the area likely 
to be impacted by coastal change within the next 100 years (2005 baseline) as identified by the Shoreline  
Management Plans. This essentially comprises the area between the current shoreline and the expected 
coastline in 100 years as identified in the Shoreline Management Plans. It should be noted that the 
expected future coastline as identified in the Shoreli ne Management Plans is not precise and typically 
represents a mid -point of a range of where the coastline might be in 100 years. In line with national 
planning policy, permanent new residential development is restricted in this area. However, there is scope 
for other types of development which help maintain the vitality and viability of coastal communities and 
allow them to adjust to coastal change.  District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
238                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  8.144  All planning applications for development within the coastal change management area need to be 
accompanied by a Coastal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment. The assessment should consider the 
management proposals for the coastline and the likelihood of investments being made and the risk of 
erosion impacting upon the development in light of these factors. The assessment should demonstrate 
that the development will not be at risk from coastal change for the lifetime of the development . In this 
regard, the assessment should comply with polic y CC1 of the East Inshore and Offshore Marine Plans. The 
assessment will also need to demonstrate that the proposed development will not increase the risk of 
erosion (e.g. from surface water run -off).  
8.145  There are inherent uncertainties with coastal change a nd the likely level of erosion over a 100 year period. 
There will always be a lack of certainty over the potential for investments to be made in the management 
of the coast. As such, any planning applications for development within 30 metres of the Coastal  Change 
Management Area should also be accompanied by a Coastal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment. 
Additionally, develop ments  in other areas close to the Coastal Change Management Area should strongly 
consider whether any essential infrastructure which will  support the proposed development is at risk from 
being lost to erosion.  
8.146  Shoreline Management Plans provide a strategic approach to the management of the coast. As such, 
proposals for new coastal management works should be in accordance with the managemen t policies 
identified in the Shoreline Management Plans. Where there is a need and or a desire to develop a coastal 
management scheme that is contrary to the current Shoreline Management Plan this should be dealt with 
through a review of the Shoreline Mana gement Plan prior to a planning application being considered.  
8.147  The Development and Coastal Change Supplementary Planning Document (2013) has been prepared to aid 
in the interpretation of the coastal change policies. The Supplementary Planning Document will be 
updated following adoption of the Local Plan.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 239 Policy WLP8.25 – Coastal Change Management Area  
The Coastal Change Management Area is identified on the Policies Map.  Reputable and scientifically robust 
evidence that eme rges over the lifetime of this P lan which effects the delineation of the Coastal Change 
Management Area should be considered when applying this policy.  
Proposals for n ew, permanent  residential development including conversion of existing buildings will not 
be permitted in the Coastal Change Management Area .  
In parts of the Coastal Change Management Area expected to be at risk from change within a 20 year time 
horizon, only temporary development directly related to the coast, such as beach huts, cafés, car parks 
and sites used for touring caravan and camping will be permitted.  
In parts of the Coastal Change Management Area expected to be at risk from change beyond a 20 y ear 
time horizon, other commercial and community uses will be permitted providing they require a coastal 
location and provide economic and social benefits to the local community.  
Essential infrastructure, including transport infrastructure, utility infras tructure and wind turbines will only 
be permitted in the Coastal Change Management Area where no other sites outside of the Area are 
feasible and there is a management plan in place to manage the impact of coastal change including the ir 
future removal and replacement.  
All planning applications for development within the Coastal Change Management Area and 30 metres 
inland should be accompanied by a Coastal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment which demonstrates that the 
development will not result in an increas ed risk to life or property.  
Planning permission for all development within the Coastal Change Management Area will be time -limited 
according to the risk identified in the Coastal Erosion Vulnerability Assessment.  
Proposals for new or replacement coastal d efence schemes will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that the works are consistent with the management approach for the frontage presented in 
the relevant Shoreline Management Plan and there will be no material adverse impact on the 
environme nt. 
 
  District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
240                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  8.148  Significant numbers of residential properties and commercial properties are at risk from coastal erosion 
within the next 100 years. A small number of properties at Easton Bavents are at the most imminent risk 
and a number of properties have already  been lost to erosion over the last 5 years.  
8.149  Under the existing Shoreline Management Plan, some parts of Corton are projected to be affected by 
erosion within the next 50 years. However, revisions to the Shoreline Management Plan through the 
Gorleston to L owestoft Coastal Strategy (2016) will mean that providing investments are made, properties 
should be safe for the next 50 years. However, many properties are likely to be at risk between 50 to 100 
years time.  
8.150  The National Plannin g Policy Framework states t hat local p lans should make provision for development 
and infrastructure that needs to be relocated away from Coastal Change Management Areas. The National 
Planning Practice Guidance advises that either formally allocating land in a Local Plan or allowing for 
relocation where planning permission would normally be refused are two ways in which this can be 
achieved. The Council considers that the relocation and replacement of agricultural land is not a viable 
option. However, it is considered feasible to relo cate and replace agricultural buildings that are required to 
meet the essential needs of an agricultural development.  
8.151  Policy WLP8.26 allows for the relocation of residential, community , agricultural  and commercial properties 
within the Coastal Change Manag ement Area and at risk of erosion to areas inland defined as the 
Countryside where development is normally restricted by Policy WLP1.3 of the Local Plan. Properties must 
be at risk from erosion within a 20 year period. This enables property owners to take a pro -active approach 
to relocate to an alternative location well before erosion becomes an imminent threat. In order to 
maintain the sustainability of coastal settlements, relocation should take place close to the existing 
community. Relocation of residen tial properties should also be to land which is outside of the Coastal 
Change Management Area.   
8.152  Alternative land uses within C oastal Change Management Areas that contribu te to the sustainability of 
coastal communities  and also reduce the risk of coastal er osion  are encouraged . Such uses will be 
evaluated on a case by case basis.

242                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Renewable and Low Carbon Energy  
8.153  Planning plays a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One way in which planning can achieve 
this is by being supportive of well conceived renewable energy developments. Waveney is already home to 
a number of renewable energy and low carbon develo pments, including wind turbines in Lowestoft, 
Kessingland and Holton, solar farms around Ellough and an anaerobic digester in Ellough.  
8.154  The National Plan ning Policy Framework requires l ocal plans to develop  a positive strategy to promote 
energy from renewa ble and low carbon sources. The Framework encourages local plans to maximise 
renewable and low carbon energy development, consider identifying suitable areas for development and 
support community -led initiatives for renewable and low carbon energy. A writt en ministerial statement 
(18 June 2015) adds further to national policy with respect to wind farms which states that wind energy 
development should only be permitted if the site is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy 
development in a Local Pl an or Neighbourhood Plan and following consultation, it can be demonstrated 
that the planning impacts identified by affected local communities have been fully addressed and 
therefore the proposal has their backing.  
8.155  Not all renewable energy and low carbon developments within Waveney are determined by Waveney 
District Council as the planning authority. The Council is only responsible for renewable and low carbon 
energy development of 50 megawatts or less installed capacity.  
8.156  Whilst the Council is keen to sup port renewable energy developments, it is aware that these 
developments can have significant negative effects on the environment, including design, heritage, 
biodiversity and landscape.  There p roposals for renewable energy will be considered against Polici es 
WLP8.29, WLP8.3 4, WLP8.3 5, WLP8.3 6, WLP8.3 7, WLP8.3 8 and WLP8.3 9. The impact of renewable energy 
developments can extend to neighbouring District s and the Broads Authority and consideration may be 
required of neighbouring landscape character and Local P lans. Renewable and low carbon energy 
developments can also have an affect on amenity of residents , visitors  and workers nearby through, noise, 
smell, shadow flicker and glare. Developments can also cause safety issues, such as distraction of drivers 
and e quipment failure. The National Planning Practice Guidance gives a full range of considerations for 
different types of renewable and low carbon technology. The Council will use this when determining 
applications for renewable and low carbon energy developme nt.  
8.157  The Government places great emphasis on local people being in control of delivering renewable and low 
carbon energy developments. The Council therefore believes that Neighbourhood Plans are best placed to 
identify suitable areas for renewable and low carbon energy projects. As Neighbourhood Plans have to go 
through a referendum, this is a key way of demonstrating local support and commitment to a local 
renewable and low carbon energy project. Suitable areas identified in Neighbourhood Plans will need t o be 
in conformity with all of the policies of this Local Plan, but particularly Policies WLP8.29, WLP8.3 4, 
WLP8.3 5, WLP8.3 6, WLP8.3 7, WLP8.3 8 and WLP8.3 9 on design, biodiversity, the landscape and the 
historic environment.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 243 Policy WLP8.27 – Renewable and Low Carbon Energy  
The Council will support Neighbourhood Plans in identifying suitable areas for renewable and low carbon 
energy development.   
Renewable and low carbon energy schemes will be permitted where:   
 There are no significant adverse effects on the amenities of nearby properties  or 
businesses , there are no adverse safety impacts and no significant adverse effects on 
the transport network; or  
 The proposal is in a suitable area for renewable and low carbon energy as identified in a 
Neigh bourhood Plan. For wind energy the proposed development must also have the 
backing of the community.   
Cumulative effects and the impact of ancillary infrastructure will form part of the assessment for planning 
applications for renewable and low carbon ener gy developments.  
When the technology is no longer operational there is a requirement to decommission, remove the facility 
and complete a restoration of the site to its original condition.

244                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Sustainable Construction  
8.158  New development can contribute signif icantly to climate change though the generation of carbon 
emissions during construction and in subsequent use.  
8.159  The energy and water efficiency of new buildings is controlled by Building Regulations. However, there is 
still a role for the planning system. For water efficiency the Government has introduced an optional 
technical standard that requires new housing to go further than building regulations and be designed to 
consume 110 litres/person/day as opposed to 125 litres/person/day. Additionally Local Pla nning 
Authorities can encourage developers to consider improvements to the energy efficiency and the 
sustainability of buildings with respect to carbon emissions.  
8.160  The Waveney Renewable Energy and Sustainable Construction Supplementary Planning Document (2 009) 
indicated that new office and school development could viably achieve the enhanced sustainability 
standard of ‘Very Good’ as set by the British Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method. 
There is no evidence to suggest that circumstances have changed which would mean this standard can no 
longer be met.  
8.161  The Waveney Water Cycle Study (2017) identifies that whilst Essex and Suffolk Water predict there to be a 
surplus supply of water over the plan period to 2036, the area is within an area of  water stress as 
identified by the Environment Agency. Demand management is part of Essex and Suffolk Water’s strategy 
to ensure there are sufficient resources over the period. The study estimates that the cost of achieving the 
enhanced building control re gulation is very low and could help contribute to achieving 52% water 
neutrality in the District (where the amount of water used before planned growth is the same as that after  
growth).  
8.162  Policy WLP8.28 sets out the Council’s approach to securing and encouraging the development of more 
sustainable buildings to lower energy and water usage and help reduce the District’s contribution to 
climate change.   
8.163  A key element of the policy is requiring a sustainability statement to be submitted with a planning 
application for major development11 demonstrating how the developer has considered improvements to 
the sustainability of the buildings and the development. The policy also applies the optional building 
regulation standard for new dwellings in terms of water e fficiency and requires new school and office 
development to achieve the ‘Very Good’ standard set by the British Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Method. In demonstrating that the development achieves ‘Very Good’, design stage 
certificates wi ll be required and planning conditions will require the submission of post -construction 
certificates.  
 
                                                             
11 As defined in the Development Management Procedure Order 2010 (as amended) i.e. 10 or more houses or 1,000sqm floorspace of n on-

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 245 Policy WLP8.28 – Sustainable Construction  
Proposals for major residential development of 10 or more houses and commercial development schemes 
of 1,000sq m or more of floor space should demonstrate through the submission of a sustainability 
statement that, where practical, they have incorporated:  
 Improved efficiency of heating, cooling, and lighting of buildings by maximising daylight 
and passive solar gain through the orientation and design of buildings.  
 Sustainable water management measures such as the use of sustainable drainage 
systems, green roofs and/or rainwater harvesting systems.  
 Locally sourced and recycled materials.  
 Renewable and low carbon energy  generation into the design of new developments. 
Larger schemes should explore the scope for District  heating.  
 Minimising construction waste, including designing out waste during the design stage, 
selecting sustainable and efficient building materials and reusing materials where 
possible.  
 Accessible and unobtrusive sustainable waste management facilities such as adequate  
provision of refuse/recycling/composting bin storage . 
 A show home demonstrating environmentally sustainable options which can be 
purchased  and installed in homes bought off -plan.  
All new residential development in the District should achieve the optional technical standard in terms of 
water efficiency of 110 litres/person/day unless it can be demonstrated that it is not viable or feasible to  
do so.  
All new office and school developments in Waveney of equal or greater than 1 ,000sqm gross floorspace 
are required to achieve the British Research Establishment E nvironmental Assessment Method ‘ Very 
Good ’ standard or equivalent unless it can be dem onstrated that it is not viable or feasible to do so.  
 
District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
246                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Design  
8.164  High quality design is a critical part of good planning and sustainable development and should contribute 
positively to making places better for people. Good design is concerned not only with  how development 
looks but also how it feels and functions.   
Design Quality  
8.165  The National Planning Policy Framework identifies high quality design and amenity standards as a core 
planning principle. Section 7 of the Framework sets national planning policy o n design. Local plans are 
expected to develop robust policies which set out the quality of development expected for the area. 
Design considerations are not limited to the design of buildings and will also apply to connections between 
people and places as w ell as integrating new development in to the natural, built and historic environment. 
Weight should be given to innovative designs which help to improve the standard of design in the area. 
Where appropriate, design projects should be referred to a design r eview panel. National Planning Practice 
Guidance seeks to use planning policies to improve crime prevention, access and inclusion, safe and 
connected streets, cohesive neighbourhoods and provision of services.  
8.166  A framework of good design principles provide s guidance for the design of new development without 
imposing architectural styles or stifling creativity. Application of such principles can accommodate 
different architectural styles whilst complementing and strengthening local distinctiveness. Innovativ e 
design is encouraged where it demonstrates a high quality design approach and is respectful of its setting.  
8.167  It is a primary aim of the planning system that development should deliver good standards of amenity for 
existing and future occupiers and surroun ding uses and does not generate significant harmful effects. 
Harmful effects can arise from overlooking, loss of privacy, noise and light pollution, and overbearing 
development amongst others. Such effects can be triggered by individual developments or as a result of 
cumulative impacts. The impact can be acute or dispersed, affecting the general amenity or tranquillity of 
an area.  
8.168  It is vitally important that new development integrates with its surroundings. Design of new development 
should take account of important landscape or topographical features and make best use of them. 
Retention and/or enhancement of natural and semi -natural features will help with the integration of new 
development and provide biodiversity and drainage benefits. They can improve ec ological connectivity by 
providing green links and networks. These could include woodlands, trees, hedgerows, ponds, 
watercourses, and geological features amongst others. Landscaping, both hard and soft, makes a key 
contribution to the overall quality and feel of development and proposals should provide details of good 
quality landscaping. Particular care should be taken with developments on the edge of settlements, 
ensuring the development is readily integrated in to the overall setting.   
8.169  Promoting public safety and discouraging crime and disorder are important outputs of a well designed 
scheme. Development proposals should incorporate ‘Secured by Design’ principles and encourage natural 
surveillance over public areas. Particular care will be required in th e design of car parking areas, Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 247 landscaped areas, public spaces and pedestrian routes in order to avoid creating crime and disorder issues.  
Development proposals should give early consideration to access by emergency vehicles, plus hard 
standing and provisi on of fire hydrants for fire service vehicles. The Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service strongly 
encourage the provision of automated sprinkler systems.  
8.170  Developments should facilitate accessibility and connectivity within and across the site. Existing footpaths , 
cycle routes and bridleways on the site should be retained. Links should be incorporated to new and/or 
existing transport routes of all types outside of the site.  Car parking should be well integrated in 
developments and car dominated environments avoide d. 
8.171  Recycling and waste management is an important element of a well designed and properly functioning 
development. Therefore adequate and appropriate provision for the storage and collection of waste and 
recyc ling bins must be integrated in to development p roposals.  
8.172  The Council has received feedback indicating there is a perception that design of development in the 
District is not as strong as it should be. Effective design policies alongside understanding and enhancing 
the distinctive qualities of the Distr ict are key to addressing this issue. ‘Building for Life 12’ is a Government  
backed standard for well designed homes and neighbourhoods. It is intended to guide discussions 
between Local Planning Authorities, developers and other stakeholders and encourage  better designed 
development. It features a traffic light scoring system across 12 categories to guide assessment of a 
development. In order to raise design standards, major residential developments12 will be expected to 
perform  extremely  positively when as sessed using Building for Life 12.  This will mean scoring green 
outcomes of the vast majority of indicators and avoiding red outcomes unless there are exceptional 
circumstances.

District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
248                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP8.29 – Design  
Development proposals will be expected to demonstrate high quality design which reflects local 
distinctiveness. In so doing proposals should:  
 Demonstrate a clear understanding of the form and character of the built and natural 
environment and use this understanding to complement local character an d 
distinctiveness;  
 Respond to local context and the form of surrounding buildings in relation to:  
o the overall scale and character  
o layout  
o site coverage  
o height and massing of existing buildings  
o the relationship between buildings and spaces and the wider stre et scene or 
townscape  
o and by making use of materials and detailing appropriate to the local 
vernacular;  
 Take account of any important landscape or topographical features and retain and/or 
enhance existing landscaping and natural and semi -natural features o n site;  
 Protect the amenity of the wider environment, neighbouring uses and provide a good 
standard of amenity for future occupiers of the proposed development;  
 Take into account the need to promote public safety and deter crime and disorder;  
 Create permeable and legible developments which are easily accessed and used by all, 
regardless of age, mobility and disability;  
 Provide highway layouts with  well integrated car parking and landscaping which create a 
high quality public realm, avoiding the percep tion of a car dominated environment;  
 Include hard and soft landscaping schemes to aid the integration of the development 
into its surroundings; and  
 Ensure that the layout and design incorporates adequate provision for the storage and 
collection of waste an d recycling bins.  
Development proposals which fail to meet the above criteria will be refused planning permission.  
Major residential development proposals will be supported where they perform positively when assessed 
against Building for Life 12 guidelines. Developments should avoid red outcomes unless there are 
exceptional circumstances.   
Innovative design will be str ongly supported where it meets the above criteria.  
Neighbourhood Plans can, and are encouraged to, set out design policies which respond to their own local 
circumstances.  
 Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 249 Design of Open Spaces  
8.173  Open Space is an essential part of the rural and urban fabri c and is a vital resource for local communities. It 
plays a pivotal role in the quality of life for people from determining a person’s health and well -being, 
contributing to the character of our townscapes and providing habitats for wildlife. Open spaces s hould 
provide facilities that are accessible and meet the needs and expectations of the local community, and 
ensure communities have a high quality of life for residents and visitors.   
8.174  Where open space is provided this should be designed to a high standard  and be well integrated into the 
surrounding area to encourage people to use it and enhance the public realm. New open space should 
demonstrate a clear function and be of a size and layout to provide recreation and public amenity value for 
the community in  the long term.  
8.175  Each new area of open space should have at least two good street frontages and be well overlooked, with 
adjacent properties facing the open space as much as possible. Entrances and connections with streets 
and spaces should also be well ove rlooked and support desire lines. Landscaping should be provided that 
will support formal and informal activities such as play and stimulate visual interest. Where areas for 
informal ball games are provided these should be level. The planting and landscapi ng should connect into 
the wider green infrastructure network wherever possible in order to support wildlife and enhance the 
public realm.  
8.176  Policy WLP1.4 states that housing development sites of 1 hectare or more should provide open space on 
site and be bas ed on the needs identified in the Green Infrastructure Strategy and the Open Space Needs 
Assessment. Incorporation of open space into residential developments is fundamental to the creation of 
an environment that will meet the expectations of residents. To  deliver a successful scheme open space in 
appropriate quantity and quality should be considered early in the design process. Well designed  amenity 
space within a development may include open areas where people can gather, relax and play. Open spaces 
shoul d be complemented by other amenity spaces such as greenways and verges that link different areas 
of the development and adjacent areas. They also provide visual links within and between developments. 
Orientation is important as spaces that receive greater amounts of natural light are more likely to support 
community use and provide a more attractive environment.  
8.177  Fields In Trust provide benchmark guidelines for the quantity, accessibility and quality of formal outdoor 
space, equipped/designated play space, and informal outdoor space. The benchmark guidelines include 
recommendations relative to the scale of development, walking distances from dwellings, and where 
necessary, minimum buffer zones with dwellings.  These guideline should be referred to when design ing 
schemes.   District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
250                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP8.30  – Design  of Open Spaces  
Proposals involving the  creation of open space should demonstrate that the design is inclusive of p eople of 
all ages and abilities. In doing so proposals involving the creation of open space should demon strate that 
the design has considered the following:  
 Location  
o Open spaces should be integral to the new development and relate strongly to new 
and existing developments.  
o Open spaces should serve catchment areas that are not already served by existing 
open spaces.  
 Access  
o Accessible without crossing main roads.  
o Separated from areas of major vehicle movement.  
o Provide footpaths with suitable non -slip surfaces.  
o Provide g ood connections with local footpaths and cycle paths.  
 Layout  
o Incorporate existing landscape features such as trees and hedgerows.  
o Orientated to receive adequate sunlight.  
o Safe places  with overlooking  from nearby dwellings and other active uses  and a 
strong relationship to t he street and nearby properties . 
o Incorporate buffer zones to reduce the disturbance to immediate dwellings.  
 Use 
o Demonstrate a clear function and support formal and informal activities and 
biodiversity .  
o Provide opportunities for a range of recreational activities to appeal to different 
ages and abilities . 
 Appearance  
o Designed a nd landscaped to a high standard to enhance the public realm.  
o Contributes to the local distinctive character of the area.  
 
Lifetime Design  
8.178  Central to the Vision of this Local Plan is the creation of a healthy environment and a healthy population. 
Waveney  has an ageing population and t he number of people over the age of 70 is projected to increase 
by nearly 12,000  over the plan period . Waveney also has a high proportion of households with a disabled 
resident with 40% of households in the District having at  least one resident with a disability.  It is therefore 
important that the design of the built environment caters for people throughout their lifetime and is 
suitable and accessible for people regardless of age, mobility or disability. It is also important that new 
dwellings are designed to be adaptable and accessible to meet people’s changing needs through life.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 251 Dementia Friendly Design Principles  
Familiar environments  
Functions of places and buildings are obvious, architectural 
features and street furniture are of a design familiar to or easily 
understood by older people;  
Legible environments  
A hierarchy of street types, streets are short and fairly narrow, 
streets are well connected. Entrances to places and buildings 
are clearly visible and obvious. Signs are minima l. Clear signs at 
decision points;  
Distinctive environments  
A variety of landmarks. A variety of welcoming open spaces. 
Architectural features in a variety of styles, colours and 
materials. There is a variety of practical features such as trees 
and street furniture;  
Accessible environments  
Land uses are mixed with shops and services within a 5 -10 
minute walk from housing. Entrances to places are obvious and 
easy to use;  
Comfortable environments  
Open space is well defined with toilets, seating, shelter and 
good lighting. Background and traffic noise should be minimised 
through planting and fencing. Street clutter is minimal to not 
impede walking or distract attention;  
Safe environments  
Footpaths are wide, flat and non -slip, development is orientated 
to avoid  creating dark shadows or bright glare.  8.179  The incidence  of dementia is increasing across 
the country as the age of the population 
increases. The R oyal Town Planning Institute  has 
produced detailed guidance on how 
developments can be designed to support 
people with dementia. Creating familiar, legible, 
distinctive, accessible, comfortable and safe 
environments can improve the ability of people 
living with dementia to live well. Dementia 
friendly design princ iples should be incorporated 
where appropriate using the principles outline in 
the policy below.  Specifically, the larger sites 
allocated in this Local Plan by Policies WLP2.4, 
WLP2.13, WLP2.16 and WLP3.1 should be 
designed in order to meet these principle s. 
Many principles of ‘good design’ that support 
those with dementia result in well designed 
spaces and places that benefit the community as 
whole.  
8.180  Dementia friendly design principles should be 
incorporated where appropriate using the 
principles outline d in Policy WLP8.31 .  
8.181  National planning policy allows local planning 
authorities to set optional technical standards 
for new housing. One of these standards relates 
to accessibility /adaptability  and wheelchair housing standards. The optional technical standar ds for 
accessibility in dwellings are set out in Document M of the Building Regulations 2010. This includes both 
M4(2), accessible and adaptable dwellings and M4(3), wheelchair user dwellings categories.  Modelling 
undertaken in the Strategic Housing Market  Assessment indicates a 40% growth in households comprising 
people with an age of 65 and above.  The Whole Plan Viability Study (2018) indicates that the cost of 
achieving this standard is not excessive and has only a marginal impact on viability.  Policy WL P8.31  
therefore applies the M4 (2) standard to 40% of new  properties. Exceptionally, due to the topography of 
the site or flood risk where it is not possible to achieve step -free access, these requirements will not be 
imposed.  District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
252                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Policy WLP8.31  – Lifetime Design  
Proposals for housing  developments of 10 or more dwellings  should demonstrate that the design supports 
the needs of older people and those with dementia  through the creation of environments which are;  
 Familiar  
 Legible  
 Distinctive  
 Accessible  
 Comfortable, and  
 Safe  
All new housing developments on sites with a capacity of 10 dwellings or more must make provision for 
40% of all dwellings to meet Requirement M4(2) of Part M of the Building Regulations for accessible and 
adaptable dwellings. Dwellin gs that meet Requirement M4(3) of Part M of the Building Regulations will be 
supported and can count towards the requirement above .  
 
Housing Density and Design  
8.182  It is important to make efficient use of land whilst delivering high quality developments whic h complement 
local distinctiveness. The National Planning Policy Framework allows Local Planning Authorities to set their 
own approach to housing density.  
8.183  Lowestoft and the market towns are built up areas with characteristically higher densities of develo pment 
and benefit from greater provision of services and facilities. Higher densities in these settlements will 
therefore complement the existing urban density levels and deliver more houses in sustainable locations. 
Development in these locations should b e of an urban scale at a minimum density of 30 dwellings per 
hectare. In the central areas of Lowestoft and the market towns densities much higher than 30 dwellings 
per hectare can be appropriate where they reflect the local character of development and ar e well served 
by public transport.  
8.184  Outside of Lowestoft and the market towns housing density will vary and housing densities should reflect 
local character.  
8.185  Development s in an urban context should be appropriately designed to define and enclose urban spac es 
(which includes streets) using buildings and structures. This can help to create places with a sense of 
identity and improve local distinctiveness.  
8.186  A key element is the high level of continuity in the built frontage using buildings of appropriate heigh t and 
width. Detached buildings are ineffective in enclosing spaces and work best at lower densities with 
landscaping around them. Urban scale developments should therefore make use of terraced and semi -
detached buildings in providing continuous built fron tages to enclose space. Where detached buildings are 
grouped together in high density schemes the result is often poorly defined with indistinct places and Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 253 spaces. Urban scale developments must therefore demonstrate a higher proportion of terraced and semi -
detached properties than detached properties. Buildings and structures forming developments at an urban 
scale of 30 dwellings per hectare and above should therefore be designed to enclose space.  
8.187  Housing density is calculated using only the site areas whic h will be developed for housing and directly 
associated uses. These uses will include access roads within the site, private garden space, car parking 
areas, open space, landscaping and small children’s play areas, where these are provided.   
 
Policy WLP8.3 2 – Housing Density and Design  
Proposals for residential development will be permitted provided that the development makes best use of 
the site in a manner that protects or enhances the distinctiveness and character of the area and takes into 
account the ph ysical environment of the site and its surroundings.  
Development proposa ls in and adjacent to the built up area of Lowestoft and the market towns should aim 
for urban scale development at a density of at least 30 dwellings per hectare, unless local charac ter 
indicates otherwise.  
Urban scale development proposals should use buildings and structures to enclose spaces and create 
places of individual and distinctive identity. Urban scale development should avoid detached buildings 
which are narrowly separated and do not effectively enclose spaces and should demonstrate a greater 
proportion of terraced or semi -detached properties than detached properties.  
Neighbourhood Plans can set their own policies for housing density which respond to local circumstances.

254                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Residential Gardens and Urban Infilling  
8.188  New development in gardens or other plots of land (such as parking areas) in urban areas can provide 
valuable new homes in sustainable locations. However, it is common for such sites to be very sensitive to 
new dev elopment by virtue of their close proximity to nearby homes and relationship to existing 
development and therefore require careful planning. The National Planning Policy Framework allows Local 
Planning Authorities to set out policies to control new develop ment on residential gardens where it may 
cause harm.  
8.189  Consultation on the Local Plan has identified a number of negative issues in connection with this type of 
development. These included cramped development, poor amenity spaces, amenity issues, unsuitable 
access and poor relationships to existing buildings. Setting out parameters to help prevent harm arising 
from such common issues can enable new homes to be delivered where appropriate whilst safeguarding 
existing homes and the wider environment.  
 
Policy WL P8.3 3 – Residential Gardens and Urban Infilling  
Housing development on garden and other urban infill sites will be supported where they satisfy the 
following criteria:  
 The scale, design and siting of the proposal is in keeping with the character and density 
of the surrounding development and would not generat e a cramped form of 
development.  
 Attractive, useable and proportionately sized amenity spaces and adequate parking and 
turning spaces are provided for the proposed and existing dwellings.  
 The pr oposal, by way of design, siting and materials integrates into the surrounding 
built, natural, and where  necessary historic environment.  
 The living conditions of proposed and existing properties are not unacceptably harmed 
through means such as overlookin g, loss of light, or overbearing forms of development;  
 Safe access is provided which does not generate significant harm to the c haracter or 
amenity of the area.  
 Safeguard protected trees.  
Neighbourhood Plans are able to set their own policies on this type  of development which respond to local

Biodiversity  
8.190  Wildlife sites, flora and fauna and geological features are an 
important resource for current and future generations. The 
Council will seek to protect both formal ly designated sites and 
other areas of wildlife and geological interest. Within Waveney 
District there are several internationally and nationally important 
geological sites and wildlife habitats. These include Special 
Protection Areas, Special Areas of Con servation, Ramsar Sites, 
National Nature Reserves, Sites of Special Scientific Interest and 
Ancient Woodland. A number of sites within and adjoining the Waveney area are recognised as 
internationally important for wildlife conservation, such as Benacre and  Easton Bavents Lagoons and areas 
of geological importance that include Corton Cliffs and Covehithe.   
8.191  Suffolk Wildlife Trust in conjunction with Suffolk County Council have identified a substantial number of 
regionally important wildlife sites within the Local Plan area, known as County Wildlife Sites. Suffolk has a 
list of local Biodiversity Action Plan s pecies and habitats which are important to protect and enhance.  
8.192  Sites protected for their biodiversity and geodiversity value are identified  on the Policies Map. Other non -
protected green spaces contribute towards the wider green infrastructure network an d are shown on the 
Policies Map.   
8.193  The National Planning Policy Framework gives significant protection to the internationally and nationally 
protected sites referre d to above. It also encourages local p lans to develop criteria based policies to assess 
the impact of development on wildlife and geodiversity sites. It states the level of protection should be 
commensurate with the level at which the site is designated (i.e. international, national and local). The 
Framework encourages positive planning at the la ndscape scale for the creation and enhancement of 
ecological and green infrastructure networks.  
8.194  The Waveney Green Infrastructure Strategy (2015) identifies green infrastructure networks within built up 
areas in the District which could be used to help info rm how new development can positively contribute 
towards enhancing green infrastructure to benefit biodiversity.  
8.195  Policy WLP8.3 4 sets out the approach to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and geodiversity within 
Waveney. The policy seeks to give an appr opriate amount of protection to locally protected sites of 
biodiversity and geodiversity value as well as species and natural features found on sites. It also 
encourages the provision of features within developments which can support biodiversity and ecolo gical 
networks. Such features could include roosting or nesting spots on trees and buildings for birds and bats, 
features which enable permeability for hedgehogs and water features such as ponds.  
8.196  Development proposals should be accompanied by sufficient i nformation to assess the effects of 
development on protected sites, species, biodiversity or geology, together with any proposed prevention, 
District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

species distr ibution data for development sites and further information is also available from the Suffolk 
Wildlife Trust. Natural England can provide detailed information regarding sites of geological importance.  
8.197  The Habitat Regulations Assessment for the Local Plan c oncludes that the level of development planned in 
the District which is within 13km of  some Special Protection Areas and Special Areas for Conservation will 
cause recreational disturbance.  The assessment identifies a mitigation strategy which will be appli ed 
across Waveney, Suffolk Coastal, Ipswich, Mid Suffolk and Babergh District Council areas.  The strategy will 
be included in a Supplementary Planning Document which will be adopted by the relevant authorities. The 
strategy will in  will include a requireme nt for developers to make financial contributions  towards the 
provision of strategic mitigation within defined zones.  The strategy together with the extensive green 
infrastructure provided on the site allocations in this Local Plan will mitigate effects on  protected sites.   
Policy WLP8.3 4 – Biodiversity and Geodiversity  
Development will be supported where it can be demonstrated that it maintains, restores or enhances the 
existing green infrastructure network and positively contributes towards biodiversity t hrough the creation 
of new green infrastructure and improvement to linkages between habitats. Regard should be had to the 
Waveney Green Infrastructure Strategy  (2015) . 
Proposals that will have a direct or indirect adverse impact on locally recognised sites  of biodiversity or 
geodiversity importance, including County Wildlife Sites, Biodiversity Action Plan habitats and species, will 
not be supported unless it can be demonstrated that new opportunities to enhance the green 
infrastructure network will be prov ided as part of the development that will mitigate or compensate for 
this loss.  
Where compensatory habitat is created, it should be of equal or greater size than the area lost as a result 
of the development, be well located to positively contribute towards  the green infrastructure network and 
biodiversity and be supported with a management plan.  
Where there is reason to suspect the presence of protected species  or habitat , applications should  be 
supported by an ecological survey undertaken by a suitably qua lified person. If present the proposal must 
be sensitive to, and make provision for their needs.  
Any development with the potential to impact on a Special Protection Area or Special Area for 
Conservation within or outside of the District will need to be su pported by information to inform a  Habitat 
Regulations Assessment.  
A Supplementary Planning Document will be prepared to implement a Recreational Avoidance and 
Mitigation Strategy in order to mitigate any impacts on Special Protection Areas and Special Ar eas for 
Conservation.  The Council will work with neighbouring authorities and Natural England to develop a this 
strategy. The strategy will include a requirement for developers to make financial contributions  towards 
the provision of strategic mitigation w ithin defined zones.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 257 Landscape Character  
8.198  Waveney District is characterised by landscapes associated with the coast, river valleys and open 
countryside. Together these have contributed towards shaping historical patterns of development and the 
identity of local communities. The District shares part of the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty and part of the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads (The Broads Authority is the Planning Authority 
for the Broads). These nationally designated landsc apes benefit from significant levels of protection in 
national planning policy and the Council will apply national planning policy to proposals within the Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty to ensure its protection. The National Planning Policy Framework a lso 
supports the protection of locally valued landscapes.  
8.199  The Waveney District Landscape Character Assessment (2008) identifies and describes distinctive 
landscape character areas throughout the District. Ten landscape character areas were identified inclu ding 
Rural Wooded Valley, Rural River Valley, Coastal Broads and Marshes, Dunes, Coastal Levels and Resorts, 
Coastal Cliffs, Settled Farmland, Tributary Valley Farmland, Farmed Plateau Clayland, Estuarine Marsh and 
Sandlings. These have been further sub -divided into component landscape character areas each with 
distinct and recognisable local, and often historic, identity.  
8.200  The Landscape Character Assessment sets out specific details about each landscape character area 
including ‘sensitivities’, ‘strategic o bjectives’ and ‘considerations in relation to development’. Appendix 7  
provides a summary of the key attributes and strategic objectives for each landscape character area.  
8.201  The Rural River Valleys and Tributary Valley Farmland character areas are identifie d in the Landscape 
Character Assessment as being valued landscapes that are particularly sensitive to change.  
8.202  Within the District, the area along the Waveney Valley is adjacent the Broads National Park. These 
adjacent areas share many similar characterist ics. The Broads Landscape Character Assessment (2006) was 
updated in 2012  and 2016 in conjunction with the Broads Landscape Sensitivity Study for Renewables and 
Infrastructure which explored the sensitivity of the landscape to renewable energy development.   
8.203  The Settlement Fringe Landscape Sensitivity Study (2016) builds on the District Landscape Character 
Assessment (2008) and defines the sensitivity of landscapes around key settlements. This information can 
be used, to inform consideration about the effect s of development proposals on the distinctive character, 
qualities and sensitivities of landscapes within the fringes of settlements within the District and on the 
settings of adjacent protected landscapes (the Broads and the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty). The study provides advice on the sensitivity, value and capacity of landscapes 
to accommodate development in the following buffer areas around settlements:   
 Lowestoft – 1,500 metres  
 Market Towns – 1,000 metres  
 Villages – 500 metres  
 District -Wide Strategic Planning Policies  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
258                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  8.204  The assessment supports the findings of the Landscape Character Assessment by identifying Tributary 
Valley Farmland and Rural River Valley landscapes on the fringes of settlements as being valued landscapes 
that are particularly sensitive to chang e.  
8.205  Policy WLP8.3 5 provides protection for all landscape character areas in the District. It requires proposals to 
consider the strategic objectives and considerations identified in the key local landscape evidence referred 
to in the policy. In doing this,  proposals should consider not only how they relate to the local landscap e but 
how they can integrate in to it through good design and landscaping. Landscaping and structural planting 
which reinforces historic field patterns or enhances connectivity within the green infrastructure network 
to the benefit of wildlife will be supported. Consideration should be given to strength of place, visibility, 
value and contribution to designated landscapes. The existing public rights of way network is fragmented 
in many locations and development proposals should consider how they could enhance public footways to 
benefit the network in the long -term.  
8.206  The Policy also gives specific protection from significant impacts on those landscapes which provide a 
setting  which are ou tside of the designated areas  the Br oads and the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
but provide a contribution to the setting of those areas.  Landscapes characterised as Rural River Valleys 
and Tributary Valley Farmland in the Landscape Character Assessmen t are considered sensitive and 
valuable and receive a similar level of protection . Significant adverse impacts will be judged based on the 
scale of the development, the associated effect on the key characteristics which define the sensitivity and 
value of the landscape, the visual impact, the duration and permanency of the effect and the extent to 
which any effects can be mitigated through a landscaping scheme. In assessing impact the Waveney 
District Landscape Character Assessment (2008), the Settlement Fr inge Landscape Sensitivity Study (2016), 
the Broads Landscape Character Assessment (20 16) and the Broads Landscape Sensitivity Study for 
Renewables and Infrastructure (2012) will be used.  
8.207  Conservation of areas recognised for their tranquil character, dark  skies and sense of wildness are key 
management issues recognised in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
Management Plan and by the Broads Authority. Tranquillity and Night Blight Maps prepared by the 
Campaign to Protect Rural E ngland (2007 and 2016 respectively) indicate that the areas with greatest 
tranquillity are located between Kessingland and Reydon within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
and in the rural area near the Saints. These areas are shown to have good (but n ot high) levels of 
tranquillity. The maps also show that Waveney is the one of the darker Districts in the country with much 
of the District darker than regional and national averages. The Broads Authority Night Blight and Dark Skies 
Assessment (2016) iden tified that in the Southern Broads, the darkest skies were located around 
Geldeston. In Waveney District this relates to the area between Mettingham and Shipmeadow.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 259 Policy WLP8.3 5 – Landscape Character  
Proposals for development should be informed by, and be sympathetic to, the distinctive character areas, 
strategic objectives and considerations identified in the Waveney District Landscape Character Assessment 
(2008), the Settlement Fringe Landscape Sensitivity Study (2016), the Broads Landscape Charact er 
Assessment (20 16) and the Broads Landscape Sensitivity Study for Renewables and Infrastructure (2012).  
Development proposals will be expected to demonstrate their location, scale, form, design and materials 
will protect and where possible enhance:  
 The special qualities and local distinctiveness of the area;  
 The visual and historical relationship between settlements and their landscape settings;  
 The pattern of distinctive landscape elements such as watercourses, commons, 
woodland trees, (especially hedge row trees) and field boundaries, and their function as 
ecological corridors; and  
 Visually sensitive skylines, seascapes and significant views towards key landscapes and 
cultural features.  
Proposals should include measures that enable a scheme to be well i ntegrated into the landscape and 
enhance connectivity to the surrounding green infrastructure and Public Rights of Way network.  
Development will not be permitted where it will have a  significant adverse impact on t he setting  of the 
designated areas of the Broads or the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area o f Outstanding Natural Beauty  
Development will not be permitted where it will have a  significant adverse impact on l ocally sensitive and 
valued landscapes including Rural River Valleys and Tributary Valley Farmla nd character areas.  
Proposals for development should protect and enhance the tranquillity and dark skies of both the 
Waveney District and Broads Authority area s.

260                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Coalescence of Settlements  
8.208  There are a number of locations throughout the District where  important undeveloped areas of land exist 
between settlements. These gaps help protect the identity and character of separate settlements. Gaps 
between settlements help give the sense of leaving one place and arriving at another. Even where there is 
count ryside between settlements, the presence of buildings, signs and other development along roads 
prevents the sense of leaving a settlement and passing through the countryside. At night, various forms of 
artificial lighting can also lead to a sense of contin uous urbanisation. Examples of important gaps in the 
District include land between:  
 Barnby and North Cove (west of Mill Lane)  
 Worlingham and North Cove  
 Beccles and Worlingham (north of 
Lowestoft Road)  
 Corton and Hopton (Great Yarmouth 
Borough)   Halesworth and Holton  
 Lowestoft and Barnby  
 Lowestoft and Blundeston  
 Lowestoft and Corton  
 Lowestoft and Kessingland

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 261 8.209  In order to retain the identity and character of settlements it is necessary to protect these gaps from 
development which could undermine their openness or lead to the coalescence of settlements. The 
Council will consider how proposals fit within the wider landscape and whether features such as the 
network of fields, trees and hedgerows are conserved, and the refore maintain the break between 
settlements. It will also seek to limit other urbanising impacts including increased lighting, traffic 
movements and ribbon development along road corridors.   
 
Policy WLP8.3 6 – Coalescence of Settlements  
Development of und eveloped land and intensification of developed land between settlements will only be 
permitted where it does not lead to the coalescence of settlements through a reduction in openness and 
space or the creation of urbanising effects between settlements.

8.210  Waveney is fortunate in having a wealth of visually and historically important heritage a ssets which are 
desirable to pro tect and enhance.  There are 14 conservation a reas within Waveney (two of which fall 
within the area of Waveney District which is covered by the Broads Authority), 1,602 listed buildings, 29 
scheduled monuments and 3 historic parks and gardens. There are also 1,420  buildings on the Local List  of 
Identified Non -Designated Heritage Assets in Waveney. The Suffolk Histo ric Environment Record provides 
information about archaeological sites throughout the District.  
8.211  The National Planning Policy Framework recognises the value of heritage assets and also the contribution 
that they can make to sustainable economic development . The Framework provides protection for all 
heritage assets but the weight given to the conservation of a heritage asset increases with its level of 
importance. Grade I and II* listed buildings, scheduled monument s and Grade I and II* registered parks 
and gardens are therefore granted the highest levels of protection.  
8.212  Local Plan policies do not seek to replicate the National Planning Policy Framework or its accompanying 
guidance but rather provide local policies that are specific to the District. The weight  and considerations to 
be taken into account for designated heritage assets are well covered in the Framework and local policies 
in this Local Plan do not seek to replicate these. The Council will therefore rely on national policy and 
guidance in this rega rd.  
8.213  Policy WLP8.3 7 highlights the objective of the Council to positively protect and enhance all heritage assets , 
including both designated and non -designated heritage assets and ensure that planning applications which 
could affect assets are supported by  sufficient information. The Council will work proactively with 
developers, Neighbourhood Plan groups and other partners such as Historic England to ensure new 
development conserves and enhances the historic environment. The impacts of all site allocations  in this 
Local Plan have been assessed against their impact on the historic environment and mitigation measures 
have been identified in the site allocation policies where relevant. The Central and Coastal Lowestoft 
Regeneration Strategy in Section 2 of thi s Local Plan identifies the Historic High Street area of Lowestoft as 
an area where the historic environment should be proactively enhanced. Policy WLP6.2 contains specific 
criteria protecting the character of the Southwold Harbour Conservation Area. Polic ies WLP8.3 8, WLP8.3 9 
and WLP8. 40 provide further guidance for development affecting non-designated heritage assets , local 
considerations for  conservation a reas and archaeology.  
8.214  Policy WLP8.3 7 highlights the requirement for development proposals which have  the potential to impact 
on heritage assets or their settings to be supported by a Heritage Impact Assessment prepared by a n 
individual  with appropriate expertise . The assessment should describe the significance of any heritage 
assets affected, including t heir setting. It should go on to establish the impact of proposals on the asset 
and its setting and consider whether the impact could be reduced through modification or mitigation. The 
level of detail should be proportionate to the importance of the asset.  As a minimum the Suffolk Historic 
Environment Record should be consulted. Pre -application advice is strongly encouraged to be sought in 
instances where a Heritage Impact Assessment may be required. This will allow the Council to give Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 263 valuable advice on sc ope and level of detail required in the assessment ensuring that an adequate 
assessment is submitted with a planning application.  
8.215  The Council has prepared and adopted a Built Heritage and Design Supplementary Planning Document  
(2012) . This document provid es valuable guidance on the implementation of the historic environment 
policies of this Local Plan and other detailed guidance on conserving heritage assets. The document will be 
kept up to date and reviewed from time to time.  
Policy WLP8.3 7 – Historic En vironment  
The Council will work with partners, developers and the community to protect and enhance the District’s 
historic environment.  
Proposals for development should conserve or enhance Heritage Assets and their settings.   
All development proposals whic h have the potential to impact on Heritage Assets or their settings should 
be supported by a Heritage Impact Assessment prepared by a n individual  with relevant  expertise . Pre -
application consultation with the Council is encouraged to ensure the scope and d etail of a Heritage 
Impact Assessment is sufficient.  The level of detail of a Heritage Impact Assessment should be 
proportionate to the scheme proposed and the number and significance of heritage assets affected.   
Proposals should take into account guidanc e included in the Built Heritage and Design Supplementary 
Planning Document.

264                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Non -Designated Heritage Assets   
8.216  The National Planning Practice Guidance encourages Councils to identify non -designated heritage assets in 
their Local Plans. For many years the  Council has retained a list of  identified non -designated heritage 
assets . There are currently 1,420 buildings on this list  within the District.  Assets on the list can  be viewed 
on the Council’s webpage. The number of non -designated heritage assets on the list is likely to increase 
over time as new buildings  and other assets are identified . To date these have only been id entified within 
or adjacent to conservation a reas. Notable examples include  the Tuttles Building on Station Square 
Lowestoft and  the former Council offices in Bungay . Non-designated heritage assets identified on the list  
used to be referred to as l ocally listed buildings.   
8.217  The following criteria will be used to establish if any potential non -designated heritage asset that is a 
building or structure meets the definition in the National Planning Policy Framework at an early stage in 
the process, as advised by the National Planning Practice Guidance. A building or structure must meet two 
or more of these significance -measuring criteria  to be identified by the Council as a non -designated 
heritage asset.  
Archaeological Interest   Architectural Interest   Artistic Interest   Historic Interest  
 Recorded in the 
Suffolk County 
Historic 
Environment 
Record    Aesthetic value  
 Known architect  
 Integrity  
 Landmark status  
 Group value    Artistic value  
 Known 
designer    Association  
 Rarity  
 Representativeness  
 Social and 
communal value  
8.218  Further information on the criteria can be found in Appendix 6. The criteria will be routinely updated 
through amendments to the Built Heritage and Design Supplementary Planning Document to take into 
account latest best practice.  
8.219  The existing Local List is not exhaustive and there are likely  to be a number of other ex amples of non -
designated heritage assets of local significance. Policy WLP8.3 8 sets out criteria for determining 
applications which may affect a non -designated heritage asset which  either  has or has  not been specifically 
identified on the list. In line wit h the National Planning Policy Framework the policy seeks to avoid and 
reduce harm to these assets. Although the level of protection afforded to them is not as great as that for 
designated heritage assets.  
8.220  Policy WLP8.3 8 seeks to restrict new uses which would result in substantial harm to a building or its setting 
or proposals which result in a loss or partial loss of the asset. One of the criteria which allows for harm or 
loss is that all other options for the asset or t he continued use have been exhausted. In demonstrating this, 
a marketing exercise in accordance with the principles outlined in Appendix 4 should be undertaken. 
Evidence of marketing will be required to be submitte d with any planning application . It should  also be 
demonstrated that it is not technically feasible and economically viable to accommodate the proposed 
new use for the site within the existing building. The Policy allows for loss of a building if the structure is 
unsound. In these cases a structur al survey will be required to support a planning application.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 265 8.221  The Policy encourages Neighbourhood Plans to identify other buildings in their locality worthy of 
protection. In doing this, Neighbourhood Plans should use the above criteria.  
Policy WLP8.3 8 – Non-Designated Heritage Assets  
The Council maintains a local list of Non -Designated Heritage Assets.  
Proposals for the re -use of  Non-Designated Heritage Assets will be supported if compatible with the fabric 
and setting of the building. New uses which re sult in substantial harm to a building or its setting will not be 
permitted unless all other options for the building have been exhausted.  
Proposals which involve the demolition or part demolition of a Non-Designated Heritage Asset will only be 
permitted where there are comprehensive and detailed plans for redevelopment of the site and where:  
 The building is structurally unsound and beyond feasible and viable repair (for reasons 
other than deliberate damage or neglect); or  
 All measures to sustain the exist ing use or find an alternative use/user have been 
exhausted.  
Neighbourhood Plans can identify other buildings of historic or local significance. However, the protection 
afforded to these should be no more than that provided to  Non-Designated Heritage Asse ts protected by 
this policy. Buildings identified should meet the criteria for identifying Non-Designated Heritage Assets on 
the Local List .

8.222  Conservation a reas are designated Heritage Assets and are afforded a high level of protection in national 
planning policy. Conservation areas are identified on the Policies Map and are located in Beccles13, 
Bungay13, Halesworth, Holton, Homersfield, Lowestoft (North and South), Oulton Broad13, Somerleyton13, 
Southwold, Southwold Harbour, Walberswick Quay, Wangford, Wissett and Wrentham.  
8.223  All of the above Conservation a reas have had Conservat ion Area Appraisals  and Management Plans 
prepared. These are updated regularly and provide an overview, of the character, significance and 
management of the Conservation areas.  
8.224  Policy WLP8.3 9 sets out the local approach for the management of devel opment w ithin the Conservation 
areas in order to avoid and reduce harm and to enhance the integrity of the areas. The Policy requires that 
proposals within conservation a reas take into account the Conservation Area Appraisal and Management 
Plan s in order to conser ve and enhance the areas. It also sets out the approach to managing demolitions 
within conservation a reas. Similar to the approach for  non-designated heritage assets , proposals for the 
demolition of buildings in conservation areas with architectural, histo ric or visual significance will only be 
permitted where the building is structurally unsound or all measures to sustain the use or find an 
alternative use for the building have been exhausted. In demonstrating this, a marketing exercise in 
accordance with the p rinciples outlined in Appendix 4  should be undertaken. Evidence of marketing will be 
required to be submitte d with any planning application . It should also be demonstrated that it is not 
technically feasible and economically viable to accommodate the proposed new use for the site within the 
existing building. For buildings which are considered structurally unsound, a structural survey should be 
included with any planning application.  
8.225  Since 2004 the Council has had a policy for the replacement of  windo ws and other features in conservation 
areas. All conservation a reas in the Waveney Local Plan area have Article 4 Directions which means 
planning permission is required for these types of proposals. The policy approach seeks to retain historic 
features in prominent parts of Conservation Areas which contribute to the character of area. This policy 
approach has proved successf ul in conserving and enhancing conservation a reas within the District and has 
been carried forward. Further detail on the implementatio n of this policy is set down in the Built Heritage 
and Design Supplementary Planning Document.  
                                                             
13 Conservation areas partly managed by Broads Authority. Also within Waveney District  is the Conservation Area of Ellingham, which is 
entirely within the Broads Authority -managed area of Waveney and so is not covered by this policy.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | District -Wide Strategic Planning Polic ies 
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 267 Policy WLP8.3 9 – Conservation Areas  
Development within conservation a reas will be assessed against the relevant Conservation Area Appraisals 
and Management Plan s and should be of a particularly high standard of design and materials in order to 
preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the area.  
Proposals which involve the demolition of non -listed buildings in a conservation a rea will only be permitted 
where:  
 The building is structurally unsound and beyond feasible and viable repair (for reasons 
other than deliberate damage or neglect);  
 All measures to sustain the existing use or find an alternative use/user have been 
exhausted; or  
 The building has no arc hitectural, historic or visual significance . 
In all cases, proposals for demolition should include comprehensive and detailed plans for redevelopment 
of the site.  
Proposals for replacement  doors, windows and porches in conservation a reas where Article 4 D irections 
are in place must be of a suitable design and constructed in appropriate materials. Applications will be 
assessed with reference to the prominence of the location, the historic and architectural value of the 
building and the historic and architec tural value of the feature to be replaced.

268                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Archaeology  
8.226  The District contains a range of important archaeological sites. Some of these are designated as scheduled 
monument s, although most assets are non -designated and sometimes not known of until development 
proposals come forward. Scheduled Monument s are nationally significant assets and afforded great 
protection in the National Planning Policy Framework. The Council recog nises that archaeological remains 
are a non -renewable resource which are valuable for their own sake and for their role in education, leisure 
and tourism.  
8.227  All sites allocated in the Local Plan have been considered for their archaeological potential. Where there is 
significant potential, the relevant policies set out the requirements for an archaeological investigation to 
take place prior to planning permission  being granted.  
8.228  The Suffolk Historic Environment Record provides information about archaeological sites throughout the 
District and is used to identify sites that may be at risk from development. Policy WLP8. 40 requires a full 
archaeological assessment of sites within potential areas of archaeological importance  to describe the 
significance of any heri tage assets affected and to ensure that provision is made for the preservation of

Assessment prior to determination may comprise a combination of desk -based assessment; geophysical 
survey and/or field evaluation.   
8.229  Where proposals affect archaeological sites, preference will be given to preservation in situ unless it can 
be shown that recording of remains, assessment, analysis, reporting, dissemination and  deposition of 
archive for access and curation will constitute appropriate mitigation for the impacts of development. 
Archaeological conditions or planning obligations will be imposed on consents as appropriate. Appropriate 
programmes of work post -consent could include some or all of:  
 further evaluation;  
 upfront excavation;  
 palaeoenvironmental work;  
 building survey and or monitoring; or  
 control of contractor’s groundworks.  
8.230  The provision of information for the public about archaeological work will be en couraged as appropriate to 
the scale of development and the nature of archaeological remains .  
Policy WLP8. 40 – Archaeology  
A full archaeological assessment must be included with any planning application affecting areas of known 
or suspected archaeological  importance to ensure that provision is made for the preservation of important 
archaeological remains.  
Development should preserve and record archaeological remains. Where proposals affect archaeological 
sites, preference will be given to preservation in s itu unless it can be shown that recording of remains, 
assessment, analysis report and deposition of archive is more appropriate.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Appendices  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 269 Appendix 1 – Infrastructure and 
Delivery Framework  
The policies and proposals of the Local Plan will be del ivered primarily through the determination and 
implementation of planning applications for the development and use of land and buildings. However, the 
success of the Local Plan will be dependant on partnership working between the Council, developers, 
infra structure provider s, and other interested stakeholders, including the public and Parish and Town 
Councils. Neighbourhood Plans will also have a crucial  role in expanding upon and adding to the policies 
and proposals of this Local Plan to address detailed l ocal circumstances.  
Table A1.1  outlines the timescale, responsible organisations, infrastructure requirements, risks and 
contingencies for each policy and proposal in the Local Plan.  
Table A1.2 sets out in detail all of the infrastructure required to supp ort the growth outline d in the Local 
Plan, the timescale for delivery, likely cost and funding options (where known ). The table categorises 
infrastructure in accordance with its contribution to supporting development in the Local Plan. Please 
note, this ca tegorisation does not necessarily reflect the importance the Council attaches to a particular 
project corporately. For the purposes of the Local Plan, infrastructure is categorised according to the 
following three categories; critical, essential and desira ble.  
 Critical infrastructure  is infrastructure that is needed to unlock development sites 
allocated in the Local Plan (i.e. without the infrastructure the development cannot 
physically take place).  
 Essential infrastructure  is the infrastructure that is n ecessary to support and mitigate 
development and ensures policy objec tives of the Local Plan are met.  Development 
could take place without this infrastructure but its sustainability would be undermined.  
 Desirable infrastructure  is infrastructure that could support development in the Local 
Plan and make it more sustainable and help deliver other place -making objectives. 
However, development planned in the Local Plan could take place sustainably without 
it.  
More details on infrastructure needs can be found in the Draft Infrastructure Study which accompanies 
this consultation. Appendices  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

capacity for development on the existing allocation be 
reduced.  
If potential improvements to Bloodmoor Roundabout are

Willingness of

 Lack of funding is considered a small risk as there will be a 
number of funding sources the Council can explore. 
Additionally the allocation includes enabling development 
which will prov ide the land and potentially  help fund the 
sports provision. If funding options are exhausted it may 
be necessary to reduce the scope of the sport provision 
to a level which funding can support.  
The Council will continue to liaise with the landowner to 
ensure the site can be delivered.  
If it becomes  clear the landowner has no intention to 
bring the site forward and/or if sufficient funding cannot 
be achieved to deliver sports facilities, the Council will 
explore providing additional sports facilities throu gh the 
use, intensification and remodelling of existing assets and 
through identifying land elsewhere where necessary.

Monitoring the effectiveness and implementation of the Plan is essentia l to ensure the success of the P lan. Monitoring is essential to establish what is happening 
now and what may happen in the future.  Monitoring can help understand whether  the strategic  policies and proposals in the Local Plan are mee ting the strategic 
priorities, objective s and targets, whether they are effective in achieving sustainable development and whether there are any unintended consequen ces. 
Importantly, it allows the Council to understand whether there is a need to review any policies of the Plan, or the Plan in it s entirety.  
Table A2.1  sets out the indicators and evidence the Council will use to regularly monitor the performance of  the P lan against each strategic priority/objective.  Table 
A2.2  identifies detailed indicators of performance for each policy.  It also identifies relevant targets from the  Plan that each policy helps address.

Requirements  
A number of policies in the Local Plan require evidence of marketing prior to allowing the redevelopment 
or change of use of a building or land. This section sets out the detailed requirements for marketing to 
justify there is no demand for the existing use and justify a change of use.   
Length of Marketing  
Prior to applying to change the use of a building protected under the relevant  policies  of the Local Plan  the 
property should be marketed for a period of at least 12 months. Evidence from neighbouring Suffolk 
Coastal suggests that industrial properties are often on the market for longer than 12 months before being 
taken up. Given the importa nce of tourism to the local economy and the potential importance of 
community facilities to local communities a 12 month period is also considered appropriate for these uses 
as well.  
Marketing Strategy  
Before marketing begins a strategy should be prepared  which sets out how the property will be marketed. 
Ideally this should be agreed with the Council prior to start of marketing. This will ensure the strategy 
meets the requirements set out in this section, and will avoid the need of a repeat of the marketin g 
exercise should the Council deem the marketing not be up to standard.  
The marketing strategy should contain the following detail:  
 Background – this should cover why the property is being marketed.  
 Location – this should include information on proximity to regional centres such as 
Norwich, Ipswich and Lowestoft, its links to transport networks and its general setting 
(i.e. business park / enterprise zone).  
 Description – this should include details on floorspace, number of floors, layout and car 
parking an d yard facilities.  
 Planning – a summary of the existing planning use, history and restrictions.  
 Marketing Recommendations and approach to advertisement – this should cover:  
o Basis of instruction - sole agent or joint agent etc.  
o Method of disposal - private  treaty or informal/formal bids.  
o Advertisement option - sale boards, internet, PR, publications, mailing etc.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Appendices  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 325 Expenditure on marketing - the budget for the marketing campaign should be proportionate to the 
anticipated return from the property. As a guide t he budget should be about 3% of the anticipated return 
from the property. For example, a property with a guide rent of £15,000 per annum should have a 
marketing budget of about £450.  
 Guide Price/Rent - this should be commensurate with the current market p rice for 
similar premises. It is expected that the value of the property will be derived from an 
expert RICS registered valuer or accredited member of RICS (Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors).  
 Guide Terms - these should be flexible and take into ac count prevailing market 
conditions. The length of leases should not be unduly restrictive.  
The strategy should include a marketing matrix similar to the template below.

Marketing Particulars  £x.xx              
Local Newspaper  £x.xx              
The extent of marketing initiatives will vary based on the type of premises being advertised. However, as a 
minimum the following initiatives should be employed for all premises:  
 Marketing Board – this could be a simple for sale board for small commercial premises, 
single tourist unit accommodation and community facilities. For larger commercial units 
and tourist accommodation sites larger board s giving details of the property including 
the guide price should be employed. Boards should be placed so they can be seen from 
the main road.  
 Marketing Particulars – these should include the following information:  
o Internal and external photographs  
o Locati on 
o Description of accommodation  
o Terms (leasehold, freehold, long lease etc.)  
o Guide Price/Rent  
o Current Planning Status  
o Services and Utilities  
o Energy Performance Certificate  
o Rateable value and business rates  
o VAT Status  
o Legal and professional costs  
o Viewing arrangements  Appendices  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
326                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  o Contact information for the agent  
For larger commercial units and tourist accommodation sites, which are more likely to have a regional or 
national audience, the particulars should be set out in a bespoke, well -designed brochure. Layouts of th e 
building together with professional photos will be required.  
 Advertisement in p ress – for small commercial units, community facilities and single unit 
tourist accommodation, an advert should be placed and maintained in a local 
newspaper. For larger comme rcial units and tourist accommodation sites, specialist 
publications should also be used. Advertisements in both local and national publications 
should include a colour picture of the premises.  
 Press c overage – for larger commercial units and tourist acco mmodation sites, a press 
release should be given to local and regional press.  
 Online advertisement – the premises should be published on the agent’s website as well 
as one national commercial property search engine. For very large commercial units and 
tour ist accommodation parks a bespoke website for the property should be created.  
 Targeted mailing – this involves the agent mailing their contacts or by purchasing a 
database of contacts.  
Marketing Report  
If following the 12 months of marketing there has be en no success in selling or letting the unit a report on 
the marketing should be prepared and submitted with a planning application for redevelopment or change 
of use.  
The Marketing Report should contain the following:  
 The original marketing strategy (in a ccordance with the above).  
 The duration and dates of the marketing campaign.  
 Evidence that the marketing strategy was delivered – this should include photos of the 
marketing boards, copies of particulars, screenshots of online advertisements, copies of 
press articles and adverts.  
 A full record of enquiries received throughout the course of the marketing campaign. 
This should record, the date of the enquiry, details of the company/individual, nature of 
the enquiry, if the property was inspected, details of any follow -up and reasons why the 
prospective occupier deemed the premises unsuitable. If any offers were rejected, the 
grounds on which the offers were rejected must be provided.  
 If the record of enquiries indicates a lack of interest during the marketing  campaign, the 
report should detail the measure undertaken to alter the strategy and to increase 
interest.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Appendices  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 327 Appendix 5 – Viability 
Assessment Requirements  
A number  of policies in the Local Plan have a test of financial viability requirement.  Where an assessment 
of viability is provided with an application it should be completed in accordance with the guidance in this 
appendix and guidance included in the National Pl anning Practice Guidance.   
Confidentiality  
Historically viability assessments submitted with planning applications have been treated as confidential as 
they were considered commercially sensitive.  However, given that these assessments are used often to 
dem onstrate that something, such as affordable housing provision, which is in the public interest should 
be reduced it is important that these assessment are open and transparent.  It is important that the public 
and other stakeholders have an opportunity to c omment and challenge the findings in the same way they 
may wish to challenge the findings of other technical studies which support a planning application.  
In most cases viability assess ments should be based on public ly available information which is reflec tive of 
industry norms rather than the unique circumstances of developers (as planning permission runs with the 
land not the developer).   
Given the above, viability assessments submitted with planning applications will not be kept confidential 
and will be published on the planning application file with the other studies, plans and information 
contained within the planning application.  In exceptional circumstances where the publication of 
information would harm the competitiveness of a business due to the ne cessity to include commercial 
information unique to that business, the Council will consider keeping some or all of the viability 
assessment confidential.  The applicant in these scenarios should provide full justification as to why the 
harm cause by publis hing the information outweighs the public interest in publishing the information.   
Independent Review  
If there are disagreements between the Council and the applicant on the findings of the viability 
assessment, or criticisms of the assessment have been r aised by stakeholders or the public, the Council will 
invite the developer to pay a fee to have the assessment independently reviewed.  The independent review 
will assess and scrutinise the assumptions and assessment and give a view on whether the assessmen t is 
robust.  If the assessment is not considered robust, the independent review will include a revised viability 
assessment in accordance with this guidance.   Appendices  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
328                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Overall Approach  
Viability assessments should be in the form of residual land value appraisals. W here the residual land 
value, obtained from discounting costs and developer profit from the development value is compared to a 
threshold land value to determine whether a scheme is viable.   
Gross Development Value  
This figure is calculated from 
the total sale values of  the 
completed units or capitalised 
rents from commercial units   Development Costs  
This figure is the sum of costs.  This 
will include build costs, S106/CIL 
payments, p rofessional fees, taxes, 
interest and  any abnormal costs   Developers Profit  
This is the profit the 
developer needs to make, 
either against develop ment 
costs or development value   Residual 
Land 
Value  
 
Residual Land 
Value  Threshold Land 
Value   Viable  
 
Viability assessments should clearly set out all of the assumptions and the evidence behind the 
assumptions that go into the appraisal.  The assessments should be clearly  and transparently presented 
including the calculation of residual land value and any cash -flow analysis. There must be no hidden 
calculations or assumptions in any model or appraisal.   
Development appraisals should include details of the proposed scheme including site area, residential unit 
numbers, number of habitable rooms, unit size, density and the split between the proposed tenures. 
Floorspace figures should also be provided for residential uses  (gross internal area)  by tenur e, and non -
residential us es in gross internal area (GIA) and net internal a rea (NIA).  Information should be provided 
relating to the target market of the development and proposed specification, which should be consistent 
with assumed costs and values.  
Details of the assumed develo pment programme and the timing of cost and income inputs should be 
provided.   
Ideally the appraisal will include a spreadsheet version of the model which can be opened and 
interrogated in Microsoft Excel and similar spreadsheet software applications.  Homes  England publish the 
Development Appraisal Tool15 which is a open sourced spreadsheet which anyone can use.  The use of this 
tool is therefore strongly recommended.

www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 329 Guidance on Assumptions to be Used  
Threshold Land Value  
This assumption is a critical assump tion as it sets the benchmark for what the residual land value is tested 
against to determine whether a development is viable.  The National Planning Policy Framework states that 
viability should consider “competitive returns to a willing landowner ”. The th reshold land value therefore 
needs to meet this test.  The National Planning Practice Guidance states that a competitive  return for the 
land owner is the price at which a reasonable land owner would be willing to sell their land for the 
development. The pric e will need to provide an incentive for the land owner to sell in comparison with the 
other options available. Those options may include the current use value of the land or its value for a 
realistic alternative use that complies with planning policy.  The guidance also states the land value should 
reflect policy requirements and the community infrastructure levy and be based on comparable, market -
based evidence wherever possible.  It also states that where transacted bids are significantly above the 
market n orm, they should not be used as part of this exercise.  
Given the above the price paid for the land will not be a relevant consideration in terms of assessing what 
the threshold land value should be.  
Market comparables for land transactions for similar dev elopments can be used to help determine 
threshold land value.  However, these can only be considered comparable if the final development 
achieved was policy compliant and was subject to the same level of community infrastructure levy or 
section 106 contribu tions.  Comparables should also be of similar densities and land types.  Therefore, 
where viability assessments rely on market comparables to establish land value they must include 
information on the final planning permission and development.  
The main  approa ch of assessing what the threshold land value is to consider what the existing use value of 
the land is. The principle of this approach is that a landowner should receive at least the value of the land 
in its ‘pre -permission’ use, which would normally be l ost when bringing forward land for development. A 
premium is usually added to provide the landowner with an additional incentive to release the site, having 
regard to site circumstances. Planning appeals across the country have determined that this is an 
acceptable approach.  Premiums above existing use value are usually 10 -20% for brownfield land and 10 to 
20 times value for agricultural land.  For some sites where a number of uses may be permissible by 
planning, the alternative use value of the site may als o be a consideration.  In all cases, the threshold land 
value should be no higher than that modelled in the Whole Plan Viability Assessment, however, it could be 
lower.   
For schemes which involve enabling development the threshold land value may be the value at which the 
planning gain can be achieved.  For example, if a sports field is to be developed to provide a new sports 
field elsewhere, the threshold land value will need to cover the cost of providing the new sports field.   
For affordable housing in the countryside, permitted under Policy WLP8.6, the threshold land value should 
be respective of typical plot values for affordable housing and should be significantly less than threshold Appendices  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
330                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  land values for normal mixed tenure schemes on allocated sites and w ithin settlement boundaries. The 
threshold land value will still have to be excess of agricultural value.   
Development Value  
This should be based on comparable evidence of transactions of new build properties.  Values should 
always be calculated on a per sq m basis.  For residential, the Land Registry publishes data on the price paid 
for new homes and this should be the starting point.  If sufficient transactional data  is not available, asking 
prices for new build could be considered and values for second -hand homes, provided they are adjusted to 
take into account that asking prices may not be achieved and that second -hand homes may not command 
the value premium which new -builds have.   
Affordable housing values should be based on discussions with registered prov iders or average agreed 
offer prices.   
For commercial developments, consideration should be given to rents and yields being achieved in the 
local markets.   
Build Costs  
Build costs should be based on publically available information such as the RICS Build C ost Information 
Service (BCIS) to ensure transparency and benchmarking.  Costs used should normally be median averages 
for the type of development being proposed.  Divergence from the median value should always be justified.   
BCIS costs do not include extern al structural and local site works and are based on Gross Internal Area 
(GIA). Preliminary costs are included in the BCIS build costs figures so should not be included as a separate 
cost.  External works costs which includes, landscaping, garages, roads, se wers and drainage should be 
identified separately in the appraisal.  Sometimes this is expressed as a percentage of build costs, normally 
in the range of 10 -20%.  Alternatively, the works can be itemised, but should be based on average costs.  
Sources of info rmation could include quantity surveyors reports or other published material such as Price 
Books.   
Abnormal Costs  
Abnormal costs are those which are unique to the site in question.  This could include contamination, 
archaeology, flood risk and ecological co nsiderations.  These should be itemised, be based on industry 
averages and evidenced in the report.  They do not need to be based on tender prices which can be 
commercially sensitive.  A quantity surveyor report may be helpful in justifying these costs or pub lished 
material such as Price Books.  The presence of abnormal costs would normally be expected to influence 
land value. The applicant should have had some awareness of abnormal costs prior to purchasing the site, 
therefore the presence of abnormal costs ar e assumed to have influenced the level of premium above the 
existing use value a land owner would expect. Thus, it should not be assumed that abnormal costs will be 
offset at the expense of compliance with the Local Plan.  Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Appendices  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 331 Fees  
Planning, Professional and m arketing fees should be justified taking account of the complexity of the 
development and develop ment values. Costs applied on a percentage basis should be realistic when 
considering the monetary value of the assumed cost.   
Finance Costs  
Viability assessme nt should normally include a cash flow analysis to calculate the level of finance costs to 
the development.  The interest payments should be justified with respect to the latest rates being offered 
by banks.  Where the scheme is in surplus, interest gained f rom capital in the bank should be credited 
against the scheme unless otherwise justified.  
Planning Obligations and Community Infrastructure Levy  
These should also be itemised in the assessment and be in accordance with the Local Plan and Community 
Infrast ructure Levy Charging Schedule.   
Contingency  
It is normal to have a level of contingency on build costs.  The level of contingency should reflect the risk 
and complexity of the scheme.  A starting point is normally 5%, but non -complex greenfield developments  
could have a smaller contingency and higher complex brownfield developments might justify a higher 
contingency.  In all case s the level of contingency should be justified.  
Developer Profit  
This should be a fixed input figure in a residual appraisal. It cou ld be based as a proportion of either 
development costs or development value and in line with  the National Planning Policy Framework 
represent a competitive return.   
For residential development the starting point should be no higher than 20% on market dwellings and 6% 
on affordable dwellings.  However, t he appropriate level of profit should be scheme specific.  Evidence 
should be provided by applicants to justify proposed rates of profit taking account of the individual 
characteristics of the scheme, the risks related to the scheme, and comparable schemes.   
It should be made clear how the profit level has been adjusted taking into account other assumed inputs 
within an appraisal. For example, the adoption of cautious assumptions such as the inclusion of hi gher 
contingencies a may warrant a lower target profit.   
Overage  
If planning policy requirements are reduced in order to ensure a viable scheme, the applicant will be 
required to enter into a section 106 planning obligation that includes an overage clause.  The clause will Appendices  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
332                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  require a further viability assessment to be undertaken at an agreed point during the development, if sales 
values or profit levels have increased, improving the viability of the development the surplus will be 
recouped by the Council up t o the amount of contribution that was applicable at the time of the 
submission of the latest relevant application.

are buildings  
A non -designated heritage asset can be a  building, monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as 
having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions.  
 
Significance is the value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest 
that can be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic.  
 
Development proposals affecting an identified non -designated heritage asset will be subject to the 
requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework at Section 12: Conserving and enhanc ing the 
historic environment and including paragraphs 131 and 135 and Policies WLP8.37 – WLP8.40 of this Local 
Plan.  
 
Below is a summary of the criteria used to select non -designated heritage assets for the Local List and 
which appears in the supporting t ext of policy WLP8.38.

The text below explains each of the criteria set out above and in the supporting text of policy WLP8.38 
(Non -Designated Her itage Assets).  
 
These criteria have been prepared with specific reference to Historic England’s ‘Conservation Principles – 
Policies and Guidance for the Sustainable Management of the Historic Environment’; and ‘Good Practice 
Guide for Local Heritage Listi ng’.  
 
 Recorded in the Suffolk County Historic Environment Record : an above -ground archaeological site 
or historic building recorded in the Suffolk County Council Historic Environment Record. 
Identification of archaeological interest will always have to be  made in conjunction with the 
Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service. Sub -surface archaeological interest is considered 
and advised on separately by the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service.  
 
 Aesthetic/artistic value: the building or struc ture, through its intrinsic design value derived from 
local styles, materials, workmanship or any other distinctive local characteristic, will exhibit a 
positive external appearance in the street scene, village or townscape or landscape.  
 
 Known architect/ designer: the building or structure will be the work of an architect or designer of 
local, regional or national noteworthiness.  
 
 Integrity: the building or structure will retain a degree of intactness and lack of harmful external 
alteration and, if part o f a group, will make a contribution to the surviving completeness of that 
group.  
 
 Landmark status: the building or structure by virtue of its design, age, innovation, construction, 
position, use or communal associations contributes as a landmark within th e local scene.  
 
 Group value: the buildings or structures will have a coherent design or historic functional 
relationship as a group.  
 
 Association: the building or structure will enjoy a significant historical association of local or 
national noteworthiness including links to important local figures or events.  
 
 Rarity: the building or structure must represent a design, use or other quality that was a lways 
uncommon or has now become uncommon or exceptional to the locality, District or wider region.  
 
 Representativeness: the building or structure will survive as a good quality representative of a 
particular historical or architectural trend or settlemen t pattern; or be part of the legacy of a 
particular individual, architect or designer, architectural or artistic movement, company or group 
in the past.  
 Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Appendices  
www.eastsuffolk.gov.uk /newwaveneylocalplan                 335  Social and communal value: the building or structure will be perceived locally as a source of local 
identity (for example, commemorative or symbolic), distinctiveness, social interaction or 
contributing to the collective memory of a place.  
 
The more criteria that are met the greater the significance of the non -designated heritage asset.  
 
In the Waveney D istrict the following locally significant uses may provide typologies of buildings and 
structures that can be identified as non -designated heritage assets:  
 
Agricultural; commemorative; commercial; culture, entertainment and leisure; resort tourism; domes tic; 
educational; health and welfare; industrial; military; aviation; forestry; water management; landed Estates; 
fishing; brewing; law and local government; park and garden structures; ecclesiastical; transport; maritime 
and coastal defence; utilities, en ergy and communications; civil defences; street furniture and historic 
surfaces.

Area  Key characteristics and development considerations  
Rural Wooded Valleys  
Waveney Wooded 
Valley  Mature woodland creates a landscape dark and of intimate and enclosed spatial scale that is characterised by a 
sparsely settled landscape with framed views. The road network traverses what is a tranquil and sparsely settled 
area which contributes towards t he night time darkness in the area. Several historical features are present including 
parkland, Somerleyton Estate and the priory at St Olaves. The strategic objectives are to conserve and enhance 
estate landscape features, protect open views and conserve the wooded transition to the Broads.  
Rural River Valleys  
Waveney Valley  Views are framed by dense woodland and contained by rising topography with occasional views across the Broads 
and drainage mills/pumps being a prominent feature. Ditches and tributaries create an interesting landscape mosaic

with seasonal variation. Away f rom the market towns settlement is contained to isolated halls and farms. The 
landscape forms the setting for the Broads and acts as a transitional buffer zone. The strategic objective is to protect 
views of the wider Broadland landscape and enhance wetlan d habitats.  
Blyth and Wang 
Valley  The landform is broad and shallow and defined by a network of tributaries and field boundary ditches and landscape 
structure is provided by hedgerows to create a rectangular field boundary network of intimate scale. Visu al is 
provided by valley landform and woodland fringing the character area with open views towards Southwold and the 
marshes. The landscape is richly textured, intricate and colourful. The area is tranquil with sparse influence of 
settlement and there are dark skies. Strategic objectives are to conserve the lowland valley floodplain character, the 
intricate mosaic of wetland habitats, the remains of Henham Park and to protect the dark skies and uninterrupted 
skylines.  
Coastal Broads and Marshes  
Covehithe  and 
Benacre Coastal 
Broads  Topography is contained by low ridges forming low lying marshes. An unusual landscape with a clear sense of place 
created by thee open water pools and contained remote character. There is an absence of built development 
creating  remote character with few restricted views, particularly along the coast and subtle skylines are important 
to give the Broads a sense of enclosure. The strategic objective is to conserve and enhance the remote character 
and biodiversity interest.  
Dunes, Coastal Levels and Resorts  
Great Yarmouth 
Coastal Strip  The landform is flat with panoramic views stretching far along the coast. This has a backdrop of resort development. 
The landscape is ephemeral with evidence of erosion and flood protection measures.  There is a strong sense of 
place created by wildlife associated with the coastline. The landscape contains simple horizons and big skies. The 
landscape is dynamic with changing light and tides. The strategic objective is to conserve and enhance remaining 
dunes, sands and coastal character. Open areas and views of the seascape and shoreline should be conserved, 
particularly between settlements.  
Coastal Cliffs  
Pakefield to 
Benacre Coastal 
Cliffs  A low cliff and dune coastal landscape with local landform variation. Panoramic views are available from the cliff 
edge and the landscape is an exposed large -scale seascape and largely undeveloped with the exception of resort 
development around Kessingland. The coast is wild and windswept with a strong ephemeral v isual character. Cliffs 
are dynamic in the context of erosion and are protected by the shingle bar. The primary objectives are to conserve 
and enhance the remote coastal character, biodiversity and to conserve the open gaps and coastal views between 
Kessin gland and Lowestoft.  
Southwold Coast  Primarily duneland with areas of scrub and coastal marsh. Panoramic views extend across the coastal marshes and 
from the Blyth Estuary back to the Southwold along with wooded backdrop created by the North Suffolk Sandlings 
which buffer the town. The lighthouse and St Edmund’s Church create a distinctive backdrop. Coastal development 
is limited outside of the town. The coast is windswept and ephemeral in character and has a tranquil and remote 
character away from th e built up area. The strategic objective is to conserve and enhance the wild and coastal 
character which is intrinsic to the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB. The traditional low key character of Southwold 
should be considered along with the understated resor t development. Potential work to coastal defences should 
respect local character.  
Settled Farmland  
Somerleyton Settled 
Farmland  The area consists of gently rolling farmland with trees around Somerleyton Estate creating a character of enclosed 
woodland. Distinctive field patterns and perception of the landscape varies form enclosed and intimate along 
country lanes to open on some ar eas of farmland. There are long views across the Broads and back with the area 
forming a low partially wooded skyline and church towers are prominent landmarks. Away from Somerleyton and 
Blundeston the sense of settlement is sparse creating a peaceful rura l landscape. The strategic objectives are to Appendices  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018

conserve the peaceful landscape and sense of enclosure created by hedgerows and trees. The Somerleyton Estate 
provides a distinct character to the area and should be conserved along with views and low lying skyl ine associated 
with Broads.  
Tributary Valley Farmland  
Blundeston 
Tributary Valley 
Farmland  Undulating landform characterised by tributaries in the valley and small farm woodlands and a network of 
hedgerows and ditches. Views are contained by rolling landform and wooded skylines which enclose a small to 
medium scale landscape. Views to the seascape are intermittent between Corton and Hopton -on-Sea and there is 
little coastal influence on the character. Settlement edges create an urban influence with tr anquillity interrupted by 
the A12 corridor. Remnant parklands add to the historic character of the landscape. Strategic objectives are to 
conserve the landscape structure and enhance the field boundary hedgerow network. Open views should be 
conserved.  
Wav eney Valley 
Tributary Valley 
Farmland  There is a pattern of enclosed field boundaries created by hedgerows sparsely wooded areas which enable 
occasional views the Waveney Valley and the Broads. There is a visual influence of field boundary ditches and the 
area is fringed by settlement edges and Beccles and Lowestoft where skylines are simple with few vertical elements 
that are exposed to the Broads. The agricultural land cover has eroded the landscape structure. The landscape 
forms part of the setting for t he Broads but the tranquillity is reduced by the A146 corridor. The strategic objectives 
are to contain the extent large settlement influence including the creation of exposed settlement edges, conserve 
the low lying skyline and wetland character along wit h the setting of the Broads.  
Hundred Tributary 
Valley Farmland  Tributaries cut into the rolling landscape and along with woodland and hedgerows they create a small to medium 
scale landscape. The landscape is textured with a mosaic of different landscape elements. The area is sparsely 
settled but there are exposed settlement edges associated with Lowestoft and Kessingland. Tranquillity is reduced 
by the A12 corridor. Flint churches and historic halls form elements of wooded skylines. The strategic objectiv es are 
to conserve the textured landscape quality the network of tributaries. Sensitive panoramic woodland skylines should 
be conserved along with the setting and views to churches.  
Mid Waveney 
Tributary Valley 
Farmland  Views in the landscape are framed the rolling landform and field boundary vegetation which create good inter -
visibility. There are intermittent views over the Broads. Small patches of woodland often surround settlements 
fringing the valley. Hedgerows are distinctive and with ditches create  a small to medium landscape. Isolated 
churches are a common feature. The area has a tranquil rural character. The strategic objectives are to conserve and 
enhance the network of waterways and function of the character area as a setting for the Broads.  
Sconch Beck and 
Waveney Tributary 
Valley Farmland  The area is characterised by an undulating landform cut by minor tributaries. Views are of a strongly contained 
character. Landscape structure is provided by trees and hedgerows and largely intact. Variation in colour and 
perception quality is provided in areas of pasture and wet meadow which fringe the network of waterways. The 
sense of settlement is sparse creating a tranquil and remote character with isolated churches a feature in the 
skyline. Strategic obj ectives are to conserve and enhance the intimate and contained character created by landform 
and landscape structure. The sparsely settled character and limited influence should be conserved.  
Blyth Tributary 
Valley Farmland  The landscape is characterised by a landfor M&H edgerows that act to limit inter -visibility with framed by views. 
Distant views of pylons increase the sense of human influence. Where landscape structure has been eroded there 
are often open views across the landscape. Historical elements i nclude field patterns and the post mill at Holton 
along with the village. Strategic objectives are to conserve and enhance the network of waterways and connections 
with the adjacent landscape of the Blyth Valley. The very contained visual character of the area and low key 
influence of settlement should be conserved including the separation between settlements, notably Halesworth and 
Holton. Wooded settlement edges should be enhanced.  
Blyth and Wang 
Tributary Valley 
Farmland  The area forms a backdrop to th e adjacent river landscapes providing scale and contrast. Intermittent network of 
hedgerows, large oaks trees and wooded cover are features. Henham Park is the primary cultural feature. The 
landscape is quiet and rural forming a transition between the rive r valleys and high plateau areas. Away from the 
settlements and A -roads the area remains very tranquil. There are occasional views across the Blyth Valley marshes 
and wooded horizons are significant from the Wang Valley around Henham. This is a varied land scape and it is often Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018 | Appendices

Area  Key characteristics and development considerations  
to perceive the landscape as a single area. The strategic objectives are to conserve and enhance tributary valleys 
and the historic landscape pattern  
Farmed Plateau Clayland  
Saints Plateau - 
West  Landform is gently undulating with distinct field patterns. Settlement is dispersed and creates a character that is 
remote with an intimate scale where field networks have not been eroded. There are a number of historic moated 
sites across the plateau. Skylines are simple and undisturbed an d long panoramic views are often possible including 
overlooking of the Waveney Valley. Woodland along the crest of the adjacent tributary farmland character area 
forms the backdrop for these views. Views to church towers are prominent horizon elements. Sma ll-scale 
settlement pattern contributes towards the perception of a rural landscape which is tranquil in character. The 
strategic objective is to conserve and enhance the historic landscape pattern, maintaining the tranquil, remote and 
rural character of t he area and views to prominent features such as churches and wooded skylines.  
Saints Plateau - East The area has good network of historic field boundaries creating a small to medium scale landscape with hedgerows 
and oak trees creating a contained landscape and views. There are a number of historic sites across the area. Church 
towers provide focal point s within small settlements and are prominent skyline features. Views are often framed 
with distant views available where landscape structure has been eroded. Settlement is low key in character and 
often remote but the sense of tranquillity is interrupted b y powerlines and pylons. Strategic objectives are to 
conserve and enhance the small -scale landscape structure, retain the dispersed rural character including separation 
between settlements to maintain the tranquil character of the area. Views to prominent features such as church 
towners should be conserved. Further extension of settlements into the more open plateau areas from the valleys 
(Halesworth, Blyth Valley and Beccles, Waveney Valley) should be monitored.  
Sotterley and 
Benacre Plateau  The landform  is contained by woodland and field boundary vegetation. Skylines reflect historic and wooded 
parkland. Visual variety is created by created ancient woodland and plantations and views are often framed. 
Settlement is characterised by small -scale development  and isolated farmsteads. The landscape has a simple 
composition creating an intimate scale with a remote and tranquil character. The strategic objective is to conserve 
and enhance field boundary patterns, the strong sense of place and landscape integrity created by the parklands 
and their landscape setting. The tranquil rural character should be considered.  
Gisleham Plateau  Largely flat, the landscape is characterised by a historic enclosure landscape pattern in the east which creates visual 
interest and a larger open character in the west. Principle elements of the cultural landscape include the Gisleham 
church tower and moated Manor Farm. Glimpsed views to parts of the coast are possible but are largely screened 
by resort development. Wooded skylines are  apparent at points creating a sense of containment. Where there are 
urban fringes this acts to reduces tranquillity while in the east the there is a sense of remoteness and tranquillity. 
Strategic objectives are to mitigate the influence of built developm ent and retain the sense of separation between 
Lowestoft and Kessingland.  
Estuarine Marsh  
Hundred River 
Marshes  A broad, flat valley with shallow valley sides of subtle definition. Panoramic views are available across the marshes 
to the low south facing ridge of Kessingland. Church towers are prominent. Cultural pattern is represented by halls 
and minor parklands. There is an intricate network of ditches, dykes and the meandering Hundred River masked by 
marshes and reeds. The variety of wetlands, reed bed s, pasture and isolated wooded areas create a rich landscape 
texture. The landscape is sparsely settled and peaceful but tranquillity is interrupted by the A12 corridor the 
presence of resort development in the north east of the character area. The strateg ic objectives are to conserve and 
enhance the marshland character and mosaic of wetland habitats along with retaining the simple and uncluttered 
skylines. Areas where settlement is sparse and tranquil in character should be conserved including the dark ski es at 
night which are a feature.  
Pottersbridge 
Marshes  Topographic variation is subtle and the landscape is contained due to the density of marsh and reed vegetation. 
Features in adjacent character areas such as low wooded ridges, arable fields and tree lines contain the marshland 
and form the backdrop to view s across it. The landscape is simple and windswept with a sense of wildness. Appendices  | Waveney Local Plan Final Draft | March 2018  
340                www. eastsuffolk .gov.uk/ newwaveneylocalplan  Landscape Character 
Area  Key characteristics and development considerations  
Settlement is sparse. The strategic objective is to retain the wild character of the area, preserve the dark night time 
sky and enhance the mosaic of habitats.  
Blyth Estuary  Ther e are panoramic views across the marshes towards Southwold. Wooded areas provide the backdrop on the 
subtly rising farmland. Wide open skies and sense of place with long distance vistas punctuated by church towers, 
water towers, mills and the masts of sail boats is apparent. The lighthouse, church and water tower are key 
landmarks visible on the horizon. Subtle ridge lines which rise to the edge of the marshes are sensitive to change. 
This is a remote isolated and unsettled landscape with an absence of settl ement and a strong sense of tranquillity. 
Suffolk estuaries such as this are known for their archaeological interest. Strategic objectives are to conserve the 
open expanse of the estuarine landscape, its long views, open skies and strong sense of remotenes s and isolation. 
The ad hoc ramshackle character of the harbour should be considered.  
Sandlings  
North Suffolk 
Sandlings  A landscape of subtle landform variation with fields defined by mixed enclosure hedgerows. Views are often framed 
by the density of field vegetation with tree lines forming prominent skyline elements with coastal broads visible 
from higher vantage points. The landscape is open near the coast and intimate further inland. The influence of the 
coast creates a dynamic landscape. Principle cultural features are the heathland and the church at Covehithe which 
is prominent within the landscape. The landscape has a varied mosaic of landscapes include heathland, scrub, 
plantations and pig farming. The area is sparsely settled and there is a sens e of tranquillity with dark night skies and 
few lit settlement edges. Strategic objectives are to conserve and enhance the sparsely settled rural character and 
areas of where a remote and wild character exists. Tree lines should be preserved where they con tribute towards 
the sense of place and views to the sea and coastal broads should be conserved.
