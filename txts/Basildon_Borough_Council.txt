INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST  
BASILDON COUNCIL’S GUIDE TO THE LOCAL PLAN  
 
What is the Local Plan?  
 The Local Plan is a document that sets out how Basildon Borough will change over a 
period of time and is also reactive to changes.  
 It covers all planning matters, except those concerning w aste disposal and minerals 
extraction. It provides a legal framework for the Planning Committee to work to.  
 It will ensure that future development makes a positive contribution to our Borough and 
will ensure that developments only take place with the requi red infrastructure – 
Infrastructure First!  
 We have a Local Plan because, as a Local Planning Authority, the Government says we 
have to.  
So what does it do?  
 It sets out a vision, and the Council’s objectives for future development and change 
within the Boro ugh. 
 The policies within the plan set out the strategic approach to growth and where housing 
development will take place across the Borough.  
 It identifies the specific locations where housing developments can occur and builds on 
two key issues:  
 Sites that were brought forward by landowners under the ‘Call For Sites’;  
 Sites that have been identified as potentially suitable for building together with the 
specific infrastructure that is needed. This information has been collated as a result of 
more than two ye ars of research and input from all the key stakeholders such as utility 
companies, schools, doctors’ surgeries, highways, etc.  
So how many houses have to be built?  
 A calculation for the required housing over the next twenty years indicates the Borough 
needs between 19,440 and 19,720 houses.  
 We acknowledge that this is only a calculation and the Local Plan needs to be flexible to 
these numbers changing, either up or down, as well as recognising that the bigger 
numbers can only be achieved by having the r equired infrastructure – Infrastructure 
First!  
 If the required housing numbers are correct it creates a problem. We don’t have enough 
land to build them so we can only meet the demand by building on land designated as 
Green Belt.  
 The Green Belt is importan t to us and we take the responsibility of protecting Green Belt 
very seriously. We have therefore carefully calculated the minimum amount of Green 
Belt required to meet the demand, should that demand prove to be correct.  
 The worst -case scenario reduces our  Green Belt by 4%. This means that 59% of the 
land area in Basildon remains designated as Green Belt.  
So what about infrastructure?  
 Infrastructure comes first!  
 To achieve the large numbers of housing means significant infrastructure investment is 
required.  
 Even some of the smaller developments require infrastructure to various degrees. The  
ii 
 Local Plan is designed to ensure that infrastructure comes first.  
 This will be achieved through the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP), which will drive this 
very importa nt issue.  
 While some developments may go through and provide some infrastructure needs 
afterwards, the larger developments must have the infrastructure before the 
development starts. Infrastructure first!  
 The money to pay for infrastructure will either com e from developers as a result of a 
levy (known as the Community Infrastructure Levy), the Council, or the Government in 
the case of the larger scale developments.  
 Basildon Borough Council is committed to ensuring that infrastructure comes first and 
that de velopments are not constructed piecemeal over areas in order to negate required 
infrastructure (development creep).  
SUMMARY  
 The Local Plan provides a legal framework to object to developments if we feel there is 
not the appropriate infrastructure.  
 We have to have one, or the Government will inflict one on us.  
 The Local Plan covers the period to 2034 but is reviewable after five years to maintain 
flexibility.  
 We should be planning for at least 19,400 houses.  
 We may have to give up 4% of our Green Belt.  
 We be lieve in Infrastructure First.

 Introduction  
 
 Basildon  Borough Council has prepared this Local Plan in order to set out how places in Basildon 
Borough  will change over the period from 2014 to 2034 to accommodate  sustainable development 
and growth. It also sets out the policies that will be applied to ensure that individual development 
proposals contribute positively towards this Local Plan. It covers all planning matters with the 
exception of waste and minerals development  which are planned for separately by Essex County 
Council as the waste and minerals planning authority. This Local Plan, along with the current Essex 
Minerals Local Plan  and Essex and Southend -on-Sea Waste Local Plan , form the Development 
Plan fo r Basildon Borough. Policies in this Local Plan will replace the 2007 Saved Policies from the 
Basildon District Local Plan  adopted in 1998.  
 This document comprises the full suite of strategic policies, allocation policies and development 
management policie s. The vision and objectives for future development and change within the 
Borough are accompanied by policies that set out the strategic approach to growth and distribution 
of development across the Borough in order to achieve sustainable development. Ther eafter, the 
chapters are arranged thematically. Within each chapter, strategic policies are followed by 
allocation policies (where appropriate), and then development management policies.  
 The strategic  policies  set out a strategic  framework  of how the Council,  in partnership  with others, 
will respond to the vision and objectives for development and change within the Borough in the 
period to 2034. These policies set the framework for joint working, managing development and 
supporting  service  provision.  They also provide  a borough -wide approach  for guiding  development to  
designated  parts  of the Borough,  and put in place  mechanisms  for delivering  infrastructure  and 
protecting and enhancing the built and natural environment, including the Green  Belt.  
 The allocation  policies  identify  the specific  locations  where  development  and change will occur. In 
order to ensure that development occurs in a way which supports the vision and objectives,  criteria  
have  been  developed  for each  allocation,  setting  out the types of development which  may occur,  and 
any mitigation  and infrastructure  provision  necessary  to support  development, including phasing its  
delivery.   
 The development management policies are intended to be applied through the development 
management (i.e. planning application) process. They set out how development will be  managed to 
ensure that it contributes towards the vision and objectives.  
 The policies  in the Local  Plan may, in turn, be supported  by Supplementary  Planning  Documents 
(SPD)  which  will provide  further  local guidance  on specific  elements  of development  (such  as the 
application of vehicle parking standards or the use and design of sustainable drainage systems), or 
may assist in coordinating or managing development in specific areas, such a s town centres  or 
conservation areas. An SPD can be prepared at any time to supplement the Local Plan and its 
delivery.   
 In addition,  over the plan period,  the Local  Plan may be further  supplemented  by Neighbourhood 
Plans, prepared by Local Councils or Neighbourhood Forums, in accordance with the Localism Act  
2011 . These  could  set out additional  planning  policies  for the management  of development  in 
smaller,  distinctive  localities,  in accordance  with the Local  Plan.  Where  they are “made” , 
Neighbourhood Plans are part of the statutory Development Plan for the  Borough.   
 This Local P lan has been prepared in the context of ongoing joint working across South Essex in 
order to address strategic cross boundary matters. A Joint Strateg ic Plan  for South Essex is being 
prepared, with the proposals in this Local P lan contributing towards the joint ambitions for growth 
and infrastructure set out in that Strategy.   
 In order to ensure that this  Local  Plan is robust and responds positiv ely to local issues, an evidence 
based  approach  has been  taken  in its preparation.  This evidence  includes  studies  and assessments 
undertaken  in order  to understand  both the needs  for development  and growth,  their likely  impact, 
and the physical constraints  on development and growth in the Borough.   
 This Local Plan has also been prepared having regard to substantial numbers of consultation 
responses received during the preparation of the Basildon Borough Core Strategy  that the Council 
was initially working o n in the period from 2007 to 2014, and the Draft Local Plan  and New and  
 
2 Alternative Sites consultations which occurred in 2016. This has helped the Council  prioritise  
issues associated with accommodating development, alongside appropriate infrastructure, and to 
better understand  the value  residents and businesses place  on distinct  features  of the local built and 
natural  environment.   
 Consultation activities have been s upplemented with ongoing engagement on a wider strategic 
scale with relevant public bodies under the Duty to Cooperate. This has included neighbouring 
authorities, the County Council, the Mayor of London, Highways England and Homes England. In 
addition foc used engagement with service and infrastructure providers, key statutory consultees 
such as the Environment Agency, Historic England, Natural England, Parish Councils, as well as 
site promoters has enabled the Council to plan more effectively for developme nt, aware of the full 
range of infrastructure, environmental and delivery considerations surrounding the proposals in the 
Local P lan.  
 It is clear  from the evidence  that there  is need  for sustainable  development  to take place  in the Borough 
in order to sup port a growing local population, and to ensure an active and vibrant local economy. 
There are also added pressures for growth in the Borough due to its proximity to Greater  London  
which  is key driver  for economic  growth,  and also gives  rise to an additional need for housing as 
people move out of London to  live.  
 Evidence also reveals where there are constraints on growth in the Borough, including areas of 
specific nature conservation value and areas at risk of  flooding. The Borough's settlements ar e also 
enveloped by a substantial swathe of Green Belt that has worked positively to maintain the 
separation between towns within and beyond the Borough. The  retention  of strategic  corridors  of 
Green  Belt continues  to present  a constraint  on development an d how future growth can reasonably 
be accommodated.   
 Whilst  there  are notable  constraints  to development  within  the Borough,  this plan makes provision 
for relatively substantial levels of growth. This requires some  land which  was identified  by the 
Basildon  District  Local  Plan  as falling  within  the Green Belt to be reallocated for development 
purposes. In reallocating such land, great care has been taken to identify sites which are less 
environmentally sensitive and which allow for the strategic corridors o f Green Belt, especially to the 
east of Basildon providing separation from Thundersley and to the west of Basildon providing 
separation from West Horndon, to continue to fulfil their important and valued function.   
 In making this provision however, the Cou ncil is clear that the growth it enables must be supported 
by improvements to transport, education and health infrastructure and other community facilities. 
Without these improvements, the concerns residents and businesses have expressed in terms of 
growth  will not be addressed, and growth will not be sustainable.

 Policy Context  
Legislative Context  
 This Local Plan has been prepared by the Local Planning Authority in accordance with the 
requirements of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), and the Town and Country 
Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 . 
 Since  2010, the Gov ernment has been reforming the planning system, major changes of which were 
brought into effect by the Localism Act 2011 , and subsequent Regulations. Through the Localism 
Act, communities have been given the power to have a greater influence over what happ ens to the 
areas where they live and work. They can bring forward Neighbourhood Plans, Neighbourhood 
Development Orders and Community Right to Build Orders, which must  conform to  the Local  Plan 
and national  planning  policy,  but do allow  for communities  to have  a greater  say over managing  
development.  
 The planning system has also been reformed to reduce the administrative burden of planning on 
businesses and households, and increase the supply of housing by reusing existing buildings. 
Amendments have been ma de to the General Permitted Development Rights Order (GPDO)  and the  
Use Classes Order  negating the need for planning permission for certain alterations to business 
premises, certain alterations to residential dwellings and certain changes of  use. 
National Policy Context  
 The NPPF sets out  the Government’s planning policies for achieving sustainable development, plan 
making and taking decision on planning applications. Local Plans are seen as key to delivering 
sustainable development and must therefore be pre pared in accordance with the principles and 
policies set out in the  NPPF . 
 The Government has published a separate Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) and a National 
Planning Policy for Waste (NPPW) which provide additional national policy on their specific areas of 
planning . As with the NPPF , the PPTS  sets out the requirements for local planning authorities when 
preparing Local Plans and taking decisions on planning applications in relation to Gypsies, Travellers 
and Travelling  Showpeople. The NPPW sets out planning policy for the management of waste and 
the preparation of Waste Local Plans. Both document s should be read in conjunction with the NPPF .  
 To provide more information and to support policies set out in the NPPF , the Government  has also 
published the national Planning  Practice Guidance (PPG) . This guidance sets out further details, 
including technical requirements, that should be considered when preparing plans and making 
decisions on planning  applications.  
 This Local Plan has been prepared  in accordance with the NPPF published in March 2012. Prior to 
submission of this plan to the Secretary of State for examination, the Government published a 
revised NPPF  in July 2018. To ensure that the policies contained within the plan remain robust and 
up-to-date post adoption, consideration has been given to these changes in national policy.  
The South East (Inshore) Marine Plan  
 The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) has commenced work on the preparation of the first 
South East (Inshore) Marine Plan. The Thames Estuary, and its creek system including Holehaven, 
Vange and East Haven creeks, fall within this Marine P lan area. The Marine Plan’s jurisdiction will 
overlap with the Local Planning Authority’s Local Plan responsibilities (which extend to mean low 
water level) and due regard must therefore be paid to the Marine Plan. This new and evolving 
concept of a Marine Plan will, at a local level, be implemented in accordance with the national Marine 
Policy Statements. The Local Plan will need to be integr ated with the South East (Inshore) Marine 
Plan once it is complete, to provide a consistent approach for planning on land, and within the 
Borough’s inter -tidal and marine environment. Given the infancy of the South East (Inshore) Marine 
Plan at the time of  finalising this Local Plan, any material implications on the Local Plan will be 
considered at its first review.   
  
 
4 The South East Local Enterprise Partnership  
 To bridge  the gap between  the national  and local levels,  business -led Local  Enterprise  Partnerships 
(LEPs) have been established across the country. The South East LEP (SELEP) includes Basildon 
Borough and comprises the areas of Essex, Kent and East Sussex. Whilst the LEP  has no statutory 
land use planning powers, it is responsible for deter mining local economic priorities and undertaking 
activities to encourage economic growth and local job  creation.  
 In July 2014, the SELEP agreed a "Growth Deal" with the Government which aims to contribute to  
the LEP’s  Strategic  Economic  Plan (2014),  helpin g to renew  the physical  and intellectual  capital of the 
South East of England. The Growth Deal focuses initially on transport infrastructure and meeting the 
skills capital requirements identified by the LEP, but also lays the foundations for increased growth 
across the SELEP area. It gives renewed impetus to the delivery of new jobs and homes in the 
Thames Gateway and in other key growth locations.  
 Within  the Growth  Deal,  and in the associated  Strategic  Econo mic Plan, South  Essex  is identified as a 
federated area where a significant proportion of the SELEP's growth is expected to be  met. 
The County Policy Context  
County Strategy  
 Basildon  Borough  is a two tier authority  area, with Essex County Council providing  a range of 
services and infrastructure such as highways, education and social services at a county -wide level. 
The County Strategy  focuses the provision of services to achieve the greatest benefit to delivering a 
buoyant economy for both the existing and future residents and businesses in Essex.  
 The Economic Plan for Essex (2014)  remains consistent with this strategic ambition and was 
developed in conjunction with the district, borough and city councils in Essex. It identifies the steps 
that local partner s will take together, alongside the private sector and the Government to accelerate 
local growth over a seven year period (2014 -2021) and lays the foundation for long -term sustainable 
growth in the years to follow. The Plan states the capacity of key trans port corridors within Essex is a 
key challenge to securing growth; a challenge that partners are working together to meet.  
 The A127 is one of these key transport corridors, and therefore a specific strategy for that route has 
been put in place. The A127 Co rridor for Growth : An Economic Plan (March 2014)  is a joint strategy 
between E ssex County Council  and Southend -on-Sea Borough Council and was adopted to provide 
greater journey time reliability along the length of the corridor to sustain the economic advan tage of 
the A127, as well as to facilitate future growth and prosperity in the region. A similar plan is now 
being prepared for the A13 with Southend -on-Sea and Thurrock Borough Councils.  
 Essex County Council  has also published a number of other policies and guidance documents 
relevant to development and growth in the Borough . These will be referenced throughout the Local 
Plan where  relevant.  
Essex Local Transport Plan  
 The Essex Transport Strategy (2011) sets out the 15 year vision to improve travel in the County and 
underlines the importance of the transport network in achieving sustainable, long term economic 
growth and enriching the life of residents. It is supplemented by delivery strategies for public 
transport, highways, cycling and Public Rights of Way (PRoW) . 
Essex Minerals Local Plan  
 The Essex Minerals Local Plan (2014) is a statutory Development Plan and should be read 
alongside the  Local  Plan.  It identifies  sites and locations  for the extraction  of mineral  deposits  within  
Essex. There are no identified extraction sites within Basildon Borough. However, there are deposits 
of sand and gravel within the Borough which are subject to a Minerals Safeguarding policy within the  
Minerals  Local  Plan.  Regard sh ould be had to the requirements of the Minerals Local Plan  where a 
development of 5 hectares or more falls within one of these  areas.   
 
5 Essex and Southend -on-Sea Waste Local Plan  
 Essex County Council is the waste planning authority for the Borough, and is re sponsible for 
preparing planning  policies, and also for assessing applications for waste management development.  
The Essex  and Southend -on-Sea Waste  Local  Plan (2017)  is a statutory  Development Plan which  should  
be read alongside  this Local  Plan.  It sets out where  and how waste  management developments  can 
occur,  and is the planning  policy  against  which  waste  management  development planning applications 
are assessed against.  
 A strategic Integrated Waste Management Facility is located at Tovi Ecopark in Cou rtauld Road, 
Basildon which is supported by six transfer stations across the County. They are essential for the 
sustainable management of household waste. The land at Tovi Ecopark has been safeguarded in 
the Waste Local Plan , which is reflected on the Poli cies Map, to ensure that it is able to continue its 
operation without being adversely affected by other development. No further sites, beyond those at 
Courtauld Road, have been specifically identified within the Borough for waste management 
purposes.  
 In addition,  the landfill  site at Pitsea  Hall Lane,  Pitsea  has planning  permission  for the disposal  of 
both inert and non -inert waste, as allocated in the previous Essex and Southend on Sea  Waste Local 
Plan (2001 ). In 2015 Essex County Council resolved to gra nt planning permission (subject to 
planning conditions and legal agreements) for an “extension of time” to complete the restoration of  
this site by 2027,  with no increase  in the total tonnage  of waste  to be received  to that previously 
approved. The final restoration and after -use remains as a wildlife  site. 
 The Waste  Local  Plan also identifies  Areas  of Search  to meet  the need  for additional small  scale  waste  
management  facilities.  It identifies  four areas  of Areas  of Search  within  the Borough.  These  Areas  of 
Search  are existing  industrial  estates  within  the Borough,  and are located away  from residential  and 
other  uses  sensitive  to amenity  impacts  such  as schools,  retail,  leisure and  office  development.  The 
Waste  Local  Plan would  seek  to focus  any new proposals  for waste management facilities, which 
support the local housing and economic growth, within  these Areas of  Search.  
The South Essex Policy Context  
 Opportunity South Essex (OSE) is a business -led partnership which supports the delivery of  
regenera tion and economic  growth  projects  as set out in the SELEP  Growth  Deal and associated 
Strategic  Economic  Plan in South  Essex.  The South Essex local authorities comprising Basildon, Castle 
Point, Rochford, Southend -on-Sea and Thurrock, as well as Essex Count y Council sit on that partnership.  
 Separately, the South Essex local authorities, plus Brentwood and Essex County Council have 
recently formed the Association of South Essex Local Authorities (ASELA). ASELA has developed a 
high level vision for South Essex  entitled South Essex 2050 , which considers the future of the 
enlarged South Essex area, disregarding internal administrative boundaries. The focus of this vision 
is to secure growth through a process of place -making, and for that growth to be supported by  
significant upgrades to strategic infrastructure. Additionally, there is a focus on ensuring that more 
local people are able to benefit from that growth by removing barriers to employment. A number of 
work streams have been established to deliver the South Essex 2050 vision. The work streams most 
relevant to this Local Plan are those regarding Spatial Planning, Industrial Strategy and 
Infrastructure.  
 The South Essex 2050  vision identifies six main growth locations in the area, and it is now intended 
that the local planning authorities and Essex County Council will work together to prepare a Joint 
Strateg ic Plan for South Essex. This will be accompanied by a separate Joint  Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan. A  Memorandum  of Understanding  (MOU) has been developed and signed which sets out the 
framework for delivering a joint plan, and various shared key principles have been agreed including a 
protocol for engaging with each other on strategic planning matters.   
Basildon Borough Council - Corporate Plan  
 The Corporate Plan 2017 – 2021 is entitled Transforming Basildon and is committed to improving the 
lives of all residents living in the five towns that make up the Borough. It seeks to create opportunity 
and prosperity for local people and businesses, and sets out three promises:   
 
6 Promise 1: Strong, safe and healthy communities with access to quality homes  
Promise 2: Vibrant town centres and a thriving economy for everyone  
Promise 3: E nhanced local environment and increased pride in our borough  
 
 There is a strong sense of achieving a balance between social, economic and environmental 
outcomes within the Corporate Plan, and also clear ambitions for a reducing inequalities and 
improving o pportunities. Partnership working is identified as a key mechanism through which 
elements of these promises can be delivered.  An Economic Development Policy  (2017)  has been 
adopted in order to deliver the economic elements of this Corporate Plan.  
Strategi c Cross Boundary Matters  
 Through the Council's participation in OSE, the ASELA , and also through existing county -wide 
arrangements, opportunities have arisen to develop a coordinated approach to the preparation and 
delivery of Development Plans at the Sout h Essex and County levels, as well as preparing joint 
evidence bases, strategies and sharing experiences and best  practice.  
 In preparing the Local Plan, there has, and continues to be, ongoing dialogue, meetings  and 
discussions  with South Essex,  Greater  Essex and Greater  London  authorities, as well as other key 
bodies such as Highways England, Natural England and the Environment Agency.  Some of the 
matters that have and will continue to require ongoing cooperation  are: 
 Housing delivery in South Essex, and the distribution of any unmet needs arising, in a way 
which supports place -making in South Essex;  
 The delivery of employment and economic growth in South Essex, which builds on sectoral 
strengths, and grows key employment clusters such as the A127 Enterpri se Corridor;  
 The capacity of the strategic road network (A127, A13 and A130) in South Essex, and 
securing the investment needed to deliver the route management strategies for this 
network in order to enable growth;  
 The implications and opportunities arisin g from the route of the Lower Thames Crossing 
passing through South Essex;  
 The implications and opportunities arising from Crossrail, and any further extensions of 
Crossrail/Crossrail 2 into South Essex;  
 The implications and opportunities for South Essex, arising from the update to the London 
Plan, and any difficulties being experienced by the Mayor of London in meeting London’s 
development needs;  
 The expansion of the Lakeside Basin in Thurrock into a new mixed -use town centre, and 
the implications this has for the retail and town centre hierarchy in South Essex;  
 The unmet accommodation needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople, both 
in terms of permanent pitches and also transit sites, both at a South Essex level and also 
county -wide;  
 Existing and future creation of strategic cross -boundary green infrastructure corridors, 
including the habitats and recreational areas in the Thames Est uary;  
 The avoidance and/or management of recreational pressures arising from population 
growth in Essex on Essex Coast habitat  sites;   
 Joint working with neighbouring authorities  to secure the protection of the Green Belt 
where it fulfils the role of preve nting coalescence between neighbouring settlements;   
 Joint working with Essex County Council to meet the waste and minerals needs arising 
from development and growth;  
 Joint  working  with the Environment Agency, the Lead  Local  Flood  Authority  and other  flood 
risk management  authorities to identify and manage all types of flood risk and land drainage 
issues;  and 
 Joint working with NHS England, the Basildon and Brentwood Clinical Commissioning 
Group, the Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital, other health service providers, and 
public health bodies to deliver improvements to health outcomes, and reduce health 
inequalities, in the Borough.

 Spatial Portrait  
 
 Basildon Borough lies at the heart of South Essex, 48 kilometres or 30 miles east of the City of 
London covering an area of approximately 110 square kilometres, or 42 square miles. Figure 3.1 
illustrates  this context  alongside  the immediate  neighbouring  authorities  and the wider  Essex,  Kent 
and London  areas.  
Figure 3.1 Basildon Borough Sub -Regional Context Map
 
 
 
 The urban areas of Basildon (including Laindon and Pitsea), Billericay and Wickford and the three 
serviced villages of Bowers Gifford, Crays Hill and Ramsden Bellhouse are surrounded by 
countryside designated as Green Belt. The Green Belt contains two unserviced villages and 
thirteen plotland settlements. The unplanned nature of the plotland settlements means some are of 
low environmental quality, b ut remain within the setting of the Green Belt.  
Our Historic Context  
 Human  activity  in the Borough  can be traced  to around  10,000BC.  The Medieval  Period  (1066 -1537) 
laid the foundations for modern development with the establishment of local manors, parish 
churches  and parish  boundaries  mainly  within  the town  of Billericay,  and the villages  of Basildon, 
Laindon, Pitsea, Dunton, Great Burstead, Little Burstead, Crays Hill and  Vange.During  the late 19th 
and early  20th century  the agricultural  depression  caused  many  Essex  farms to become semi -
derelict or abandoned, particularly on the heavy claylands which were hard to farm. Entrepreneurs 
bought land at these farms, dividing and selling them off as individual plots and  small  holdings  to 
many  East Londoners  and returning  soldiers  from the First World  War. This created  a generation  of 
unregulated  development  which  comprised  of houses  that were  little more than  wooden  shacks  with 
no access  to mains  services  or sanitation  and accessible  only by unmade roads. These areas became 
known as plotlands, remnants of which still exist  today.  
 The main  settlement  in the Borough  is Basildon;  a Mark  1 New Town  designated  in 1949  and built in  
 
 
8 a number  of phases  over 50 years  to create  more  regulated  development  in place  of the extensive 
plotlands and to absorb the expanding population of London. The New Town Designated Area 
largely absorbed the villages of Basildon, Laindon, Nevendon, Vange and Pitsea.  
 There  are three  nationally  designated  Scheduled  Monuments  in the Borough;  related to surviving 
Bronze  Age earthworks  in Norsey  Woods  in Billericay  and two moated  sites at Botelers  and West 
Thorpe in Basildon. There are four Conservation Areas; Billericay High Street, Little Burstead, 
Great  Burstead  and Noak  Bridge  and around  130 Listed Buildings,  including  two churches  in Great 
Burstead and Laindon that are afforded the highest level of legal protection, Grade I  status.  
Our Population and Demography  
 The Borough's population has dramatically increased since the 1950's following the phased 
construction  of Basildon  New Town  and the gradual  expansion  of the older  settlements  of Billericay 
and Wickford. The 2014 based sub -national population predictions have predicted that the 
Borough ’s population has now increased to 183,000. Of this, B asildon (including Laindon and 
Pitsea) accommodates around two -thirds of the population with the remaining third being located 
within Billericay, Wickford and the surrounding serviced and unserviced settlements . 
 The Addendum to the South Essex Strategic Ho using Market Assessment (SHMA  Addendum ) 
(2017) examines population projections  up to 2037.  It is predicted  that there  will be an increase  in the 
population  in the Borough of 34,197 people between 2014 and  2037.  
 When the outcomes of the 2011 Census are compared to the 2001 Census , the main changes  in 
the population since 2001 have been the increasing proportion of residents aged between 60 -64 
(increased  by 35%)  and those  aged  85 and over (increased  by 44%).  The majority  of the residents 
describe themselves as being White British (89.5%), with other Minority Groups accounting for 
11.5%  of the Borough  population,  an increase  of 6.4%  from 2001.  The majority  consider  themselves to 
be Christian (60.3%) with other faiths accounting fo r 2.9%.  
Our Transport Connections  
 Figure 3.2 illustrates the connections the Borough has with national and regional strategic road 
networks;  via the east-west A127,  A13 and north -south  A130  corridors.  These  connect  the Borough 
with London and Greater Essex  including destinations such as London Southend Airport and 
London Stansted Airport, the international ports of Felixstowe, Tilbury and Harwich and the new 
super container port of London Gateway.

 The Borough  is also served  by two railway  lines to the north  and south.  Access  to these  is via five 
railway stations: Basildon, Laindon, Pitsea, Billericay and Wickford. Rail services from Billericay 
and Wickford connect to Stratford City and  terminate  at London  Liverpool  Street.  In 2018,  Crossrail  
services  will be fully operational from Shenfield, one stop west of Billericay, linking non -stop with 
Maidenhead and Heathrow Airport, via Central London. In the south of the Borough, rail services 
run between London Fenchurch  Street  and Shoeburyness  with services  to Lakeside  Shopping  
Centre  and Dagenham, via a junction at  Pitsea.  
Our Landscape and Natural Environment  
 The Borough's landscape is varied, comprising three main urban development areas and three 
serviced settlements, set within arable farmland, permanent grazing with hedgerows, woodland 
and a large area of the Thames Estuary's coastal grazing marshland. The plotlands are 
characterised  by sporadic  residential  development  and a mosaic  of scrub,  grassland  and woodland 
habitats.  
 The local natural environment is rich in nationally and locally important habitats with six Sites of 
Special  Scientific  Interest  (SSSIs)  ranging  from Ancient  Woodland  and rich grasslands  in Billericay to 
coastal marsh  in Vange, Fobbing and Pitsea. There are over 50 Local Wildlife Sites (LoWS), Local  
Nature  Reserves  (LNRs)  and Country  Parks  with over 150km  of PRoW that provide a means of 
accessing the open  countryside.  
 There are no internationally or European protected habitats in the Borough, however there are 
Ramsar Sites, Special Protection Areas (SPA), and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) within 
5km of the Borough boundary, principally downstream of the River Crouch, the Borough's main 
watercourse, which has its s ource in Little  Burstead.  
Our Housing Stock  
 There  are approximately  76,000  existing  homes  in the Borough,  64% of which  are owner  occupied, 
21% socially rented and 10% privately rented. The Borough's housing stock comprises 21.7% 
detached, 25.7% semi -detach ed, 35.2% terraced and 17.4% flats and others with the majority 
 
 
10 having 2 -3 bedrooms  (42%).  
Our Education Provision and Performance  
 At 2017, the Commissioning School Places team at Essex County Council recorded 51  primary 
schools, 10 secondary schools and 6  sixth forms in the  Borough.  
 Educational attainment in both primary and secondary level is slightly lower than the East of 
England  and England  averages.  The 2011  Census  also showed  that the skills  level amongst  adult 
residents is also low. Only 17% of resident workers are qualified to NVQ4 and above, and 40% 
hold only NVQ1 or no qualifications at  all. 
 Key to improving this situation  has been to tackle  the quality  of educational  provision in the 
Borough . In Autumn 2013 Essex County Council, Basildon Boro ugh Council and the Basildon 
Education Partnership  Trust agreed with 35 Basildon schools to form a partnership panel of local 
authorities and School  Leaders  to support  one another  and work together  more effectively.  By 
August  2015, this had led to the merg er of separate infant and junior schools into primaries, the 
creation of a new  teaching  school  and the raising  of standards  at all schools  ensuring  none  remain  
being  classed as inadequate by Ofsted.  
 Higher education opportunities existing at some of the Borough's secondary Academies, as well as  
with the South  Essex  College, SEEVIC  and ProCAT colleges  which  have  skills  campuses  in the 
Borough.  
Our Economy  
 The South Essex Economic Development Needs Assessment (EDNA) 2017  identifies  Basildon  as 
the largest e conomy in the South Essex sub -region.  Basildon is  home  to the A127  Enterprise  Corridor,  
the largest concentration of employment in Essex and there are some 87,0001 jobs based in the 
Borough.  
 The EDNA identifies that the Borough's working  age population  broadly  matches  that of the county  
and region.  However,  the low resident skills base results in high level of out commuting. .  The main  
business sectors in the Basildon Borough are wholesale and retail trade (21%), manufacturing 
(14%) and human health and social work activities  (13%).  
 In total there are over 7,300 VAT registered business enterprises trading in the  Borough. Centre for 
Cities Outlook (2018),  suggests that the Borough has the 7th largest quantity of business stock in 
the UK. It considers busi nesses in the Borough to have lower than the national average of business 
closures compared to other parts of the country at 49/10,000 population, whilst business start -ups 
are one of the highest in the country at 68.2/10,000 population; ahead of major cit ies in the UK 
such as Leeds and Liverpool and greater than the national average.  
 In terms of employment stock, the Basildon Economic Development Policy identified that the 
Borough has a strong enterprise base with a particularly high concentration  in the  ICT and Digital, 
Wholesale, Construction, Motor Trades, Retail, Financial and Insurance,  and Health and 
Manufacturing  sectors . 
 In the Borough, the unemployment trend increased between 2008 and 2013, in line with the 
economic downturn, however between 2013  and 2015 the claimant rate has started to decline 
showing that levels of  unemployment  is beginning  to fall and the Job Seeker  Allowance claimant 
count is now at  1.6%2. 
Our Retail, Leisure and Provision  
 Basildon Town Centre is one of Essex's regional town centres, alongside Chelmsford, Southend -
on-Sea and Colchester. There are four other town centres in the Borough;  Pitsea, Laindon,

11 Billericay and Wickford of varying size and  function.  
 The Borough  has four out-of-centre  retail  parks  that all have  at least  one large  supermarket  providing 
convenience goods. There are also 39 local centres that support the Borough's residential and 
business neighbourhoods with basic shopping and service  needs.  
 The Borough's centres are facing increasing competition from other retail locations including 
Lakeside, Bluewater and Westfield at Stratford, as well as Southend -on-Sea and Chelmsford. The 
Lakeside Basin has approval through the Thurrock Borough Local Plan Core Strategy to be 
changed into a more mixed -use town centre, wit h further planned expansion of retail,  residential, 
leisure and commercial uses.  
 The Borough  offers  a range  of leisure  and recreational  opportunities  including  the Basildon  Sporting 
Village,  which  includes  the only 50m swimming  pool in Essex  and South  Esse x Gymnastic  Centre. 
The Borough is also home to several health clubs, four golf courses, four country parks and  over 
1,300ha of open space.  
 Basildon  Festival  Leisure  Park and its immediate surroundings  is the Borough's  principal  commercial  
leisure  complex  which  contains a multiplex cinema, bowling alley, wake boarding centre, play 
centre, bar and nightclub, a gym, go -karting centre, and several restaurants and  hotels.

 Drivers of Change  
Economic Growth Agenda  
 The Government is pursuin g an economic growth agenda in order to ensure that Britain has a 
stable, robust and competitive economy. Local Plans are expected to support economic growth by 
building on strengths and address ing potential barriers to investment, such as a poor  environme nt 
or any lack of infrastructure, services or housing. This requirement has significant implications for 
the levels of growth identified in this Local  Plan.  
Demographic Change and Population Growth  
 The population of the Borough is expected to grow substant ially over the next 20 years. A 
significant  driver  of this growth  will be natural  change  in the population  i.e. babies  being  born.  This 
alone gives rise to the need for an extra 770 homes per year within the Borough over the plan 
period.  Basildon  is also an attractive  location  for people  moving  out of London  to raise  a family, which 
given its history as a Mark 1 New Town is not surprising, as it was designed for such a population. 
Migration from elsewhere in England, primarily London, along with market sig nals and likely job 
growth gives rise to the need for between 1,019 -1,033 homes per annum over the plan  period.  
 The number of older people within the Borough as a proportion of the population is also increasing. 
The number of people aged over 65 living in the Borough is expected to increase by 17,000 people 
by 2037. This has  implications for the types of homes that need to be provided in the Borough, and 
the types of supporting infrastructure that is put in  place.  
 Whilst  the population  of older  people  in the Borough  is increasing,  it is forecast that there  will also 
remain  a strong demand for family type accommodation, and the types of infrastructure that 
support families and young people such as schools. It is anticipated that the requirements of this 
plan will generate a need for several  new primary schools and a new seconda ry school.  
 The provision of homes for families and the supporting infrastructure which makes the Borough an  
attractive  place  to live is essential.  Without  this, new people  will not be attracted  to the Borough and  
the size of the labour  force  would  decline,  due to the ageing  population,  affecting  the success of the 
local economy. It is expected that migration from London will be a key driver of population growth 
amongst the working age population in the  future.  
Improving the Quality of Life  
 Consultation with residents throughout the preparation of the Local Plan  has identified  a number  of 
issues  that are important  to residents  in terms  of ensuring  a good  quality  of life:  
 Many residents are frustrated by the levels of congestion experienced in  the Borough, 
particularly at peak times, and therefore a reduction in the levels of congestion should be 
a key driver for change. Opportunities presented through the Essex Local Transport Plan 
(2011) , the proposed South Essex Joint Strategy  Plan and throu gh new development 
proposals will enable this to occur.  
 Many residents also expressed frustration about the quality and the capacity of education 
provision in the Borough, with a particular emphasis on the quality of secondary 
education within  the main  urban area of Basildon.  Work  has been  undertaken  to address  
the quality  of school provision in Basildon, and the Borough Council is working closely 
with the County Council  to identify  the need  for new school  provision  to support  growth.  The 
Basildon  Economic Development Policy, Breakthrough Basildon Borough Commission 
(2018) and Pathways to Success Panel (2018) all set out opportunities for wider 
engagement in ongoing training  and skills  development  within  the Borough  to improve  
access  to jobs and reduce depri vation and ensure more inclusive growth can be realised.  
 Residents  were  also concerned  about  the capacity  and quality  of healthcare  services.  
Whilst specific  healthcare  matters  are beyond  the control  of the Council,  the Council  and 
the County Council  have  engaged  pro-actively  to assist NHS England and the Basildon 
and Brentwood  Clinical  Commissioning  Group (CCG) to bring about improvements in the 
local area. This includes assisting with highway and public transport access 
improvements  to Basildon  Hospital,  and working  with the CCG and the hospital to directly  
 
13 deliver new and modernised healthcare facilities. The Local P lan will set out other 
opportunities to secure new healthcare provision within the  Borough as it grows.  
 Residents value the sense of openness and greenness that is present in the Borough, 
and therefore this should be enhanced and protected as appropriate. This Local P lan 
puts in place mechanisms for the delivery of new Green Infrastructure projects within th e 
Borough and further afield through supporting a refresh to the South Essex Green Grid 
Strategy with other South Essex councils.  
 Residents value local services and town centres. The Local P lan seeks to enhance and 
protect them as appropriate. Masterplans and project focused regeneration strategies are 
in place to enable the regeneration of Basildon, Pitsea  and Wickford  town  centres, whilst a 
planning consent is in place for the substantial redevelopment of the entire  Laindon 
Shopping Centre within Laindon Town Centre  which will significantly enhance its vitality 
through fundamental overhaul of its physical form, layout and public realm and the 
diversification and quality of its retail offer.  Billericay  meanwhile will continue to benefit  
from a public realm strategy aimed at managing the conservation of its historic and 
protected core, which should help enhance its  ongoing commercial success.  
Protecting the Environment  
 The environment in the Borough is fundamental to the quality of life of residents as an ame nity, and 
is also intrinsically important for its nature conservation and landscape value. As a consequence, 
the enhancement and protection of the environment is a key driver for change  in the  Borough.  
 Such enhancements may include opportunities to use gre en areas in a multi -functional way, for 
example, to reduce flood risk whilst also providing opportunities for recreation. This is promoted 
within the NPPF , by Essex County Council as the Lead Local Flood Authority and as part of the 
TE2100  Plan. Natural En gland meanwhile are especially advocating the provision of open space 
alongside new development in the Borough to prevent harm arising from recreational disturbance 
to Essex Coast European sites especially, but also SSSIs in the Borough.  
 The need to prote ct the environment meanwhile may drive changes to the way in which new 
developments are built and serviced in order to reduce the amount of pollution to the air and to 
watercourses. These changes are promoted through the Building Regulations , and will also  be 
required  to help ensure compliance with the Ambient Air Quality Directive , and ensure  that water  
quality  in the nearby  rivers  Crouch,  Roach  and Thames  achieves the requirements of the Water 
Framework  Directive . 
Climate Change and Flood Risk  
 Whilst scep tics continue to challenge the causes of climate change, it is clear from empirical 
evidence that the climate is changing, and that this has long -term implications on water resources, 
temperatures and areas at risk  of flooding, including some parts of the  Borough. In addition, there 
will continue to be a need for people and wildlife to adapt and become more resilient to any 
changes.  
 Heavy rainfall events are increasing in occurrence and increase the risk of fluvial and surface water 
flooding within the urba n parts of the  Borough.  
 Meanwhile,  sea-levels  are expected  to continue to rise, increasing  the risk of flooding  in low-lying 
areas  of the Borough,  such  as around  Pitsea  marshes.  Whilst  this area is largely  un-developed  these  
sea-level rises  will have  consequences  for coastal  habitats.  As the sea-levels  rise, coastal  habitats  
will become increasingly squeezed between the sea and any defences, resulting in their decline 
and eventual loss. There are legal duties to plan for, and where possible, limit such  losses.  
 There  is also evidence  of the occurrence  of more  extreme  weather  events.  These  will have  effects on 
the security of our food supply, as well as the health and well -being of people, particularly the 
elderly and other vulnerable groups. There is a need to ensure that development and communities 
are more resilient to the impacts of extreme weather  events in this Local P lan. 
Significant Projects in the Borough  
 There  are some  significant  projects  already  underway  within  the Borough  which  will drive  change  
 
14 over the plan period. These  include:  
 A127 Enterprise Parks Corridor – Within the Borough, there are many multi -national 
companies such as Ford Motor Company, Leonardo, First Data, MK Electric,  Case  New 
Holland  and DST located  within  the A127  Enterprise  Corridor. Ford Dunton Technical Centre is 
the largest of its type in the UK and employs 3,000 highly skilled designers, engineers and 
support staff.  The Basildon  Economic  Development Policy  envisages  that the role of this 
corridor will be retained and sup ported to grow, with the aim of attracting new investors to 
the corridor. Costa Coffee recently opened their new European Roasting Plant and barista 
training centre in this area.  
 
 Basildon  Town Centre  – A Masterplan  has been  prepared  to guide the regeneration  of 
Basildon  Town Centre  to enhance  its role as a regional  centre.  The Masterplan  envisages  
65,300m2 of commercial leisure and comparison retail floorspace, as well as a new college 
campus, a new market and 1,500 to 2,000 new homes. This will b e supported by 
enhanced public transport connections and improved integration. Elements of the 
Masterplan have already been delivered, such as Gloucester Gate and Acacia Park that 
physically link the town centre with Gloucester Park to the north through a green link and 
the new market is due to be completed in 2018 to enable South Essex College’s new 
town centre campus to be built near the station. The remaining  delivery is expected to 
occur within the  plan-period, with public transport and highway improvem ents already 
funded by SELEP due to be delivered by 2021 and the redevelopment of East Square 
and its surroundings with a new cinema and leisure complex due to move into planning 
phase during 2018.  
Significant Projects in South Essex  
 There  are a number  of significant development/infrastructure  projects  elsewhere  in South  Essex  that 
will influence  the Borough. Some of these projects will create new jobs, and will therefore create 
new commuting patterns, opportunities  in new spin-off industries  and new skill requirements.  Others  
will create  new shopping and leisure opportunities for residents that will need to be addressed in 
order that the Borough's town centres continue to grow and thrive to serve local  people.  These 
projects include:  
 London  Gateway, Thurroc k  – This is the UK’s  newest  deep -sea, semi -automated  
container port, rail terminal and Europe’s largest logistics park, sited on the north bank of 
Thames in neighbouring Thurrock. Its first phase opened in November 2013 and once  
complete,  it is expected  that London  Gateway  will create  12,000  direct  jobs and over 
20,000 indirect  jobs in the wider South Essex economy.  
 Port of Tilbury, Thurrock  – Further upstream, the Port of Tilbury has been serving 
London and the South East for over 100 years as a dock and  Cruise Terminal . It has 
expanded during that time offering different facilities and tariffs to London Gateway. The 
Port of Tilbury is currently advancing plans for Tilbury2 on the site of the former Tilbury 
Power Station, which would increase the size of the port by adding new berths further 
downstream. If approved through the Government’s National Significant Infrastructure 
Project’s (NSIP) process , it would become operational during the plan period and the 
Borough has the potential to benefit directly an d indirectly from its construction and 
operation.  
 Southend  Airport  – This airport has received significant investment since 2010, and now 
operates  commercial flights to a number of destinations across Europe, including regional 
flights to Dublin that enab le onward connection to destinations in the USA. The London 
Southend Airport and Environs Joint Area  Action  Plan (2014)  anticipates  that the airport  
will be dealing  with 2 million  passengers  a year by 2030, and that the surrounding area will 
be developed for airport related businesses creating around 6,000  jobs.  
 Southend  Central  Area  – An Area  Action  Plan has been  prepared  for the Southend  
Central  Area, comprising Southend Town Centre and the seafront central area. In 
accordance with Southend -on-Sea’s  Core  Strategy, the Area Action Plan seeks to 
regenerate and transform the existing town centre as a fully  competitive  regional  centre , 
led by the development  of the University  Campus.  The regeneration of Southend provides 
opportunities in relation to access to Higher Education, and also a need for Basildon 
Town Centre to identify its own niche and competitive edge through its own tailored  
 
15 regeneration  programme.  
 Lakeside Basin – The Thurrock Core Strategy (2011) plans for the future of the Lakeside 
Basin including the industrial parks, retail parks and shopping centre. It is proposed that  
transformation will bring about between 7,000 and 9,000 new jobs, primarily through the 
substantial expansion of retail floorspace  (50,000m2 net comparison  floorspace),  and 
additional convenience, office and commercial leisure floorspace to broaden the mix of 
uses. Expansion of retail and leisure provision at Lakeside presents a challenge to 
Basildon Town Centre in identifying its own role and function within the retail hierarchy 
within South  Essex.  
 The Lower Thames Crossing - A preferred route for this crossing has been identified by 
the Government running through the neighbouring Thurrock Borough to the  M25, 
between junctions 29 and 30. It will have a junction with the A13 to the west of the current 
Orsett Cock junction (A13/A128).  This therefore  presents  economic  opportunities,  but will 
need  to be managed carefully  in order  to ensure  it does  not have  negative  consequences  
for the local highway  network and/or land  values.

 Vision and Objectives  
The Vision  
 Building  on the current  spatial  and policy  context  in which  the Borough  sits, the Council  has 
sought to articulate a vision for the future of the Borough, which aligns with the wider South Essex 
2050 vision jointly agreed in 2018. The vision will be delivered through this Local P lan and related 
strategies and  programmes.  
 
 
 In developing this vision the Council has set out identified specific ambitions under five distinct 
headings. It will not be possible to address all of th ese ambitions through the planning process 
alone. However, by creating well planned, attractive communities that are linked to services and 
job opportunities it will be possible for the planning system to contribute towards many of these 
ambitions.  For example,  well planned  communities  which  offer suitable  premises  and housing  will 
attract businesses and skilled people to move to the area contributing to the education and 
employment  ambitions  in particular.  The specific  ambitions  of the Council,  to be delivered through 
this Local P lan, are therefore set out  below:  
Education and Skills  
 To work with our partners through South Essex 2050 to support the educational  and 
skill improvement of local people to ensure they can benefit more inclusively from 
growth, whilst helping them realise their potential;   
 To create an education system that caters for a range of levels of education to better 
support those with no quali fications as well as those reaching a high level of education;  
 To attract  qualified  and motivated  teachers  that are flexible  to meet  the needs  of learners;  
 To provide infrastructure to support learning at all levels, and in areas of the Borough 
that requir e it most;  
 To deliver learning that meets the needs of local businesses, to grow key sectors and 
increase productivity, especially through apprenticeships;  
 To raise the levels of educational attainment and aspiration;  and 
 To enable people with a higher level of education to secure well paid jobs, but not 
forgetting vocational training for trade and public service jobs.  
Employment and Business  
 To work with our partners through South Essex 2050 to support the expansion and 
regeneration of sustainable econo mic and commercial growth centres, supported by a 
locally available and skilled workforce;   
 To support the expansion of the  Borough’s  workforce  to provide  enough  people  to take 
on the jobs available, whilst ensuring the retention of a well -educated and skilled 
workforce within the Borough;  
 To ensure that the skills needs of business are met across a range of sectors, offering 
opportunities for all levels of qualifications and delivering skills support to deliver career 
progression and retain skilled work force;  
 To deliver a thriving and mixed economy offering local jobs for local people;  
 To have a prosperous town centre offer with a good retail offer to attract others;   
Local Plan Vision  
By 2034, we want to accelerate Basildon Borough’s ambition. We want a more prosperous 
economy providing employment for all our residents, including higher value jobs. We need more 
housing and a better  range  of housing.  We want  to protect and enhance  our natural environment 
and biodiversity,  including  open  space.  The Borough will  feel safe and residents will benefit from 
high standards of health  and well-being.  We want  an improved  cultural  offer,  more vibrant town

Strategic Objectives  
 In order to deliver the spatial requirements of the Local Plan’s Vision for 2034, ten Strategic 
Objectives have been set. These  have  been  aligned,  where  possible, to  ensure  compatibility  with 
the Borough’s spatial  and policy context, as well as the  vision  and ambitions  of the Council . They 
have taken account of the Borough’s drivers of change, the evidence base that has informed this 
plan, the Sustainability Appraisal outcomes and relevant feedback from consultation  comments  
received during the plan’s preparation.

 Achieving Sustainable Development  
STRATEGIC POLICIES  
Policy SD1: A Strategic Approach to Sustainable Development in Basildon 
Borough  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  is clear  that the purpose  of the planning  system  is to contribute  towards  the achievement 
of sustainable  development.  It is widely  recognised  that there  are three  dimensions  to sustainable 
development: economic, social and environmental  which should be addressed in an integrated 
way because they are mutually dependent   
 The NPPF sets out how local planning authorities should achieve sustainable development 
through the plan -making process. It expects that that Local Plans should seek oppor tunities  to 
achieve  each  of the economic,  social  and environmental  dimensions  of sustainable development,  
and net gains  across  all three.  Significant  adverse  impacts  on any of these  dimensions should be 
avoided and, wherever possible, alternative options which reduce or eliminate such impacts 
should be pursued. Where adverse impacts are unavoidable, measures to mitigate the impact  
should  be considered.  Where  adequate  mitigation  measures  are not possible,  compensatory 
measures may be appropriate.  
 The NPPF expects local planning authorities to work together to address strategic, cross -
boundary matters which impact on the ability to achieve sustainable levels of growth and 
development in an area. Basildon Borough sits within the South Essex sub -region. There is a 
long history of the authorities in South Essex working together on strategic planning, and in 2017 
the Leaders and Chief Executives (or their equivalents) of the six local planning authorities in 
South Essex (including Brentwood Borough), and Essex Co unty Council came together to create 
a shared vision for South Essex – South Essex 2050 . The vision identified key policy themes to 
be supported, and six growth areas within South Essex where it is expected development will be 
focused. In order to deliver the vision new joint working arrangements have been established at a 
political and executive level covering strategic planning, industry, education and skills, 
infrastructure and communications.  
 A key task arising from the new joint working arrangements is  the preparation of a Joint Strategic  
Plan for South Essex. There is an ambition for this to deliver the homes and jobs needed in South 
Essex through partnership working, not just at a local level, but also with Government, to bring 
forward the strategic i nfrastructure improvements to transport, education, health and green 
infrastructure that are needed to support growth, particularly in the six growth areas identified in 
the vision.   
 Work on the Joint Strategic Plan is at an early stage, and it is not expected to be adopted until 
2020. The Local Plan will therefore contribute towards some of the growth requirements early in 
that Plan. However, following the adoption of the Joint Strategic  Plan it may be necessary  to 
review this Local P lan, at least in parts, to ensure any opportunities for further growth and 
infrastructure provision in the Borough identified in the Joint Strategic  Plan can be realised.  
Evidence Base  
Economic  Growth  
 The NPPF  requires a local planni ng authority to  support sustainable economic growth  by setting 
out a clear economic vision and strategy for their area . Local planning authorities should be 
planning  positively and  proactively to meet the development needs of business and be able to 
respon d to changes in economic circumstances.  
 The Council recognises the strategic role the Borough has in the South Essex and Greater Essex  
economy,  accounting  for over half of all jobs in South  Essex  alone. It has the largest stock of office 
floorspace in Sou th Essex, and the second largest stock of industrial floorspace. The majority of 
this is concentrated in the A127 Enterprise Corridor, although smaller industrial estates and town 
centres in each of the Borough’s settlements also play a role in this supply .   
 
21 
 In the period from 2001 to 2014, the B orough’s  economy grew by 41% in terms of Gross Value 
Added (GVA), and at £23,313 per capita was £5,000 greater than the South Essex average. 
Consequently, workplace earnings in the Borough sit above average for the area, providing an 
attractor to people living elsewhere is South Essex. When this is combined with the draw 
employment in London has on people living in the Borough, only 56% of jobs are filled by people 
living in the Borough. This highlights the strategic importance of the Borough, and in particular the 
A127 Enterprise Corridor, as a hub for business and employment in South Essex.   
 In order to determine how the economy in South Essex may grow and change in the future, a 
South Essex Economic Development Needs Assessment (2017 ) (EDNA ) has been prepared. The 
EDNA  considered the potential for growth in South Essex and calculated the need for additional 
employment  floorspace across the area using the East of England Forecasting Model (EEFM) as 
a baseline. Sensitivity testing was applied to this baseline to assess growth scenarios focusing on 
various sectors in which the South Essex area has strengths such as advanc ed manufacturing, 
health technologies and the digital and creative sectors. It also considered the potential for 
displaced businesses from East London relocating to South Essex. The EDNA concluded that 
there is the potential to create around 52,800 jobs ac ross South Essex, of which around 14,500 
jobs could be in Basildon Borough. Its growth in sectors requiring office and industrial space will 
generate around 1 0,000 jobs (B -class jobs), which, in turn, will require the provision of at least 
28ha of addition al employment land in the Borough.   
 Whilst taking into account the findings of the EDNA , the Council is also highly ambitious in 
relation to economic growth and seeks to ensure that there are opportunities for businesses to 
grow in the Borough, opportuniti es for new businesses to locate to here and opportunities for 
local people to access jobs through skills development and training, as set out in the Council’s 
Economic Development Policy.   
 The Essex Grow -on Space Feasibility Study (2016)  has highlighted a market failure in the 
Borough in relation to the availability of smaller sized office and industrial units for emerging small 
businesses, curtailing the potential growth of these businesses. This identifies a concealed need 
for employment floorspace of 9ha  arising from local businesses looking for room to grow into.   
 Additionally, discussions with the Greater London Authority (GLA) have indicated that there will 
be unmet business growth arising from London over the next 20 years, which Basildon Borough 
could capture, at least in part. The London Industrial Land Demand Study (2017) expects 
manufacturing and utilities to be industrial sectors where businesses will be seeking relocation 
outside London. This is opportune, given the Borough’s strengths in advance d manufacturing, 
and the Council commits, through the Local P lan, to make provision for  around 14ha  of the  
displaced or unmet employment need from Greater London  through growth in the A127 
Enterprise Corridor .  
 Overall, therefore, the Local P lan commits t o the delivery of at least 51ha of employment land. 
However, employment land is constantly under threat from other uses, such as conversion to 
residential flats under permitted development, and also other commercial activities such as 
commercial leisure, r etail and sui generis uses. Taking into account supply side adjustments for 
churn and losses to other uses, the EDNA  and the Employment Land and Premises Study 
(ELPS) (2013)  have both recommended making additional land available in the Borough for 
economic  growth, with need constituting around 60% of supply.   
 However, there is some employment land supply within the Borough which is owned by 
significant multi -national companies. The Council is keen to encourage the retention of these 
companies as they respon d to changes in the global economy, and therefore recognises that their 
land-holdings may not be available for general economic growth, but may provide opportunities 
for additional job growth in the Borough through business consolidation. This constrains t he 
available supply of land for general economic growth, particularly in relation to sites suitable for 
office space.  
 Consequently, the Local P lan makes provision for 92ha of land for employment purposes, with 
the intention of securing at least the 51ha of B-class employment development needed. This will 
deliver around 1 4,150 B-class jobs, as part of a total jobs growth of at least  20,000 jobs within the 
Basildon economy.   
 Supplying land, and creating conditions for economic investment is however, only pa rt of the  
22 Council’s Economic Development Policy . Another component is ensuring that local residents 
have access to those employment opportunities. Currently, low skill levels prevent access to 
higher paying jobs in the local economy, and employment depriva tion in some parts of the 
Basildon urban area is particularly high. This has implications for other indicators of well-being  
including health outcomes. Growth in higher paying sectors, such as advanced manufacturing 
and digital, cultural and creative techn ologies is therefore considered essential, alongside a 
strategy to engage more local people in education, training and other forms of skills development. 
The Council is pursuing separate, non -planning strategies such as the Pathways to Success 
Panel and Br eakthrough Basildon Borough Commission in order to achieve a skills uplift amongst 
local people and ensure the benefits of growth are more inclusive.  
Housing  Growth  
 In order to achieve the economic ambitions of the Borough, it is necessary to ensure that t he 
housing  and infrastructure  is put in place  to ensure  businesses  have  access  to people  (labour and  
knowledge)  and resources  that they need  to be successful.  Planning policies should recognise 
and seek to address potential barriers to investment, including a poor environment or any lack of 
infrastructure, services or  housing.  
 Significantly boost ing the supply of housing in England  is a key focus for Government and  local 
planning authorities are expected to identify their  local housing need and ensu re that their Local 
Plans meet  this objectively assessed need  in full for market and affordable housing . However 
there are p olicies within the NPPF  which refer to areas or assets, such as  nature conservation  
sites, heritage assets,  locations at risk of flooding and land designated as Green Belt  which have 
the potential to constrain growth . Infrastructure capacity may also be a constraining factor if 
transport impacts are severe, or if the outcomes for communities are unsustainable.  
 The SHMA Addendum , identifies an objectively assessed need (OAN) for housing of up to 4,000 
homes to be delivered in South Essex every year in order to support both housing need and the 
needs of economic growth. This housing target is made up of the cumulative requirements  of the 
five authorities of Basildon, Castle Point, Rochford, Southend -on-Sea and Thurrock that consist 
the housing market area. The Joint Strategic  Plan will address the matter of housing distribution 
between these authority areas once adopted, including any redistribution. However, as a starting 
point the calculated OAN for Basildon Borough is between 972 and 986 homes per annum, or 
between 19,440 a nd 19,720 homes over 20 years. Taking into account the projected 
requirements for additional pitches and plots for the Borough’s ethnic Gypsy and Traveller 
households that have ceased to travel permanently, the Basildon Borough Gypsy, Traveller and 
Travell ing Showpeople Local Needs Accommodation Assessment (BBLNAA) (2018)  indicates 
that the SHMA  need is greater by 51 pitches, taking the OAN to between 19, 491 and 19, 771 
homes over 20 years.   
 The SHMA Addendum  OAN calculations use the 2014 Minister for Housin g, Communities and 
Local Government (MHCLG) sub -national household projections as a basis. The new standard 
method for calculating housing need  set out in the revised NPPF 2018 , if applied now, would also 
use the same set of household projections along wit h housing affordability ratios (2017 based) to 
calculate the requirement for housing in the Borough. The household projections provide the base 
for the calculation with the affordability ratio identifying the scale of uplift required to address local 
marke t conditions with the uplift capped at 40%. The standard method does not use the base 
date of the data ( 2014 ), but rather the current year from which the calculation is to be taken. This 
means that if a Local Plan was prepared today for Basildon Borough it  would have a requirement 
for 17,232 homes over the period from 2018 to 2034 (16 years), based on data up to  31 August 
2018.  Whilst t he OAN calculated by the SHMA Addendum  is higher , it does c over a longer time 
period. Once  completions between 2014 and 201 8 have been  taken into account to contribute 
towards supply,  the remaining housing need for the plan period , including shortfall in provision for 
the period 2014 -2018 , as set out in this Local Plan, is broadly aligned to the figure calculated  by 
the standard method .  
 In preparing the Local  Plan, the Council has taken into account the government’s ambitions for 
housing growth, and the evidence of housing need as set out in the SHMA Addendum . This does 
not vary significantly from the requirement  of the standard methodology . Consideration has also 
been given to the availability of land, spatial distribution options and infrastructure requirements. It 
has also been necessary to consider avoiding areas of the Borough at risk of flooding, 
contaminati on and pollution, as well as avoiding sites of nature conservation importance.    
 
23 
 Account has also been taken of the great importance attached to the permanence, extent and 
role of the Green Belt and the fundamental aim of preventing sprawl by keeping land permanently 
open, altering boundaries only in exceptional circumstances, taking account of the need to 
promote sustainable development. In the Borough, particular regard has been had to preventing 
the coalescence of the Basildon urban area with Thundersley  to the east and West Horndon to 
the west, as this would create a continuous urban conurbation stretching along the A127 around 
20 miles from West Horndon in Brentwood/Thurrock to Shoebury ness  in Southend.   
 Having taken into account the supply of housing t hrough completions, urban capacity (including 
town centre regeneration), sites with planning permission and a windfall allowance, the Council 
concluded that a strategy that would constrain housing growth to sites within the Borough’s urban 
areas would mean  that there would be a significant shortfall of housing when considered against 
the OAN for the Borough. Therefore, achieving sustainable levels of housing development within 
the Borough without impinging on the Green Belt has been unavoidable and Green Be lt 
boundaries have been amended, where exceptional circumstances were judged to have existed, 
in order to achieve sustainable development in the Borough.   
 The Local P lan therefore makes land provision for at least 17,791  homes. When housing supply 
is compa red against the housing need  of between 19,4 91 and 19,77 1, the scale of unmet need is 
identified to be around 10% of the housing requirement. This is similar to the level of unmet need 
based on the standard method approach . While the need is lower at 17,23 2, the supply is also 
comparably lower at 15,531 as it does not include housing completions between 2014 and 2018.   
 In terms of delivery , it is expected that during the plan period to 2034, only around 15,465  homes 
will be delivered, with the annualised rate of delivery varying over the plan period to reflect both 
infrastructure and environmental constraints, which will slow delivery in some locations, and push 
delivery on some large scale strategic sites beyo nd the plan period. The Council has also been 
realistic about lead -in times and build out rates on the suite of sites identified in this plan, 
including a number of Green Belt sites which will not be available until this plan is adopted. The 
minimum housin g target for the Local P lan is therefore 15,465 over a 20 year period from 2014 
to 2034 , with staged delivery rates as set out in table 6.1. However the Council will take a 
proactive approach to monitoring delivery following the adoption of the plan, in  line with the 
requirements of national policy, and seek to implement the delivery techniques set out in the 
chapter 18 of this plan to increase delivery . If necessary the Council will review this matter as part 
of the five year plan review . 
 The overall housi ng target aligns with the 2014 -based sub -national population projections for 
Basildon Borough, which was used as the demographic baseline in the SHMA Addendum . At 31 
March 2018 , 2,247  homes had been delivered against this target, leaving this plan to make 
provision for at least 13,218 homes.   
Table 6.1: Staged Housing Target  
Time  Period  Up to 2023 2023 – 2028 2028 – 2034  
Homes per Annum  622pa 688pa 1,111 pa 
 
 Whilst the housing target falls short of the OAN for the Borough, it does represent a significant 
step change, with an average delivery rate of around 826 homes per annum, compared to the 
historical rate of development in the Borough in the period 2001 to 2017 of 369 homes per 
annum.   
 It is recognised that the rate of delivery expected in this plan period falls short of that considered 
necessary to support economic growth. However, the economic growth scenario in the SHMA 
Addendum  assumes a static position in relation to commuting patterns, economic activity and  
unemployment. It is clear through discussions with the GLA, that there will be a degree of 
employment displacement out of London, as some industrial sites within Greater London are 
redeveloped for housing purposes. As set out above, the Council’s  Economic  Development Policy 
seeks to promote higher levels of economic activity and lower levels of unemployment amongst 
the resident population through a range of measures, which fall outside the scope of planning. 
The assumptions affecting the relationship betwe en housing and economic growth are therefore 
likely to change over the plan period, and will therefore need to be reviewed frequently to monitor  
24 if there are negative consequences arising from the housing growth in this plan.   
 In order to support the level  of housing and employment growth set out in the Local P lan, a 
bespoke Infrastructure Delivery  Plan has been prepared. This has been prepared in partnership 
with service and infrastructure providers, and has a cumulative cost of around £500m.  
Developers wi ll be expected to contribute towards these infrastructure requirements and , where 
possible , growth has been concentrated in particular locations in order to create a better critical 
mass for infrastructure provision. However, it remains the case that the C ouncil and its service/ 
infrastructure delivery partners will need to seek funding from Government sources in order to 
deliver the growth in this plan. If that funding is not forthcoming, delivery rates will be affected.   
 Whilst the Local Plan contains som e ambitious infrastructure proposals such as a new grade 
separated junction on the A127 and a relief route for South West Billericay which combined open 
up the opportunity for around 7,200 homes, infrastructure proposals in this plan are largely 
confined t o the Borough’s geographical extent. The Local Plan can do little more than recognise 
the need for improvements to strategic infrastructure, such as the A127, A13 and A130, to 
support the cumulative impacts of growth in South Essex. The Joint Strategic  Plan will therefore 
provide a new opportunity for infrastructure to be considered at a strategic level, rather than just 
at a local level, and consequently, different approaches to infrastructure provision may be 
identified in the future. This may give rise t o new opportunities for growth, as land or sites which 
are not currently suitable and/or available are opened up. It will therefore be necessary to review 
the Local P lan in the future, if new approaches to infrastructure provision open up new 
opportunities  for growth in the Borough.   
Policy SD1  
A Strategic Approach to Sustainable Development in Basildon Borough  
 The Council will work with neighbouring authorities in South Essex to bring forward a Joint 
Strategic Plan for sustainable growth in South Essex wh ich seeks to deliver at least 90,000 homes 
and 58,000 jobs.  
 In contributing to this South Essex target, the Local Plan makes land provision for 17,791 homes 
and 92ha of employment land, with the target of delivering at least 15,465  homes and 20,000 jobs 
by 2034. Homes will be delivered at the following minimum rates:  
2018 – 2023 2023 - 2027  2028 - 2034  
622pa 688pa 1,111 pa 
 
 The Council  will optimise  the use of previously  developed  land in the urban  areas  where  it is suitable 
for development purposes. Suitable greenfield land will also need to be developed in urban areas, 
where the necessary services and infrastructure are available. This will  deliver:  
 9,179  homes  
 up to 22.5ha of employment land need ( up to  43.5ha of supply)  
 In order to accommodate the remainder of the growth, the Green Belt has been reviewed to make 
provision  for around  8,612  new homes  and at least 28.5ha of employment  land need ( 48ha of 
supply).  The review  has ensured that the purpose of the wider Green Belt is maintained, and that 
those parts of the Green Belt of higher landscape and/or ecological value are protected, and 
enhanced where possible, in accordance  with the NPPF . A sequential  approach  to flood  risk has 
also been  taken,  and those  areas at greatest risk of flooding will be  avoided.  
 In order  to ensure  that economic  growth  benefits  local residents,  and builds  on opportunities  arising 
from a changing  economy,  provision  of new jobs will be focused  on high skilled  jobs in the 
advanced manufacturing and technology sectors, and new economic opportunities will be created 
through the regeneration of town centres and enterprise  parks.  
 In order to ensure that the local people and the local economy can thrive, growth will be phased, 
aligned with the provision of the  services  and infrastructure needed to keep people and 
businesses  connected and moving, and enable local residents to stay healthy and fulfil their  
potential.   
 
25 
 This Local Plan will be reviewed, at least in part, following the adoption of the Joint Strategic Plan 
for South Ess ex, if opportunities for further growth and infrastructure provision in Basildon 
Borough are identified.  
 
Policy SD2: Settlement Hierarchy and the Distribution of Growth  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF expects planning to actively manage patterns of growth to maximise the  use of public  
transport,  walking  and cycling,  and to focus  significant  development  in locations  which are or can 
be made sustainable. Consequently, this directs development towards existing settlements,  
particularly  those  that already  benefit  from access  to a range  of services  and access to 
sustainable transport  modes.   
Evidence Base  
 The Settlement  Hierarchy  Review  (2015)  identifies  the settlement  hierarchy  within  the Borough. It 
identifies Basildon (including Laindon, Pitsea and Noak Bridge) as the main urban area, which 
benefits from a fuller range of access to transport choices, services and employment 
opportunities. Basildon consequently has the largest population. Next in the hierarchy are the 
settlements of Billericay (including Great Bur stead and South Green) and Wickford, which have 
smaller populations and smaller  employment  areas,  but have  access  to a full range  of services  and 
transport  choice s. Below this are the three serviced villages of Bowers Gifford, Crays Hill and 
Ramsden Bellho use. These smaller  villages  have  some  local service  provision  and more  limited  
access  to bus services.  There are also a number of unserviced settlements within the Borough 
including the historic settlement of Little Burstead, and a number of informal plotland settlements. 
These unserviced settlements are typically more remote from service  provision.    
 Employment provision in the Borough is aligned with the settlement hierarchy. The main areas of 
employment activity can be found within Basildon, primari ly within the A127 Enterprise Corridor 
and within Basildon town centre. There are smaller industrial estates in Billericay and Wickford, 
with the town centres in these settlements also providing retail and office space. There are also a 
number of rural loc ations where small scale business estates have grown up around former 
farms, or similar. The EDNA  establishes that the A127 Enterprise Corridor is a key location within 
South Essex where growth of key sectors in the local economy such as transport and logi stics, 
advanced manufacturing, green technologies and health technologies should be located. It also 
establishes Basildon town centre as a key location for the growth of digital, cultural and creative 
industries sector. Other employment location provide a supporting role in economic growth and 
should be retained.  
Urban Land Capacity  
 In accordance  with policy SD1, the development  potential of the Borough's existing urban 
settlements has been considered in the first instance to limit the loss of Green Belt la nd. This 
approach seeks to maximise development on previously  developed land where it is suitable to do 
so, but may include some greenfield sites within the urban area, as well as including land which 
previously formed part of the Basildon District Local P lan Areas of Special Reserve, where  the 
Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment  (HELAA)  has found  them  to be 'suitable,  
available  and achievable'  in line with the NPPF requirements.  The Borough's  urban  land capacity  
can accommodate  approximately  9,098  homes (net), as set out in Table 6.2.  
 The town centre regeneration dwelling capacity includes the number of homes identified within 
adopted masterplans and a 6.4% uplift based on higher density residential development that has 
historically be en delivered within Basildon Town Centre, and to a more modest degree within 
Wickford Town Centre, than what was anticipated in the masterplans. This is based on the 
calculations set out in the  Town Centre Masterplan Residential Audit Paper (2018).   A windfa ll 
allowance informed by the Basildon Borough Housing Supply Windfall Report (2017)  is also 
included in the urban supply beyond the first five years. This windfall allowance was calculated 
having regard to past sources of windfall supply, and the potential  for those sources to continue 
to contribute towards supply into the future.     
26 
 In terms of employment land provision meanwhile, there are 43.5ha of vacant or underutilised 
land supply within the existing urban area . This will enable up to  22.5ha of the em ployment land 
demand to be met of the identified need. 4.8ha of supply have been secured in Basildon since 
2014. However, this supply pre -dates the calculation of need in the EDNA and the Essex Grow -
on Space Study.

Capacity of Land within the Green Belt  
 Having considered the capacity of the sites in the urban area, it was concluded that exceptional 
circumstances may exist for permitting development on sites within the extent of the Green Belt. 
However, it was necessary to make a planning judgement as to w hether exceptional 
circumstances existed on a site by site basis having regard to a suite of evidence including both 
the Green Belt Study Review (2018),  and a site level Green Belt harm assessment  as part of the 
Green Belt Topic Paper (2018) , and also evid ence on environmental constraints, infrastructure 
needs, capacity and opportunity. Through this process, a suite of sites within the extent of the 
Green Belt were identified for inclusion in the Local  Plan for the purpose of contributing towards 
meeting em ployment and housing needs. Sites which potentially risked the coalescence of the 
Basildon urban area with Thundersley to the east and West Horndon to the west were considered 
to cause significant harm to the openness of the Green Belt and the purpose of i ncluding land 
within it, and have therefore been retained within the Green Belt.   
 Whilst some sites were excluded from consideration on the grounds of Green Belt harm, some 
more significant incursions into the Green Belt have been identified where there is  the potential to 
secure significant transport infrastructure projects, which support not only growth, but deliver 
wider enhancements. This is particularly the case in relation to East Basildon and Wickford, 
where  the combined growth of around 5,500  homes , to be delivered through the Local Plan and 
the Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet Neighbourhood Plan,  and a 48ha extension to the A127 
Enterprise Corridor would help to secure a new junction on the A127, improving accessibility to 
Wickford and relieving co ngestion at the A127/A132 junction and surrounding routes. Similarly, 
growth to the South West of Billericay in the order of  1,700  homes will secure a new relief route 
between the A129 London Road and the junction of B1007/Laindon Road with A176/Noak Hill 
Road , significantly reducing congestion at the Sun Corner junction on Billericay High Street.   
Settlements within the Green Belt  
 Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet is a small serviced settlement which sits in the Green Belt to 
the east of Pitsea and to the west of Thundersley in Castle Point Borough. It has, along with the 
rest of the parished area, been designated as the Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet 
Neighbourhood Area. The settlement offers some community facilities and services . It also  
 
27 benefits from good transport links with access to the strategic road network and frequent public 
transport services along the London Road to the south. As such, it  represents a sustainable 
location for growth within the Borough, with the opportunity to increase service provision to the 
existing population of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet. The Local P lan does not allocate sites 
for residential  development within this designated neighbourhood area but has specified a 
housing requirement figure for the neighbourhood area which will be delivered through a 
Neighbourhood Plan, once adopted . The housing target set reflects the capacity for sustainable 
growth in this location.   
 The serviced settlements of Ramsden Bellhouse and Crays Hill which are situated between 
Billericay  and Wickford to the north of the Borough, benefit from access to some services and 
public transport provision, the viability and retention of which should benefit from some additional 
development. However, these settlements sit away from the strategic roa d network, and the 
opportunity for significant growth is not therefore appropriate  at this time . Consequently, minor 
amendments to the Green Belt boundary for Crays Hill  have been made to permit a limited 
amount of development to occur, whilst maintaining  the overall scale of the settlement and the 
purpose of including land within the Green Belt.  The minor amendments create a new logical 
settlement boundary and create opportunity to deliver around 65  new homes. Ramsden 
Bellhouse has been designated as a neighbourhood area, therefore the Council has specified a 
housing requirement figure  within the Local Plan for the neighbourhood area which will be 
delivered though a Neighbourhood Plan, once adopted.   
 There are also 13 plotland settlements within the exte nt of the Green Belt, which are unserviced. 
The NPPF permits limited infilling within the Green Belt where the overall openness of the  Green 
Belt will not be affected. A review has been undertaken to determine the likely contribution infill 
development in the Green Belt, largely in plotland areas, will make to overall housing provision in 
the Borough. This identifies the potential  for around 145  homes  to be accommodated  on infill sites 
in the Green Belt. However, f urther  analysis identified the Hovefields a nd Honiley Neighbou rhood 
Area within  the Fairmead Plotlands as not being suitable for infill development due to highways 
issues and therefore the potential for infill development  across the Borough  is around 135 homes.  
Due to limited  access to services in these locations  significant levels of additional growth beyond 
this will not be permitted.   
Broad Locations for Housing Growth  
 The area to the south of Crays Hill has been identified as a broad location for potential housing 
growth. T he broad location covers  the area of land between the settlement of Crays Hill to the 
north and the A127 to the south and includes the Dale Farm site. The area  consists of low density 
residential accommodation which includes a number of authorised Gypsy an d Traveller sites and 
is largely rural in character.  A large amount of land within the area has been promoted for 
development during  the preparation of the Local Plan  and includes a proposal for 500 homes on 
the site known as Dale Farm.   
 The area to the so uth of Wickford is also identified as a broad location for potential housing 
growth. The broad location covers the area of land between the settlement of Wickford to the 
north and the A127 to the south, excluding the allocation in this plan known as site H 12, but 
including the Hovef ield and Honiley Neighbourhood A rea. The area consists of low density 
residential accommodation which includes a number of both authorised and unauthorised Gypsy 
and Traveller sites, and is largely rural in character. A large amo unt of land within this area, 
includ ing the entire extent of the Ho vefield and Honiley Neighbourhood Area , has been promoted 
for development during the preparation of the Local Plan.  
 Both these areas are illustrated in Figure 6.1 : 
 
 
 
 
  
28 Figure 6.1: Broad Lo cations Key Diagram  
 
 
 At this time, there are a number of constraints affecting both these  areas which prevent them  
being identified as specific development location s within this plan, including matters related to 
sustainable access to local services, highway access and ensuring that proposals for improving 
the A127 which will emerge through the Joint Strategic Plan can be delivered unhindered. 
However, the Council rec ognises that there may  be opportunity to bring forward comprehensive 
scheme s for both these areas  that seek to redevelop and improve the condition of brownfield 
sites if existing constraints can be address ed and overcome. As a result , the Council will 
reconsider th ese location s for housing growth in the next Local Plan review , allowing time for 
sustainable development proposal s to be identified and proposals for the A127 to be further 
developed within the Joint Strategic Plan . In the south Wickford area thi s will be undertaken in 
conjunction with the Neighbourhood Forum for Hovefield and Honiley.  
 In bringing forward such proposal s the Council is mindful that any future development in these 
broad location s make provision for the whole community and not result  in the displacement of the 
travelling community unless suitable alternative sites are provided.  
Policy SD2  
Settlement Hierarchy and the Distribution of Growth  
 In order to deliver the strategic approach to sustainable development within Basildon  Borough,  the 
Council will distribute growth to each of the main settlements, as  follows:  
Settlement  Type  Settlement  Name  Dwelling  
Provision  Employment  Land  
Provision  
Main Urban Area  Basildon (includes Laindon, 
Pitsea and Noak Bridge)  8,747  91ha 
Towns  Billericay  3,034  0.3ha  
Wickford  3,513  0.7ha  
 
 
29 Settlement  Type  Settlement  Name  Dwelling  
Provision  Employment  Land  
Provision  
Serviced 
Settlements  Crays Hill  65 0ha 
Ramsden Bellhouse  39 0ha 
Bowers Gifford  1,350 0ha 
Green Belt Infill  163 0ha 
Windfall  880 0ha 
TOTAL  17,791  92ha 
 
 As set out in policy SD1, the redevelopment of appropriate land within  the existing  urban  area will 
be supported,  subject  to compliance  with all relevant  policies within  this plan.  In particular,  town  
centre  regeneration  will be supported  in accordance  with policies R2 to R5 of this  plan.  
 In order to enable this level of growth, 186ha of land beyond the existing urban area will be  made 
available for development around the Basildon urban area including a 48ha eastern extension to 
the A127 Enterprise Corridor for economic growth purposes. In Billericay, 131ha of land beyond 
the existing urban area will be made available for development purposes, and 7 0ha around 
Wickford will be made available for development pu rposes. Specific development locations are 
identified in policies E2 to E8, and H7 to H21. 
 The designated Neig hbourhood Areas of Bowers Gif ford and North Benflee t and Ramsden 
Bellhouse  will be required to deliver , through their Ne ighbourhood Plans, the hou sing figures that 
have been allocated to them within this p lan. In order to achieve these targets it may be necessary 
for those Neighbourhood Areas to exceptionally amend their Green Belt boundaries. To ensure 
that new development is sustainable new homes within these areas should be accompanied by 
supporting  infrastructure including open space, community facilities and local services. . 
 Minor  amendments  will be made  to the Green  Belt around  the serviced  settlement  of Crays  Hill to 
accommodate  additional  small -scale  development  consistent  with the design and  character  of 
existing  buildings  within  the village.  Large  scale  extensions  to Crays Hill  will not be  permitted.  
 Minor amendments will be made to the Green Belt where it offers opportunities for small scale 
self-build developments and where planning permission has otherwise been granted to residential 
development and which now form built -up extensions to the urban  area.  
 Limited infill development will be permitted in the Green Belt in accordance with po licy GB4, and 
the exceptions set out in the  NPPF . 
 The area s to the south of Crays Hill, Billericay , and to the south of Wickford  have been identified 
as broad location s for potential  housing growth  which will be considered in the next review of the 
Local Plan once sustainable development proposal s have been identified that incorporate, and are 
supported by,  the necessary infrastructure provision.  
 
Policy SD3: Designated Neighbourhood Areas  
Policy Co ntext  
 Neighbourhood planning was introduced by the Localism Act 2011  (amending the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 ) as a way for local communities to plan for , and manage , 
development within their own areas. Local Councils and Neighbourhood Forums , who are the 
responsible  bodies for neighbourhood planning in their designated neighbourhood areas, have 
the power to produce a Neighbourhood Development Plan  which sets out general planning 
policies for development  and the use of land . Once the plan is ‘made’ it forms part of the formal  
30 Development Plan and is used to determine planning applications in the neighbourhood area. 
Local Councils and Neighbourhood Forums can also produce Neighbourhood Development 
Orders which can grant planning permission for certain  types of development in the 
neighbourhood area without the need for a traditional planning application.  
 Local planning authorities have a duty to support local communities in preparing plans or orders 
for their local area, as stated within the Neighbourhood Planning (General) Regulations 2012 (as 
amended) , and to take them through a process of examination and referendum.   
 The NPPF  states that local planning authorities should set out clearly within the ir local plans 
strategic policies for the ne ighbourhood areas, including policies for housing and economic 
development, and neighbourhood plans must be in  general conformity with them. 
Neighbourhoods are expected to plan positively to support local development , shape and direct 
development in their area, and identify opportunities to use Neighbourhood Development Orders  
to enable developments that are consistent with their neighbourhood plan to proceed.  
 Whilst the Local Plan has been prepared in accordance with the original NPPF , the Council 
acknowl edges that the N eighbourhood Plans currently being prepared will not come forward in 
the transitional period and will therefore be assessed against the newer version of the NPPF . The 
newer version encourages  housing targets to be set for each neighbourhood  area and allows for 
changes to Green Belt boundaries to be made through Neighbourhood Plans where strategic 
policies have identified a need for such a change.  
Evidence Base  
 There are three designated neighbourhood areas within the Borough which are  Hovef ields and 
Honiley, Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet, and Ramsden Bellhouse. All three areas have 
indicated that they wish to prepare Neighbourhood Plans  to determine where they wish 
development to go in their respective areas. T he Council ha s set out within this policy how it 
intends to support each area, having regard to the aspirations of the communit ies, the evidence 
supporting this Local Plan and the development needs of the Borough as a whole.   
 The Local Plan e vidence has identified  the appropriate level of growth within each neighbourhood 
area, and also appraised sites within these areas against a range of criteria to identify their 
development potential . All of this evidence is available to the neighbourhood planning bodies 
should they wish to use them as part of their own evidence . In preparing this Local Plan the 
Council has also identified the challenges  which the neighbourhood areas face . In particular  the 
provision of transport infrastructure which is needed to unlock potential growth  within the 
Hovefields and Honiley N eighbourhood Area and make existing development sustainable . For 
matters which are strategic in nature the Council will seek to deliver the m through  the Local Plan 
by way of developer contributions , and where possible through utilising external  funding  sources . 
However, w here infrastructure projects are complex and finance must be secured from several 
sources it is unlikely they will be completed in the early part of the plan period.  
 The Local Plan also redefine s the Boroughs  Green Belt boundaries , through strategic policies  
SD1 and SD2, to allocate land for development around the Borough’s settlements  in order to  
contribute to meeting the Boroughs identified development needs.  By the time the Neighbourhood  
Plans are adopted th ey will also have the ability to change Green Belt boundaries to 
accommodate development within their neighbourhood areas. The Council has therefore 
assigned Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet Neighbourhood Area and Ramsden Bellhouse 
Neighbourhood Area thei r own housing targets, which enables the community to determine their 
own site allocations for meeting the target. It is important to note that these targets represent the 
minimum level of housing development that their Neighbourhood Plans  must deliver.  
Hovefields and Honiley  Neighbourhood Area  
 The Hovefields and Honiley Neighbourhood Forum and Neighbourhood Area were designated in 
May 2016. The neighbourhood area is located within the Green Belt within the Fairmead Plotland 
between the settlements of Basil don and Wickford. The neighbourhood is small with limited 
access to services and comprises mainly of residential development  occupied by both the settled 
community and the travelling community. There are some localised flooding issues in the area 
associate d with limited drainage infrastructure provision and proximity to flood risk sources , and 
access to the area is via ‘left in’ and ‘left out’ turns onto the A127 which is not deemed safe or 
sustainable from a highways perspective.   
 
31 
 The current aspirations of  the Neighbourhood Forum is to  redevelop  the neighbourhood area into 
a new  standalone, serviced community.  Whilst the evidence supporting the Local Plan does not 
justify an allocation for significant housing development in this area , including the findings of the 
High Level Site Evaluation (2018) , the Council acknowledges that if such a level of housing was 
proposed in a Neighbourhood Plan, it would be reliant on the delivery of the new junction on the 
A127 and associated link roads.  Much of the growth a pportioned  to the east of Basildon and 
across Wickford  in the  Local Plan is not anticipated to come forward early in the plan period , due 
to the significant costs associated with providing a new junction on the A127 . The delivery of a 
Neighbourhood Plan would  encounter similar  time constraints.  
 The level of development within this area identified by the Council was limited infill development 
only which would deliver approximately 23 dwellings. This does not match the aspirations  of the 
Neighbourhood Forum and the High Level Site Evaluation  later demonstrated that for any 
development to occur within the neighbourhood area an alternative access into the area must first 
be provided.  
 Owing to the fact that any significant development proposa ls in the neighbourhood area would be 
reliant upon the delivery of the new junction on the A127, it is likely that the first review of the 
Local Plan would take place prior to any development coming forward in this area . This would 
allow  the Neighbourhood Forum sufficient time to progress an appropriate Neighbourhood Plan  
alongside the work the Council intends to undertake to bring forward proposals for the south 
Wickford broad location identified in policy SD2. . 
 Until such a time that the Council and the Neighbourhood Forum agree sustainable development 
proposals for this area , the Council will not support additional development in this neighbourhood 
area. Furthermore, it is important that a ny future development in the neighbourhood area make s 
provision for the whole community and , to ensure the Neighbourhood Plan is lawful , it must not 
result in the displacement of the travelling community unless suitable alternative sites are 
provided.  
Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet  Neighbourhood Area  
 The designation of the Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet Neighbourhood Area  was approved in 
July 2016 and covers the entire Parish boundary. Bowers Gifford is a small village to the east of 
Basildon inset from the  Green Belt. It benefits from having good access to the strategic highway 
network, frequent public transport services along the London Road to the south  and the village 
itself offers some community facilities including  a convenience store, garden centre and 
community hall. Outside the village core , to the south of the London Road is a primary school and 
a nursing home.  The North Benfleet Plotlands are located to the north of the neighbourhood  area 
within the Green Belt and adjacent to Bowers Gifford. The population of Bowers Gifford and North 
Benfl eet included members from both the settled and travelling community. The land surrounding 
the settlement of Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet is mainly in agricultural use while land to the 
south the neighbourhood area, south of the A13 is predominantly marshland .  
 Throughout the preparation of the Local Plan, the Council’s suite of evidence has identified land 
east of the Basildon urban area as a potential growth location which could contribute significantly 
towards meeting the Borough’s development needs.  Much of the land within this area ha d been 
promoted for development through the HELAA  and many sites ha d been found suitable and 
available for housing development. The Council determined that land to the east of Basildon, 
including land within the neighbourhood area, was capable of accommodating around 2,000 
dwellings. D ue to the complex nature of development within this location, as a result of multiple 
land promoters and the significant infrastructure improvements required to support development, 
the Council commissioned consultants to produce t he High Level Development Framew ork for 
East Basildon (2017)  (HLDF). The HLDF assessed the issues and recommend ed a preferred 
framework for delivering the level of growth being sought  alongside the necessary  infrastructure.  
 Based on the preferred framework , the Council has allocated land to the east of Pitsea  in policy 
H5, which is outside of the designated neighbourhood area, for residential development 
supported by educational and leisure provis ion but the re remains a need for a further 1,350 
additional dwellings to be provided on the remaining land to the east of Basildon. As this land 
forms part of the designated neighbourhood area, the Council has set a  minimum  housing target 
of 1,350 dwellings for the n eighbourhood area which the Parish Council  will be required to meet 
deliver  through a Neighbourhood Plan.   
32 
 Land to the east of Burnt Mills has also been allocated through policy E6 of this Local Plan for 
employment use and will form an extension to the exis ting A127 employment corridor. Whilst this 
allocation is within the neighbourhood area, the Council considers this site to be of strategic 
importance in delivering the economic ambitions of the Local Plan and contributing towards 
meeting the employment nee ds for the Borough as a whole. Therefore any Neighbourhood Plan 
proposal will need to reflect this strategic allocation in order to be in accordance within the Local 
Plan.  There are also a number of transport infrastructure requirements to be delivered in this area 
which are of strategic importance to the Borough including new junction on the A127 and 
associated link roads. These must also be reflected within any Neighbourhood Plan proposal.   
 The proposals that have been considered by the Parish Council as  part of the early preparation of 
their Neighbourhood Plan include the comprehensive redevelopment of the North Benfleet 
plotlands  and a large housing allocation to the north east of the neighbourhood area which would 
contribute to meeting some of the iden tified housing need for the area. Whilst the initial proposals 
would not deliver the level of housing required of them, the Parish Council has indicated that they 
wish to plan and allocate land for development in their area themselves , this approach is 
supported by the Council.   
 It is important that any future development  in the neighbourhood area makes provision for the 
whole community . The North Benfleet Plotlands are home to the majority of the neighbourhood 
area’s travelling community therefore any redevelopment of this area and any other sites where 
they are located, must not result in the m being displaced  unless suitable alternative sites are 
provided.  
 If the Parish Council is unable to deliver the required hous ing target through a Neighbourhood 
Plan, or the designation for the neighbourhood area expires before the next review of the Local 
Plan, the Council will look to allocate  land to accommodate growth within the settlement within the 
next review.  
Ramsden Bel lhouse  Neighbourhood Area  
 Ramsden Bellhouse is a small distinct serviced settlement in the north of the Borough in between 
the larger settlements of Wickford and Billericay. It has good access to the countryside and green 
amenity spaces and offers some loc al facilities such as a village shop and hall. However, the 
nearest primary school is in Crays Hill and the nearest secondary school, healthcare and leisure 
facilities are in Wickford. Growth would therefore provide the opportunity to improve the 
sustainab ility and inclusiveness of Ramsden Bellhouse as a community.  
 The Serviced Settlement Review (2017)  undertook a detailed review of potential site allocations 
within Ramsden Bellhouse , which along with the findings of the HELAA , assisted in identify ing 8 
sites with the collective capacity to sustainably accommodate 39 homes through frontage -only 
development . This was in keeping with the  existing  character of the settlement where properties 
are situated on large plots forming ribbon development along the main  roads . The recommended 
mix of detached and semi -detached properties would also help to diversify the housing stock to 
provide smaller, more affordable homes within the settlement.  Other sites have been promoted 
for development through the Council’s HELAA,  therefore there is potential for  alternative site 
provision . However the Serviced  Settlement Review highlighted sustainability issues which would 
potentially constrain higher levels of growth within the settlement.  
 The Ramsden Bellhouse Neighbourhood Area was designated in August 2018. The Council is 
aware that a number of residents  of Ramsden Bellhouse did not agree with the recommendations 
of the Serviced Settlement R eview to allocate sites for semi -detached proper ties on Church 
Road . Furthermore, the Parish Council has previously submitted representations to the Council 
during the preparation of the Local Plan identifying a selection of sites for development which 
varies slightly from those recommended in the Counc il’s own evidence base.  The Council has 
therefore taken the decision to set a housing target of 39 dwellings for the neighbourhood area 
allowing the Parish Council, through a Neighbourhood Plan, to determine the locations for 
housing allocations to meet th e target.  
 If the Parish Council  is unable to deliver the required housing target through a Neighbourhood 
Plan, or the designation for the neighbourhood area expires  before the next review of the Local 
Plan the Council will look to allocate land to accommod ate growth within the settlement within the 
next review.   
 
33 Future Neighbourhood Planning Areas  
 There is opportunity across the plan period for other communities within the Borough to come 
forward and become neighbourhood planning bodies and develop their ow n Neighbourhood 
Plans and/or Neighbourhood Development Orders. The Council will support these communities 
and provide them , where requested, with an indicative housing target for their area . This target 
will be  based on up -to-date evidence  and will help en sure that the Borough’s neighbourhoods 
provide the level of sustainable growth that meet their development needs.  
 Neighbourhood Plans are expected to support the delivery of strategic policies therefore , where a 
neighbourhood area includes a strategic allo cation as set out within this Local Plan, the 
Neighbourhood Plan will be required to support  its delivery . Any other development they wish to 
provide within their neighbourhood area will be in addition to the requirements of the Local Plan 
allocation.  
Policy SD 3 
Designated Neighbourhood Area  
 The Council will support neighbourhood planning bodies in preparing Neighbourhood Plans and/or 
Neighbourhood Development Orders for their designated neighbourhood areas within the 
Borough, in addition to fulfilling its statutory duties under the relevant regulations, in accordance 
with the NPPF .  
 The Council is committed to working with the Hovefields and Honiley Neighbourhood Forum to 
explore opportunities for enabl ing growth within the designated neighbourhood area as part of a 
wider growth strategy for south Wickford  required to bring forward development in this broad 
location as anticipated in policy SD2. T he outcomes of this will be incorporated into the next 
review of the Local Plan.  
 The Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet , and Ramsden Bellhouse Neighbourhood Areas are 
allocated the following minimum housing targets which must be delivered through their respective 
Neighbourhood Plan s: 
a. 1,350 homes within the Bowers  Gifford and North Benfleet Neighbourhood Area; and  
b. 39 homes within the Ramsden Bellhouse Neighbourhood Area.  
 If Neighbourhood Plans for the Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet and Ramsden Bellhouse 
Neighbourhood Areas fail to come forward and deliver the re quired housing targets , or the 
designations of these areas expire prior to the next Local Plan review , the Council will plan for 
their delivery within the next review.  
 The Council will provide indicative housing targets for any newly designated neighbourh ood area 
where requested to do  so by the neighbourhood  planning body . However if a neighbourhood area 
covers any strategic allocation within the Local Plan, housing or employment, the Neighbourhood 
Plan will be required to support the delivery of the alloc ation, in addition to any other development  
they wish to provide . 
 
Policy SD 4: Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development  
Policy Context  
 At the heart of the NPPF  is a presumption in favour of sustainable development. It expects that 
this presumption is applied when preparing planning policy and when taking decisions on 
planning applications.  
 The Planning Inspectorate has set out a model policy to be incorporated within Local Plans for all 
areas in order to ensure consistency between national and local policy with regard to this 
presumption. It requires local planning authorities and applicants to work together to find 
development solutions which mean that proposal s secure sustainable development which 
achieves all three dimensions of sustainable development. The Council operates a pre - 
34 application process, and is also prepared to use planning performance agreements to enable the 
engagement necessary to facilitate jo int working.   
 This policy does not override other policies of this plan, such as policies related to Green Belt 
protection, flood risk management and nature and heritage conservation, but expects 
development proposals which comply with it to be decided in a positive and expedient manner. 
Where the Local Plan is silent on a matter, or becomes out of date the NPPF  is identified as the 
default source of planning policy.   
Evidence Base  
 The presumption in favour of sustainable development requires consideration to be given to both 
the needs for development (the benefits) and any adverse impacts of allowing such development 
and for them to be weighed against each other. Any relevant evidence base that underpins this 
plan, along with any updates to that evidence, a nd any evidence submitted alongside any 
planning application will therefore need to be considered when applying this policy.  
Policy SD 4 
Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development  
 When considering development proposals in the Borough, the Council wil l take a positive  
approach that  reflects  the presumption  in favour  of sustainable  development  contained  in the NPPF .  
 The Council will always work pro -actively with applicants jointly to find solutions which means  that 
proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to secure development that improves the 
economic, social and environmental conditions in the  area.  
 Planning  applications  that accord  with the policies  in this plan will be approved  without  delay,  unless 
material considerations indicate  otherwise.  
 Where  there  are no policies  relevant  to the application,  or relevant  polices  are out of date at the time 
of making the decision, the Council will grant permission unless material considerations indicate 
otherwise taking into account  whether:  
a. any adverse  impacts  of granting  permission  would  significantly  and demonstrably  
outweigh  the benefits,  when  assessed  against  the policies  in the NPPF  taken as a 
whole;  or 
b. specific policies as referred to in the NPPF  indicate that development should be  
restricted.   
  
 
35 
 Building a Strong, Competitive Economy  
STRATEGIC POLICY  
Policy E1: Economic Growth Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  sets out the specific requirements for local planning authorities in terms of planning for 
economic growth. It expects that policies should set out a clear economic vision for the area and 
pro-actively encourage sustainable economic growth. Planning polic ies should support existing 
business sectors and be flexible enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the Local Plan. 
Local planning authorities should identify priority areas for economic regeneration, infrastructure 
provision and environmental enha ncement and , through planning policy , promote the development 
of clusters or networks of knowledge driven, creative or high technology industries .  
 The South Essex Economic Development Needs Assessment (EDNA) draws together the different 
strands of the Sou th Essex economic picture, providing an evidenced, policy guidance compliant 
analysis of the economic and employment land opportunities and challenges for South Essex. It 
also establishes a strategic, multi -authority strategy for realising the area’s full economic 
opportunity. The EDNA  supports the existing and emerging planning policy of each of the South 
Essex authorities. For Basildon Borough, it provides additional economic evidence supporting the 
Local Plan, complementing the Basildon Borough Employmen t Land and Premises Study (ELPS) 
(2013)  which was consulted on as part of the Draft Local Plan (2016).  
 The EDNA  also recommends a total demand of 28ha of employment land should be met within the 
plan period. This is broken down between the different B -use classes as 6ha for B1 Offices, 10ha 
for B2 manufacturing and industrial, and 12ha for B8 storage and distribution uses.  
 Grow -on space is a term used to describe  the slightly larger premises  growing SME businesses 
would want to occupy in order to successfu lly expand their operations. The Essex Grow -on Space 
Feasibility Study reveals that as a result of a current market failure, a further 9ha of need should 
also be provided, broken down between 7ha of B1 Offices and 2ha for B2 manufacturing and 
industrial us es, as this particular component of local need is invisible to generic employment 
forecasts.   
 The land potential in the Borough also means that an opportunity exists to meet either displaced or 
unmet employment growth needs coming out of Greater London. An  additional 14ha of need from 
Greater London is therefore going to be planned for on the basis that this would increase the 
overall ratio of job numbers to new homes in excess of  1:1, giving each new household the 
opportunity to find a job within the Borough as it grows. This decision takes into consideration the 
recent increase in housing numbers projected to be needed in the Borough  by the mid -2030s as 
set out in the SHMA . This is likely to place additional pressure on the demand for employment land, 
whilst also reflecting upon the long -standing economic position of the Borough that the Local P lan 
seeks to retain and strengthen, as a major employment hub, providing job opportunit ies to the 
wider south Essex sub -region.  
 The Local Plan therefore seeks to provide for a total need of 51ha of B-class employment land 
during the period 2014  to 2034, which on its own will provide around 14,150 new jobs . However, 
when combined with employm ent forecasts for sectors outside B -class uses (such as retail, leisure, 
health and public services, etc.), this will contribute to an overall provision at least  20,000 new jobs  
in the Borough over the plan period.  
 In looking at where this provision would be located, it is known through a combination of EDNA,  
ELPS  and the HELAA  that the Borough’s existing urban capacity could yield up to  22.5ha of 
employment land through the intensification of existing employment areas and the development of 
vacant employme nt land, with the remaining 28.5ha provided by land released from the Green Belt, 
where exceptional circumstances have been judged to exist.  
 In appreciating how the employment land market works, there is a need however to provide a 
contingency allowance to  account for ‘windfall losses’ and ‘churn’. Windfall losses takes into  
36 account the fact that a proportion of designated employment land will not be entirely used by B -use 
class employment. As well as making an allowance for unexpected losses of employment land 
(such as conversion to residential or leisure uses), allowance is made for the fact that the locational 
and premises needs of businesses and sectors change over time. This requires businesses to be 
more agile and move to where suits them most. In othe r instances an existing business might 
cease its operations and a new business take over a site for redevelopment. For this to happen 
smoothly there is a need for a certain level of vacant land and premises for businesses to occupy, 
which is referred to as  ‘churn’.  
 The Economic Development Topic Paper (2018)  considers the impact that unexpected losses and 
churn has had on the Basildon Borough for the period since the ELPS was published in 2013. This 
shows that so far, during the plan period 2014  to 2017, ap proximately 4.8ha of B -class new 
employment land need has been delivered in the Borough. However, during the same period 3.3ha 
of employment land was lost to non -B class uses. Therefore, in order to deliver 4.8ha of additional 
B-class employment need, 8.1h a of land supply has actually been required in order to account for 
windfall losses and churn.   
 The EDNA  and the ELPS both make recommendations with regards to the total land supply that is 
required in order to meet the Borough’s employment needs. The EDNA  refers to this as a ‘supply -
side’ adjustment where additional land supply is required to meet needs. The Council has 
considered past delivery of economic growth in the Borough as part of the Economic Development 
Topic Paper , and has determined that in ord er to meet demand, the need for employment land 
should not exceed 60%  of total land supply. Therefore, in order to meet a need of 51ha, a land 
supply of approximately 85ha will be required.   
 However, Basildon Borough also has a shortage in the amount of available land that is considered 
suitable for office uses, and a market failure need to provide grow -on space for businesses based 
in office and industrial sectors. Owing to this shortage, and  due to one of the largest underutilised 
sites that is suitable for new office development being located at the Dunton Technical Centre, a 
site protected for uses associated with automotive research and development only, there is a need 
as part of the Loca l Plan to be more flexible in terms of overall land supply. This increases the 
required  land supply to 92ha. This is made up of up to 43.5ha of vacant or underutilised land 
supply and at least 48ha of land supply which would come forward through Green Belt  release in 
appropriate and sustainable locations. This will ensure the overall need for office development is 
realised in locations it is more likely to be successful and will provide sufficient flexibility for the 
Borough to respond to changing market si gnals over the plan period.   
 Whilst the Dunton Technical Centre is identified as a cluster, for the purposes of considering 
strategic locations in the EDNA,  it represents a strategically important asset for advanced 
manufacturing in the Borough and the wid er South Essex sub -region, which should continue to be 
supported and allowed to expand into the neighbouring underutilised employment site.   
 The Local  Plan, in addition,  expects  there  to be some  degree of continual  recycling  of B-class  land 
over the plan period  as the Borough’s land supply and economy adjusts to the land demands of 
changing business sectors. Land  is identified  in policies  E5 to E7 to provide  new sites to meet  the 
overall  demand  for B-class uses projected during the plan period. Existing employment areas will 
also be protected from conversion to non B -class uses through policies E2 and E3, in order to 
conserve the supply  of B-class employment land and premises, and to prevent the loss of 
employment space that would otherwise increase press ure on the Green Belt.   
 In several rural Green Belt locations, smaller employment sites are already providing part of the 
Borough's employment land supply. These have arisen primarily through farm diversification, but 
also utility redevelopment,  or are historical  business  premises,  which  predate  the Town  and Country  
Planning Act  1947  and the introduction  of the planning  system.  Generally,  these  premises  are not 
planned for  employment  purposes,  and do not offer the levels  of premise  quality  and accessibility  
available in the planned employment  areas.  
 With a more proactive approach these rural sites can continue to contribute towards supply, but the 
Local  Plan recognises that they too may need to be adapted, improved or replaced over the plan 
period to meet oc cupiers' needs, and continue to provide local people with rural employment 
opportunities during the plan period. These sites are therefore recognised distinctly as part of policy  
E7 to ensure  their continued  operation  remains  in character  with their rural,  Green Belt location, 
whilst enabling them to regenerate and remain  adaptable to changing business sectors.

 The Basildon Borough Hotel Futures Study 2017  shows market potential for two large new hotels, 
some smaller hotels and possible extensions to existi ng hotels in the Borough. A recommendation 
of the supporting ‘ Local Plan Options for Meeting Hotel Needs’  paper recommends that a locational 
strategy should also be reflected in policy that will permit hotel development not only within town 
centres, as rec ommended by the town -centre first policy in the NPPF , but also in employment 
areas along the A127 Enterprise Corridor, as evidence indicates this as the other key location in 
the Borough where it would be appropriate to incorporate hotel development to sup port the growing 
demands from businesses in more sustainable and accessible ways.  
Policy E1  
Economic Growth Strategy  
 As part of the Local  Plan’s objective to deliver at least 20,000 additional jobs , the Council  will seek  
to deliver  at least  14,150 addition al B-Class full time equivalent  jobs within  the Borough over the 
period of this plan through sustainable growth of the local economy, supported by the provision  of a 
flexible  supply  of employment  land and premises  to meet  the varying  needs  of different B-class 
economic sectors. This will be achieved  by: 
a. Protecting and enhancing existing viable employment areas and premises in order to 
meet the needs of existing and new businesses, including the protection of land 
specifically for B1 and B2 uses, to more effectively manage suitable land shortages of  
B1 and to attract higher value advanced manufacturing jobs through the protection of 
land for B2 uses;  
b. Encouraging the improvement and redevelopment of private land within existing 
employment areas in order to  enable business growth, and improve the attractiveness of 
these areas;  
c. Making provision of 92ha of land in order to deliver at least 51ha of additional 
employment development falling within use classes B1, B2 and B8 during the plan 
period. As part of this  provision, specific sites will be secured for the delivery of grow -on 
space for emerging businesses;  
d. Ensuring that the A127 Enterprise Corridor is considered favourably for suitable hotel 
related development, outside of town centres, to support the needs of the business 
community;  
e. Allocating Rural Enterprise Sites within the Green Belt to protect local employment 
floorspace in rural locations, and provide local employment opportunities which make the 
best use of brownfield sites without causing harm to the  Green Belt or the purposes of 
including land within it;  
f. Facilitating the training and education of local people to gain skills required to enter or 
remain part of the local workforce;  
g. Establishing and maintaining relationships between local businesses and  local training 
and education providers to ensure local facilities are provided to access professional and 
vocational training; and  
h. Supporting and facilitating proposals and initiatives which contribute to implementing the 
priorities identified in the Coun cil’s Economic Development Policy . 
 In order to secure the additional employment land required under part 1c the Council will:  
a. Support the intensification and regeneration of underutilised land within existing 
employment areas  to provide 22.5ha of employmen t land need;  and 
b. Allocate land to the East of Burnt Mills Employment  Area  for new employment land 
supply suitable for B1, B2 and B8 uses in order to secure at least 28.5ha of new 
employment need provision during the plan period.  
 Every  effort  should  be made  to explore  suitable  and viable  locations  for development  in the Borough’s  
existing employment areas, prior to the development of new employment allocations, in order to 
ensure the ongoing vitality and viability of the existing employment  areas.  
 
 
 
  
38 ALLOCA TION POLICIES  
Policies E2 and E3: Existing Employment Areas  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires local planning authorities to set criteria, or identify  strategic sites for local and 
inward investment to match the strategy and to meet anticipated needs over the plan period.  
Evidence Base  
 Basildon  Borough’s  employment  floorspace  is predominately  general/light  industry  (B2) amounting to 
a 38% share of total  Class B employment floorspace, which is followed by office (B1a) with a 24% 
share, warehousing (B8) with a 20% share and research and development (B1b) with an 18% 
share of total Class B employment floorspace,  respectively.  
 The ELPS  and the EDNA  assessed  the condition  of 25 existing  employment  areas  (including  the 
Borough's  Regional Town Centre in Basildon and two standalone town  centres  of Billericay  and 
Wickford).  It found  that the employment  areas  varied in  condition  with five areas  being  rated  as being  
in fair condition  and three  being  found  to be in poor condition. This has helped to inform which areas 
should continue to have a role in employment floorspace provision in the Borough, and whether 
any of the areas need enhancing to bring them up to an acc eptable standard for delivering policy 
E1. 
 For office and industrial stock, the EDNA  has identified the importance of both Basildon and 
Thurrock as the broader areas within the South Essex sub -region with the greatest number of sites. 
Larger industrial uni ts making up a greater proportion of stock tend to be located in Thurrock, 
whereas the smaller, yet more numerous offer is in Basildon resulting, in part, from its higher -
skilled manufacturing clusters. Whilst Basildon and Thurrock also have the largest sh are of 
unoccupied office and industrial premises, a recent decline in available floorspace as demonstrated 
in the EDNA  implies an increase in demand and the study alludes to a potential lack of supply in 
the near future.  
 Existing employment areas are never theless still operating effectively and viably as employment 
locations, on the whole, and in particular the future employment land supply -demand balance, 
shows that there is sound justification for the continued protection of existing employment areas in 
accordance with the NPPF . The majority of employment areas within Basildon Borough comprise a 
range of uses and will be retained for the purpose of providing opportunities for general B -class 
uses, and associated employment generating sui generis uses. Howe ver, the Dunton Technical 
Centre will be retained but its use restrictions relaxed to ensure it can provide for B1 (a) and (b) 
purposes. In the Basildon District Local Plan  the use was restricted to B1(b) only, restricted 
specifically to automotive industr y research and development. Given the ongoing presence of the 
main occupier of the site, the Ford Motor Company and their potential for more varying needs in 
the future, it is intended to relax this industry based restriction over the existing buildings an d 
vacant land to the north, but to maintain the B1(b) automotive research and development restriction 
over the  associated  test track.  
 In reviewing the existing employment areas, a boundary review was conducted within the ELPS  to 
ensure they remain fit for purpose and reflective of the development patterns on the ground. This 
has concluded that boundary changes should be made in the following  locations:  
a. 1.5ha of land North of Courtauld Road (allocated as E3 in the Basildon Dist rict Local 
Plan) removed from employment allocation and reconsidered by the Local  Plan for other 
needs due to highway access  constraints;  
b. Burnt  Mills Employment  Area amended  to include  the former  tree nursery,  south  of Lord’s  
Way and the Lord’s Court Busin ess Park. In addition the Basildon Water Recycling 
Centre and Courtauld Road waste facility (Tovi EcoPark) should be removed as they are 
non B -class  uses;  
c. Cranes Employment Area boundary extended to include open space north of Christopher 
Martin  Road;  
d. Pipps  Hill Employment  Area boundary  extended  to exclude  Pipps  Hill Retail  Park and 
include open space north of Burches and Miles Gray Road and adjacent former car  
showroom;   
 
39 e. Laindon  North  Employment  Area boundary  contracted  to remove  the petrol  filling  station  
and estates agent on the A127/High Road junction. Southern boundary amended to 
include all of the employment premises, not just their  frontages;  
f. Ford Technical Centre Employment Area boundary contracted to remove the Dunton 
Fields residential area granted by 12/00951/FULL  and the car showroom at West Mayne 
as they are non B -class  uses;  
g. Southfields  Employment Area contracted  to remove the car showroom fronting  West 
Mayne as it is a non B -class use;  and  
h. Radford  Way Employment  Area expanded  to include  the surface  car park on Radford  
Crescent.  
 These changes, along with others following a review of employment delivery for the period 2014  to 
2017, have been made to the extent of the existing employment areas as previously identified  in the 
Basildon  Distri ct Local  Plan. The Policies  Map which  accompanies  the Local P lan shows the revised 
boundaries including those changes listed  above . 
Policy E2  
Existing Employment Areas for General B -Class Uses  
Twelve Existing  Employment Areas, as shown on the Policies Map, will be protected to provide  use classes  
B1a, B1c, B2 and B8 employment  floorspace,  and associated  employment  generating  sui generis uses over the 
plan period:  
a. Burnt Mills,  Basildon;  
b. Cranes,  Basildon;  
c. Case N ew Holland Tractor Park,  Basildon;  
d. Festival Business Park,  Basildon;  
e. Pipps Hill,  Basildon;  
f. Laindon North,  Laindon;  
g. Wrexham Road,  Laindon;  
h. Southfields,  Laindon;  
i. DST House, St Nicholas Lane,  Basildon;  
j. Terminus Drive, Pitsea;  
k. Radford Way Business Park, Billericay;  and 
l. Wickford Business Park, Hurricane Way,  Wickford;  
Policy E3  
Existing Employment Area for Research and Development Uses  
 8ha of land at Dunton, as identified on the Policies Map, will be safeguarded for employment 
purposes falling within use c lass B1 (a) and (b).  
 The test  track associated with the Ford Technical Centre,  will be protected  specifically  for the 
purposes  of automotive  research  and development purposes  only. 
 1.8ha  of land  to the north  and west of the test track  will be protected for any appropriate  proposals  
falling within use class  B1(a) and (b).  
 
Policy E4: Protection of Existing Employment Areas for B2 Manufacturing and 
Industrial Uses  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires  local planning authorities to set criteria, or identify strateg ic sites, for local and 
inward investment to match the strategy and t o meet anticipated needs over the plan period  and 
plan positively for different sectors through the location, promotion and expansion of clusters or 
networks of knowledge driven, creative  or high technology industries . 
 The Borough’s Economic Development Policy  sets out a clear economic vision for the Borough to 
ensure that sustainable economic opportunities are accessible to all our residents. “ By 2050,  
40 Basildon can be the real economic po werhouse to the east of London ”. As growth shifts away from 
London, Basildon is in prime position to take advantage of some of the high technology companies 
looking for alternative space to grow. We believe that our ability to accommodate high value 
techno logy and digital businesses is our Unique Selling Point and the basis for future growth.  
Evidence Base  
 A key finding of the EDNA  is that the A127 Enterprise Corridor is providing a strategic location 
within the South Essex sub -region for meeting future eco nomic growth. Many of the sites located in 
this area are suitable for, and represent an opportunity to provide premises that sectors such as 
advanced manufacturing and green technologies, health technology and transport & logistics could 
occupy. In order t o build on these strengths within the Borough’s economy and to seek to meet the 
ambitions set out in the Council’s Economic Development Policy , the Local Plan also protects land 
for employment use classes that would support growth in these industry sectors . Policies E4 and 
E6 protect land along the A127 Corridor for B2 uses, as many of the employment sectors 
mentioned above fall into this category of the use classes order.  
 Along the A127 Enterprise Corridor, there are vacant or underutilised land within exi sting 
employment areas that could provide opportunities to encourage the expansion of clusters or 
networks of high technology industries. This strategic portfolio of sites underpins a strategy to co -
ordinate and focus future site delivery and investment to  ensure the area acts like a functional 
economic hub, rather than a group of local authority areas with competing or conflicting 
propositions to businesses.  
 Using national policy guidance , the recommendations of the EDNA  on sector requirements and site 
clusters and the assessment of the EDNA  between supply and demand, each South Essex 
authority is being encouraged to take a positive policy approach towards protecting strategically 
important employment allocations, which can accommodate key growth sectors, as well as 
protecting existing employ ment areas and the active employment activities they accommodate 
within each authority area.  
Policy E4  
Protection of Existing Employment Areas for B2 Manufacturing and Industrial Uses  
The vacant/underutilised land within the following f our Existing Employm ent Areas, as shown on the Policies 
Map, is allocated for use class B2 employment purposes only : 
a. 1.63ha of land within the Burnt Mills Industrial Estate,  Basildon3; and 
b. 2.49ha of land within Festival Business Park4. 
 
Policy E5: Land West of Gardiners Lane South, Basildon  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires  local planning  authorities  to positively  and pro-actively  encourage  sustainable 
economic growth and to identify strategic sites for local and inward investment to match the 
economic development strategy and to meet employment needs over the plan  period.  
Evidence Base  
 This 3 7 ha site was allocated for mixed -use comprehensive development including employment, 
residential and open space provision in the Basildon District Local Plan . Aside from some small 
scale r esidential development, it has not yet come forward for comprehensive development. The  
NPPF  states  that land should  not be continually  reallocated  or protected  if there  is little prospect of it 
coming forward for the allocated development in the plan period. As a result, the  ELPS  re-
evaluated whether the Land West of Gardiners Lane South should continue to be allocated for 
employment purposes in the plan period. The assessment concluded that it should continue to be 
                                                      
 
3 EDNA reference B36  
4 EDNA reference B42   
 
41 allocated for new B -class employment , but as a mixed -use scheme with new housing and open 
space, provided the constraints on the site in terms of playing pitch relocation and transport 
infrastructure  could  be overcome.  This Local Plan therefore  reallocates part of  the site for 
employment  purposes and,  alongside  policy  H5, seeks  to redevelop  it into a high quality  mixed -use 
community  with essential  additional infrastructure and supporting policies to relocate some of the 
existing playing pitches and sports clubs. A High Level Development Framework for Gardiners 
Lane South (2017)  was prepared for this site to evaluate its development potential for mixed used 
development. It concluded that a scheme incorporating 5.5ha of B -class employment floorspace  
resulted in a viable  solution for develop ing the site.   
 The Essex Grow -on Space Feasibility Study  states that as a result of a current market failure, a 
further 9ha of need should be provided, broken down between 7ha of offices and 2ha for 
manufacturing and industrial uses.   
 As established for Po licy E1, the Borough has a shortage of grow -on space for office and industrial 
uses and there is a lack of the amount of available land that is considered suitable for offices. 
Owing to this shortage there is a need to be more flexible in terms of overall land supply.  
 Office floorspace will be the most challenging demand to accommodate in the Borough, because 
whilst projected demand can be accommodated by the comparable supply, there are limited 
number of potential sites identified as suitable solely for office use. The  advice of the EDNA  is that 
the South Essex authorities must ensure that future office development is focused towards sites 
which meet its occupier requirements, which may not be possible within the mixed -use site portfolio 
alone, so this will have to be a ssessed on a site -by-site basis and monitored carefully over the 
projection period. Policies E2, E3, E5, and E6 aim to address this potential issue by protecting  
existing employment areas and allocating additional  land specifically for meeting the needs fo r 
office floorspace and/or for grow -on space.   
 The EDNA  identifies Land West of Gardiners Lane South as one of the few sites that would be 
suitable for B1 office development which is a significant consideration given the overall shortage of 
land for these purposes. Similarly, the Grow -on Space Feasibility Study  identifies a significant need 
for grow -on space for expanding businesses within use class B1. It is therefore considered 
appropriate that the employment land to be delivered on Land West of Gardiners  Lane South will 
be protected to deliver for office and grow -on space within use class B1.  
 The Part 2 – Publication Local Plan Transport and Highways Impact Assessment (Publication 
THIA) (2018)  considered the cumulative implications of development on this site, both economic 
and residential, and also development in the wider area. It found that mitigation measures, 
including modal shift, are required in the vicinity of this site to ensure sufficient capacity in the 
highway network is achieved, enabled by gr owth. This site will therefore need to contribute towards 
upgrades to the strategic and local road networks, and also improvements to public transport 
connections, in order to ensure that it does not place an undue burden on the road network.  
Policy E5  
Land West of Gardiners Lane South, Basildon  
5.5ha of land,  as identified on the Policies Map with the  notation E5 , will be developed for B -class employment 
purposes as part of a wider mixed -use comprehensive redevelopment of land west of Gardiners Lane South  as 
set out in Policy H5 , subject to the following criteria:  
a. Development  of the site must  be informed  by an up to date  Development  Brief or 
Masterplan, approved by the Council, to guide holistic development of the  area;  
b. At least 3.3ha of B -class employment land will be protected specifically for B1 uses, with 
at least 3ha of land required to provide grow -on space opportunities for businesses 
falling within that use class;  
c. In respects of the new employment development, it mu st ensure the residential amenity 
of existing and new residential dwellings by coordinating adjacent land uses. 
Employment units adjacent to residential dwellings should be for B1 uses or live -work 
units only, or else green buffers should be provided betwe en employment and residential  
uses;  
d. Employment proposals are subject to a Traffic Impact Assessment to establish what 
mitigation  is required to the local or strategic highway network to enable the development  
42 to take place;  and 
e. Employment development of th is site must also comply  with all other relevant polic y 
requirements  of this plan.  
 
Policy E6: Land East of Burnt Mills, Basildon  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires  local planning  authorities  to positively  and pro-actively  encourage  sustainable 
economic growth and to identify strategic sites for local and inward investment to match the 
economic development strategy and to meet employment needs over the plan  period.  
Evidence Base  
 The ELPS  and the EDNA  conclude that employment development in a location to t he east of 
Basildon, in the area known as Burnt Mills, is appropriate. However, the Publication Local Plan 
THIA  identifies a  need  for more  significant  modifications  to the local and strategic  road network  to 
ensure  highways capacity can be achieved to faci litate the sustainable development of this site. It is 
expected that this capacity will be provided  through the  provision  of a new junction  on the A127,  
which  will also serve  housing  development  to the east of  Basildon and  across  Wickford.  As set out in 
the High Level Development Framework for East Basildon (2017)  and Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
(2018),  this junction is likely to be of a scale that it will require public  subsidy  and therefore it is 
expected that this site will form part of the long -term employment land supply for the Borough, 
rather than be immediately  available  for development in the early part of the plan -period.  It is also 
expected  that this site will contribute  both financially towards the provision of these highways 
improvements and also be part of the business case for bids to the Local Enterprise Partnership 
and/or Government for any gap funding required to deliver the highway infrastructure and any other 
infrastructure requirements in this  location.   
 It is expected that all of the remaining need for employment land that cannot be met from other 
allocations, or the intensification of uses within Existing Employment Areas is met in this location. 
Given its proximity to the  existing residential areas of Pitsea to the south, and new hou sing 
development proposed  between Pitsea and Bowers Gifford in policy H1 1 this site is therefore well 
located to contribute towards a more  balanced  and sustainable  mix of development . 
 The A127  Enterprise  Corridor  is already a  large  employment  location  that has enabled  clusters  of 
industries and sector to form. It is widely acknowledged that business clusters are important to the 
ongoing success and  growth  of the economy,  and consequently,  new employment  provision to the 
east of Basildon will be well related  to the existing A127 Enterprise Corridor. It will also be  well 
located  in relation  to the strategic  road network  in order to  provide  ease  of access  for HGVs,  whilst  
reducing  the impact  of such  movements  on residential amenity.  Due to the nature  of the existing 
Burnt  Mills Road,  which  is a narrow, winding  country  lane with limited  verge that is prone to flooding, 
it will be served by a new access road between Pound Lane and Courtauld Road providing 
improved HGV access to the site, and a more effecti ve connection to the existing employment  
area. Burnt Mills Road will then be downgraded to provide local access only to properties along its 
length.   
 Whilst this is a sustainable location for the provision of additional employment development in 
terms  of accessibility  and economic  benefit,  the Outline  Landscape  Appraisal  has identified  some 
concerns with regard to the impact of development in this location on the agricultural landscape. 
Consequently, it is expected that any employment development provided i n this location is very 
strongly landscaped in order to limit its  impacts to the wider area.   
 In addition to the land reserved in policy E5, the Essex Grow -on Space Feasibility Study  findings 
will require more sites to provide for this need which is otherw ise invisible to employment forecasts 
and caused by market failure. Similarly, E6 is also a location that is both suitable and represents an 
opportunity to provide new space for the target employment sectors.  
 Policy E6 aims to help address this supply chal lenge by protecting land specifically for meeting the 
needs for office floorspace and/or for grow -on space within the wider site.   
 
43 
 The site has also been identified as being suitable for the provision of the Borough’s Travelling 
Showpeople accommodation nee ds of 3 plots across the plan period due to the site ’s accessibility 
to the strategic road network . There is also synergy  between general employment uses expected to 
be delivered on site and the activities occur ring within Travelling Showpeople  yards which typically 
include storage, the repairing and maintenance of vehicles and fairground equipment, alongside 
residential occupation. These plots should be delivered within  one yard within this allocation and 
planned for alongside employment development w ithin a masterplan/ development brief approach 
for the whole allocation. It is important that the location and internal layout of the Travelling 
Showpeople yard is designed in such a way as to ensure that the residential areas of the plots are 
not adversel y impacted by other occupiers and uses within  the allocation, whilst maximising the 
use of land.   
Policy E6  
Burnt Mills Extension  
 48ha of land to the east of Basildon,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation   E6, is 
allocated  for B-class  employment development, an ancillary hotel and/or pub restaurant , and a 
Travelling Showpeople yard, subject to the following  criteria:  
a. Development of the site must be informed by a Development Brief or Masterplan, 
approved by the Council, to guide holistic development of the site and ensure the 
different uses retained on site are able to be brought forward in a manageable way;  
b. No development of the site should take place until improved access to the strategic road 
network at the junction of Pound La ne with the A127 has been secured. In respects of 
the new employment development, it should be located and designed to : 
i. Relate effectively to existing employment provision within the A127  
corridor;  
ii. Be accessed  from the strategic  road network  in order  to ensure that it can 
be used  flexibly by a range of different employment uses, including those 
requiring HGV  access;  and 
iii. Protect the residential amenity of existing and new residential uses 
including Gyp sy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople accommodation  by 
coordinating adjacent land uses. Employment units adjacent to residential 
uses  should be for  B1 uses  or live-work  units  only, or else green  buffers  
should  be provided  between  employment and residential uses;   
c. Employment proposals are subject to a Traffic Impact Assessment to establish what 
additional mitigation is required to the local or strategic highway network to enable the 
development to take place; and  
d. Employment development of this site must also comply with all other relevant policy 
requirements of  this plan.  
 At least 14.7ha of land in this allocation will be protected specifically for B1 and B2 uses, and 
prote cted for grow -on space in order to ensure the Council meets its need for employment provision 
over the plan period. This will be divided betw een the different use classes in the following way:  
a. At least 8.5ha will be protected for employment uses falling within class B2;  
b. At least 6.2ha will be protected for the purposes of providing grow -on space, this will be 
split between 4.2ha for B1 and 2ha for B2 uses.  
 Provision  of a Travelling Showpeople yard providing 3 plots  which should be appropriately designed 
and sited within the allocation to minimise the impacts on residential amenity of the plots in  
accordance with 1b(iii) of this policy whilst ens uring that the optimal use of the wider site is 
achieved .  
 
Policy E7: Rural Enterprise Sites  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF expects planning policies  to support the sustainable growth and expansion of all types  
44 of business in rural areas through both conversion of existing bui ldings  and well designed  new 
buildings . They should also  promot e development and diversification of land -based rural 
businesses, and support sustainable rural tourism and leisure  developments .  
Evidence Base  
 The EDNA  identifies  a number  of employment  sites outside  of the main  urban  areas  in the Borough 
which have a certain amount of vacant or underutilised land and could provide opportunities for 
future provision of employment land in the rural  areas.   
 The condition of nine existing employment sites located outside of the main urban areas was 
assessed by the ELPS . Sites located at Pitsea Hall Lane, Sadlers Farm, and London Road (Vange) 
performed poorly in the assessment. Although these sites are currentl y occupied, if they  become 
vacant, they may be more difficult to re -let due to their poor condition. Guildprime, White Bridge 
Farm,  the London  Road, Billericay  Clusters,  Vange Wharf  and Annwood  Lodge  all received  a fair 
score  and may  have  potential  limited  redevelopment  opportunities,  such  as upgrading  premises  and 
improving  site layout quality. Bluehouse Farm (Pitsea) and Barleylands Depot (Billericay) received 
good scores.   
 Guildprime,  London  Road  Clusters,  and Vange  Wharf  were  determined by  the study  to have  no scope  
for further  change  in terms  of meeting  the need  for new employment land  in the future.  However  the 
ELPS  recommends  that they should  be protected as employment sites for B -class employment  uses.   
 Whilst  these  rural employment  locations  are currently  in business  use, and opportunities  for making the 
best use of land to support  economic  growth  is in principle  supported,  it is important  to recognise that 
any development and growth of these sites must be in the context of the local surroundings.  As 
such,  the scale  and nature  of development  proposals  in these  locations  will be constrained  by the 
landscape and Green Belt. Consideration will also need to be given to the appropriateness of 
access arrangements, both for servicing and for employees and  customers.   
Policy E7  
Rural Enterprise Sites  
 To support the rural economy and provide greater flexibility to the employment land supply, the 
following existing Rural Enterprise Sites, as identified on the Policies Map, will be retained for  B-
class employment purposes as appropriate to their  location:  
a. Guildprime  Business Park, Great Burstead & South Green,  Billericay;  
b. Vange Wharf , Pitsea;  
c. Blue House Farm , Pitsea;  
d. Whites Bridge Farm , Crays Hill; 
e. Annwood Lodge , Wickford;  and 
f. Barleylands Depot,  Billericay  
 At the locations listed in part 1 of this policy, the following types of development will  be accepted, 
subject to compliance with the requirements of part 3 of this policy : 
a. extensions or expansions of an existing business or intensification of employment uses  
within the defined site  boundary;  
b. Agricultural  diversification;  
c. Change of use or conversion of a permanent and soundly constructed agricultural 
building;  or 
d. Uses  with a strong  functional  link back  to local agriculture,  forestry  or other  rural activity.  
 The types of development listed in part 2 of this policy will be supported within the locations  listed in 
part 1 where the following criteria can be  met: 
a. The proposal  would  improve  the balance  of jobs to working  age population  within  the 
immediate vicinity;  
b. The scale  of employment  is appropriate  to the accessibility  of the site by public  transport,  
cycling and walking , and the standard of  highways;  
c. The proposal respects the character and qualities of the landscape and the setting of any 
affected  settlement  or protected  landscape,  and includes  effective  mitigation  measures  to  
 
45 avoid adverse effects or minimise them to acceptable levels;  and 
d. The proposal conforms with all other relevant polic y requirements of  this plan.  
 
Policy E8: Untidy Industry Zone, Burnt Mills  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  does not provide specific policies covering 'untidy industries'. Rather, the term 'untidy 
industry' has been used by the Council since the 1990s to describe a variety of industries, which 
although vital to  the mix of sectors and employment possibilities in the Borough in terms of the 
people they employ and the services they provide, tend to be more untidy in appearance and 
could, without licensing controls, cause significant environmental harm.  
 Examples of industries that fall into this category include waste recovery and salvage (particularly 
metals), recycling, outside storage, and the parking of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). Sites for such 
industries are typically characterised  by their poorer  visual  appea rance,  noisy  work  carried  out in the 
open,  poorer  quality or temporary service buildings, large areas of hardstanding, and nuisance 
creating atmospheric discharges such as smoke, dust and  oil. 
 In light of this challenge in the Borough,  the location  of untidy industries  needs  to be carefully  
managed  to ensure  that both visual  and residential  amenities  of neighbouring  areas  are protected.  
In addition,  untidy  industries can  act as a disincentive  to investment  in other  economic  activities  in the 
close  vicinity,  particularly office,  retail  and leisure  uses.  As such,  it is preferable  for untidy  industries  
to be concentrated,  as far  as possible,  into a single  area where  the challenges  faced  by this sector  can 
be better  managed.   
 Land between Harvey Road and Archers  Field in the Burnt Mills Industrial Estate already contains 
a predominance of untidy industries, including car breakers, scrap metal merchants, skip hire, 
scaffolding companies and haulage yards. It is possible that some further development of untidy 
industries  could  take place  in this area over the plan period  through  the re-use of existing  sites.  It is 
not expected that such an approach would result in increased environmental  impacts that could not 
be dealt with through the supporting Environmental Protection Act  regimes.  
Evidence Base  
 In accordance with the recommendations of the ELPS , the Council will retain the area  allocated for 
untidy industries so that it can continue to manage the location of these potentially environmentally 
harmful industrie s. It should be noted that many of these uses also require Environmental 
Protection Act  licensing which is administered separately by the local authority and/or Environment  
Agency.  
Policy E8  
Untidy Industry Zone, Burnt Mills  
The development or expansion of  untidy industry uses will be permitted in the Harvey Road and Archers Field  
area of the Burnt  Mills Industrial  Estate,  as identified  on the Policies  Map.  Untidy  industry  proposals in  other  
locations  within  the existing  industrial  areas  will be assessed  on the basis  of their likely  effects  on nearby uses 
and the availability of sites in the Untidy Industry Zone. Outside of identified employment areas, untidy industry 
will not be  permitted.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy E9: Locations for Employment  Development  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires  local planning  authorities  to set criteria,  or identify  strategic  sites for local and  
46 inward investment to match the economic development strategy and to meet employment needs 
over the plan  period.  
Evidence Base  
 The ELPS  and the EDNA  indicates  that the locations  favoured  for B-class  employment  development,  
as reflected in policies E2 to E8 provide sufficient space to accommodate the predicted economic 
growth needs of the Borough, as well as needs arising from  any windfall loss and churn. The 
locations will also provide sufficient space to accommodate grow -on space for expanding 
businesses and a certain level of displaced or unmet growth needs coming out of Greater London, 
which will provide further employment opportunities in the Borough in line with the Council’s 
Economic Development Polic y. There is therefore no known requirement, or need, for permitting 
economic development outside allocated employment locations identified. However, consistent with 
the requi rements of the NPPF , criteria identifying where such development may be deemed 
suitable have been developed in the event such applications are  made.  
Policy E 9 
Locations for Employment Development  
 New B-class  employment  development,  and employment  generatin g sui generis  uses will be permitted 
within an allocated Employment Area or Rural Enterprise Site, subject to compliance with the 
requirements of any site specific allocation, and where all of the following criteria are  met: 
a. There is no adverse impact as a  result of pollution and disturbance, access, parking and 
servicing in the  area;  
b. The accommodation provided is flexible and suitable to meet future needs and 
requirements of larger businesses and small to medium enterprise firms, where  
appropriate;  
c. The sca le, bulk and appearance of the development is compatible with the character of 
its surroundings;  and 
d. On-site servicing and space for waiting goods vehicles is provided to an adequate  
standard.  
 Proposals  for industrial  development  within  the allocated  Emplo yment  Area  or Rural  Enterprise  Sites , 
as shown on the Policies Map , will be expected to contribute, where appropriate, to environmental  
and traffic improvement schemes for that employment  location.  
 Proposals for new B -class employment development outside Employment Areas will be restricted to 
B1 uses only in order to prevent potential disturbing activities in residential areas, and will be 
permitted where  the criteria  set out under  part 1 are met, and the following  additional  criteria  can 
also be met: 
a. The use is compatible  with the existing  uses  in the surrounding  area and there  are no 
adverse impact s on residential amenity or environmental  quality;  
b. There are no adverse impact on the capacity of the local road network;  and 
c. The development  provides  adequate  on-site parking  and servicing  for its intended  use, 
including space for waiting goods vehicles.  
 
Policy E10: Non B -Class Uses in Employment Areas  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  makes it clear that long term protection of employment allocations should be avoided 
where there is no prospect  of them  coming  forward.  However,  it is also clear  from the NPPF  that 
plan making should be based on an up to date and relevant evidence base, and therefore be 
responsive to the market signals to provide adequate provision of the r ight type of employment land 
to meet the needs of the business  community.   
 The NPPF  also expects that planning policies should be flexible enough to accommodate needs 
not anticipated in the plan and to allow a rapid response to changes in economic  circumstances.    
 
47 Evidence Base  
 The ELPS  and the more recent EDNA  provides  an up to date evidence  base,  which  the NPPF  
requires  in support  of a protective policy  stance.  The findings  on the supply  and demand  for 
employment  land show  that the current employme nt areas are performing well overall with a level 
of vacancy consistent with market conditions and maintaining a level of ‘churn’ which any functional 
market will require. Findings from the study also show that the current employment areas also 
generally p rovide a reasonable  quality  of premises  that are meeting  the needs  of existing  users.  
There  are significant forecast employment needs for the plan period up to 2034, and the existing 
employment areas provide  an important  contribution  to meeting  demand  in key sectors  which  are 
competitively  located in the Borough.   
 The ELPS  recommends the strengthening of certain employment protection policies, such as  the 
potential  loss of industrial  premises  to alternative  uses. It expressed concern about permitting non B -
class development  within  existing  employment  areas  on the basis  of the availability  of employment  
land elsewhere, as there is no guarantee similar levels of B -class job provision will be secured. 
Along with the Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  it also recommends the 
need to resist the loss of employment floorspace to out of town retail provision. Such provision has 
the potential to negatively  impact  on the vitality  of town  centres  and is less sustainable  due to 
reliance  on car use. Additionally, where a requirement for such development can be demonstrated, 
sufficient out of town locations are already available within the Borough, as identified in policy R11. 
The Local P lan similarly makes provision for out of town leisure provision  in policy R12. The loss of 
B-class employment land for retail and leisure uses is not therefore  justified.   
 The EDNA  highlights that of the employment land that is available in the Borough, there is not a 
significant supply of land that would be suitable for office uses. Whilst the Local P lan accounts for 
windfall losses and churn as part of the overall land supply for particular uses , as set out in policies 
E2-E7, this provides further justification for the retention of employment areas for particular B -class 
uses. This will be necessary if the Borough’s employment needs are to be met, and if the Council’s 
Economic Development Policy  of increasing the prosperity of the Borough’s residents through a 
greater offer of higher -value jobs in sectors such as adva nced manufacturing is to be realised.  
Policy E 10  
Non B -Class Uses in Employment Areas  
 Proposals  for new non B-class  employment  uses  within  Employment  Areas  and Rural Enterprise 
Sites which are likely to substantially prejudice policy SD1 will not normally  be permitted.  
 Where  a proposal  is seeking  to redevelop  or convert  a building  within  an Employment  Area  or Rural 
Enterprise Site into a non B -class use, permission will only be granted where the following criteria 
are met: 
a. It must  be demonstrated  the premi ses have  been  vacant  and pro-actively  marketed  for B-
class use for a minimum period of 2  years;  
b. It can be clearly demonstrated that the level of future demand for B -class employment 
uses has sufficiently dropped within the Borough to justify the loss of B -class 
employment space specifically designated to meet the need for this purpose over the 
plan period;  
c. It can be demonstrated  that the location  of the use within  an employment  area will not 
undermine the vitality or viability of town centres or local  centres;  
d. The proposed use is compatible with other existing uses within the employment area, 
having regard  to any potential  harm  to productivity  levels,  or to the health  and well-being  of 
employees or potential users;  and 
e. The proposal conforms to all other  relevant polic y requirements of  this plan.  
 
Policy E11: Aligning Skills and  Jobs  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects local planning authorities to pro -actively encourage sustainable economic  
48 growth and to plan positively for the expansion of the knowledge based , creative or high technology 
industries.    
 The National Productivity Plan, 'Fixing the foundations: Creating a more prosperous nation'  (July 
2015) , states that the UK's skills weaknesses and failure to grow a serious system of respected 
employer -led professional and technical qualifications are of such a long standing, and such 
intractability, that only the most radical action can address  them.   
 The Council's  Economic  Development  Policy  seeks  to improve the employment prospects, 
education and skills o f local people. It notes that while the employment rate in the Borough has 
improved since 2015, at the same time residents’ earnings fell considerably from the 2013 median 
level. The fall and stagnation in wages indicates a worrying trend of reduction in h igher paid and 
skilled employment opportunities and demonstrates the inability of local residents to access higher 
skilled and paid employment due to their lack of skills The policy seeks  to intervene  by getting  lower  
skilled  residents  into training  and work  to avoid  them  becoming marginalised in the labour market 
and to ensure improvements in the Borough’s economy are not unevenly shared.  
Evidence Base  
 The EDNA  notes that education is a concern across South Essex and is already an area of focus in 
the st rategic vision for Basildon Borough. It considers that the Borough suffers from a skills 
shortage, which has led to many jobs in established and emerging high -value companies being 
taken up by non -resident workforce who commute into the area. A stakeholder  workshop revealed 
that the coupling of low skills and high in -commuting has resulted in the resident labour force being 
effectively shut out from these jobs, which is a nuance that does not emerge from available data.  
 It is recommended by the EDNA  that th e South Essex authorities target support and investment for 
education, skills and training towards the occupations and industries within the sub -region’s 
identified growth sectors (transport & logistics, advanced manufacturing & green tech, 
digital/cultura l/creative industries, and health technology). This should help to boost the 
qualifications and skill levels of local people in order for them to take -up the jobs being created in 
the area over the next 20 years, and have better access to higher level occu pation opportunities.  
 Opportunities for local people to be engaged in the local economy through skills and training  can be 
achieved through the effective use of planning incentives and S106 agreements. Favourable 
consideration can be given to those proposa ls that will provide higher skilled jobs, and S106 
agreements can be used to secure skills training for local employees, and apprenticeships  within 
the construction  industry.  Additionally,  contributions  collected  through  the Community  Infrastructure 
Levy  (CIL) from development  can be spent  on securing  education  and skills  training  infrastructure. 
These  measures  will complement  those  measures  being  taken  by economic  development  partners 
and education providers to increase the take up of skills training and education amongst local 
people.  
Policy E 11 
Aligning Skills and Jobs  
 All major development proposals comprising B -class employment, retail and sui generis  uses, which 
as defined in the Town and Country Planning (Development Management  Procedure) (England)  
Order 2010 consist of the provision of buildings where the floorspace created by the development is 
1,000m2 or more; or which have a site area of 1ha or more, will be required to work with the Council 
and its partners to secure improvements to skills levels  and employment amongst local residents. 
Applicants will be encouraged to:  
a. Provide  apprenticeship/training  posts  for local young  people,  with a focus  on those  not in 
education, employment and training;  and 
b. Provide training in conjunction with local trainin g providers for employees of the proposal, 
seeking to improve skill levels amongst the workforce to NVQ level 3 or  higher.  
 Additionally, those developments identified in part 1, plus all other major development proposals 
falling within use classes C and D will also be required to:  
a. Employ builders who offer local apprenticeships in the development of the  proposal; and  
b. Submit an ‘Employment Skills Plan’ to demonstrate how the development proposal will  
 
49 secure improvements to skills levels and employment amongs t local residents.

 Ensuring the Vitality of Town Centres  
STRATEGIC POLIC IES 
Policy R1: Retail and Commercial Leisure Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  encourages local planning authorities to pursue town centre policies which support their 
vitality and viability. Local planning authorities are expected to recognise town centres as being the 
heart of their communities and  set out policies  for the manage ment and growth of centres.  
 The PPG provides further guidance on, and support to, the town centre policies contained  within 
the NPPF  and states that a positive vision or strategy for town centres, articulated through the 
Local Plan, is key to ensuring suc cessful town centres. The strategy should enable sustainable 
economic growth and provide a wider range of social and environmental  benefits.  
 Local planning authorities should plan positively to support town centres to generate local 
employment,  promote  beneficial  competition  within  and between  town centres,  and create  attractive, 
diverse  places  where  people  want  to live, visit and work.  The PPG  identifies  improving  the quality of 
parking in town centres and the quantity too as a way to help achieve this positive  approach.  
Evidence Base  
 The Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study (2015)  reported that the market 
context for town centres,  and retail  in particular,  is evolving  and there  has been  a renewed  focus  on 
the role and function  of the high street as a result. Town centres are facing increased pressure to 
remain competitive and to continue  attracting  retailers  and shoppers  in response  to the recent,  
sustained  economic  downturn, the continued attraction of out of town facilities as al ternative 
shopping destinations, and the increasing popularity of online shopping. Despite these challenges 
there still remains a role for town centres to provide a retail offer but this may need to be alongside 
leisure, cultural and civic services for the  town centre to continue being  successful.  
 The changes in the retail market that are expected to have the biggest implications on centres in 
the Borough in the medium to long term are the polarisation to higher order centres, the growth of 
the convenience goods sector and the growth in commercial leisure. The polarisation trend refers 
to the preference of retailers to concentrate trading activities in larger stores within larger centres, 
rather than having a network of smaller -format stores. The implication s for this on town centres is 
that many retailers will seek to downsize their portfolios, particularly in smaller centres and these 
centres may be required to potentially refocus their role and function away from being solely  
shopping  destinations,  to incorporating  a much  broader  retail,  leisure,  culture  and residential offer.  
 The second key change refers to the significant growth of discount retailers in the convenience 
goods  sector  and the apparent  move  away  by operators  from opening  larger -format  stores.  Instead, 
there is a preference for smaller supermarkets and retailers establishing a network of ‘top up’ 
convenience goods shopping facilities, often located in town centres or neighbourhood/local 
centres. The third change is based on predictions that com mercial leisure, such as cafes, bars, 
restaurants and cinemas, will form a growing share of town centre floorspace. Town centres will 
need to redefine their function as ‘destinations’ in light of this change. Despite this, there will still 
remain  a need  for retail  floorspace  in town  centres  and Experian  forecast  that store -based  shopping is 
still expected to expand in the future, while online sales will begin to  plateau.  
 There  is a clear  hierarchy  of centres  within  the Borough  as confirmed in the Basildon Retail and 
Commercial Leisure Capacity Study . The Borough's main centres are  Basildon,  Billericay,  Laindon,  
Pitsea  and Wickford, with Basildon being a regional centre. They are an important part of the local 
economy providing local jobs and important goods  and services for residents and  workers.  
 There  are a further  39 local centres,  as set identified  in the Basildon Borough Local  Centres  Review  
(2015  Update),  which  support  neighbourhoods  in the main  settlements  and some  of the smaller  
settlements,  and provide  local communities  with the opportunity  to buy convenience  goods  or visit 
essential  services outside town centre locations. There are also a number of out of centre retail and 
commercial leisure  locations  in the Borough  which  are well used  and compl iment  the offer in the  
 
51 regional,  town and local  centres.  
 The Borough's town centres, particularly Basildon Town Centre, are facing increasing competition 
for expenditure  from large  nearby  centres  outside  the Borough  which  include  Lakeside,  Chelmsford, 
Brentwood and Southend -on-Sea. All of these centres are planning future expansions or 
enhancements to their retail  and leisure offer.  
 
 
 The hierarchy of centres within the Borough is set out in Table  8.1. 
Table 8.1: Hierarchy of Centres  
Hierarchy  Position   Location  
Regional Town Centre  Basildon  
Town Centre  Billericay  
Laindon  
Pitsea  
Wickford  
Local Centre  39 Local Centres - See Appendix 4 
 
 In general the Borough's town centres are performing well, with the exception of Laindon Town 
Centre, although planning consent was secured in September 2017 for the major redevelopment of 
the Laindon Shopping Centre. It  is important that features which help define these centres and 
make them successful now, such as the cluster of independent retailers in Billericay, the 
pedestrianised nature of Basildon's primary shopping area, and the street markets in Basildon, 
Pitsea and Wickford are protected. However, there is scope to improve certain areas or aspects of 
each town centre to make them more attractive as destinations of choice and cater for the needs of 
the population, now and into the future. This will ultimately ensu re their longevity and improved 
success.   
Town and Local Centre Definitions  
Town  centre  - A defined  area,  including  the primary  shopping  area where  retail  devel opment  is 
concentrated, and areas predominately  occupied by main town centre uses adjacent to the primary 
shopping  area.  
Primary shopping frontage - primary frontages located within the primary shopping area that are likely to 
include a high proportion of retail uses.  
Secondary  shopping  frontage  - secondary  frontages  located  within  the town  centre  that are likely  to include a 
diversity of uses such as retail, restaurants, cinema and  businesses.  
Main town centre uses:  
 Retail development (including warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres);  
 Leisure,  entertainment  facilities  and the more  intensive  sport  and recreation  uses  
(including  cinemas, restaurants,  bars and pubs,  night -clubs,  casinos,  health  and fitness  
centres,  indoor  bowling  centres, and bingo  halls);  
 Offices; and  
 Arts, culture and tourism development (including theatres, museums, galleries and 
concert halls, hotels and conference facilities).  
Local centre - locally significant areas of retail and other appropriate uses providing 3 or more units . 
  
52 
 The South Essex Strategic Retail Study (SESRS) (2018)  provides a strategic retail evidence base 
for South Essex (including Basildon Borough), to assist in determining cross -boundary retail and 
leisure planning matte rs. The SESRS provides an update to the Basildon Retail and Commercial 
Leisure Capacity Study , and provides the latest quantitative need for Basildon Borough. The 
qualitative assessment provided within the Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity St udy 
however remains the most recent on -the-ground assessment of the Borough’s centres and stores.  
 Under the preferred housing -led scenario (Lakeside comparison sensitivity) of the SESRS , there is 
a need to plan for up to 2,500m2 net additional comparison goods floorspace and  up to 700m2 net 
additional  convenience  good  floorspace  by 2021.  By the end of the plan period the capacity 
requirements are forecast to increase to a net addition of 24,100m2 of comparison goods 
floorspace an d 4,900 m2 of convenience good floorspace, although these longer -term forecasts 
(post -2021) should be treated as  indicative, as recommended in the Basildon Retail and 
Commercial Leisure Capacity Study . The study  recommends that capacity forecasts should be 
subject to regular review throughout the plan period, in order to ensure up  to date evidence base 
which is based on accurate economic and market trends and that residential growth is occurring at 
the levels forecast . 
 There is also a requirement for 1,900 m2 gross additional food and drink (A3, A4 and A5) floorspace 
within the Borough by 2021, increasing to a requirement of 9,300 m2 gross by the end of the plan 
period. The Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  recommends that the 
identified requirement for new commercial leisure floorspace (including restaurants and cafes) is 
directed towards Basildon Town Centre in the first instance, where a significant under -provision of 
commercial leisure floorspace has bee n consistently identified . New commercial leisure floorspace 
will however also include additional  cinema  facilities,  which  would  provide  improved  consumer  
choice  and competition,  and any further family  entertainment. The  study  also examined  the 
provision  of gym and leisure  facilities  and ‘games  of chance’  facilities such  as bingo  halls,  casinos  
and bookmakers  within  the Borough,  and concluded  that although they were adequate both 
qualitatively and quantitatively, poor provision of gym and leisure facilities  was noted within  Laindon 
Town Centre specifically.  
 The plan directs  new development  towards  the larger  settlements,  principally  Basildon  (incorporating 
Laindon and Pitsea), Billericay and Wickford, in line with Government planning advice and the 
principle s of sustainability. This will in turn support the regeneration and enhancement of the 
Borough's town centres and help secure an improved vitality. However, the Council also recognises 
the importance of local shopping provision within many of the Borough's  neighbourhoods, including 
those  created  as part of the strategic housing allocations , and the growth of serviced settlements.  In 
these  localised centres  small -scale  retail  development  should  be promoted  providing  it is appropriate  
in scale  and meets the day-to-day needs of the  community.  
 Town centres are also major generators of journeys for employment, shopping, services, and 
entertainment, and are therefore the focus for a large number of vehicle trips. The Basildon 
Borough Parking Capacity and Interven tion Study (2017)  was commissioned to review parking in 
the Borough’s five town centres, railway stations and employment areas. The findings of the study 
addresses the ‘Promoting Sustainable Transport’ requirements of the NPPF , to ensure existing and 
future parking facilities are adequately considered for the planning processes and when developing 
and delivering the Borough’s regeneration. It is clear from the study that a series of new parking 
policy measures are required that reflect the varied nature of parking constraints across the five 
town centres, railway stations and employment areas  and these are set out in policy T9 . The study 
appraised the different options for the provision, management and spatial intervention to 
accommodate future parking deman d, which has subsequently informed the plan’s approach to 
parking provision within the town.  
 The hotel bedspace demand projections for the Borough and the other findings of the Basildon 
Borough Hotel Futures Study  have a number of implications in relation to hotel development. The 
study shows market potential for two large hotels, some smaller hotels and possible extensions to 
existing hotels in the Borough within the plan -period. The Local Plan therefore needs to ensure its 
policies guide hotel development  to appropriate locations, accounting in particular for the more 
business  focused nature of the Borough’s hotel patrons.  
 
 
  
 
53 Policy R1  
Retail  and Commercial Leisure Strategy  
 The Council will seek to deliver up to 2,500m2 net additional comparison goods floo rspace  and up to 
700m2 net additional convenience good floorspace by 2021. A further 21,600 m2 and 4,200m2 net 
floorspace respectively will be delivered by the end of the plan  period, subject to periodic monitoring 
and review of economic and market trends.  
 In addition to new retail provision, the Council will seek to deliver up to 1,900 m2 gross  additional 
food and drink (A3, A4 and A5) floorspace by 2021, and a further 7,400 m2 gross floorspace by the 
end of the plan  period, subject to periodic monitoring and  review of economic and market trends . 
 To ensure  the long-term vitality  and viability  of the Borough's  centres,  the Council  will apply  a “town 
centre -first” approach  to proposals  for retail,  leisure  and other  main  town  centre  uses  in accordance  
with the established hierarchy of  centres as follows:  
 Regional  Town  Centre: Basildon  
 Town  Centre: Billericay, Laindon, Pitsea  and Wickford  
 Local  Centre: 39 Local Centres as defined in Appendix  4 
 The regeneration  of Basildon,  Laindon,  Wickford  and Pitsea  Town Centres  in accordance  with policies 
R2 to R5 will be a key priority, while enhancements to the vitality of Billericay Town Centre will be 
sought in accordance with policy R6. Proposals that focus new development for retail, leisure and 
other main town centr e uses within these centres will be  supported.  
 The Council will support proposals for the development and retention of hotel/visitor 
accommodation,  in appropriate locations, where identified needs are not being met by existing 
facilities, taking into account locational requirements when applying the sequential test, the target 
market of hotel patron and the viability of hotel development.  
 In addition to the main town centre uses, residential development will be permitted on appropriate 
sites within the  Borough's town centres, where they could contribute to their vitality  and subject to 
compliance with all other relevant policies of this plan.  
 The Council  will safeguard  existing  street  markets  and encourage  the creation  of new street  markets 
where they s upport the vitality of the town  centre.  
 The Council  will give preference to applications for main town centre uses located in town centres, 
and will apply the sequential and impact tests to proposals to re -use, redevelop or intensify out of 
centre location s for retail, leisure and other main town centre uses . 
 Shops and other community facilities within local centres should be retained and enhanced where 
they remain viable and new local centres created where they are required to meet the day -to-day 
needs of the local community.  
 Greater emphasis will be placed on sustainable access to and from the town centres such as 
walking, cycling and public transport, and appropriate levels of car parking will be provided in key 
locations and along main movement corridors  into the town centres. The Council will ensure there 
continues to be sufficient car parking capacity across each town centre to support the economic and 
future growth aspirations, without inducing unmanageable traffic flows across the highway network.  
 
Policy R2 to R5: Town Centre Regeneration  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects local planning authorities to plan positively within their Local Plan s to support 
the to support town centre  viability and  vitality.  
 The PPG  states  that strategies  should  identify  changes  in the hierarchy  of town  centres,  including 
where a town centre is in decline. In these cases, strategies should seek to manage decline  
54 positively  to encourage  economic  activity  and achieve  an appropriate  mix of uses  commensurate 
with a realistic f uture for that town  centre.  
 The PPG  emphasises  that not all successful  town  centre  regeneration  projects  have  been  retail -led or 
involved significant new development. Improvements to the public realm, transport (including 
parking)  and accessibility,  as well as other  measures  promoted  through  partnership  working,  can 
also play important  roles.  
Evidence Base  
 A principle objective of the Local P lan is to create vibrant and thriving town centres by maintaining 
Basildon Town Centre's role as a Regional Centre  and conserving the distinct identities of the 
Borough's other town centres, whilst improving their local community roles and functions  through 
mixed -use developments. There is a particular challenge to ensure that these towns strengthen 
their roles as 'de stinations' to reduce the ‘leakage’ of trade to other competing centres such as 
Brentwood, Chelmsford and Southend -on-Sea, as well as the out of centre location of  Lakeside.  
 Transforming the Borough's town centres into vibrant centres of retail, commerce a nd places  for the 
community to live and enjoy is also an integral part of the Borough's Community Strategy 2012 -
2036.  
 The Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  concluded that allowing flexibility 
within town centres is  critical  to ensuring  their longer -term health.  Imposing  controls  on the proportion  
and concentration of A1 uses within the centre would fail to recognise the current trends and issues 
faced by town centres and so would not assist in achieving this  objective.  
Basildon  Town Cent re 
 Basildon Town Centre performs the role of a Regional Town Centre, and as set out in policy R2, will 
be the primary focus for all future major retail and leisure development within the Borough, 
alongside supporting education, cultural and employment uses . This recognises the functional role 
it plays to communities both within the Borough and in the wider  sub-region.  
 The town  centre  offers  excellent  public  transport  links.  Basildon's  main  bus station  and train station 
which have good connections to London and other towns, both within and outside the Borough, are 
located within the town centre. There are several car parks situated around the town centre. The  
primary  shopping  area is pedestrianised  throughout  and this is recognised  as a positive  asset to the 
town centre, as is the presence of various civic and community  facilities.  
 The retail offer is clustered around Town Square and the covered Eastgate Shopping Centre  and is  
generally  considered  to represent a middle  to lower  market -offer.  There  are a range  of department  
stores and foodstores operated by national multiple retailers  located throughout the centre,  and the 
principle ‘anchor’ stores Primark, Debenhams and Asda generate strong footfall to their  locations.  
The retail  mix is generally  positive albeit with a weaker offer towards the western end, which is 
accentuated by the design of the dominant retail frontage in the Westgate Centre  which faces onto 
Southernhay and  turns  its back  on the town  centre.  
 The Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure  Capacity Study  identified a need to provide an 
additional foodstore in the  town  centre  in the long term to provide  improved  consumer  choice  and 
competition  to the only other  foodstore within the centre. The study recommends that this take the 
form of a medium -sized supermarket in the region of 1,000m2 net, and be located towards the 
western end of the town centre. The remainder of the need for retail in terms of convenience and 
comparison goods can be primarily met  through  the redevelopment  and modernisation  of the 
centre’s existing  property  stock.  
 Retail  premises  are generally  good -sized  and relatively  modern  with low vacancy  rates.  However, 
there  is opportunity  to modernise  and improve  the retail  property  stock  in some  parts  of the centre, 
particularly the s econdary areas around Market Square and South Walk which now appear more 
dated. More recently, town centre blocks have been the subject of private investment, including 
enhancements to the Eastgate Centre’s entrances, which have previously been hidden from  view 
and refurbishment of the external appearance and shop units around Town Square, which shows 
added market confidence in the centre, at a time it needs to modernise its built facilities.   
 
55 
 The repositioning of the retail offer away from the ‘value’ end, which includes discount and  value 
retailers will also assist in reducing expenditure leakage to destinations such as Lakeside and 
Chelmsford and improve the quality of the retail offer in order for the town centre to fulfil its role and 
function as the hig hest order centre in the Borough.  
 Whilst  environmental  quality  is reasonable,  some  ‘softening’  of the appearance  of the town  centre 
through investment and regeneration projects in suitable public realm treatments would be 
beneficial as there is little architectural diversity or significant areas of green  space.  
 The town centre contains two Grade II listed buildings at Brooke House (Grade II), and the raised 
pool and sculpture in the foreground of Brooke House (Grade II and group value), which contribute  
to its special interest. The town centre’s listed buildings and public art represent a significant part of 
the town centre’s history, layout and sense of place, which can be linked to the post -war New Town 
planning movement. Any proposal for development w ithin the town centre, including public realm 
improvements, should therefore take into account, and contribute positively to the historic quality of 
the area.  
 The town centre also plays an important civic and community function which is due to be enhanced 
by the introduction of the new South Essex College campus as part of the redevelopment of Market 
Square. This  will secure the physical redevelopment of part of the town centre, following the 
relocation of the market  into St Martin’s  Square, further to the north.  The introduction  of the college  
will introduce  significant  new additional footfall into the town centre, particularly during  weekdays.  
 While  retail  diversity  is strong,  the Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity  Study  found  
that the town  centre offers  very limited  leisure  and evening  economy  options.  The absence  of such  
facilities,  particularly a  cinema  and family  dining  offer,  means  that the centre  principally  operates  as a 
retail  destination, and does not have a sufficiently diverse mixt ure of uses to ensure it is an 
attractive  destination outside of retail trading hours. The Towngate Theatre is the only cultural 
venue within the town centre and whilst it is an important facility, it would also likely benefit from an 
improved evening econ omy as would  the rest of Basildon Town Centre. There is therefore scope 
for a qualitative and quantitative enhancement of the A3 (Restaurants  and Cafes)  and A4 (Pubs  and 
Bars)  and a hotel offer within  Basildon  Town Centre,  and the majority of  the identified  new 
floorspace  capacity  will be directed  towards  improving  this type of provision.  This is accompanied 
by a recognised need to provide cinema facilities within the town centre. The Council is leading a 
proposal to redevelop East Square with a ne w multiplex and supporting restaurants and public 
realm enhancement which should enable  the centre  to genuinely  offer better facilities in the 
evenings and compete  with other leisure  destinations within and outside the  Borough . 
 Since  2012,  Basildon  Town Centre's  planning  and regeneration  has been  guided  by a Masterplan, 
prepared  by the Council's  Development  Partner  Barratt  Wilson  Bowden  and scheduled  for review at 
least every seven years. The Basildon Town Centre Masterplan  (2012)  sets out the potential to  
redevelop the centre's key areas into a series of high quality developments with public urban 
spaces to bring about substantial positive changes and new development opportunities to  create a 
coherent overall public space network. The key development areas  include St Martin's  Square, 
Market Square, East Square, and East Walk and propose the introduction of mixed -use areas of 
retail, leisure, residential and office development; as well as the relocation of the street market and 
the South Essex College into t he town centre. In addition, the Masterplan  seeks to overhaul public 
transport facilities available in the centre, encouraging greater use and  better inter -connections. 
These proposals include a safe and modern transit mall for buses, taxis and trains, as well as 
creating new development opportunities through the redevelopment of the bus and railway station 
areas. This is alongside changes to the highway network that will enable improved traffic 
management.  
 To support the regeneration of Basildon Town Centre, the Council have identified a minimum 
dwelling  capacity  of 1,036  units  (see policy  SD2)  within  the boundaries  of the town  centre  through 
the latest  HELAA  and maximising densities . This corresponds  with the opportunity to deliver up to 
2,128  homes  which is based on the 1,500  to 2,000  homes  outlined  in the Basildon  Town Centre 
Masterplan , which itself covers a larger area than the defined town centre , and an uplift of 6.4% 
based on higher density residential develop ment being delivered historically t han originally 
anticipated within the Masterplan , as set out in the Town Centre Masterplan Residential Audit 
Paper . There have also been a number of residential schemes that have already come to fruition 
since the approval of the Masterplan , including seve ral office to residential conversions at Regent 
House, Keilting House and Trafford House. There is an expectation that further opportunity sites  
56 will be realised over the course of the  plan period , focused however on more purpose built 
accommodation.  
Polic y R2  
Basildon Town Centre Regeneration  
 Basildon Town Centre will be the primary focus for all future major retail and leisure  development 
within the Borough, in order to reinforce its role and function as the highest -order centre in the 
Borough and enable it to compete with other similar sized centres in the  sub-region.  
 The town centre will be regenerated with the aim of providing the majority of the additional retail 
floorspace required for the Borough, alongside leisure and entertainment floorspace, a new  hotel, 
up to around 2,128  residential units, a further education college, and a mix of business, community 
and open space uses. These will all be delivered as guided by the most up to date Town Centre  
Masterplan.  
 The primary shopping area, which includes the primary and secondary frontages will be protected, 
as will the street  market;  while  the redevelopment  and modernisation  of existing  premises,  particularly 
around  the periphery  of the primary  shopping  area,  will be encouraged  to support  the diversification 
of uses and the introduction of a night -time economy.  
 Enhancements  to the environmental  quality  of the town  centre  will be made  through  the refurbishment 
of the existing  public  realm  and the creation  of new squares  and green  spaces  as part of development, 
which will provide greater connectivity between the surrounding residential areas and the  centre.  
Laindon Town Centre  
 Laindon Town Centre is located 2 miles to the west of Basildon Town Centre. It predominantly 
comprises the purpose built L aindon Shopping Centre as well as a NHS health centre and public 
library nearby. The centre  is in a relatively  accessible  location  surrounded  by a large  residential  
community  which would, if suitable facilities were to be provided, be able to look towards the centre 
to meet their shopping  needs.  
 Numerous  studies,  including  the Basildon Retail  and Commercial  Leisure  Capacity  Study,  have  
identified  the Laindon Shopping Centre as being in significant need of redevelopment and it has 
been the ambition of the  Council to replace the poor quality building with a more appropriate mixed 
use scheme for Laindon Town Centre through private investment.  While  this has always  been  the 
intention,  progress  on the redevelopment  of the Laindon Centre  has stalled  several  times  over the 
years  due to numerous  changes  in ownership  and a lack of general investment.  
 The town centre currently has a small supermarket, which is the centre's only anchor store, and a 
limited mix of comparison goods retailers as well as a bank, post office  and public house. The 
proportion  of empty  units  is high and significantly  above  the national  average  and, whilst  car parking 
appears to be adequate the pedestrian accessibility to the centre needs improvement. The 
environmental  quality  and access  to the centre  by the surrounding  community  needs  to be enhanced 
through  improvements  to the permeability  of the centre  and the creation  of a more  attractive  public 
realm with  landscaping.  
 The study  identified  an opportunity  to improve  convenience  goods  provision  for residents  in Laindon 
Town Centre as part of the shopping centre's redevelopment, with a larger format foodstore being 
an anchor store for the new centre. This would provide enhancement to the local provision for 
residents in the Laindon area, and support the wider redevelopment of the  centre.  
 It also remains  the Council's  aspiration  to facilitate  the replacement  of the Laindon  Health  Centre, 
which  is adjacent  to the Laindon  Shopping Centre  to improve  health  facilities  for the existing  and 
future  local community.  
 In September 2017, Swan Community Housing secured planning consent for the redevelopment of 
the existing shopping centre, the neighbouring health centre and a local supermarket into a new 
mixed -use residential, office, retail and health deve lopment with parking and new public spaces, 
centred on a new High Street. “Laindon Place” will commence construction on a phased basis from 
2018.   
 
57 Policy R3  
Laindon Town Centre Regeneration  
 The regeneration  and redevelopment  of Laindon  Town Centre  is a key priority  of the Council  and will 
be delivered in accordance with its  Masterplan.  
 The town centre will be regenerated through a mixed -use scheme providing new retail floorspace in 
a High Street format, including a stand -alone replacement large format foods tore, alongside at least 
224 residential units, 1,681m2 of offices, a replacement NHS health centre, open space, and 
community  uses.  
 Enhancements to the environmental quality of the town centre will be made through landscaping 
and improvements to the publi c realm, highways, car parking and public transport links will provide 
greater access to the  centre.  
Pitsea Town Centre  
 Pitsea  Town Centre  is located  3 miles  to the south  east of the Basildon  Town Centre,  at the intersection 
of a number  of major  intra and inter-urban  roads.  The Pitsea  Town  Centre  Masterplan  (2007)  set out  
the vision  and direction  for the regeneration  of the town  centre  which  focuses  on the integration of  
retail,  leisure,  employment,  community  services  and facilities,  and transport  infrastructure  within an 
attractive and enhanced public  realm.  
 The retail offer in Pitsea Town Centre is skewed towards convenience goods retailing, as well as 
meeting some day -to-day comparison and service needs. The Basildon Retail and Commercial 
Leisure  Capacity Study  identified an under provision in comparison goods and a number of 
qualitative gaps in the food and beverage offer within the town centre, which currently suffers from 
a proliferation of take -away and fast food restaurants, and little footfa ll outside of retail trading 
hours. There are no  cafes,  drinking  establishments  or family  orientated  restaurants  and this should  be 
a key element of the town centre's  regeneration.  
 The town  centre  benefits  from a popular  and well-supported  street  market  which  has been  relocated to  
the newly -created  market  square  fronting  the High Road  and provides  an enhanced  focal  point  for 
pedestrian activity. The creation of the market square has enhanced the public realm, but further 
works are required  to provide  better pedestrian  links between  the various  parts  of the town  centre.  
At present the  town  centre  favour s cars more  than pedestrians  which  has an impact  on footfall  and 
pedestrian safety.  
 With the provision of additional retail units as part of the regeneration  of the Pitsea Market which 
are now the base of The Range and the  nearby  Tesco  Extra  store,  which  accounts  for a large  
proportion  of comparison  goods  spending in the area, there is unlikely to be a need for further 
provision of retail floorspace for comparison goods  within  the plan period.  The relocation  of Aldi 
supermarket  also means that the provision of convenience goods is well catered for. However there 
is an opportunity to modernise and improve the existing retail stock around the periphery of t he 
primary shopping area to encourage a greater mix of retail  uses.  
Policy R4  
Pitsea Town Centre Regeneration  
 The regeneration of Pitsea Town Centre will ensure its vitality and viability and enable it to thrive as 
a 'destination' providing a diverse retai l and leisure offer, alongside health and community facilities 
that meet the needs of the local  community.  
 The primary shopping area, which includes the primary and secondary frontages will be protected, 
as will the street  market;  while  the modernisation  of existing  premises,  particularly  around  the periphery 
of the primary  shopping  area,  will be encouraged  to support  the diversification  of uses  and the creation 
of a vibrant evening  economy.  
 Enhancements  to the environmental  quality  of the town  centre  and the creation  of pedestrian  friendly 
public realm will improve its attractiveness and encourage greater pedestrian movement through the  
centre.   
58 Wickford Town Centre  
 Wickford Town Centre is located in the north -east of the Borough and has been the subject of  a 
number of recent regeneration projects, including the renovation and refurbishment of Wickford 
swimming  pool to incorporate  a new fitness  suite,  the relocation  of the market  to Market  Lane  and a  
new public  square,  new public  toilets  and improvements  to the High Street  in the form of renewed  
paving, shop frontages, landscaping and  lighting.  
 The town centre, whilst relatively small in size, contains two small semi -enclosed shopping centres 
and two supermarkets  and is focused  around  a linear  shopping  area.  There  is a relatively  low 
vacancy  rate within the town centre, and the presence of some national retailers indicates that the 
centre is performing reasonably  well. 
 The town centre benefits from good public transport links providing connections to Basildon and the  
wider Essex  area and it has adequate  car parking  provision.  Wickford  train station  is located towards 
the northern end of the town centre and there are a number of bus routes that terminate at the 
station and in The  Broadway.  
 The Basildon Retail an d Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  revealed there is a fairly good 
representation of convenience goods retailers within the town centre with the presence of Aldi  and 
the Co -Operative, as well as a small Iceland store. There are also a number of independen t 
retailers, and a good range of service providers such as banks and chemists. However the retail 
offer is generally medium  to lower  market,  and whilst  there  is a selection  of comparison  goods  
retailers,  the clothing and fashion offer is quite limited. This is also true for the food and beverage 
offer within the town centre which is represented by only two pubs, a restaurant , and is largely  
dominated by take -away  operators.  
 Regeneration of the town centre was first envisaged in 2006, with the adoption of a Town Centre 
Masterplan  which set out the approach to revive the High Street, provide a new street market, 
health centre, leisure centre and library and create new commercial, residential and retail space. 
However,  due to the economic  downturn  the Council  was not successful  in securing  a regeneration 
partner  to deliver  the aims  of the Masterplan  as the plan became  financially  unviable.  The Council 
has since produced the Wickford Town Centre Regeneration Strategy (2013)  and implemented  a 
number of the key regeneration projects achieved through phased  delivery . 
 While  the recent  investments  in the town  centre  public  realm  have  helped  to reinvigorate  the central 
area of the town centre and encourage new inves tment and more retailers and shoppers, the 
Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  identified a need for further investment to 
make the town centre more cohesive. The railway viaduct, which bisects the town centre, is a 
dominating visual barr ier which interrupts the line of sight and divides the primary shopping area in 
half with the greatest footfall to the south of the  viaduct.  
 In terms of new provision, the study recommended that an additional foodstore within Wickford 
could be beneficial a s there is evidence that the existing Aldi store is over -trading and the Lidl and 
Iceland stores were also  trading  strongly.  It noted  few opportunities  for outward  expansion  of the 
centre,  and therefore any improvements to provision were expected to be principally small -scale. 
The study also encouraged  further  diversification  of the retail  offer and modernisation  of the existing  
unit stock  as and when suitable opportunities  arise.  
 The latest HELAA report has identified capacity for at least 15 residentia l units within the  town 
centre but there is a recognised potential for this figure to increase, subject to further development 
projects  that support the regeneration of the town centre coming  forward, particularly those which 
review the role and provision of parking in the town centre. As recently as January 2018, planning 
consent was granted for the redevelopment of the existing Rylands Hostel to the south of the town 
centre to provide 30 affordable residential units, alongside 78m2 of commercial floorspace.  
 While the need for additional accommodation provision in Wickford is less clear, the Basildon 
Borough Hotel Futures Study  recommends that there could be potential for a small lodge -hotel 
linked to a pub restaurant, pub rooms, pos sibly a small budget hotel, and/or the expansion of the 
existing hotels that serve the town.  
 
  
 
59 Policy R5  
Wickford Town Centre Regeneration  
 The regeneration of Wickford Town Centre will be delivered in accordance with the most up to date 
Masterplan or Regen eration  Strategy.  
 The town centre will be regenerated with the aim of providing new retail floorspace including an 
additional  foodstore,  and 15 - 100 residential  units,  alongside  a mix of other  leisure,  business,  health 
and community uses where opportuniti es arise. This will increase the popularity of the town centre 
as a shopping and leisure destination and enable it to  thrive.  
 The primary shopping area, which includes the primary and secondary frontages will be protected, 
as will the street market; while the modernisation of existing premises and the diversification of the 
retail offer will be  encouraged.  
 Further enhancements to the public realm will be supported where they improve the cohesiveness 
of the town centre and increase its attractiveness to inve stors and  retailers.  
 
Policy R6: Billericay Town Centre Enhancement  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects  planning  policies  set out policies  for the management  and growth of town centres 
over the plan period to ensure the ir vitality and viability in the long term.  
 In terms  of the historic  aspect  of the town centre,  the NPPF  states  that local planning  authorities should 
plan positively for the conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment and take into 
account the wi der social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits that conservation of the 
historic environment can  bring.  
Evidence Base  
 Billericay Town Centre is located in the north west of the Borough. It has a focus on higher -end 
national retailer and leisure operators, and caters for a relatively affluent catchment area. The 
centre is based around a linear High Street, with the railway station at the n orthern end and a 
Waitrose supermarket acting as the main anchor, towards the southern end of the town  centre.  The 
location of the train station which provides connections to London and surrounding towns, and the 
frequency of bus routes running through the  centre ensures that the town centre offers good 
transport  links.  
 As a centre, Billericay provides a good range of services and shopping and currently retains a high 
proportion of its local residents' spend. There is a strong independent retailing sector w ith a large 
number of specialist and boutique retailers based within the High Street which forms the principal 
shopping area. There is a good range of national multiple retailers, although further demand  from 
national  retailers  appears  to be relatively  limited, probably  as a consequence  of the small size of 
many of the retail premises in the town  centre.  
 The town centre also has a vibrant restaurant scene which, when viewed in combination with  the 
retail  offer,  provides  consumers  with an experience  that cannot be replicated  online.  It has a strong 
evening economy and boasts the greatest number of A3 and A5 uses in the Borough when 
considered  as a proportion  of total town  centre  uses.  These  are filled mainly  by restaurants  including 
mid-range  chains  such  as Ask Italian,  Prezzo  and Pizza  Express,  but there  is also a large  presence of 
independent cafes. The town centre also contains five pubs and one  bar. 
 The majority of the town centre has been designated as a Conservation Area since the 1960s and 
is therefore  legally recognised  as being  of special  architectural  and historical  interest  and protected  
under  policy  HE2. The  historic  core of the town  centre  comprises  a collection  of traditional  and more  
modern  buildings which  creates  an attractive  and unique  charac ter that should  be preserved  and 
wherever  possible enhanced. To support this aim the Council adopted the Billericay Town Centre 
Conservation Area Management Plan in 2012  and the Billericay Conservation Area Shop Front and  
60 Design Guide in 2015  as Supplementary Planning Documents to provide guidance on  shop front 
design and advertising, as well as put forward a range of other considerations when works are 
proposed within the Conservation Area. It is expected that such guidance will encourage 
investment in the town centre, work towards its continued conservation and strengthen the quality 
of the shopping  experience.  
 Whilst the town centre has a high quality environment with interesting architectural diversity, the 
Basildon Retail  and Commercial  Leisure  Capacity Study  did identify  there  being  very few public  
spaces  and an over dominance of traffic. There is a need to ensure the ongoing success of 
Billericay Town Centre by considering opportunities to improve the public realm, particularly for 
pedest rians, and ease capacity issues on the road  network.  
 The Basildon Retail  and Commercial  Leisure  Capacity Study  recommended that the town centre 
could benefit from the introduction of a second supermarket, likely to be in the form of a local store 
format, to improve consumer choice. As the town centre  is fairly constrained  with limited  opportunity  to 
expand  the Coun cil will consider  positively applications  which  seek  to modify  or amalgamate  suitable  
units  providing  they do not conflict  with the historic setting to provide additional convenience goods  
floorspace within the centre.  
 The Basildon Borough Hotel Futures St udy identifies opportunities for accommodation 
development in Billericay in terms of pub accommodation ; restaurants with rooms; a small boutique 
hotel possibly, subject to suitable building for conversion; and a small budget hotel possibly on a 
suitable si te. 
 The Basildon Parking Capacity and Intervention Study  identifies Billericay as having a lower level 
of parking provision per capita than other town centres across the Borough.  There is therefore an 
underlying demand for additional parking provision within the town centre, with demand for parking 
forecast to exceed current available capacity over the coming years. There are limited opportunities 
for new car park sites, which presents challenges in sustainably delivering further capacity, unless 
any of  the existing car parks are decked, which would need to be done sympathetically due to the 
historic protection of the wider area and the amenity of surrounding residential buildings. The study 
however considers a range of potential measures that could form  the basis of an improved parking 
policy.  
Policy R6  
Billericay Town Centre Enhancement  
 To support the vitality and viability of Billericay Town Centre, the strong independent retailing sector 
and evening economy will be protected, and the provision of a lo cal store format foodstore which 
enhances consumer choice will be considered  favourably, alongside a mix of other leisure and 
community uses where opportunities arise.  
 Opportunities to enhance the public realm, including the introduction of a dedicated spa ce for a 
street market and an increase in public space will be encouraged where they contribute to the 
vitality of the town centre and are in keeping with the town centre’s historic character, whilst not 
impacting on  amenity.  
 The overall vehicle parking st ock will be efficiently and effectively managed through the 
implementation of appropriately designed supply, maintenance, charging and enforcement 
measures.  
 Works carried out to buildings and/or land within the town centre boundary which enhance the 
charac ter and vibrancy of the town centre will be supported where they are in accordance with the 
latest  Billericay  Conservation  Area  Shop  Front  and Design  Guide,  Billericay Town Centre 
Conservation Area Management Plan  and any other  relevant  policy requirements  of this plan.  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
61 ALLOCATIONS POLICIES  
Policy  R7: Town Centre Boundaries , Policy R8: Primary Shopping Frontages 
and Policy R9: Secondary Shopping Frontages  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states that local planning authorities should define the extent of  town centres and 
primary shopping areas when drawing up their Local Plans. This includes defining the  primary  and 
secondary  frontages  within  these  areas,  and setting  policies  that make  clear  what uses  will be 
permitted  in such  locations.  Competitive  centres  should promote  customer  choice  and a diverse 
retail offer and reflect the individuality of town  centres.  
 Whilst the Local P lan will seek to meet the requirements of the NPPF  by setting out the uses  
permitted within  town centres  and primary  shopping  areas,  the Town  and Country  Planning  (General  
Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015  allows for certain changes of use to occur without 
the need for  planning  consent.  Whilst  it is recognised  that this provides  some  flexibility  in the re-use 
of units, there is a  concern that some changes may interrupt active frontages in town centres or 
cause  an over -proliferation  of non-retail  uses  affecting  the character,  and vitality  and viability  of town  
centres. There is therefore a need to monitor the mix of uses in town  centres.  
 The NPPF requires planning policies to guard against the unnecessary loss of valued facilities and 
services  such as local shops , particularly where this would reduce the community’s ability to meet 
its day -to-day needs.  Historically,  shops  and other  A-class uses  provide  an active  street  frontage, 
contributing  towards  a lively  street  scene  and often  meeting  an important  need  whilst  maintaining 
their primarily retail  role. 
Evidence Base  
 While a wide range of uses are located in the Borough's town centres, their primary function is 
shopping  and this should  remain  the principal  land use, especially  at ground  floor level.  The town 
centres provide a strong local identity, and it is important to continue to maintain their status as 
important shopping ar eas and centres of employment. Defined town centre boundaries ensure that 
town centre uses are focused in areas where there are the best opportunities for linked trips and for 
access by public transport, cycling and  walking.  
 In order for town centres to be  successful and competitive, they must provide customer choice and 
a diverse retail offer. A review of the extent of the Borough's town centres and their primary 
shopping areas, including the primary and secondary frontages, was undertaken and reported in 
the Basildon Borough Shopping Frontage Review and Changes to Town Centre Boundaries (2015).  
The recommendations of this are reflected on the Policies  Map.  
 Primary shopping areas are defined areas within town centres where retail development is 
concentrated , generally comprising the primary and secondary frontages. Primary shopping 
frontages  will have  a high proportion  of Class  A1 uses  (retail),  while  secondary  shopping  frontages 
provide opportunities in centres for a greater diversity of  uses.  
 In order to protect and promote the primary retail function of the town centres, the review 
recommends  that a target  of at least  75% of all units  in the primary  shopping  frontages  of Basildon 
Town Centre be occupied by A1 uses. Basildon Town Centre, being a Regional C entre has a large 
primary shopping area, with a primary shopping frontage that is dominated by a range of national 
multiple retailers and currently achieves this proportion of A1 provision. Within the smaller town 
centres in the Borough, namely Billericay,  Pitsea and Wickford , current levels of A1 uses within the 
primary shopping frontage are around 60%. This has allowed for a mix of retail and evening uses  to 
arise  in these  centres  to the benefit  of the vitality  of these  centres.  Consequently,  a lower target of 
60% is to be set for these centres to limit further loss of retail from within the town centres’ core 
areas and provide the flexibility required to ensure that this successful mix with low vacancy rates 
is maintained. As development and occ upier details are yet to be established for Laindon Town 
Centre, the designation of primary and shopping secondary frontages has not been carried forward 
into policy as it is considered premature to identify primary and secondary shopping frontages. This 
will be kept under review as the centre is regenerated to inform a future review of the Local P lan.   
62 
 Whilst it is important that a critical mass of retail  uses  is maintained  within  the primary  shopping  
area,  a more  flexible  approach  is taken  within the seco ndary shopping frontages where a range of 
other town centre uses such as restaurants, cinemas  and businesses  may otherwise  be appropriate.  
This is particularly  important  for Basildon  Town Centre which is expected to increase its leisure 
provision considerably over the plan  period.  
 Town centre areas located outside primary shopping areas generally contain a much greater variety 
of uses and therefore, a much more flexible approach to the change of use will be encouraged. 
This includes a change of use  to residential in appropriate locations, where it would not result in an 
unreasonable break, or dominance in the shopping  frontage.  
Policy R7  
Town Centre Boundaries  
 The location and extent of the Borough's town centres are shown on the Policies Map.  Land  within  
the town  centre  boundaries  will be retained  for the ongoing  provision  of town  centre  uses  appropriate 
to a town centre, including retailing, offices, leisure and community facilities, and residential (where 
it contributes to the viability and vitali ty of the town centre).  
 Proposals for development within the town centre boundaries will be permitted  where:  
a. The use and scale is consistent with the role and function of the town centre;  and 
b. It is consistent  with the Borough's  spatial  strategy  and all other  relevant  policy 
requirements of  this plan.  
 For proposals within Primary Shopping Areas, development above ground floor level  will be 
encouraged where there will be no adverse impact on the functioning of the ground floor retail  or 
other beneficial  use, to the extent that it would make a ground floor units unviable.  
Policy R8  
Primary Shopping Frontages  
 Within  the Primary  Shopping  Frontages , as defined  on the Policies  Map,  the change  of use of ground 
floor premises from Class A1 uses (shops) to other town centre uses will be permitted provided  the 
proposed use will provide a service to visiting members of the public and  would:  
a. Make a positive contribution to the vitality and viability of the town  centre;  
b. Not result  in the net loss of retail  floorspace  at a scale  that would  result  in the proportion  of 
A1 retail uses at ground floor level (taking account of any unimplemented planning 
permissions)  falling below :  
i. 75% in Basildon Town Centre;  or 
ii. 60% in Billericay, Pitsea or Wickford Town Centres.  
c. Not fragme nt any part of the Primary Shopping Frontage by creating 3 or more non -A1 
uses together;  
d. Be compatible with the retail appearance and character of the frontage;  and 
e. In the case  of uses  that would  not create  an active  frontage,  a window  display  or other  
frontage appropriate to the centre would be  provided.  
 The beneficial  temporary use of vacant  units  will be encouraged  where  it would  maintain  or enhance  
the function of the town centre, having regard to both their number within the centre as a whole and 
the primary shopping frontage, and the length of time the unit has been  vacant.  
Policy R9  
Secondary Shopping Frontages  
 Within the Secondary Shopping Frontages , as defined on the Policies Map, the use of ground floor 
premises for retail and other appropriate town centre uses will be permitted, provided the proposed 
use will provide a service to visiting members of the public and  would:  
a. Make a positive contribution to the vitality and viability of the  centre;  
b. Not result  in the net loss of retail  floorspace  at a scale  that would  result  in the proportion  of  
 
63 A1 retail uses at ground floor level (taking  account  of other  unimplemented  planning 
permissions) falling below 30% which is justified as necessary to support the continued  
retail  function  of that frontage  zone ; 
c. Be compatible with the retail appearance and character of the frontage;  and 
d. In the case  of uses  that would  not create  an active  frontage,  a window  display  or other  
frontage appropriate to the centre would be  provided.  
 The Council  will give consideration  to the provision  of community  facilities  within  secondary  frontages, 
where  it can be demonstrated  that these  will provide  a service  to visiting  members  of the public  and 
would support the vitality and viability of the town  centre.  
 
Policy R10: Local Centres  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  focuses primarily on town centres although the Glossary at Annex 2 does state that 
references to town centres or centres applies to city centres, town centres, district centres and local  
centres.  However  this excludes  small  parades  of shops  of purely  neighbourhood  significance.  
 The NPPF  expects planning policies to aim for a balance of uses within an area so that people can 
be encouraged to minimise journey lengths for a range of activities, one of which being shopping. 
The p rovision of localised shopping centres in smaller settlements and neighbourhoods of the 
larger settlements supports this  aim. 
Evidence Base  
 There  have  been  numerous  retail  studies  undertaken  that have  examined  the Borough's  shopping 
provision and centre hierarchy. The most recent study on local centres, the Basildon Borough Local 
Centres Review , identified 39 local centres across the Borough. These centres positively contribute 
towards the high levels of accessibility to serv ices, facilities, amenities and, most importantly,  
shopping  opportunities  within  the Borough.  Most  local centres  were  identified  as having good  transport  
links by being  easily  accessible  on foot, on a main  bus route  or providing  car parking facilities. Man y 
also have integrated community facilities, public houses, and are within close proximity to health  
facilities.  
 The Council considers the Borough’s  local centres as an important element of its retail and leisure 
strategy and therefore seeks to safeguard t hem in order to ensure availability of essential local 
shopping facilities, providing for day -to-day needs to all residents within reasonable walking 
distance. This is particularly important for the less mobile members of the community and those 
who may  not wish to travel far. For this reason, in the following policy the Council’s approach is not 
to permit proposals which would lead to the proportion of Class A1 uses within local centres falling 
below 50%.  
 New development of retail and appropriate uses wi ll be encouraged in these local centres where it  
is commensurate  in scale  with the size, role and function  of the specific  centre.  Appropriate  uses that 
the Council may permit are those that meet community, health or social needs (nurseries, doctor’s 
and d entist surgeries, police shops, arts and cultural uses,  etc.).  
 New local centres will also be created, where necessary, as part of the larger strategic housing 
allocations  to ensure the  new communities  are sustainable  and can still flourish  where  there  are no 
existing  local centres within close proximity. Once a new local centre is established, criteria 1 and 2 
of policy R10 will be applicable should any change of use within the local centre be  proposed.  
Policy R10  
Local Centres  
 Within local centres, as def ined on the Policies Map  and listed in Appendix 4, the Council will only 
permit changes of use  at ground floor level from an existing Class A1 retail use  where:  
a. Class  A1 (retail)  will continue  to be the predominant  use within  the local centre  boundary,   
64 taking into account unimplemented planning permissions for changes of  use; 
b. The shop unit has been proactively and appropriately marketed for a minimum of one 
calendar year and it has been demonstrated that  there  is no realistic  prospect  of the unit 
being  used for A1 retail  purposes  in the foreseeable future;  
c. The proposal meets the needs of residents within the local  neighbourhood;  
d. Other  essential  shops  which  meet  the day to day needs  of the community  are within  400 
metres walking distance from the centre of  the local  centre;  
e. The proposal  will not have  an adverse  effect  on the vitality  and viability  of the centre  as a 
whole and/or on the individual shop unit;  and 
f. A shop front is retained or  provided.  
 Residential, business or community uses of the upper floors  of units within local centres will be 
encouraged where there will be no adverse impact on the functioning of the ground floor retail  or 
other appropriate  use and where adequate parking and servicing arrangements can be put in place.  
 The Council will suppo rt the establishment of a new local centre where the following criteria  are 
satisfied:  
a. The need for a local centre is identified in the relevant strategic housing allocation policy 
in this Local P lan; 
b. The new centre  will not have  an adverse  effect  on the vitality  and viability  of an existing  
centre;  
c. A minimum of 3 units are provided;  and 
d. At least 50% of the total number of units are for retail (Class A1) use.  
 
Policy R11: Out of Centre Retail Areas  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF expects local planning authorities to allocate  a range  of suitable  sites to meet  the scale  
and type of retail  and other  town  centres  uses  needed  in town  centres.  Where  sufficient  land is not 
available  within  town  centres  to accommodate  this, then other accessible locations should be 
identified that are well connected to town  centres.  
 The Glossary  at Annex  2 of the NPPF  also provides  guidance  on the status  of existing  out of centre 
locations  comprising  or including  main  town  centre  uses.  It states  that they do not constitute  town 
centres unless they are identified as centres in Local  Plans.  
Evidence Base  
 Not all of the retail provision in the Borough is concentrated in the network of town centres. In 
common  with elsewhere  in the country,  the town  centres  compete  for expenditure  with retail  parks, 
freestanding retail warehouses and large format out of centre convenience goods floorspace. 
Typically  these  areas  offer ‘bulky  goods’  retailing,  such  as DIY goods  and furniture,  however  there 
has been an increasi ng demand from ‘high street’ retailers to relocate to these out of centre 
locations.  
 Whilst the retail provision at these locations often compliments the retail offer in the town centre 
and provides  floorspace  for retailers  that may be less suited  within  a town  centre  location,  they do 
pose  a risk to the vitality  of town  centres  where  they compete  to attract  the same  consumer  market. 
The Council  recognises  their important  contribution  to the retail  provision  in the Borough,  however 
they are not considered  to be centres  and do not form part of the hierarchy  of centres  (Table  8.1). 
The Council's  priority  is to ensure  the viability  and vitality  of the Borough's  town  centres,  therefore 
proposals for new retail parks and out of centre shopping areas or extensions to existing out of 
centre shopping areas will be discouraged in favour of town centre  locations.  
 There are six out of centre shopping areas within the Borough which are concentrated in the 
Basildon urban area (incorporating Pitsea and Laindon). They range in scale, size and the type of  
goods  being  sold with the majority  providing  a mix of convenience  and comparison  goods.  Out of  
centre  shopping  areas  account  for a large  proportion  of the overall  market  share  for convenience 
goods within Basildon and the two main retail parks of Pipps Hill and Mayflower have a strong  
 
65 market share in comparison  goods.  
Policy R11  
Out of Centre Retail Areas  
 There  are six out of centre  shopping  areas  in the Borough,  as identified  on the Policies  Map.  These 
are: 
a. Pipps Hill Retail Park,  Basildon  
b. Mayflower Retail Park,  Basildon  
c. Cricketers Way Retail Park, Basildon  
d. Vange Retail Park,  Basildon  
e. Hazelmere,  Pitsea  
f. Mandeville Way,  Laindon  
 The Council will only support further development, including the expansion and intensification of the 
shopping  area in these  locations,  where  sequential  and impact  assessments  have  indicated  that it is 
appropriate to do so.  
 
Policy R12: Festival Leisure Pa rk and Surroundings  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects local planning authorities to allocate a range of suitable sites to meet a range of 
needs including leisure needs. The guidance in the Glossary of the NPPF  on the  status  of existing  
out of centre  location s applies  to out of centre  leisure  parks  in the same  way it  applies  to out of 
centre  shopping  areas.  ‘Out of centre’ is identified as a location not in or on the edge of a centre but 
not necessarily outside the urban area.  Unless  an out of centre  location  is identified  as a centre in 
the Local Plan it does not constitute a town  centre.  
Evidence Base  
 Festival Leisure Park is a large purpose -built out of town leisure destination within the Basildon 
urban area, which includes a cinema, a family dining offer, and complementary leisure uses. It is 
the single biggest family entertainment venue for residents in the Borough and also has a wider 
presence in the leisure  market.  
 While  the centre  has no stand -alone  cafes,  the range  of restaurants  available  is considered  to be 
varied with the majority being A3 units. They include mid -range, family -oriented restaurants  such as  
Nandos,  Pizza  Express,  Harvester  and TGI Fridays.  In terms  of family  entertainment  the Leisure Park  
offers  the only cinema  within  the Borough,  which  is an 18-screen  multiplex  and the Borough's only 
bowling facility. There is also childrens’ play centre, a wake -boarding centre, hotel accommodation 
and a  nightclub. In the vicinity, there is also a David Lloyd Leisure Centre and a go -karting centre.   
 The Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  found that the Leisure Park draws 
trade for dining  and leisure activities from across the whole of the Borough and beyond. It accounts 
for nearly  a third  of all spending  by residents  within  the urban  area of Basildon  on restaurants  and 
contributes to  the high leakage  of spending  away  from Basildon  Town Centre.  The study  also 
reported  that the cinema  complex  at Festival  Leisure  Park occupies  a monopolistic  position,  and its 
location  means that there is no scope for any of the Borough’s town centres to benefit from the 
popularity of this facility in terms of linked trips to cafes, restaurants or shopping within the  centres.  
 In conclusion the study recommended that expansion or intensification of facilitie s at Festival 
Leisure Park, or other out of centre commercial leisure floorspace, should be  discouraged and such 
opportunities should instead be focused to the town centres.  
 
 
 
  
66 Policy R12  
Festival Leisure Park and Surroundings  
The Council will only suppor t the expansion or intensification of facilities at Festival Leisure Park and its 
surroundings , as identified  on the Policies  Map,  if the sequential  and impact  assessments  have  robustly justified  
that it is appropriate to do  so. 
 
Policy R13: Locations for Hotel/Visitor Accommodation  
Policy Context  
 Tourism development is identified as a main town centre uses and l ocal planning  authorities  are 
required  through  the NPPF  to allocate  suitable  sites that meet the scale and type of development 
need ed in the town centre. Where there isn't an  appropriate  site within  the town  centre  the local 
planning  authority  should  set policies  for meeting the identified need in appropriate edge of centre 
sites and then in other accessible locations that are well conn ected to the town  centre.  
 It is recognised  that there  may be certain  circumstances  where  physical  or other  constraints  mean 
that it isn't appropriate  to locate  tourism  development  within  the town centre.  In those  circumstances, the 
PPG  recommends that local planning authorities  plan positively  to identify  the most  appropriate  
alternative  strategy  for meeting  the need and sets out the considerations for  tourism.  
Evidence Base  
 There  are eight  hotels  operating  within  the Borough,  excluding  Bed and Breakfast,  guesthouse and 
other forms of accommodation, and these are located in or near the Basildon urban area. They 
include national hotel operators such as Premier Inn, Travelodge and Holiday Inn, as well as 
independent hotel operators such as  those at Friern Manor Country House Hotel and the Old 
Rectory.  The majority  of these  hotels  provide  ancillary  on-site facilities  in the form of function  suites for 
business conferences, general functions and wedding receptions and the majority cater for b oth 
business  and leisure  orientated  tourism.  The Council  also recently  approved  the construction of  a 
hotel  at the Gun Public  House,  Pitsea  (15/00557/FULL ) which  is ancillary  to the existing  facility 
already in place (a public house and function  rooms).  
 The East of England  Tourism's  Regional  Customer  Insight  Programme  (2009 ) identified  Essex  as 
being mainly a short -break destination, particularly for visitors who seek active or activity based 
trips.  According  to the Borough's  Leisure,  Arts, Culture  and Tourist  Accommodation  Study  (2010)  
this is likely  the result  of Essex’s  proximity  to London,  and the desire  of Londoners  to take advantage of, 
in particular outdoor, leisure activities on their doorstep. The Borough is in a more unique position 
because it also has a strong business market with a large concentration of businesses in the 
Basildon  urban  area which  many  of the hotel  operators  serve.  In general,  the larger  hotels,  which 
are predominantly  located  in the Basildon  A127  Enterprise  Corridor,  tend to cater  for the business or  
mixed  business  / leisure  markets  while  the leisure  focused  hotels,  which  are outside  the urban area, 
tend to be small or very small, focusing on the ‘boutique’  market.  
 The Basildon Borough Hotel Futures Study  was commissioned to ensure that the Council puts in 
place an appropriate policy approach in line with future market demand for hotel accommodation in 
the Borough, hotel operator location and site requirements, national planning policy, and to guide 
other Council intervention to support hotel development in the Borough. The need for two new 
large hotels, some smaller scale hotels and possible extensions to existing hotels in Basildon was 
identified in the study as well as potential for some small scale acco mmodation in Billericay and 
Wickford. T wo key broad locations in Basildon  that were considered to be appropriate for large 
hotel development were  Basildon Town Centre , in order to support its regeneration , and the A127 
Enterprise Corridor , to help promote business growth.  Policies R2 and E1 support hotel 
development in these locations.  
 The Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  identified a good provision of mid -
range and budget hotels  across  the Borough,  however  it is recognised  that there  are no higher  tier 
hotels  at present within  the Borough.  An additional,  higher  quality  hotel  or, possibly  a small  (up to 50 
rooms)  country house hotel, or both, subject to demand being present, would provide a greater 
range of accommodation options within the Borough, according to Essex Hotels Futures (2009),  an  
 
67 Essex -wide hotel study. Hotel development within Basildon Town Centre, wh ich would be in line 
with the town -centre -first approach has been considered through the Basildon Town Centre 
Masterplan . A country house style hotel, by its very nature, is likely to be located outside the town 
centre. The Essex -wide study recommended tha t any demand for a country house hotel could be 
met by converting and extending an existing building or group of buildings or by constructing an 
entirely new  facility.  
 Land off Nethermayne, adjacent to Basildon Golf Course and less than 1 mile from Basildo n Town 
Centre has been considered as a suitable location for  delivering some of the  hotel provision within 
the Borough. The site is approximately 2ha in size and located on the edge of the urban area, the 
majority of which is  outside the Green Belt. It is in public ownership and is envisaged that a 
proposed higher grade hotel could support Basildon Golf Course which is adjacent to the site by 
providing an additional amenity that attracts leisure based tourism to the area,  as well as provide  
employment  oppor tunities  for the local community.  It would  be ancillary  to the adjoining leisure  
activity.  
 Consequently, a less prescriptive policy approach was recommended as being better suited for 
land adjacent to Basildon Golf Course in order to support a realistic and viable scheme on the site, 
having regard to evidence. Such a policy would support proposals which recognise the specific 
characteristics of the site, and will seek to promote the development of hotel accommodation 
alongside other supporting services an d/or uses, in line with the Council’s objectives.  
Policy R13  
Locations for Hotel/Visitor Accommodation   
 The provision of a full -service  hotel with conference and function space will be permitted on land 
adjacent to Basildon Golf Course, as defined on the P olicies Map, where the following criteria have 
been met:  
a. The proposal satisfies the sequential test and impact assessment for main town centres 
uses;  
b. The proposal is ancillary to Basildon Golf Course;  
c. The hotel will provide around 100 bedrooms;  
d. Where an ancillary facility such as a function suite is proposed as part of the hotel 
development, the proposal must demonstrate the need for such a facility and that it is 
economically viable;  
e. The design, scale, massing and layout of the proposal is sympathetic to  the character of 
the surrounding area and should be no taller than four storeys; and  
f. All other relevant policies in this plan have been complied with, in particular, those 
policies in  chapter 16 of this plan.  
 The Council will support other new or redevelo ped leisure and/ or operational uses on  the remaining 
part of  land adjacent to Basildon Golf Course where such uses are appropriate in terms of nature, 
scale and location subject to compliance with all other relevant policies of this plan.   
 The Council wil l support additional hotel provision in the Borough’s town centre locations, as well as 
in the A127 Enterprise Corridor alongside , and in support of , business development.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy R14: Locations for Town Centre Uses 
Policy C ontext  
 The Government  supports  a town  centre  first approach  when  locating  development  for town  centre 
uses as this ensures the vitality and viability of centres. As such the  NPPF  requires  local planning 
authorities to apply a sequential test to planning applications for main town centre uses which  are 
neither  in an existing centre nor in accordance with an up -to-date plan . 
 The NPPF also advises local planning authorities to request an impac t assessment for all retail  
68 developments which exceed a locally set floorspace threshold. If the local planning authority has 
not implemented  any local thresholds,  then the default  threshold  of 2,500m2 would apply . 
 The impact assessment should examine the impact of the proposal on existing, committed and 
planned  public  and private  investment  in a centre  or centres  in the catchment  area of the proposal, 
and the impact of the proposal on town centre vitality and viability , including local consumer choice 
and trade in the town centre and wider area.  
 The PPG  provides further guidance in the 'Ensuring the vitality of town centres’ section in  terms of 
the interpretation of the NPPF’s  sequential and impact tests, including how they should be applied 
to both plan -making and  decision -taking.  
Evidence Base  
 To maintain the balance between the role and function of the Borough's regional centre, town 
centres, and local centres, the Council will apply the sequential test and impact assessment  to new 
retail development and main town centre  uses that are not in an existing centre.  
 In line with the NPPF,  proposals for town centre uses should look to locate  within the town centre 
boundaries before considering alternative edge of centre and then out of centre sites.  When  
conside ring proposals  against  the sequential  test, the Council  will refer to the Hierarchy of Centres 
(Table 8.1). This approach is intended to sustain and focus growth and investment in the Borough's 
town centres as well as minimise the need to travel, provide a  diverse range of services in the one 
central location and make facilities accessible to  all. 
 The Council recognises that certain uses have particular locational requirements which means that 
they may only be accommodated in specific locations. Where justi fication of this is  provided, the  
Council  will take locational  requirements  into consideration  when  applying  the sequential  test. As 
stated in PPG,  landownership is not a suitable  justification.  
 The Impact Assessment is required for planning applications for retail, leisure and office 
development outside of town centres to ensure they would not detrimentally impact the function, 
vitality  and viability  of the Borough’s  centres.  The Council  considers  that the national  threshold  of 
2,500  sq.m is not appropria te for the area and has therefore set a local threshold. The Basildon 
Retail and Commercial  Leisure Capacity  Study  considered  the national  threshold  to be too high for 
the Borough  given that units of around 500m2 could meet the requirements for various national 
retailers. The national  threshold  could  therefore  cause  a significant  adverse  impact  on Basildon  and 
other  centres depending on the occupier and location. The study recommended the following  
thresholds:  
 Outside town centres: 500m2  
 Outside local centres: 200m2 
 These should be based on the nearest centre to the proposed site in question and, to avoid 
cumulative developments that exceed this threshold, it is considered that an impact assessment 
should be required if the threshold is breached in any one year by more than one planning 
application.  
 In terms of retail evidence, local planning authorities should use  their evidence base to assess the 
needs for land or floorspace for economic development, includi ng both the quantitative and 
qualitative needs for all foreseeable types of economic activity over the plan period, including for 
retail and leisure development. Therefore, it is considered that the policy recommendations within 
the Basildon Retail and Com mercial Leisure Capacity Study  are justified and based on adequate, 
up to date and relevant evidence about the economic prospects of the Borough.  
 The Impact  Assessment  will be particularly  relevant  to edge  of centre  and out of centre  proposals 
but may also  be applicable to those in an existing centre where the scale of the proposal is not 
considered to be in keeping with the size, role and function of that centre within the hierarchy. In 
assessing vitality and viability consideration will be given to pedest rian flows, vacancy rates, 
numbers  and range  of facilities,  quality  of the urban  environment  and the general  performance  of 
the centre. The Basildon Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  recommends a number of 
locally based considerations for the Im pact Assessment and these form part of the criteria for policy  
R14.   
 
69 Policy R14  
Locations for Town Centre Uses  
 The Council will seek to ensure that retail uses (A1 use class) are predominantly located within  its 
designated town centres. Development and uses  must be appropriate to the scale, character and 
function of the town centre, be in keeping with its role and function within the Borough’s hierarchy of 
centres, and not harm the vitality and viability of the centre as a  whole.  
 A sequential test will be ap plied to planning applications for main town centre uses that are not in an 
existing centre, or where the proposal is not in accordance with the Local P lan. Town centre uses 
should be located in town centres and  then in edge  of centre  locations  and only if suitable  sites are 
not available  will out of centre  sites be  considered.  
 In terms  of proposals  outside  town  centres,  preference  will be given  to accessible  sites that are well 
connected to the town  centre.  
 For out of centre proposals, preference will be g iven to those that are located within the existing out  
of centre shopping areas or Festival Leisure Park.  
 The Council will require an Impact Assessment for applications for retail, leisure and  office 
development outside of town centres  where:  
a. The developme nt is equal  to or more  than the threshold,  as set out below for the nearest 
centre;  or 
b. Where  the threshold  has already  been  breached  within  the last year by more  than one 
planning application.  
Nearest  Centre  Threshold  
Regional Town Centre  500m2 
Town Centre  500m2 
Local Centre  200m2 
 
 The Impact Assessments should include an assessment  of: 
a. The impact of the proposal on existing, committed and planned public and private  
investment in the regional, town and local centres in the catchment area of the proposed  
development;  
b. Individual and cumulative impact of the proposal on the vitality and viability of the  
Borough's centres taking into  consideration:  
i. Its impact on linked trip spending between different town centre uses or  
businesses;  
ii. Its impact on loca l consumer  choice;  
iii. The potential for relocation of businesses currently trading in town centres 
to locations out of  centre;  
iv. The extent to which the market profile of the development proposed will 
compete  with existing facilities in town centres;  and 
v. The im pact through trade diversion on the role and function of a town 
centre up to  five years from the time the application is  made.  
 
Policy R15: Existing Local Shops  
Policy Context  
 There  is no specific  policy  in the NPPF  in relation  to local shops  which  are located  outside  centres. 
However, the NPPF  expects planning policies to aim for a balance of uses within an area so that 
people can be encouraged to minimise journey lengths for a range of activities, one of which is  
70 shopping. Local shops located within ex isting communities support this  aim. 
 In addition, the NPPF  requires planning policies to plan positively for the retention and 
development of local services  and community facilities such as local shops to enhance the 
sustainability of communities and resid ential environments.  
Evidence Base  
 The Basildon Borough Local Centres Review identified numerous locations of two shop units or 
less across the Borough which didn't constitute local centre status, but which provide convenience 
goods shopping for local comm unities in the urban and rural areas. As such, the Council will 
protect existing local shops in areas outside the Borough's centres from other forms  of development  
(such  as residential  conversions)  where  there  remains a need for the provision of the local service in 
the area.  
Policy R15  
Existing Local Shops  
Development  proposing  the change  of use or loss of any premises  or land currently  or last used  as a local shop  
(A1 use class)  outside  of the defined town centre or local centre boundaries will be permitted subject to 
compliance with policy HC11 and all other relevant polic y requirements  of this plan.  
 
Policy R16: Hot Food Takeaways  
Policy Context  
 Amongst  other  things,  local planning  authorities  are required  to promote  a diverse  retail  offer and 
make clear which uses should be permitted in town centre locations and other shopping areas. The  
NPPF  further  acknowledges  that local planning  authorities  should  promote  healthy  communities, use 
evidence to assess health and well-being  needs and work with public health leads and 
organisations.  
 The NPPF  identifies the important role that planning can play in facilitating social interaction and  
creating  healthy,  inclusive  communities.  In drawing  up Local  Plans,  local planning  authorities should  
pursue  policies  to support  the vitality  and viability  of town  centres  and deliver social, recreational and 
cultural facilities and services the community needs. Planning policies and decisions should take 
account of and support local strategies to improve health  and well-being  for all and local planning  
authorities should work with public health officers and health organisations to understand and take 
account of the health status and needs of the local popu lation and the barriers to improving health 
and well -being.  
Evidence Base  
 Hot food takeaways are now a common feature of town centres, high streets, and local centres 
because they fulfil an increasing demand for instant food access and convenience. Traditi onally, 
hot food takeaways (A5 use class) differ in purpose from restaurants or cafés (A3 use class), 
however,  some  businesses  classified  as restaurants  (A3 use class)  also offer takeaway  services. 
This is the case for many fast food restaurants, and also for many restaurants serving Indian or 
Chinese style cuisine. This increased proliferation of hot food takeaways over recent decades is 
reducing  the diversity  of retail  offer,  as well as having  significant  influence  over food consumption 
patterns.  
 Hot food  takeaways can contribute towards unhealthy lifestyles. Research shows that increased 
exposure and opportunity to buy fast food (including proximity and opening hours) results in 
increased consumption levels which can have negative effects on health. This is because some hot 
food takeaways offer energy -dense food with high levels of saturated fat, sugar, salt and 
preservatives which are linked to obesity and related health  conditions.  
 England has one of the highest rates of obesity in Europe and in the deve loped world. The 
Department of Health report Healthy Lives, Healthy People (2010) acknowledges o besity is one of 
the most widespread threats to health and well-being  in the country and that there is a link between  
 
71 excess body weight and diseases such as ty pe 2 diabetes, cancer and heart  disease.  
 The Marmot Review (2010)  highlighted a social gradient in health which is related to  deprivation. 
The National Obesity Observatory has also found that there is a strong association between 
deprivation and the densit y of fast food outlets, with more deprived areas having more fast food 
outlets per population. A report on the implications for spatial planning arising from the Marmot 
Review noted that deprived areas could particularly benefit from policies which aim to improve 
availability  of healthier  food options  and better  access  to shopping  facilities,  coupled  with planning 
restrictions to control the density of fast food  outlets.  
 The Hot Food Takeaway Assessment (2015)  draws together information about the impact of hot 
food takeaway  shops  in Basildon  and provides  the evidence  base  for this policy.  The report  details 
the national and local health concerns, associated existing evidence and how this policy can 
support health  improvements.  
 Obesity  prevalence  in the Borough  is significantly  greater  than regional  and national  rates  according to  
the Basildon  Joint  Strategic  Needs  Assessment  (JSNA)  (2012)  produced  to support  Clinical 
Commissioning Groups (CCG) . The Basildon  and Brentwood  CCG  has identified  within  their 
Strategic  Prevention  Implementation  Plan 2014 -2019  a need to focus on some actions to reduce 
obesity within the area, and considers that planning services in the Borough may have a role to 
play in reducing obesity through better control of the location, pr evalence and proliferation of hot 
food takeaways. There is therefore scope, within the context of national planning policy and wider 
policy related to health and well-being , to consider the role the local plan could play in reducing  
obesity.  
 In particular,  childhood obesity is a growing threat to children’s health. Obese children are more 
likely  than children  of a healthy  weight  to become  an obese  adult  with associated  health  problems 
later in life. The Council considers that restricting children’s access to takeaway shops can act  to 
discourage unhealthy eating and seek to stop the rising levels of obesity in the  Borough.  
 The Hot Food Takeaway Assessment  reveals that there are 186 registered hot food takeaway 
shops across the Borough, including mobile food units. This does not however include those 
restaurants also offering takeaway services, ancillary to their main operation. According to the 2007 
Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) rankings, Basildon Borough is ranked 136th of 354 authorities 
nationally,  and 5th within Essex for overall deprivation. Deprivation at Lower Super Output Area 
(LSOA) highlights the level of diversity and inequality that exists within the  Borough, with  some  
areas  experiencing  high levels  of deprivation,  and others  very low levels. Given  national and  local 
concerns  about  the impact  of hot food takeaways  on human  health,  and the combination of an over -
concentration of takeaway shops and high levels of deprivation, there is therefore a clear  basis  for 
seeking  to limit further  increases  in the provision  of hot food takeaways  in the Borough.  
Policy R16  
Hot Food Takeaways  
 Applicati ons for new hot food takeaways  falling  within  the A5 use class  will be supported,  subject  to 
compliance with all other relevant policies of this plan, where the following thresholds are not 
exceeded:  
a. Within town centres, no more than 10% of shop units should comprise hot food  
takeaways;  
b. Within  local centres  comprising  6 or less shop  units,  no more  than 50% of the shop  units  
should comprise hot food  takeaways;  
c. Within  local centres  comprising  7 to 14 shop  units,  no more  than 30% of the shop  units  
should comprise hot food takeaways;  and 
d. Within local centres comprising 15 or more units, no more than 20% of the shop units  
should comprise hot food  takeaway s. 
 New hot  food takeaway  shops  will only be permitted when they fall  outside  400 metres  of the 
boundary  of new and existing schools,  colleges,  and youth centres. Exceptions will apply to retail, 
town and local centre locations within this 400 metre buffer zone, subject to compliance with all 
other relevant policies of this plan.   
72 
 Outside designated centres, and in areas where the residential character  of an area predominates, 
no more than two A5 units should be located adjacent to each other.  
 This policy will also apply to applications to relax or vary conditions to allow hot food  takeaway 
facilities in conjunction with existing restaurants, cafés and other hospitality  uses.  
 
Policy R17: Betting Offices  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  emphasises  that the purpose  of the planning  system  is to contribute  towards  sustainable 
development.  Improving  health,  social  and cultural  well-being  for all and deliver ing sufficient  
community  and cultural facilities and services to meet local  needs  supports this goal . 
 Town centres are recognised as being integral to meeting local need and supporting well-being . 
The NPPF  states that local planning authorities should recognis e town centres as the heart of their 
communities and pursue policies to support their viability and vitality. Local planning authorities 
should set out policies that make clear which uses will be permitted in such locations, and promote 
competitive town ce ntres that provide a diverse retail offer which reflects the  individuality  of a town  
centre.   
 Licensing authorities are required to publish a Statement of Gambling Policy at least every three 
years, under the Gambling Act 2005 . Basildon Council has a polic y for granting licensing, which 
was reviewed i n 2016, following amendment to g uidance issued by the Gambling Commission. The 
Gambling Licensing Policy Statement (2016 ) is a statement of the principles the Council applies 
when deciding to approve or reject license applications for casinos and other gambling outlets. 
Paragraph 4.3 of the Gambling Licensing Policy Statement  specifically states that Basildon Council 
will pay particular attention to the protection of children and vulnerable persons from being ha rmed 
or exploited by gambling, as well as issues of crime and disorder. Paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5 also 
make reference to the new requirements introduced by the Gambling Commission in April 2016 
with regards to assessing local risk.  
Evidence Base  
 As a conseque nce of changes to the Use Classes Order in 2015, betting offices are considered as  
‘Sui Generis’,  therefore  not falling  within  any given  use class.  Planning  permission  is therefore 
required for change of use of a premises to a betting office unless the premises is already in  that 
use. This change in legislation stemmed from the Mary Portas High Street Review (2011) which 
recommended putting betting offices into a separate use class under the planning system. This 
change received overwhelming support when  subject to consultation in 2014. The Government has 
made it clear that this change is intended to provide local authorities with an opportunity to consider  
and, if appropriate  refuse,  any application  for a new betting  office  where  the proliferation of bet ting 
offices in town centres has  arisen.  
 There are around 9,000 betting offices in the UK and the Government estimates that there are 
approximately 593,000 problem gamblers. Problem gambling is seen as a health disorder and it is 
defined as ‘gambling that compromises, disrupts or damages family, employment, personal or 
recreational pursuits’. As well as negatively affecting health, the British Medical Journal (2012)  also 
found that problem gambling can lead to debt and possibly crime to fund further gamblin g activities.  
 The British  Medical  Association  Board  of Science  (2007)  found  that availability  of opportunities  to 
gamble  and the incidence  of problem  gambling  within  a community  were  linked.  The characteristics 
that often  facilitate  and encourage  people  to gamble  in the first place  are primarily  features  of the 
environment, such as location of the gambling venue and the number of venues in a specified area.  
These  variables  may be important  in both the initial  decision  to gamble  and the maintenance of the 
behaviour. Therefore it is important to limit the clusters of betting offices in any given area to 
reduce the negative connotations associated with betting  offices.  
 As with healthy eating and obesity, gambling is linked to deprivation. There are areas with in the 
Borough that are more deprived, and consequently areas where residents are more susceptible to 
the risks and impacts of gambling. The 2010 British Gambling Prevalence Survey  found  that at-risk  
 
73 gambling  and problem  gambling  were  associated  with areas  of deprivation,  and poor levels of 
educational attainment. There are also links to  ethnicity.  
 In addition to the impacts on health and well-being , and consequential impacts for community 
safety,  the prevalence  of betting  offices  displaces  other  high street  uses  and impacts  on the vitality of  
designated  town and local centres.  The clustering  of betting  offices  can also create  an intimidating 
environment and detracts from the high street  ambiance.  
 There  are currently  24 betting  offices  located  within  the Borough  and it is important  to ensure  future 
betting  offices  are not clustered  together  where  they could  have  negative  health  impacts,  or cause 
harm to the vitality and viability of town and local  centres.  
Policy R17  
Betting offices  
In addition to the principles set out in the Council’s  Gambling Licensing Policy Statement , proposals for new 
betting offices will not be permitted if they fall within 400m of any existing permitted betting office.

 Promoting Sustainable Transport  
STRATEGIC  POLICIES  
Policy T1: Transport Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF expects  local planning authorities to actively manage patterns of growth to maximise the 
use of public transport, walking and cycling, and to focus significant development in locations which 
are, or can be made, sustainable.  
 With regard  to transport  policy,  the NPPF  expects  local planning  authorities  to set out policies  that 
facilitate sustain able development by giving people a real choice about how they travel. Policies 
should  create  a transport  system  that promotes  sustainable  transport  modes,   Different policies and 
measures will be required to maximise the use of sustainable transport modes in rural and urban 
areas.  
 Local planning authorities are also ex pected to work  collaboratively  with neighbouring  authorities  and 
relevant  transport  authori ties and providers  to develop  strategies  for the provision  of viable transport 
infrastructure necessary to support sustainable  development.  
 Essex County Council , as the local Highway s Authority , is responsible for the management and 
maintenance of all adop ted roads within the Borough. Essex County Council is therefore 
responsible for transport planning within the Borough . 
 The Essex Transport Strategy  sets out an overall vision for transport provision in Essex. It aims to 
deliver “a transport system which su pports sustainable economic growth and helps deliver the best 
quality of life for the residents of Essex”. In order to deliver this vision, the strategy  seeks to 
achieve five broad  outcomes:  
1. Provide  connectivity for Essex communities and international gateways to support 
sustainable economic growth and regeneration;  
2. Reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve air quality through lifestyle changes, 
innovation and technology;  
3. Improve safety on the tran sport network and enhance and promote a safe travelling 
environment;  
4. Secure and maintain all transport assets to an appropriate standard and ensure that the 
network is available for use; and  
5. Provide sustainable access and travel choice for Essex residents to help create 
sustainable communities.  
 Essex  is a diverse  county  with different  sub-areas  that have  different  needs  and issues  with regards to 
continued and future transport provision. The Thames Gateway South Essex sub -area, which 
Basildon Borough is loc ated can become heavily congested, particularly at peak periods. The 
Essex  Transport  Strategy  therefore  identifies  a specific  suite  of priorities  for South  Essex  that aims to 
promote more sustainable modes of transport that support economic growth ambition s. These 
priorities  are: 
 Providing for and promoting access by sustainable modes of travel to new development 
areas;  
 Improving public transport links within and between the Thames Gateway towns 
(including the A13 Passenger Transport Corridor and other enhanced public transport 
schemes);  
 Improving the availability of sustainable travel choices and raising public awareness of 
these through travel planning;  
 Addressing maintenance, signing and broken links in the cycle network to improve 
conditions for cycl ists and create a safer environment for cycling;  
 Improving the attractiveness and ease of use of public spaces to support regeneration; 
Improving journey time reliability on strategic inter -urban routes including the A127, A129, 
A130 and A13; and  
 Improving  access to London Gateway Port and London Southend Airport.   
 
75 
 Whilst Essex County Council is the local Highway A uthority for Basildon, and also Castle Point and 
Rochford, Southend -on-Sea and Thurrock are both unitary authorities responsible for their own  
highways  matters.  Consequently,  transport  planning  in South  Essex  requires  a greater  degree of 
coordination than in other areas. Joint working through the South Essex Growth Partnership, and 
previously through the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership, helps  to provide this 
coordination,  and also helps  to identify  infrastructure  investment  priorities  for the area which  help to 
support growth and the delivery of strategic infrastructure projects in the wider area. More recently, 
a Strategic Transport Board has  been established for South Essex which also includes private 
sector transport providers such as the rail operators, the ports and the airport. There is also 
ongoing engagement with bus operators. This interaction with the private sector is important for 
delivering improvements to sustainable transport  modes.  
 Since  2011,  and in relation  to Basildon  Borough , the Essex  Transport  Strategy  has secured  major  
investment into the Borough’s transport network including the new £63m junction upgrade o n the 
A13/A130 at Sadlers Farm (completed 2013) and the £5m highway works to improve capacity in 
the A127 Enterprise Corridor (completed 2011). More recently, £3m pinch -point funding from the 
Department for Transport (DfT) was secured to widen a key part o f the A176 between Basildon 
Hospital and Basildon Town Centre, to support expansion of the Town Centre and address 
congestion of this  link. 
 Funding  has also been  secured  from SELEP  to fund various  improvements  along  the A127  Corridor 
including £27m for imp rovements to the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange. A further £13m has also 
been secured for the Basildon Integrated Transport Package which will help deliver public transport 
improvements,  highway  changes  required  by the Basildon  Town  Centre  Masterplan  and improved 
access to Basildon  Hospital.  
 Whilst  Essex  County  Council  is the local Highway  Authority,  Highways  England  is responsible  for 
the strategic highway network including the M25 and parts of the A13 in the neighbouring borough 
of Thurrock. Following a route consultation which took place from 26 January to 24 March 2016, in 
April 2017 the Secretary of State for Transport announced the preferred route  for a Lower Thames 
Crossing. The Lower Thames Crossing is identified as a priority for investment in the National 
Infrastructure Plan,  and will form part of the strategic highway network providing congestion relief 
and additional  capacity to  the existing  Dartford  river crossings.  Highways  England  will be consulting  
on the preferred route  for the Lower Thames Crossing in early 201 8, following the route 
announcement  and responding to the consultation feedback from local authori ties, Highways England  
have been modelling the impact of the Lower Thames Crossing on various highway routes across the 
South East, including South Essex and North Kent. It is therefore  necessary  for Basildon Council to 
continue to work closely with Highways England, Essex County Council and its neighbouring 
authorities to ensure that in addition to the maximising the opportunitie s the crossing presents, any 
challenges arising from the Lower Thames Crossing to the local transport network are fully 
addressed. The application for the Development Consent Order will be submitted to the Planning 
Inspectorate’s National Significant  Infrastructure Project process in 2019 , with approval expected in 
late 2020 or early 2021. The Lower Thames Crossing is then expected to open to traffic in 2027 
subject to planning consent and finance arrangements.  
 At a local level,  the Borough's  Community  Strategy aligns  with the NPPF  and the Essex  Transport 
Strategy in so far as it envisages high quality public transport as the main way of getting around the  
Borough,  helping  to reduce  congestion  and giving  people  easier  access  to schools,  jobs,  shops, health 
and other key facilities.  
Evidence Base  
 The Borough is an important  area for employment  and economic  growth  within  South  Essex  and 
Essex more generally. Furthermore, the A127 runs through the heart of the Borough acting both as 
a local connection, and also  as a strategic route into London. The A13 fulfils similar functions and is 
located to the south of the Borough. In this context, the Publication Local Plan Transport and 
Highway Impact Assessment (THIA) (2018)  shows that parts of the highway network in th e 
Borough already operate at, or near capacity, making it more vulnerable to congestion incidents. 
Such incidents quickly impact on other routes resulting in significant queue lengths at some 
junctions, and results in unreliable journey times for car and p ublic transport users. It found 
particular capacity issues with the strategic west -east routes of the A127 and the A13, and their 
junctions.   
76 
 Detailed junction modelling of the highway network in the Borough was prepared for the Council in 
partnership with Essex County Council to understand the implications that growth within the 
Borough, and also growth arising from outside the Borough, could have on the existing highway 
network in the  Borough. The modelling consists of a highway impact assessment , which has 
evolved through the emerging iterations of the Local Plan, to assess the impact of future growth on 
the highway network, followed by mitigation modelling to determine whether or not improvements 
to the highway network could be brought forward t o effectively manage the increased level of traffic 
anticipated for the future year 2034. The latest findings of the modelling are set out in the 
Publication Local Plan THIA . The highway modelling includes various scenarios that have been 
tested in 2011, 2 014 and 2018, with the latest version providing a VISUM model which provides 
total coverage of the Borough and strategic junctions outside the Borough to gain a full 
understanding of the impacts of additional traffic associated with specific growth locatio ns 
contained in this Local Plan.  
 The results of the Publication Local Plan THIA  showed that significant parts of the road  network in  
the Borough  would  operate  at or above  capacity  as a consequence  of growth.  In particular,  most of 
the existing junctions in  both Billericay and Wickford are shown to be over capacity in future years 
as a consequence of the levels of growth proposed in this plan. Both improvements to the highway 
network, and a modal shift towards more sustainable travel modes is therefore requi red in both of 
these settlements to enable further growth without exacerbating congestion  levels.  
 Basildon (including Laindon and Pitsea), being a planned settlement with a more generous road 
layout,  is more  able to accommodate  growth  within  the existing  road network.  Nonetheless,  there 
are still likely to be capacity issues a t some junctions which would need to be improved in order to 
accommodate projected growth. Improvements to the highway network within Basildon  should be 
accompanied by enhancements to opportunities for travel by walking and other sustainable modes 
such as cycling and public transport, particularly given  the reasonably  close  proximity  of the 
population  to jobs and services,  and also as a response to relatively higher population densities  and 
business clustering which make public transport services more  viable.  
 As a result of the Publication Local Plan THIA  showing a significant need for mitigation in order to  
accommodate  the growth  proposed  in this plan,  the Council  worked  with Essex  Coun ty Council to  
identify  and appraise  a series  of mitigation  measures  for each  settlement,  with a focus  on those 
junctions and routes where capacity was expected to be particularly impacted by growth. The 
mitigation modelling within the Publication Local Plan THIA  assessed which mitigation measures 
could be implemented to improve capacity and reduce congestion caused by future development 
within each settlement. High  level costings  were  also calculated  for each  mitigation  measure  in order  
to determine  whet her the transport proposals are deliverable in the context of the level of 
development proposed. The costing information will also assist in ensuring that development 
contributes towards the delivery of the mitigation required to support  growth.  
 The result s of the mitigation modelling for Billericay  and Wickford  show that  the majority of  the 
major  junctions  in these  settlements  could  be improved  to accommodate  the levels  of growth 
proposed. However, currently three junctions out of seventeen tested experience capacity issues 
and following mitigation of the road network after the Local Plan’s growth is taken into 
consideration, a total of five junctions would have capacity iss ues at morning or evening peak times 
emphasising  the need for  a more  strategic  approach  to mitigation  is needed and also a shift towards  
more  sustainable  travel  modes.  
 Meanwhile , the mitigation modelling  for the south of the Borough also showed that the ma jority of 
junctions could be brought within their designed capacity , either  through  existing  Essex  Transport  
Strategy works  such  as the Basildon  Integrated  Transport  Package and the A127 Corridor for 
Growth: An Economic Plan 2014 , or through the mitigation  proposed to be installed alongside 
future development.  In recognition of that the A127 is not trunked and yet is part of a 24  mile 
corridor for growth stretching across different planning and highway authority areas, the Council 
has signed a Statement of Common Ground with the local authorities along the route, Essex 
County Council and Transport for London to ensure that in the future, a more coordinated 
programme of investment and management is followed in the interests of upgrading the whole 
route to sup port growth in Greater London and Essex.  
 The mitigation measures identified through the mitigation modelling  will however come at a cost, 
which has been calculated as part of a high level costing exercise as part of the highway modelling 
of the Local Plan.  A significant proportion of this cost is associated with the provision of a new 
junction on the A127 to provide access to new development in Wickford and East Basildon, and  
 
77 also to provide congestion relief on the route into Wickford on the A132. A signif icant scheme such 
as this will require funding beyond which can be secured from developer contributions or CIL, and 
therefore it will be essential to secure funding from the Government /SELEP.  
 In addition  to the strategic  highway  mitigation  schemes  identifi ed to keep  the main  road network 
moving and safe,  it will be necessary  for individual  development  schemes  to make  localised  
improvements to the road network to ensure safe and sustainable access to development  sites. 
These localised improvements will need to be identified in conjunction with the Highway Authority, 
and therefore ongoing engagement between Basildon Council and Essex County Council will be 
necessary.  
 In terms of sustainable transport modes, the Council has worked with Essex County Council to 
develop a local Cycling Strategy, as part of its duties under the Education Act 1996 . A strategic 
approach to cycling is essential to get more people using cycling as a travel choice, bringing wider 
travel, health and well-being  benefits. Within Basildon (including Laindon and Pitsea) there is a 
well-developed network of cycle ways, which were installed through the development of the New 
Town, but this is not the case in Billericay and Wickford to the north. Despite this , the proportion of 
people travelling t o work by bicycle is below the national average . It is therefore necessary to 
deliver improvements to the existing network and secure parking facilities at key destinations, 
whilst also incorporate new route provision and facilities within new development  to increase 
participation.   
 In terms  of public  transport  provision,  the Basildon  Integrated  Transport  Package  will deliver  public 
transport improvements within the Borough  around bus and railway stations. Similarly, Basildon 
Council  in partnership  with Essex  County  Council and Greater Anglia rail franchise  plan to improve  
public  transport  integration around Billericay and Wickford railway stations. The Local Plan will 
expect  the opportunity for public transport provision  to be extended  into new developme nts where  
practical  to encourage  the use of this travel mode.  The ongoing  engagement  of bus and rail operators  
will be necessary  for these  improvements to successfully be delivered in a way that influences an 
overall modal  shift.  
Policy T1  
Transport  Strategy  
During the plan period, the Council will seek to deliver improved accessibility to jobs, services and facilities via 
an enhanced and better integrated transport network. This will be achieved by:  
a. Ensuring that new development is well -located and designed to minimise the need for 
travel, encourages the use of sustainable modes of travel as an alternative to the private 
car, and provides or contributes towards necessary transport infrastructure, including 
local and strategic highways mitigation and sustainable travel services, routes and 
facilities;  
b. Working with businesses and community service providers to improve accessibility to key 
services and facilities through the use of travel plans, and to ensure that new premises 
and facilities are readily accessible by sustainable modes of travel;  
c. Working in partnership with public transport providers and Network Rail to develop better 
links, access and capacity for the railways and bus network;  
d. Working on a route -corridor basis with Essex County Council, p lanning authorities and 
highways authorities to deliver, in a timely manner, integrated transport measures which 
mitigate the impact of planned development on the highways network, promote more 
sustainable travel patterns and encourage increased use of sus tainable modes of travel, 
such as public transport, cycling and walking. This will include:  
i. A coordinated package of improvements to junctions and routes along the 
A127 Corridor, that will increase road capacity, reduce traffic congestion, 
improve safety, and improve access to the Borough from surrounding 
areas, and access to London along the A127 from Southend -on-Sea; 
ii. Targeted investment to improve local transport infrastructure, focusing on 
delivery of improved and better integrated bus and train services , and 
improved pedestrian and cycling networks; and  
iii. Measures to encourage behavioural change in individual travel choices. 
Travel plans will be developed as a means of coordinating these 
measures.   
78 e. Working with Highways England, Essex County Council and nei ghbouring planning  and 
highway  authorities to assess the impacts and opportunities arising from the preferred 
route for the  Lower Thames Crossing, and ensure that it integrates effectively with the 
South Essex strategic road network.  
f. Ensuring that potentia l adverse impacts on the natural environment, as a result of 
proposals for new or improved transport infrastructure are either prevented or 
successfully mitigated as part of the development proposal.  
 
Policy T2: Improvements to Carriageway Infrastructure  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects local planning authorities to identify the transport  infrastructure required to 
support sustainable development, and to seek improvements to the transport network that limit or 
avoid  the significant impacts of development . 
 The Essex  Transport  Strategy  prioritises  improving  journey time reliability on strategic inter -urban 
routes including the A127, A129, A130 and the A13, and providing for and promoting access by 
sustainable modes of travel to new development areas . 
Evidence  Base  
 Owing to the capacity issues identified on the highway network in the Borough through the 
Publication Local Plan THIA , the provision of new and improved transport infrastructure is essential 
to mitigate the impact of future housing and economic growt h in the Borough up to 2034.  
 The Essex Transport Strategy , the A127 Corridor for Growth: An Economic Plan , and future route 
based strategy for the A13, propose a number of highways schemes for the Borough, in order to 
address issues with the existing highw ay network's capacity and resilience. It should be noted that 
whilst funding has been secured for some of these improvements, some others will be the subject 
of future bids.  
 A127 Corridor for Growth: An Economic Plan : The A127, which passes through the hea rt of the  
Borough is  a strategic  route  in South Essex and East London which  becomes  heavily  congested  
during  peak  periods.  It carries a significant amount of traffic, with volumes in excess of 70,000 
vehicles per day, which is comparable  to flows  on some  motorways.  However,  the A127  is not a trunk  
route  and has significant capacity issues. Congestion at key junctions along its route is also a 
problem with the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange suffering particularly severe congestion during 
peak periods. It is  expected that congestion on the A127 will worsen as a result of growth across 
South Essex without mitigation. This includes  growth  in Basildon,  Brentwood,  Castle  Point,  
Chelmsford,  Rochford  and Southend -on-Sea. There are key economic growth opportunities served 
by this corridor also including the Basildon A127  Enterprise  Corridor  and London  Southend  Airport.  
The current estimated  cost of delivering  the Economic Plan  is in the region  of £76m,  excluding  any 
widening  of the route  to three lanes.  The A127/A130 Fairglen  Interchange  is amongst  the elements  of 
the Economic Plan  which  have  been  identified as priorities within the next six years. A bid has been 
successfully submitted to the SELEP/DfT  to provide funding to support these priorities, together 
with funding for other works. Widening of  the A127 features within the long term proposals for the 
route, and requires land to be safeguarded for such purposes in the  meantime.  
 A176 Upper Mayne : This short length of narrow road under the A127 experiences s evere peak 
time congestion. It is proposed that the number of running lanes passing under the A127 is 
increase d by consolidating footway provision. This will allow more highway space to reduce 
queuing, which on occasions extends back to the A127 slip lane.  
 A13 Route  Management  Strategy : The A13 is a strategic  route  serving  South  Essex,  and providing a 
key link to London and the national motorway network. It has been subject to improvements within  
Thurrock,  and also at the junction  with the A130  at Sadlers  Farm  in order  to accommodate strategic  
growth,  particularly  in relation  to freight  movements  and to reduce  congestion.  However, the  part of 
the A13 between  Pitsea  and Stanford -le-Hope  has not been  the subject  of improvements to date and 
is potentially a co nstraint on growth in South Essex in the longer term. Essex  County Council  in 
conjunction  with Thurrock  Council  and Southend -on-Sea Council  are seeking  to prepare a  Route   
 
79 Management  Strategy  for the A13, to complement the A127 Economic Plan , ensuring  the efficient  
operation  of this equally important route  over the long term to support growth.  
 In addition to those projects identified through the Essex Transport Strategy  to address existing 
issues, and to support strategic growth, a series of additional pro jects involving improvements to 
the carriageway network have also been identified through the mitigation modelling within the 
Publication Local Plan THIA . These  improvements  have  been  subject  to a high level costing  
exercise,  and funding  for these  improvements  will be secured  through  the use of the Community  
Infrastructure  Levy (CIL) and/or Section 106 contributions from developers, and where necessary 
supplemented by funding secured through bids to the SELEP /DfT. The projects that will be pursued 
are summarised  below.  
 A127 Fortune of War: The UK Air Quality Action Plan for Nitrogen Dioxide (2017)  is particularly 
relevant at this junction, as national modelling indicates the potential for Nitrogen Dioxide levels to 
exceed European limits in this loca tion. Congestion management therefore has a role to play in 
addressing that issue. This junction remains the only constriction to free -flow along the A127 within 
Essex and is a ‘pinch point’. As such, it is a limiting factor for capacity between Southend -on-Sea 
and the M25, through Basildon and the delays it causes are at a cost to drivers and may 
discourage business and people locating to the area. Improvements at this junction are  expected  to 
offer benefits  within  the internal  road network  of Basildon  in addition  to freeing up  capacity  on the 
A127.  Previous modelling of potential schemes at this junction suggest that benefits could also  
include  reduced  queuing  at the junction  of A176/ Upper  Mayne with St. Nicholas  Lane, however, the 
full extent of potential  scheme benefits are currently being investigated as part of separate study 
commissioned by the Highways Authority.  
 A new grade separated junction on the A127 at Pound Lane:  This junction is required to se rve 
the development proposed to the e ast of Basildo n (policies E6 and H1 1) and  in Wickford (polic ies 
H12, H13, H14 and H1 5). These sites combined will provide around  5,000 homes and over 3,300 
jobs. The new junction  will also improve access to the A127 Enterprise Corridor by providing a new 
easterly access point, reducing pressure at the A132 Nevendon Interchange. It will also reduce 
flows north -south along the A132 through Wickford, reducing congestion at junctions through the 
town and freeing up capacity for local traffic. This junction will provide significant benefits, above 
and beyond those, which can be offered by alternative proposals such as widening of the 
Nevendon Road (A132) northbound, and the provision of  a northbound spur between the A127 and 
the A130 closer to the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange. However, this proposal is substantially 
more expensive, and will require support from neighbouring authorities and funding support to 
supplement developer contri butions from the SELEP/DfT.  
 A relief route to the south/south -west of Billeric ay, between Laindon Road and the A129 
London Road: Currently traffic accessing the west of Billericay must travel through the  southern 
part of the historic Billericay Town Centre . Junctions in  this location experience capacity issues. It 
is proposed that spine roads are provided running through site H1 7 to provide an alternative route 
to the west, avoiding the town centre. This will require some limited improvements to the existin g 
local highway  network.  It is expected that the costs of this route will be met by developers as they 
bring forward their sites for development.  
 A link road from West Mayne extending westwards to strategic site H8: In order to  support 
development within strategic site H8, it is necessary to provide a new link road from the site to 
provide local access to Laindon without using the Dunton Interchange. It is expected that this link 
road will provide access for occupiers of the new development  to services  within Laindon  Town 
Centre,  supporting  the vitality  and viability  of that centre. It is expected that this link road will be 
designed to a standard that would accommodate bus movements and emergency vehicles,  and the 
costs of its delivery will be met from the  development.  
 Modifications to the Basildon Town Centre road network: In order to facilitate growth and 
regeneration  within  Basildon  Town Centre  various  improvements  to the road network  are proposed 
by the Basildon  Town  Centre  Masterplan . These  improvements  will provide  multi-modal  opportunities to 
access services and facilities in the town centre. These will be funded through regeneration, with 
some funding already secured from SELEP/Local Growth  Fund.  
 Various  individual  junction  improvement  schemes:  The Publication Local Plan THIA  identifies 
the need to undertake improvements at the following junctions in order to support  growth:   
80  A13 Haywain junction,  Vange  
 A176/Dry Street Interchange,  Basildon  (In delivery 2018)  
 A176/St Nicholas Lane junction, Basildon  
 A127/A176 Pipps Hill Interchange, Basildon  
 B1464  London Road /High Road /Clay Hill Road, Basildon  
 A13/A176  Five Bells Interchange North, Basildon  
 A13 Pitsea Interchange, Basildon  
 A129/ Mountnessing Road /London Road roundabout,  Billericay  
 B1007/A129 Sun Corner junction,  Billericay  
 B1007/ Norsey Road/High Street/Western Road, Billericay  
 A129 /Southend Road /Outwood Common Road, Billericay  
 A129/ Southend Road/Hickstars Lane, Billericay  
 A132/ Runwell Road /A132 junction , Wickford  
 A1245 /Chelmsford Road /A129 Lond on Road, Wickford  
 A132 /Golden Jubilee Way/Radwinter Avenue, Wickford  
 A129/ London Road/Nevendon Road/High Street, Wickford  
 It is expected that these local junction improvements will be secured through CIL and/or planning 
obligations secured through Section 106 or Section 278 agreements alongside growth in the 
respective settlement. Where necessary , bids will be made to the SELEP or Government funding 
streams to address any funding gaps  arising.  
 It is also expected that there will be the need for other localised improvements to the highway 
network to address local congestion issues and to ensure road safety.  These should be identified 
through the Transport Assessments/Transport Statements for indi vidual development  sites.  
 A number of the carriageway improvement projects listed have been identified through the 
Sustainability Appraisal  to have the potential to impact upon designated nature sites depending on 
their routing and design. It will therefor e be necessary to adopt safeguards to ensure the protection 
and enhancement of the natural environment at an early stage of development of these projects in 
order to identify appropriate mitigation against any negative effects that may arise.  
Policy T2  
Improvements to Carriageway Infrastructure  
 In order to manage congestion and reduce the effects of pollution on key routes, and at key 
junctions within the Borough, the Council will work with SELEP, Essex County Council and 
developers to secure the following  improvements and alterations  to carriageway  infrastructure  in the 
Borough,  alongside  new development,  during  the plan period up to  2034:  
a. Improvements to the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange;  
b. Widening of the A127 in line with the A127 Corridor for Growth: An  Economic Plan ; 
c. Improvements to the A176 Upper Mayne junction with the A127;  
d. Improvements to the A13 in line with the A13 Route Management Strategy ; 
e. Improvements to the A127 Fortune of War junction;  
f. The provision of a new grade separated junction on the A127 at Pound Lane, including a 
link road to Cranfield Park Road/Tresco Way;  
g. The provision of a south/south -west relief route for Billericay alongside new housing 
development;  
h. The provision of a link road from West Mayne to site H8, providing multi -modal 
connections to Laindon Town Centre;  
i. Modifications to the Basildon Town Centre road network in line with the Basildon Town 
Centre Masterplan ; and 
j. Various individual junction improvement schemes:  
i. A13 Haywain junction, Vange  
ii. A176/Dry Street Interchange, Basild on 
iii. A176/St Nicholas Lane junction, Basildon  
iv. A127/A176 Pipps Hill Interchange, Basildon  
v. B1464 London Road/High Road/Clay Hill Road, Basildon  
vi. A13/A176 Five Bells Interchange North, Basildon  
vii. A13 Pitsea Interchange, Basildon  
viii. A129/Mountnessing Road/London Road roundabout, Billericay   
 
81 ix. B1007/A129 Sun Corner junction, Billericay  
x. B1007/Norsey Road/High Street/Western Road, Billericay  
xi. A129/Southend Road/Outwood Common Road, Billericay  
xii. A129/Southend Road/Hickstars Lane, Billericay  
xiii. A132/Runwell Road/A132 junction, Wickf ord 
xiv. A1245/Chelmsford Road/A129 London Road, Wickford  
xv. A132/Golden Jubilee Way/Radwinter Avenue, Wickford  
xvi. A129London Road/Nevendon Road/High Street, Wickford  
 The improvements and alterations to carriageway infrastructure listed above are considered to be 
the minimum requirements to support development. Where appropriate, developers will be required 
to demonstrate how they intend to improve highway infrastructure beyond this. Other localised 
improvements to carriageway infrastructure will also be secured along side new development where 
it is necessary to reduce local congestion and ensure road  safety.  
 Detailed assessment of the potential impacts of any new or improved transport scheme on the 
natural environment, including SSSI and adjacent Local Wildlife Sites will be required, and where 
adverse effects are predicted, appropriate mitigation will need to be identified and undertaken.  
 Developers  will be expected  to contribute  towards  these  carriageway  alterations  either  in-kind through 
on-site route provision as s pecified within their allocation policy, or through financial contributions 
via the Community  Infrastructure  Levy or planning  obligations  secured  through  Section  106 Agreements.  
Where  necessary development will be phased or limited in order to align with t he delivery of these 
schemes. This phasing is specified within individual development  allocations.  
 
Policy T3: Improvements to Footpaths, Cycling and Bridleway Infrastructure  
Policy Context  
 With regard to walking and cycling, the NPPF  expects Local Plans to support patterns of 
development  which  facilitate  the use of sustainable  modes  of transport.  In particular,  development 
should be located and designed to give priority to pedestrian and cycle movements,  and create 
safe and secure layouts which minimise conflicts between traffic and cyclists or  pedestrians.  
 The Essex  Transport  Strategy  seeks  to promote  sustainable  travel,  by providing  the infrastructure for 
sustainable travel and promoting the use of travel plans. With regard to cyc ling, the Essex 
Transport Strategy  considers actions to improve access for cyclists and pedestrians in particular, 
and identifies the following improvements as  essential:  
 Addressing gaps in existing networks;  
 Better linkages for walking and cycling routes within the PRoW  network;  
 Improving signing;  
 Improving crossing facilities; and  
 Ensuring that pedestrian routes are accessible for everyone.  
 Improving the safety of the cycling network is also a key concern within the Essex Transport 
Strategy . Policy  14 of the strategy  sets out Essex  County  Council’s  approach  to encouraging  
cycling, which includes developing cycle networks within towns across Essex and improving 
access to local services and schools for cyclists. In terms of locational priorities in relation  to 
cycling, the strategy  identifies Basildon (including Laindon and Pitsea) as a priority area, seeking 
improvements to  the town’s  cycle  networks,  including  links with surrounding  areas  such  as Billericay  
and Wickford.  
 The Infrastructure Act 2015  includes  a new legal requirement for the Government to produce a 
cycling and walking investment strategy. The DfT’s Cycling Delivery Plan (2014)  refers to a new 
national cycling target, to double the number of cycling stages (trips) nationally over a 10 year 
perio d.  
 In response  to this legal  requirement,  and also the requirements  of the Essex  Transport  Strategy , 
the Essex Cycle Strategy  has been prepared with the aim of setting out a strategy for providing 
coherent cycle networks. Specifically, it commits  to:  
82  Establishing a coherent, comprehensive and advantageous cycle network in every major 
urban area, utilising a combination of on -carriageway and off -carriageway cycle  facilities;  
 Ensuring each borough or district has an up to date cycling action plan (renewe d every 5 
years);  
 Providing well -placed and high quality cycle parking at key public destinations such as 
town centres, leisure facilities and railway  stations;  
 Ensuring that all new housing includes secure and easily accessible cycle storage and 
that new secure cycle storage is facilitated in existing housing  developments;  
 Ensuring  that cycling  is prioritised  over motorised  transport  in all new developments  – 
making it easier to carry out short trips by bicycle than by car. Cycle routes within 
commercial and residential  developments  will be more  direct  and convenient  than car 
routes  and will connect in to existing cycling infrastructure on leaving the  site; 
 Prioritising more frequent and good maintenance of our cycle  network;  
 Providing a clear and consiste nt standard of good quality, well placed cycle signage – to 
an appropriate density, with provision of journey times as well as distances (to cater for all 
audiences) where  possible;  
 Continuing to improve cycle safety at sites with actual and perceived safe ty problems;  
and 
 Developing an improved mechanism for the reporting of safety  issues . 
 The Basildon  Cycling  Action  Plan (2017)  aims to:  
 Identify how cycling levels can be increased in the Borough;  
 Prioritise funding for new cycle schemes;  
 Create a usable, h igh-quality cycle network that connects residential areas with key 
employment locations, railway stations, and town centres; and  
 Create opportunities to increase recreational cycling.  
 Taking into account the current barriers to cycling in the Borough, commuter flow analysis and 
locations of development, the Cycling Action Plan  has highlighted a series of interventions for cycle 
enhancements in the Borough:  
 Review existing route signage and lighting and improve maintenance of existing routes;  
 Prioritise north –south and east –west flagship routes, providing access to Basildon Town 
Centre and railway station;  
 Increase provision of useful cycle routes in Billericay, Wickford, and Basildon in particular;  
 Provide new and improved cycle parking with a focus of satisfying the considerable 
demand for commuter trips at railway stations;  
 Fill obvious gaps in the existing cycle -route network (on alignments with cycle -friendly 
topography);  
 Provide new infrastructure on key roads with cycle -friendly topography;  
 Develop Flagship Routes through Feasibility Studies to Detailed Design; and  
 Promote and market Flagship Routes with ‘Cycle Superhighway’ style branding and 
disseminating techniques.  
Evidence Base  
 2011  Census  data shows  that only 1% of journey  to work  trips in the Borough  are made  by bicycle, 
with only 4% on foot. However,  31% of journeys  to work  are less than 5km,  and 12% are less than 
2km. Whilst there are some steeper gradients and hills around the Borough such as at Noak Hill, 
Crown Hill, and Crays Hill which would make some journeys by bicycle or foot more challenging, 
there is  great  potential  within  the Borough  for cycling  rates  to be increased  to meet  the national  
cycling target. Significant parts of the Borough have relatively flat terrain, particularly within 
Basildon. There are also opportunities to improve cycling access to the rail  network.  
 The Basildon Cycling Action Plan , identifies high quality and well planned infrastructure which wil l 
be vital in encouraging cycling and improving safety.  
 PRoW  are planned and managed by the Highway Authority  through the Essex  Transport  Strategy . 
The Borough’s network of 147km of PR oW, representing 2.3% of the wider Essex network are 
protected in law, a nd all members of the public have a right to their use and enjoyment. The 
Borough’s PR oW encompass public byways, bridleways and footpaths; with the latter representing  
 
83 76% of the network.  Legislation places certain duties and responsibilities on farmers and 
landowners in respect of PRoW  that cross land within their ownership and control. Similarly, 
developers wishing to build on land that is crossed by a PRoW  must bear in mind their 
responsibility to ensure that the public are still able to make use of th e Right of Way.  
 The Essex Public Rights of Way Improvement Plan 2013  identifies ten objectives from which 
management of the PR oW will be guided including incorporating approved pathways into the 
PRoW network; better integrate PR oW with other access provision, initiatives and facilities; 
reducing fragmentation ; and improving accessibility.  
 Disregarding PR oW during the planning process can result in serious problems both at 
development stage and post completion, with costly resolutions which could res ult in enforcement 
action by the Highway Authority.  
 Through the Local Plan the Council will seek to improve and retain the existing PRoW  network, 
however it is important to ensure that such improvements are in keeping with the surroundings of 
the PR oW, in  order to maintain natural and/or historic setting.  
Policy T3  
Improvements to Footpaths, Cycling and Bridleway Infrastructure  
 In order to increase the proportion of residents accessing work, railway services, education facilities, 
other services and recrea tional oppo rtunities by foot or by bicycle, the schemes and projects set out 
in the latest Essex Transport Strategy, Public Rights of Way Improvement Plan  and Basildon 
Cycling Action Plan  to improve footpaths, footways and cycling infrastructure as well as  the safety of 
users will be delivered during  the plan period.  
 The Council  will work  with partners  including  Essex  County  Council  to secure  the funding  necessary 
to deliver the infrastructure improvements set out in the Essex Transport Strategy, Public Rights of 
Way Improvement Plan and the  Basildon Cycling Action Plan . It will also expect development 
proposals to support their implementation by:  
a. Retaining and improving any existing footpaths, footways, cycleways, bridlew ays and 
other Public Rights of Way passing through or adjacent to their  site; 
a. Providing  additional  footpaths,  cycleways  and bridleways  which  link up with the existing  
network and address any gaps in the  network, thereby providing access to nearby 
residenti al, commercial, retail, education and leisure opportunities, as well as access to 
the countryside;  
b. Providing  facilities  for pedestrian  and cycle  access,  including  the provision  of cycle  
parking,  in both residential development and non -residential developme nt; and 
c. Contributing to facilities for pedestrian and cycle access at nearby public transport  hubs.  
 
Policy T4: Improvements to Public Transport Infrastructure and Services  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects local policies to be balanced in favour of sustainable transport models and to 
encourage  solutions  that support  reductions  in greenhouse  gas emissions  and reduces  congestion.  
 The Essex  Transport  Strategy  prioritises  the promotion  and provision  of public  transport  networks 
within South Essex, including improving public transport links within and between the Thames 
Gateway towns, including the A13 Passenger Transport  Corridor.  
Evidence Base  
 The rail network  through  the Borough  provides  important  conn ections  to Southend -on-Sea, Thurrock 
and London via two rail lines: the Southend Victoria branch of the Greater Anglia mainline to 
London Liverpool Street and the Essex Thameside services to London Fenchurch Street. There is, 
however, no rail connection between these lines in South Essex, increasing the importance  of bus  
connections  for north -south  travel.  The interchange  experience  between  bus and rail services at   
84 many  of the Borough’s  stations  is not efficient  or well designed  and therefore  improving  access to  
stations  and their ability  to handle  more  passengers  will therefore  be an important  consideration to 
support local  growth.  
 There  is also an opportunity  for the Borough to take advantage of the benefits of the new Elizabeth 
Line, being delivered by the Crossrail project. It is a new pan -London non -stop rail service which 
will be operating from Shenfield in the neighbouring borough of Brentwood  from December 20 18. 
This is only one stop westwards from Billericay on the existing Greater Anglia mainline. The 
Elizabeth Line will open up the opportunity for people travelling to, or through  London to take the 
train from Wickford and Billericay and connect to Crossrail  services at Shenfield, with faster, more 
frequent and smoother services through London without the need to change  trains.  
 As with the Borough’s  strategic  road network,  significant  investment  in the railway  network  passing 
through  the Borough  is needed  to alleviate  existing  capacity  and reliability  problems  and to ensure 
that there is sufficient capacity in future to accommodate growth in rail travel. Rail link services to 
London are operating close to capacity on the Thameside route between Fenchurch Street and 
Shoeburyness.  Therefore,  the Council  will work  with Essex  County  Council,  Network  Rail, the Office 
of Rail and Road and existing and future rail franchise operators to influence the commissioning 
and management of local rail services to secure a nd deliver investment in rail travel, alleviate 
overcrowding and improve reliability and  resilience.  
 The Essex Transport Strategy  states that for those living within the main towns in Essex and the 
more  substantially  built up areas,  access  to most  essentia l services  by public  transport  is generally 
good. This is also the case for public transport connections along the main inter -urban corridors 
such as the A13. However, it also highlights one notable exception being access to hospitals, 
where, due to the lo cation of facilities, access can be difficult even for those within areas which are 
otherwise well connected to essential services. Basildon Borough is highlighted as one such area 
which despite having a hospital on the southern edge of Basildon, more than  11,000 households 
within the Borough have poor access to it. Due to the location of Basildon College adjacent to the 
hospital access  to further education for 16 -19 year -olds is also currently below that recorded in 
comparable areas. It should however be n oted that this will be improved as a consequence of the 
college being relocated to the town centre by 2020  as part of the Basildon Town Centre 
Masterplan.  Nonetheless, access to the hospital by public transport will remain an issue, and 
therefore it is considered reasonable to expect access improvements to be secured where possible 
through the Local P lan, through public transport upgrades.  
 Whilst public tra nsport connectivity within the main towns is generally good, provision of services 
between towns within the Borough and beyond the Borough is more variable. The Essex Transport 
Strategy  identifies Basildon as being less well connected to other main towns w ithin Essex. 
Additionally, both the Borough’s smaller village settlements of Crays Hill and Ramsden  Bellhouse 
and within the A127 Enterprise Corridor experience infrequent public transport services, affecting 
the ability of local residents to access servic es and employment by more sustainable  means.  
 The provision  of an excellent  passenger  transport  network  is widely  recognised  as a key attractor of  
inward  investment  and business  growth.  Excellent  network  coverage  enables  the easy movement of 
people,  makes  it possible  for people  to travel  into the area for employment  and helps  to reduce 
traffic levels on our roads, cutting costly delays to businesses caused by congestion. Similarly, the  
provision  of attractive  public  transport  has a major  role in cutting  carbon  emissions,  by attracting those 
who would otherwise travel on their own by car. It also offers access to employment and access to 
education for those who may otherwise be excluded from these  opportunities.  
 Passenger transport is therefore one of the key considerations of the Essex Transport  Strategy  
which proposes the following improvements in relation to the Borough:  
 Enhanced Public Transport Network for South Essex: These proposals seek to make 
public  transport  a more  favourable  option  for people  travelling  between  towns  in South  
Essex for work and leisure purposes. This has the potential to deliver positive benefits for 
the Borough in terms of providing better north -south links between towns in the Borough 
and those in mid Essex and beyond. This a lso has the potential to improve public 
transport provision in order to access key facilities such as the hospital, and also 
employment opportunities within the A127 Enterprise  Corridor.  
 A13 Passenger Transport Corridor: In order to promote public transpor t as a  favourable 
option for people travelling along the A13 between Southend -on-Sea and Basildon, a 
programme of bus prioritisation and improved bus waiting facilities has been proposed  
 
85 along the  A13. 
Policy T4  
Improvements to Public Transport Infrastruct ure and Services  
In order to increase the number of people accessing work and services by public transport, the Council will:  
 
 Work with Essex County Council and bus service providers to secure funding  for: 
a. Enhancements to the public transport network in S outh Essex, with an emphasis on  
those projects which  will: 
i. Improve north -south links within Basildon  Borough;  
ii. Enhance access to hospital  services;  
iii. Enhance access to the A127 Enterprise Corridor;   
iv. Enhance accessibility to railway stations; and  
v. Enhance access to other main towns in  Essex.  
b. The delivery of the A13 Passenger Transport Corridor, improving the speed and 
frequency  of bus movements along the A13  Corridor.  
 Work with Essex County Council, Network Rail, the Office for Rail and Road, and rail franc hise 
operators to  secure  investment  in services  which  accommodate  growth  in rail travel,  and secure  onward  
journeys by sustainable means, including public transport, walking and  cycling.  
 Work with large employers, Essex County Council and public transport operators to improve bus 
connectivity in business areas and encourage employees to travel sustainably to work.  
 Expect development proposals to, where appropriate, support the establishment of new public 
transport services for their occupants/users, and be designed to meet the needs of public  transport 
operators and users. In  particular:  
a. Road layouts should accommodate direct, convenient and safe bus  routes;  
b. Bus priority  measures  and parking  restrictions  which  enable  the safe passage  of buses  
should be implemented, where  necessary;  
c. The layout of development should ensure all homes and other frequently accessed forms  
of development are within 400m of a bus stop;  and 
d. Bus waiting facilities should be suitably sheltered, have good pedestrian and disabled  
access and benefit from passive  surveillance.  
 
ALLOCATION POLICY  
Policy T5: Transport  Improvements  Areas  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states  that local planning  authorities  should  identify  and protect,  where  there  is robust 
evidence, sites and routes which could b e critical in developing infrastructure to widen transport 
choice.  
Evidence Base  
 A number of the projects identified in policies T2, T3 and T4 as identified in the Essex Transport 
Strategy and the Publication Local Plan THIA  require land to be made available to enable transport 
improvements to take place in the future. In particular, these include : 
 Improvements to the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange;  
 Widening of the A127 in line with the A127 Corridor for Growth: An Economic Plan ; 
 Improvements to the A132 Nevendon junction;   
86  Improvements to the A176 Upper Mayne junction with the A127;  
 Improvements to the A13 in line with the A13 Route Management Strategy ; 
 Improvements to the A127 Fortune of War junction;  
 The provision of a new grade separated junction o n the A127 at Pound Lane, including a 
link road to the A130;  
 The provision of a south/south -west relief route for Billericay alongside new housing 
development;  
 The provision of a link road from West Mayne to site H8, providing multi -modal 
connections to La indon Town Centre;  
 Modifications to the Basildon Town Centre road network in line with the Basildon Town 
Centre Masterplan ; 
 Various individual junction improvement schemes:

 All transport  improvement  projects  mentioned  above  are options  and at early  stages  of development, but 
all have,  at the very least  indicative  diagrams  identifying  their land requirements.  It is important that 
the land requirements of these transport improvement projects are taken into account when 
assessing development proposals in order to ensure that the development does not prevent 
necessary  highway  improvement  works  from occurring,  reducing  their effectiveness,  or substantially 
increasing the cost of delivering such a  project.  
 Detailed assessment of the potential impacts of any new or improved transport scheme on the 
natural environment, including SSSI and adjacent Local Wildlife Sites will be  required, and where 
adverse effects are predicted, appropriate mitigation will need to be identified.  
Policy T5  
Transport Improvements Area  
 The Council will safeguard land required for transport improvements as identified on the Policies  
Map.  
 Development proposals within the proximity of a Transport Improvement Area will be  approved, 
providing the development does not:  
a. Prevent the delivery of transport improvements within the areas safeguarded for 
transport improvement  works,  unless  that safeguarded  land is not essential  in order  to 
mitigate  the impact of development;  
b. Reduce  the effectiveness  of transport  improvements  within  the areas  safeguarded  for 
transport improvements;  
c. Increase the cost of delivering transport improvements within the areas safeguarded,  
without appropriate mitigation through a Section 106  Agreement.  
 
  
 
87 DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy T6: Managing Congestion  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states that encouragement should be given to solutions which support reductions in 
greenhouse gas emis sions and reduces congestion. However, development should only be 
prevented on transport grounds where the residual cumulative impacts of development, following 
mitigation, are  severe.  
 The Essex  Transport  Strategy  seeks  a reduction  in greenhouse  gas emissi ons and also prioritises 
the improvement  of journey  times  on key routes  passing  through  or adjacent to  Basildon  Borough 
including the A127, A130, A13 and A129 as key priorities for the South Essex sub -area.  
 The Essex  Transport  Strategy  also states  that congestion  is common  on several  inter-urban  routes 
within the Borough including the A1235 and the A132, around the Basildon A127 Enterprise 
Corridor, the A176 between Five Bells and Basildon Hospital, and the A132/A13 junction in  Pitsea.  
 The NPPF  stipulate s that all development which generate significant amounts of transport 
movement should be supported by a Transport Statement or Transport Assessment  and should be 
required to provide a Travel Plan . Essex  County  Council's  Essex  Transport  Strategy  Development  
Management  Policies  (2011)  set out a clear approach to congestion at policy DM15. This requires 
there to be no increase to congestion as a result of new development. It expects Transport 
Assessments or Transport Statements to be prepared to acc ompany development proposals which 
are likely to have a significant  effect  on the transport  network.   
Evidence Base  
 The Publication Local Plan THIA  demonstrates that the road network in the Borough already 
experiences congestion on key routes and at key ju nctions during peak periods. Modelling of  the 
growth proposed within the Local Plan indicates that without mitigation many junctions in the 
Borough will  exceed  their designed  capacity.  As a consequence,  the cumulative  impacts  of growth 
without mitigation w ill be severe. It is therefore essential that the Council considers the likely 
impacts  of development  on the capacity  of highway  infrastructure  and congestion  when  assessing 
planning  applications,  and ensures  that mitigation  minimises  these  impacts  as far as is reasonably 
possible.  
Policy T6  
Managing Congestion  
 All development proposals that are likely to generate significant amounts of movements must  be 
accompanied by a Transport Assessment or Transport  Statement.  
 The assessment/statement must demonstrate how the impacts of the development on the  highway 
network will be mitigated to limit significant effects on highway and junction  capacity in order to 
satisfy the requirements of the Highway Authority.  
 Subject  to compliance  with all other  relevant  policies,  favourable  consideration  will be given  to those 
development proposals which fully mitigate their impacts on highway and junction  capacity to the 
satisfaction of the Highway Authority.  
 Where is it not possible to fully mitigate the impact of a development proposal on highway and/or 
junction capacity, consideration will be given to the following matters in order to determine  whether 
the residual impacts of the development are severe. Where the residual impacts are considered to 
be severe following consultati on with the Highway Authority, the application will be refused. The 
matters that will be considered  are: 
a. Any projected  levels  that exceed  the designed  capacity  of affected  junctions,  following  
mitigation;  
b. Any projected  levels  that exceed  the designed  capac ity of affected  highway,  following  
mitigation;   
88 c. Any projected  increases  in queue  lengths  on affected  junctions  or highways,  following  
mitigation;  
d. Any increase in risks associated with road safety, following  mitigation;  
e. Any other impacts on journey time reliability, following mitigation;  and 
f. Whether  all reasonable  opportunities  to promote  modal  shift have  been  considered,  and 
where appropriate included within the transport mitigation measures for the  development.  
 In appropriate circumstances, the Council will use planning conditions, or a Section 106  Agreement 
to ensure that highway mitigation works are delivered to accompany the phasing of  development.  
 
Policy T7: Safe and Sustainable Access  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states  that in relation  to transport,  decisions  should  take account  of whether  opportunities for 
sustainable transport modes have been taken up, and whether safe and suitable access to a 
development site can be achieved for all  people.  
 The Essex  Transport  Strategy  sets out five objectives  for improving  the transport  network  in Essex. 
Two are particularly  relevant  in respect  of securing  safe and sustainable  access  to developments. 
These  are: 
 Reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve air quality through lifestyle changes, 
innovation and technology; and  
 Improve safety on the transport network and enhance and promote a safe travelling 
environment.  
 The policies set out in the Essex Transport Strategy  highlight the importance that will be  placed on 
the location of development and the design o f development in seeking to achieve these objectives.  
 The Essex Local Transport Plan Development Management Policies  meanwhile sets  out detailed 
requirements in terms of securing safe and sustainable access to development. This includes the 
setting of requ irements for highways access in policies DM2 to DM5,  requirements for sustainable 
access, travel planning and the protection of PRoW  in policies DM9 to  DM11  and specifying  the 
requirements  for Transport  Assessments  and Safety  Audits  at policies DM13  and DM14.  The 
thresholds  for the provision  of Transport  Statements  and Assessments  are set out at Appendix B of 
the Essex Local Transport Plan Development Management  Policies . 
 The UK Air Quality Action Plan for Nitrogen Dioxide  is also relevant in the Borough,  as national 
modelling indicates the potential for Nitrogen Dioxide levels to exceed European limits on the A127 
at the Fortune of War junction. Congestion management has a role to play in addressing that issue.  
Evidence Base  
 Promoting  a safe travelling  environment  is important  to the delivery  of the Essex  Transport  Strategy , 
which highlights that in order to promote greater public transport use or healthier travel choices 
such  as walking  and cycling,  we need  to ensure  that people  will be safe when  travelling.  Similarly, 
improving  safety  is essential  to making  best use of our transport  network,  ensuring  that our roads 
are effectively maintained and managed to minimise the risk of collisions and the disruption and 
delay  these  can cause.  Evidence  set out in the Essex  Transport  Strategy  demonstrates  that there is  
a need  to improve  safety  for all road users  in Essex  to achieve  these  benefits,  as well as ensuring the 
number of people killed or seriously injured on our roads is  reduced.  
 With regard to the need for sustainable access arrangements for new developments, the Essex 
Transport Strategy  provides data showing that there are significant emissions of carbon dioxide, 
and other gases such as nitrogen dioxide arising from road transpor t movements in the Borough. 
This has implications for public health and also for the environment. Our ability to reach essential 
services (including  healthcare,  retail  and leisure  facilities),  employment  or education  has a major  
influence on how we choose to travel, and our overall quality of life. Most  of us have benefited from 
the improvement in personal mobility made possible by rising car ownership. However, this has 
contributed  to an increase in emissions  arising  from transport  movements.  In order to address this  
 
89 issue, applications for developments requiring a Transport Assessment  or Transport Statement  will 
be required to produce an Air Quality Assessment which include s air quality monitoring data with 
their proposal, covering key juncti ons local to the site. Where air quality impacts are likely to arise a 
Mitigation Strategy should also be provided which fully ameliorates these impacts.  
 Additionally,  those without  access  to a car or those  who have  difficulty  travelling  often  have  more  
limited  choices  and opportunities; for instance, the life opportunities available to our residents, 
particularly younger residents, can be constrained by their ability to reach education or 
employment. Therefore, good access to sustainable transport modes su ch as cycle routes and 
public transport will not only contribute  towards  reducing  the environmental  impacts  of transport  
movements,  but also the social aspects of accessibility.  
 The preparation of Travel Plans to accompany new developments  which generate  significant  levels  
of movement,  i.e. those  developments  requiring  a Transport  Assessment or  Transport  Statement,  is a 
recognised  means  by which  sustainable  travel  choices  can be promoted within new development 
proposals. It is therefore expected that Trave l Plans are prepared for all proposals which also 
require a Transport Assessment or Transport Statement. Essex County Council  has produced  
guidance  on the production  of Travel  Plans  for businesses  entitled  Helping you Create a Business 
Travel Plan (2010).  This guidance is particularly aimed at destination developments such as retail 
and commercial developments, but may also be useful when considering residential development 
proposals.  
Policy T7  
Safe and Sustainable Access  
 In order to ensure that developmen t proposals offer safe and sustainable access either directly,  or 
via appropriate mitigation, the following requirements must be  met: 
a. Safe access to the highway network, having regard to the highway access policies of  the 
Highway  Authority;  
b. Safe access  to the site for cyclists  and pedestrians,  including  the approach  to the site 
from the nearest public transport node;  
c. No significant adverse  impact on local air quality, once mitigation measures have been 
taken into account;  
d. Development must not result in a si gnificant adverse impact on PRoW , or the local road 
network in respect of traffic capacity and highway safety, and  
e. Access  to public  transport  services  within  400m  of any home  or frequently  visited  non-
residential development, as required by policy  T4, with  the exception of infill development 
within the Green Belt.  
 In order  to maximise  safe and sustainable  access  in those  developments  which  will generate  significant 
transport movements, the Transport Assessment or Transport Statement must address matters of 
road safety and sustainable travel modes to ensure that all reasonable mitigation measures have 
been put in  place.  
 Where a development requires a Transport Assessment or Transport Statement it must incorporate, 
or be accompanied by, an Air Quality Assessme nt, which includes air quality monitoring data , to 
determine the impacts of the proposal on local air quality . Where adverse impacts on local air 
quality are identified, a Mitigation Strategy will be required .  
 Where a development requires a Transport Asse ssment or Transport Statement it must also be 
accompanied by a Travel Plan, setting out how sustainable travel behaviours will be encouraged. In 
relation to residential developments, particular regard should be given as to how residents will 
access the nea rest primary and secondary school provision by foot, ensuring that the route is  safe 
and convenient.  
 
 
 
 
  
90 Policy T8: Parking Standards  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  allows local planning authorities to set local parking standards for residential  and non-
residential development, taking account  of: 
 The accessibility of the development;  
 The type, mix and use of development;  
 The availability of, and opportunities for, public transport;  
 Local car ownership levels; and  
 A need to reduce the use of high-emission vehicles.  
Evidence Base  
 The Essex  Parking  Standards  - Design  and Good  Practice  (2009)  currently sets out vehicle  parking  
standards for Essex  taking  into account  those  matters  identified  in national  policy.  It is considered  
that these parking standards , or any subsequent future iteration of these standards  are appropriate 
in the Borough because they promote minimum requirements for  parking  for residential  
developments,  but maximum  requirements  for parking  in non-residential developments  and is 
consistent with the approach taken with other authorities in Essex.  
 Census data indicates that car ownership in the Borough is high and many households are likely to  
have  multiple  vehicles.  This has consequences  in locations  where  there  is insufficient  off-street car  
parking,  as this results  in excessive  on-street  parking  and illegal  parking  on pavements,  verges, etc. 
Minimum residential parking standards are therefore appropriate to address this  issue.  
 In order to promote more sustainable transport patt erns, however, the Essex Parking  Standards - 
Design and Good Practice  continues to promote maximum car parking standards for non -
residential developments. The purpose of this is to encourage residents to choose to walk, cycle or 
use public transport for jo urneys where their destination has limited parking provision. Whilst this 
may be appropriate in some locations within the Borough, the Basildon Borough Parking Capacity 
and Intervention Study  highlighted potential capacity issues with town centre parking i n Billericay 
and Wickford in particular. It also highlighted issues with on -street parking within the A127 
Enterprise Corridor. There is therefore a need to consider the local context of proposals before 
accepting significantly less parking provision than is required by the parking s tandards in some 
destinations.  
 The Essex Parking Standards - Design and Good Practice  also sets out minimum requirements in 
respect of disabled parking provision and bicycle parking provision. The amount of people in the  
Borough  with ill health,  which  would  limit their ability  to carry  out day-to-day activities,  is slightly higher  
than the average  for the East of England.  In terms  of disabled  parking  provision,  the Essex parking  
standards  take into consideration  the slightly  higher  statistics  and therefore the  standards are 
considered  appropriate.  
 In terms of bicycle parking provision, these standards are again considered to be appropriate in 
order to encourage those who are more able to access employment and services by more 
sustainable  means  of transport  to do so. This will also allow  the objectives  contained  in the Essex 
Cycle Strategy  to be achieved, once  adopted.  
Policy T8  
Parking Standards  
 Proposals  for development  will be expected  to make  provision  for car parking,  provision  for disabled 
parking  and provision  for safe and secure  parking  for bicycles,  in accordance  with the latest  adopted 
Essex  Parking  Standards,  and any future  iterations  of these  standards,  once  adopted  by the Council.  
 Locations that are considered to be more sustainable and well served by public transport may be 
considered appropriate for lower levels of  provision.  
 Proposals for provision above or below these standards must be supported by evidence detailing 
the local circumstances that justify devi ation from the  standard.   
 
91 Policy T9: Town Centre, Employment Areas and Railway Station Parking 
Provision  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires local planning authorities to seek to improve the quality of parking in town 
centres and ensure it is convenient, safe and secure.   
Evidence Base  
 The Council will continue to promote sustainable forms of travel  through policy and by working in 
partnership with providers. However it also recognises that private vehicles  will continue to be  a 
preferred mode of travel for ma ny users . It is therefore important to ensure that there is adequate 
parking provision both in new residential developments and around our town centres , employment 
areas and  railway stations.  
 The Council commissioned a Basildon Borough Parking Capacity and Intervention Study  which 
examined the current provision and quality of off street parking within the Borough’s five town 
centres, at the railways stations and within the A127 employment corridor. The study also provided 
comments on the level of on stre et parking within certain parts of the Borough, which is managed 
by the South Essex Parking Partnership on behalf of the Council. The purpose of the study was to 
provide recommendations on parking provision for the preparation of the Local Plan in relation  to 
the retention, and potential for intensification, of existing parking provision and the creation of 
additional parking provision.  
 The study reported a significant level of provision within Basildon Town Centre which is largely 
within multi -storey car p arks that are well maintained and with relatively straightforward access. 
The parking supply was not found to be heavily utilised and this is not forecast to change 
significantly across the plan period. In contrast to Basildon, the current parking supply i n Billericay 
and particularly the railway station was observed to be very well utilised and it is likely that either 
future growth in demand will need to be managed or additional provision will be required to 
accommodate growth.  
 Parking within Laindon and Pitsea Town Centres are both considered to be sufficient. The 
provision in Laindon is however of a poorer standard, this should be addressed through the 
redevelopment of Laindon Town Centre as set out in policy R3. There was also found to be an 
imbalance i n the distribution of demand, particularly for the railway stations, which are situated 
further away from the main town centres.  
 The overall level of provision within Wickford, in comparison to the local population, is relatively 
good with a number of dif ferent parking options . How ever the quality of parking and the 
accessibility of some car parks within the town centre could be improved. The railway station 
parking was identified as being restricted and t he level of projected residential growth across the  
town during the plan period could create  significant demand constraints in the future.   
 Parking capacity was identified as being constrained at a number of railway station car parks 
across the Borough. The Council is now working with the rail franchise op erators and Network Rail 
to develop viable options for addressing this issue at the stations. Whilst some opportunities for 
decking these car parks is available to increase capacity, these should be considered alongside 
wider transport measures to manage d emand.  
 An examination of parking provision within the A127 Enterprise Corridor identified a range of 
pressures, with certain employment locations being reliant on on -street parking which can lead to 
traffic flow issues. This was generally linked to busine sses having insufficient off -street parking 
provision. The parking standards in policy T8 will have an important role to play in managing levels 
of employment parking as well as other forms of parking.  
Policy T9  
Town Centre, Employment Areas and Railway Station Parking Provision  
 The Council will support proposals that seek to increase the parking provision within town centres,  
92 employment areas and at the Borough’s railway stations where there is an identified shortfall in 
capacity. Proposals will also be supported where they result in improvements to the quality and 
accessibility of existing parking provision.  
 Proposals that would result in the loss of parking provision will only be permitted where the said loss 
does not result in an under supply of parki ng within the area. Consideration should be given to the 
impact that any loss would have on both current and future parking demand in light of the planned 
growth proposed within this plan.  
 
Policy T10: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Standards  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF supports the move to a low carbon future and advises that local planning authorities 
should plan for ways to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  
 The introduction of the Climate Change Act 2008  signified a long -term commitment from the 
Government to reduce GHG emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050.  Road transport 
contributes about 20% of overall UK CO 2 emissions and electric vehicles (EVs) are considered a 
technologically effective means of reducing this form of carbon e missions and therefore helping to 
meet the carbon reduction targets set to mitigate climate change.  The Committee on Climate 
Change (CCC) found that the UK needs 60% of new cars and vans to be electric by 2030 to meet 
the 2050 climate change targets. The f igure is currently at less than 1% (in 2014) and is only 
assumed to rise to 8% by 2020.  
 The UK was also one of 13 international members of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Alliance to 
sign a commitment to promote cleaner motoring and slash transport emissio ns. It includes an 
agreement to make all passenger vehicle sales zero emission vehicles by 2050.  
 Decarbonisation of the road transport sector is therefore an essential area of policy focus and the 
provision of EV charging infrastructure has been identified  as a barrier to the uptake of EV 
ownership.  
Evidence Base  
 There are only three public locations and six business locations for  EV charging located at present  
within the Borough. Whilst it is not possible to identify how many private homes have EV charging  
points , extensive research (both in UK and other countries) shows that home -based overnight 
charging is the charging option preferred by drivers and policy makers and day charging at the 
workplace is the second preferred charging location . 
 The Council pre pared an Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Briefing Paper (2017)  which 
considered the best approach for the Council, as a local planning authority, to promote the use of 
EVs. It identified that the Local Plan has a role to play and recommended a requirement for EV 
charging infrastructure  to be incorporated into new development through policy as part of parking 
provision requirements. Such an approach is in line with practice established in the London Plan 
and by other local planning authorities.  
Policy T10  
Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Standards  
 The Council is supportive of improving the uptake of low emission and electric vehicles. In order to  
ensure that growth in the Borough can support this , all new developments will be required to 
include, where practical, appropriate provision for electric vehicle charging points. Electric vehicle 
parking should be counted as part of the total parking prov ision, and bays should be clearly marked. 
The following standards will apply in the Borough:  
f. Residential developments (excluding use class C1 hotels and C2 residential institutions) 
require 1 passive charging point per unit (dwelling with dedicated parking ) or where off -
plot or communal parking is provided 50% of all new parking space s should have active 
charging points.   
 
93 g. Non-residential developments, use class C2 residential institutions and propos als for 
stand -alone car parks, should include active provisi on for electric car charging points of 1 
charging point or 10% of all new parking spaces, whichever is greater.  
h. Use class C1 Hotels should include active provision for electric car charging points of 
30% of all new parking spaces.  
 In cases where charging p oints, including infrastructure to enable retrofitting, cannot be provided 
within the development site, developer contributions may be sought to enable those facilities to be 
suitably provided in other locations including public car parks or on -street park ing spaces.  
 
Policy T11: Access for Servicing  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  is clear that safe and suitable access to a development  site should be achieved for all  
people.  
 As outlined in the Essex Transport Strategy , Essex is a natural conduit for freight movements 
because of its trunk roads and rail routes, and its port and airport connections to international 
markets. Similarly, local distribution is vital for Essex businesses, and the retail lifeblood of its major 
urban areas and towns. With so much of t he County's retail stock being on the move,  there is  a 
need  to manage  and plan for freight  in a proactive  way in order  to allow  our ports,  airports  and town  
centres  to thrive.  At the same  time,  it is important  that freight  movements  respect  the needs of 
communities within the Borough and does not impinge on people's quality of  life. 
 The Essex Transport Strategy  sets out that Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) will be encouraged to 
use 'Priority 1' roads in Essex County Council's Road Hierarchy (comprising the st rategic road 
network and inter -urban county roads). Where the use of 'Priority 1' roads is not possible, HGVs 
will be expected  to use 'Priority  2' roads  (those  that distribute  traffic  between  the local road network 
and 'Priority 1' roads). The use of the r emaining local road network by HGVs will be minimised and 
will be for access to the destination only. This will help to reduce any adverse impacts on amenity,  
the environment  and the structural  integrity  of the highway.  
 Additionally,  all developments  within  the Borough  are serviced  on a weekly  basis  by waste  collection 
operatives. Requirements in relation to this matter are set out within section H6 of the Building 
Regulations which require waste collection points to be reasonably accessible to the siz e of the 
waste collection vehicle typically used by the waste collection authority. Within the Borough it is 
appropriate for all new developments to have safe and convenient access for collection  vehicles, or 
suitable on road stopping, with the access road s and highways being constructed of materials able  
to withstand  the weight  of the collection  vehicles.  Preferably  suitable  turning  facilities  should be  
provided  within  all developments,  in order  to prevent  the need  for collection  vehicles  to reverse. 
However,  where  there  is a necessity  to reverse,  this should  be limited  to short  distances  only, and 
the route must allow clear visibility, free from sharp turns and obstacles. This standard appears 
appropriate  for other  servicing  and delivery  vehicles  that occasionally  access  many  developments 
also.  
Evidence Base  
 As stated in the Evidence Base for policy T1, the results of the Publication Local Plan THIA  showed  
that significant  parts  of the road network  in the Borough  are operating  at or near capacity, making  it 
vulnerable  to congestion  incidents  which  can quickly  impact  on other  routes.  This results in queuing 
at some junctions and interchanges at peak times and unreliable journey times for car and public 
transport users. Particularly problematic are th e strategic west -east routes of the A127 and the A13 
which provide important movement corridors for local traffic and freight within South Essex. 
Therefore, any new developments that will require regular servicing by HGVs should not be 
designed in such a w ay that they could potentially add to the congestion issues already 
experienced, or present a concern for highway  safety.  
 Additionally,  it is important  that HGVs  waiting  to be loaded/unloaded,  or otherwise  unable  to travel 
due to statutory rest periods can be accommodated off the highway to avoid congestion and/or  
94 increased road safety risks. There is evidence around the existing employment areas that, where 
insufficient  sized  sites are used  to regularly  receive  HGVs,  there  are high levels  of on-street  parking 
by such vehicles to the detriment of the free movement of  others.  
Policy T11  
Access for Servicing  
 Development proposals that require regular servicing by HGVs should  be: 
a. Located on main or secondary distributor r outes, with appropriately designed servicing 
areas that enable HGVs to access  and egress  the development safely and  in a forward 
gear without creating congestion;  and 
b. A sufficient size to accommodate the number of vehicles they expect to receive at any 
one time, taking into account loading/unloading time and any statutory rest  periods.  
 All other  developments  should  be designed  to ensure  that properties  can be accessed  in a safe and 
convenient way by waste collection freighters and delivery  vehicles.   
 
95 
 Supporting High Quality Communications 
Infrastructure  
STRATEGIC POLICY  
Policy COM1: Digital Communications Infrastructure Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  places great importance on the provision of advanced, high quality communicat ions 
infrastructure in delivering sustainable development and economic growth. It also recognises  the 
importance  of high speed  broadband  technology  and other  communications  networks  in enabling 
local community facilities and services to  function.  
 The Digital Communications Infrastructure Strategy (2015)  by Department for Culture, Media and 
Sport is the national strategy for developing the coverage and capacity of the UK’s broadband 
network and future communication technology services.  
 Essex County Council has adopted 21st Century Digital Essex (2011),  the County Strategy for 
delivering world -class broadband in Essex, which aims to increase the amount of homes and 
businesses that have high quality telecommunications available to  them.  
Evidence Base  
 Communica tion technology is integral to daily life, with the Internet, mobile phones, radio and 
television being more obvious examples. In order to create sustainable and successful 
communities in the Borough and ensure new development  opportunities  for housing  and 
employment  are appropriately  serviced,  there  is a need to make provision for the necessary 
supporting communications infrastructure in appropriate locations, and at the right times, to meet 
the needs of the community and businesses.  
 The Communications Infrastructure Report (2012)  by Ofcom states that broadband is available on 
nearly every copper telephone line in the UK. Mobile signals are strong enough for outside calls 
from 97% of properties for all four 2G (texts and calls) networks in the UK, with u rban areas 
generally receiving better coverage. Mobile communication is good for the Borough, and access to  
digital  TV and radio  are improving.  There  are however  variations  among  mobile  phone  operators, 
particularly  in 3G (mobile  internet  and calls)  and 4G coverage.  Only a few networks  provide  effective 
indoor and outdoor 4G coverage.  
 The UK Next Generation Network Infrastructure Deployment Plan: Broadband Delivery UK (2015)  
by the Department for Culture Media and Sport states that superfast broadband supports business 
growth and local job creation and makes it easier for people to get into work by allowing more 
flexible working patterns. Superfast broadband connection speeds  in the Borough are generally 
good. South Essex has already benefited from the BT telephone exchanges being upgraded to 
accommodate high speed fibre optic  “fibre  to the cabinet”  (FTTC)  broadband  connection.  Network  
speeds  shows  that broadband connection sp eeds in the Borough are high, with a 92.8% fibre 
based  coverage5. However, there is now an increased emphasis on improving speeds further by 
providing fibre to the propert ies, reducing the need for copper wiring which otherwise inhibits 
speeds. Additionall y, rural communities around Crays Hill and Ramsden Bellhouse do not have 
access to fibre broadband requiring the network to be extended. There is also a need within the 
Borough to improve access to superfast broadband for businesses in the A127 Enterprise Corridor 
where there is limited fibre broadband connectivity.  
 Increasing  the stability  and range  of communication  technology  available  could  provide  additional 
benefits to the economic, social and environmental attributes of the area, including to resident s 
providing  greater  access  and connections  to essential  services  and enabling  businesses  to trade

Policy COM1  
Digital Communications Infrastructure Strategy  
 The Council will:  
a. Seek to ensure that all homes and businesses in the Borough have access to superfast 
broadband and 4G mobile network coverage , as a minimum;  
b. Support the future rol l out of new communications technologies that will ensure 
businesses in the Borough can parti cipate effectively in the global , national and local  
econom ies; and  
c. Support the future role out of new communicat ion technologies that will enable residents 
and businesses in the Borough to access a broader range of service  opportunities, to 
improv e their quality of life,  competitiveness  and reduc e the need to travel.  
d.  
 This will be achieved through the Infrastructure Delivery Plan  and by working with partner 
organisations including Essex County Council, infrastructure providers and service operators to:  
a. Extend, and where necessary enhance the capacity of  existing broadband and 4G 
mobile network coverage to those areas which currently experience deficit s, most 
notably the A127 Enterprise Corridor and rural communities;  
b. Identify practical and sustainable ways  in which new forms of communications 
infrastructure can be rolled out early across the Borough, having regard to any financial, 
planning and physical constraints  and opportunities  which may exist;  
c. Ensure that opportunities to align communicat ions with ne w development  and highways 
infrastructure and other works are realised to ensure that efficiencies are achieved in 
terms of cost, delivery and disturbance time.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy COM2: Determining Applications for Digital Telecommunic ations 
Equipment  
Policy Context  
 The Government has issued Permitted Development rights to a variety of minor forms of 
telecommunications development. Part 24 of the General Permitted Development Order (1995) (as 
amended) “Development by Telecommunications Code System Operators” allows 
telecommunications  operators  to install  and replace  certain  types  of telecommunications  equipment, 
provided certain criteria are met without the need for planning  permission.  
 Although the Cou ncil cannot object to the principle of development, in some instances, it can 
exercise  control  over the siting  and appearance  of telecommunications  equipment  in the interests of  
protecting  amenity.  Permitted  Development  is curtailed  in Conservation  Areas6 and where  Article 4 
Directions are in place which have removed the relevant Permitted Development rights. Similarly, 
Listed Building Consent is required for installations on, or within the curtilage of a Listed  Building.  
 Applications which do not meet the Permitted Development criteria will require formal planning 
permission or prior approval by the local planning authority before  equipment can be  installed.  
 The NPPF  requires  local planning  authorities  to support the expansion of electronic communications 
networks, including telecommunications and high speed broadband  through planning policy . The 
number  of radio  and telecommunications masts should be kept to a minimum, consistent with the 
efficient operation of the network, and seek the use of existing mast s, buildings or structures 
wherever possible. Where new equipment is required it should be sympathetically designed and 
                                                      
 
6 As designated by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990   
 
97 camouflaged, where  appropriate.  
 Local planning authorities are required to take a positive approach to the provision of 
telecommunicatio ns equipment and not impose bans or strict restrictions on location or distances  
between new telecommunications development and existing development . Applications for 
telecommunications development should be determined on planning grounds, and supported by  
the necessary evidence to justify the proposed  development.  
Evidence Base  
 There are specific challenges to providing the communications infrastructure needed to support 
existing social and economic activity in the Borough, and provide the infrastructure necessary to 
deliver the industrial, office, retail and housing growth envisaged in the plan period. Space for 
utilities  under  the Borough’s  streets  is limited  and, while  the supply  of services  is currently  adequate, 
there is a challenge to meet increased demand as the economy grows, whilst at the same time 
adapting to a low carbon economy, capable of managing its impact on the environment. The dense 
concentration of the majority of Borough businesses into the A127 Enterprise Corridor also means 
that higher  demands are concentrated into a restricted geographical  area.  
 Historically, mobile network providers tend to co -locate antenna and dishes on existing masts; 
although the increasing demand for higher speed telecommunications equipment could result in a 
need for new masts and equipment. For these reasons there is likely to be an increase in the 
number of applications for antennae and other telecommunications equipment in the Borough in 
future  years.  The Local Plan will help manage  that demand  to reach  an optimum  solution  for both 
network coverage and capacity, whilst protecting  amenity . 
 In recent  years  there  has been  a considerable  growth  in the variety  of digital telecommunications 
equipment located within neighbourhoods and there are already a number of dig ital 
telecommunications installations throughout the Borough that can be used to accommodate  
additional equipment. There are also parts of the Borough, such as Green Belt, areas of nature 
conservation, and heritage assets  that are  likely  to be more sensitive  to the installation  of new masts  
and cabinets . It is therefore  essential  to ensure that the proliferation of new digital 
telecommunications equipment structures is kept to a minimum, that their visual impact is 
appropriately mitigated, and to see k opportunities for the rationalisation or screening of existing  
equipment, as necessary to improve amenity.  
 With continual advances in technology it is likely that demand for new digital telecommunications 
infrastructure will be sustained, albeit it may c hange form. It is in the interests of local residents and 
businesses that the Borough  maintains  the necessary  infrastructure  which  will improve  the quality  of 
existing  services and provides timely access to new digital services. The Council recognises the 
need to take account of the technical limitations on siting, but operators must also recognise the 
Local Plan's role in protecting areas which are more sensitive to matters such as visual intrusion, 
and the need to protect residential  amenity.  
 It should be  noted that telecommunications operators must demonstrate compliance with the 
International Commission on Non -Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) statutory guidelines, 
when  submitting  applications  for telecommunications  equipment.  The main  purpose  of the ICNIRP 
guideline is to protect public health from the effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure that 
may result  from masts,  antennae  and base  stations.  Following  a review  of the ICNIRP  Guidelines in 
2009, it was discovered that since their introduction in 1998, there has been no evidence to 
suggest that the effects of exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic waves below the 
restricted levels has had any long term negative effect on the health of the general public. It is 
therefore widely recognised that applications that comply with the ICNIRP statutory guidelines 
cannot be refused on the grounds of impact on public  health.  
Policy COM2  
Determining Applications for Digital Telecommunications Equipment  
Proposals (including for prior a pproval under Part 16 of the General Permitted Development Order)  for new or 
upgraded digital telecommunications equipment should:  
 Demonstrate  that the siting  and design  of the installation  would  not have  a detrimental  impact  upon  
 
98 the visual, operational u se and amenity of neighbouring occupiers, the host building or public space 
(where relevant), on safeguarded land for transport improvements as defined in policy T5, and on 
the appearance and character of the area;  
 Seek opportunities to share existing mast s or sites with other providers. Where a new structure 
alongside existing equipment, or a new site is proposed, this should be supported by the necessary 
evidence to justify  that: 
a. There is no reasonable possibility of sharing existing facilities, or of erecting antennae on 
an existing building or other structure to meet operational requirements; and  
b. There is no suitable alternative site for the development.  
 Conform  to the International Commission on Non -Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines, 
taking account of the cumulative impact of all operators, equipment located on the mast/site where 
appropriate.  
 
Policy COM3: Digital Communications Infrastructure in New Residential and 
Commercial Developments  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  state that planning policies should recognise and seek to address  potential  barriers  to 
investment,  including  any lack of infrastructure  and services.  Local planning  authorities  should  also 
work  with other  authorities , stakeholders  and providers  to assess the quality and capa city of 
infrastructure, including telecommunications, and  ensure there is sufficient provision alongside 
development . 
Evidence Base  
 Improvements  to the delivery  of a full range  of infrastructure  needs  will be fundamental  to achieving 
the development ambitions of the Borough, to cater for its growing population and expanding 
business  base.  It is recognised  that a flexible  approach  will need  to be taken,  particularly  in relation to 
delivering infrastructure for newly established or extended communities as they evolve throughout 
the plan period.  
 As new development increases the demand for digital communications infrastructure, it is likely that 
development sites will require new telecommunications equipment and infrastructure to be 
upgraded  in order  to provide  the future occupiers with  the effective  mobile  and broadband  
connectivity  as required. This is especially the case for those sites that have been identified for 
development and are peripheral to the existing urban areas, where a network may already be 
established. Proximity to communications infrastructure is sometimes key to the maximum 
effectiveness of such infrastructure,  a result  of direct  relationship  between  connection  speeds  and 
proximity  to exchanges or infrastructure  centres.  
Policy COM3  
Digital Communications Infrastructure in New Residential and Commercial Developments  
 The Council will support proposals which install new, or improve existing, communications 
infrastructure if they are required to enable the successful delivery of new development, and where 
they accord with all other relevant policies in the plan. All new developments will be expected to:  
a. Identify  and plan for the digital  telecommunications  network  demand  and infrastructure  
needs  arising  from the development, and ensure  that these are addressed in reasonable 
time to serve the proposed development from first  occupation;  
b. Include provision for connection to superfast broadband and 4G mobile phone coverage 
across the  site, as a minimum;  
c. Encourage  the provision,  accommodation  and use of communal digital 
telecommunications  equipment; and  
d. Take account of Highway Authority land requirements as set out in policy T5, when 
determining the location and route of new utility services in the vicinity of the highway  
 
99 network or proposed h ighway network, so as not to impede or add cost to highway 
mitigation schemes.  
 In addition, where  the scale , form or massing  of the new development  can be demonstrated by  
sound  technical evidence, to be likely to cause an interference with existing digital  communications 
infrastructure in the vicinity, that is otherwise avoidable by design,  the Council  will seek  opportunities  
to mitigate  such  impact  through  appropriate  design modifications and all suitable measures for re -
siting, re -provision or enhancement  of any relevant digital communications infrastructure within the 
new development.  
  
 
100 
 Delivering a Wide Choice of High Quality Homes  
 
Policy Context  
 As set out in respect of policy SD1, the NPPF requires local planning authorities to boost 
significantly the supply of housing. It expects evidence to be used to ensure that the objectively 
assessed needs for market and other forms of housing including affordable housing is met in full 
through planning policy , as far as is consistent  with the other  policies  set out in the NPPF . It expects  
that key sites are identified  which are critical to the delivery of the housing strategy for the Borough 
over the plan  period. In order for sites to be identified in the Local Plan they must be suitable for 
development, available (or likely to become available during the plan period) and achievable 
(viable). It is expected, that at any point in time, a five year supply of deliverable housing sites will 
be available in the Borough.  
 In addition to setting out requirements for the quantum of growth, the NPPF  also sets out 
requirements for securing an appropriate mix of housing. Local planning authorities to identify the 
size, type, tenure and range of housing that is required, reflecting local demand. In particular it also 
expects specific provision to be made for affordable housing, and for the housing needs of different 
groups in the community , such as , but not limited to,  older people and people with disabilities , 
families with children and people who wish to build their own homes . 
 Separate to the NPPF , national planning policy in relation to Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople is set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) . The PPTS  establishes the 
objective for fair and equal treatment for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in terms of 
securing their accommodation needs, which facilitates their traditional and nomadic way of life, 
whilst re specting the interests of the settled community. As with the NPPF , the PPTS  expects local 
planning authorities to assess and plan for the specific accommodation needs of Gypsies, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople and to be able to identify a five year s upply of sites for this 
purpose.  
 Policy SD1 establishes that during the period of the Local  Plan, at least 15, 465 homes will be 
delivered within the Borough. The policies in this chapter establish how these will be delivered. 
Policy SD2 meanwhile establishes the distribution of growth. The other policies in this chapter will 
establish the precise location s of strategic housing growth, the requirements of development on 
these sites and general development management policies which will apply to all housing growth 
locations.   
STRATEGIC POLICIES  
Policy H1: Housing Strategy  
Evidence Base  
Housing Needs  
 Whilst policy SD1 makes provision for 17,791 homes, the full objectively assessed need , there are 
concerns around delivery which mean it may only be poss ible to deliver around 15,465 of these 
homes in the period to 2034. Thi s compares to a housing requirement of  between 19,491 and 
19,771 which  comprises a need for between 19,440 homes and 19,720 homes arising from the 
SHMA Addendum , and a need for 51 pitch es for ethnic Gypsies and Travellers arising from the 
Basildon Borough Gypsy and Traveller Local Needs Accommodation Assessment ( BBLN AA) 
(2018) . This means that there is a potential unmet need for housing of up to 4,000  homes , when 
both supply and delivery  issues are taken into account . It is therefore extremely important that 
those homes provided within the Borough effectively respond to local demand issues, as there is 
no slack in the supply to allow for the provision of homes local people do not need, or  cannot 
afford.  
 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment  (SHMA ) (2016)  identifies the need for different house 
sizes to meet the changing needs of the Borough’s population. There is a demand amounting to 
40% of total supply for smaller units, reflecting the demographic trends of the Borough and the 
desire amongst younger res idents to get on the housing ladder. There is also a strong demand,  
 
101 accounting for 40% of need, for 3 bedroom properties reflecting the need of growing families. The 
need for properties of 4 bedrooms or more is limited to 20% of supply. However, it is impo rtant that 
these homes are provided as they will help to attract more professional people to live in the area. 
This is particularly important for both business growth and also in sustaining public services, in 
particular healthcare.  
 The SHMA also identifie s a housing pressure arising from the growing population of older people.  
This has implications  for the turnover  of existing  homes  within  the housing stock, and for the demand 
for specialist accommodation for older people who may need to live in supported housing. The 
SHMA identifies the need for 1,491 units of specialist housing accommodate for older people, and 
also the need for 598 bedspaces in residential/nursing homes.  
 Whilst the need for housing in the Borough is high, simply making provision at curre nt market 
values (or higher) will not address the issue, as average house prices within the Borough are  in 
excess  of seven  times  the income  of the resident  population. This makes  it difficult  for first time 
buyers to access the local property market and for families to meet their accommodation needs as 
they grow and change. The SHMA identifies the need for at least 6,274 of new homes delivered in 
the Borough over the period from 2017 to 2034 to be affordable,  as defined by the NPPF, in order 
to meet the needs arising.  
 In terms of the need for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople accommodation, this is 
identified in the BBLNAA . This has been prepared in accordance with the PPTS  and Housing and 
Planning Ac t 2016,  and forecasts the needs for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in 
the Borough to 2034. Due to the different requirements of the PPTS and the Housing and Planning 
Act 2016, the BBLNAA  identifies two groups of Gypsies, Travellers and Trave lling Showpeople, 
depending on whether they meet the ‘planning definition’:  
Do not meet the planning definition:  Those who should be planned for in accordance with 
their specific cultural needs for living accommodation in accordance with the Equality Act 
2010, the Children’s and Families Act 2014  and the Human Rights Act 1998,  but no longer 
exercise a nomadic lifestyle and where t he PPTS  does not apply (ethnic Gypsies, Travellers 
and Travelling Showpeople).  
 
Do meet the planning definition:  Those Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  
who continue to travel and for whom the policy requirements of the PPTS  apply (nomadic 
Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople).  
 
 An equivalent to 51 pitches until 2034 is considered to be for Gypsies, Travellers  and Travelling 
Showpeople  that do not currently meet the planning definition, but nevertheless, have an ethnic 
right to live in culturally appropriate accommodation. These needs should be met as part of the 
overall housing provision and have therefore been added to the full objectively assessed need for 
housing.  
 The need arising from nomadic Gypsies and Travellers is 53 pitches until 2034. Additionally, there 
is a requirement of 3 additional plots  for nomadic Travelling Showpeople. National policy in th e 
NPPF  and PPTS  requires this need to be planned for specifically.  
 The wider group of Essex authorities has prepared an Essex LNAA into which the findings of the 
Basildon Borough LNAA have been integrated. At this time, it has not been possible to robustl y 
assess the need for transit sites in Essex, with data on unauthorised  encampments collected to 
date insufficient to establish a requirement. Changes have been made to the data collection 
process, but it will not be possible to undertaken an assessment un til 2019/20 at the earliest. 
Should that assessment identify the need for a transit site within the Borough in the future, this will 
need to be considered through the next review of the Local Plan.  
Housing Land Supply  
 The Local Plan makes provision for a supply of 17,791  homes, as set out in policy SD2. It 
comprises the following forms of identified supply:  
 
  
 
102 Table 11.1: Housing supply within the Borough  
Source  of Supply  Capacity  
Dwelling Completions 2014 – 2018 2,247  
Dwelling Units with Planning Consent  at 1st April 201 8 2,641 
Town Centre Regeneration Dwelling Capacity (outstanding)  1,164 
Other Urban Dwelling Units on sites in the HELAA (suitable, 
available and achievable)  2,166  
Strategic Sites removed from the Green Belt  7,072  
Designated Neighbourho od Areas  1,389  
Village Extensions to Crays Hill  65 
Self-Build Sites 32 
Limited Infill Development in the Green Belt  135 
Windfall  880 
Total  17,791 
 
 The Windfall Assessment identifie d the potential for around 880 additional homes to be secured 
during the plan period on sites which cannot be identified at this time  and these have been included 
in the table above as windfall . No allowance for windfall is included within the five years to 2023.  
 There is the potential within the land supply to achieve a hi gher rate of delivery than that set out in 
policy SD1. However, this would require the infrastructure needed to support growth being brought 
forward in a timely manner, and for development capacity to be optimised on each potential site.  
 A Whole Plan Viabi lity Assessment  (2018)  has been prepared to understand the implications of the 
policy requirements of this plan on development viability. Generally, the sites being brought forward 
for residential development as part of the Local P lan are considered to be viable, although some 
public funding will be required to secure strategic infrastructure improvements needed to open up 
some sites in East Basildon and Wickford. Viability is not therefore considered to be a constraint on 
housing l and supply, or on the provision of affordable housing as a proportion of overall 
development.  
 In terms of land supply for ethnic Gypsies and Travellers, this can be met from within the identified 
supply, including limited infill development in the Green B elt. Infill plots offer similar sites to those 
currently occupied by a majority of the Gypsies and Travellers living in the Borough. Specific sites 
however need to be identified for nomadic Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople which 
beyond the ext ent of the Green Belt or inset from the Green Belt  in order to conform with the PPTS.  
This is dealt within in more detail in policy H3.  
Housing Quality  
 The quality of homes in the Borough, and the communities in which they are located is important to 
the health and well -being of residents, and also to the vitality of the local economy. Good quality 
housing and access to services will be especially important in attracting the skilled professionals 
needed in the local economy and local public services to liv e in, or come to the Borough.  
 The Essex Design Guide  (2018)  highlights the importance of good design in ensuring that new 
homes meet the needs of residents now and in the future. It especially highlights the importance of 
ensuring that new homes are sustai nable not only to benefit the environment, but also to ensure 
homes are efficient and people can afford to live in them. It also highlights the health and well -
being benefits that can be derived through planning for green spaces and opportunities for activ e 
travel within development.   
 
103 
 The Linking Planning,  Health and Wellbeing  Topic Paper  (2017)  emphasises  the importance 
connectivity between housing and community has on mental well -being, and for ageing well. It is 
therefore essential for health, and for th e capacity of healthcare services, that new homes are 
delivered as part of communities, supported by the full range of infrastructure needed. The phasing 
of infrastructure to be delivered alongside housing is therefore paramount.  
Policy H1  
Housing Strategy   
 In order to deliver at least 15, 465 new homes within Basildon Borough during the period 2014 to 
2034, as specified in policy SD1, which respond to the needs of local residents now, and in the 
future, the Council will:  
a. Encourage the effective re-use of land within existing residential areas for the provision 
of new homes;  
b. Encourage development in town centres to incorporate residential development on upper 
floors, and in locations on the edge of town centres.  
c. Identify specific strategic sites for additional housing growth across the Borough, with the 
aim of creating sustainable communities supported by sufficient infrastructure;  
d. Ensure that the mix of new homes provided in the Borough is aligned with the needs of 
the population. This will enable fi rst time buyers, growing families and those looking to 
down -size to meet their accommodation needs;  
e. Secure specific provision of specialist accommodation for older people, and other 
vulnerable adults living in our communities;  
f. Provide opportunities for loc al people to build their own homes through the identification 
of sites specifically for self -build development; and  
g. Identify sites to meet the special accommodation needs of our Gypsy, Traveller and 
Travelling Showpeople population.  
 In order to ensure that  local people have the opportunity, financially, to access new homes, the 
Council will seek to ensure that provision is made for 6,274 affordable homes inclusive of the total 
housing target for the Borough. This will be achieved by:  
a. Seeking a proportion of  new homes provided by developers to be affordable (see policy 
H26); 
b. Delivering affordable homes via the Council’s own house building programmes; and  
c. Securing a new public site for the accommodation of Gypsies and Travellers (see policy 
H3). 
 In order to en sure new homes contribute positively towards the quality of the  Borough as a place to 
live, and enable communities to be sustainable and thrive, the Council will require the following:  
a. The delivery of homes must be phased to align with infrastructure prov ision;  
b. High standards of design that create places people want to live now and in the future;  
c. High standards of sustainability within the design and construction of new homes so that 
residents can enjoy a low cost, healthy living environment;  
d. The provision  of integrated formal public open space, and the enhancement of the green 
infrastructure network to offer a range of health and environmental benefits; and  
e. High levels of accessibility by public transport and active modes of travel to employment, 
education , services and recreation opportunities in order to promote inclusion and 
encourage community cohesion.  
 
Policy H2: Specialist Accommodation for Older People and Disabled Adults  
 Essex County Council is the provider of social services in the Borough. It is  encouraging the 
provision of specialist accommodation in Essex as a means by which older people and those with 
disabilities can continue to  live healthy  and active  lives within  existing  communities. This approach 
is intended to reduce the demand for resid ential/nursing home care, which is a considerably more 
expensive way of meeting the needs of older people and those with disabilities, and can 
unnecessarily restrict  independence .   
 
104 
 There are currently 2,600 specialist accommodation units for older people w ithin the Borough of 
which 2,535 are Sheltered and Enhanced Sheltered Housing and the remaining 65 units provide 
Extra Care Accommodation. The SHMA Addendum  has identified the projected need for additional 
specialist accommodation up to 2037 for the Boroug h of 1,716 units. This amounts to an average 
delivery rate of 75 units per annum and therefore a need for an additional 1,491 units by 2034. The 
following table shows this demand by type of specialist accommodation and the Council’s Housing 
Strategy  has de fined this as a proportional split of 85% Sheltered/ Enhanced Sheltered Housing to 
15% Extra Care Units.  
Table 11. 2 The Need for Specialist Accommodation for Older People by 2034  
Specialist  Accommodation  
Type  Additional  Provision  
Required  (units)  
Sheltered Housing  1,097  
Enhanced Sheltered Housing  175 
Extra Care  219 
Total  1,491  
 
 The current split in tenure of specialist accommodation within the Borough is 87% rental and 13% 
leasehold. Whilst the need for rental units will remain, the increasing number of older households 
likely to want to remain homeowners is expected to result in an increased demand for leasehold 
specialist accommodation in the future, as their needs change and they require different levels of 
care. The projected tenure split of  50% leasehold and 50% rental, as recommended by Housing 
LIN SHOP@, will therefore be sought by the Council. However this will be kept under review 
through the Council’s Housing Strategy , which should be considered as supporting information 
when applying t hese policies.  
 As well as specialist accommodation, it is also important to ensure that homes are designed and 
built in such a way that enables the occupant to remain in their home for as long as is practical and 
safe. Part M4 Category 2 of the Building R egulations  on adaptable and accessible homes provides 
the opportunity for people to live in their homes for longer as they can be adapted to accommodate 
changing needs in terms of accessibility. The Council will require a proportion of new homes to be 
cons tructed to Part M4 Category 2 within major development proposals.  
 Whilst there is a focus on enabling people to live independently, with an ageing population there 
will always be a need for residential/nursing care to meet some older peoples’ care and 
acco mmodation  needs.   The SHMA Addendum shows that the population of people aged 75 and 
over, living in communal accommodation is expected to grow by 598 people by 2034.  
 There is also a need in the Borough for specialist accommodation for people with disabilit ies where 
care and support are provided with the purpose of enabling the individual, the support to live as 
independently as possible in the community. This includes people with learning difficulties, autism 
and/or physical or sensory impairment.  Whilst th e majority of their needs  are currently met within 
the existing community, there is existing provision of 115 places for people with learning disabilities 
within the Borough and 30 places for people with physical disabilities. These places are important 
for promoting independent living, and for supporting people where their carer(s) are no longer able 
to support t hem. The Independent Living Programme for Adults with Disabilities  Market Position 
Statement (2016) sets out data related to the specialist  care and  accommodation  needs  of working  
aged disabled adults and reports a future need of 103 places within the Boro ugh by 2021/22 . The 
level of provision within the Borough is currently sufficient to meet its needs, and consequently  
there  is no specific  requirement  for further  provision  in this regard. However  this will need to be kept 
under review, with flexibility av ailable to enable any special provision  required through consultation 
with Essex County Council Social Services.  
 There is also opportunity for specialist accommodation to assist in the delivery of healthcare 
services through the provision of step -down acco mmodation for adults being discharged from 
hospital with no ongoing need to remain in hospital, but who can not immediately return home. Such 
schemes are likely to be small in scale and any arising demand should be identified and delivered 
in consultation w ith Basildon and Brentwood CCG  and the Basildon and Thurrock University  
 
105 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust when a large development proposal comes forward.  
Policy H2  
Specialist Accommodation for Older People and Disabled Adults  
 The Council  will seek  to secure  at least  1,491  units  of additional  specialist  accommodation  for older 
people throughout the plan period. This will be achieved  by: 
a. Requiring  a proportion  of new homes  within  larger  development  proposals  to be in the 
form of specialist accommodation for old er people. Where this aligns with need, 
specialist accommodation may be required to form part of the affordable housing  
provision;  
b. Working with Registered Providers and Sempra Homes to secure specialist  
accommodation for older people within affordable housing proposals on suitable sites;  
and 
c. Supporting  proposals  by private  sector  specialist  accommodation  providers  within  
appropriate, accessible  residential  locations  within  the Borough,  subject  to compliance  with 
all other  relevant policies within this  plan. 
 The Council will also be seeking to secure at least 598 additional residential care/nursing beds  for 
older people throughout the plan period. This will be achieved  by: 
a. Working with those promoting large strategic housing sites to include provision on  these 
sites; and  
b. Supporting proposals by private sector residential care/nursing home providers within 
appropriate,  accessible  residential  locations  within  the Borough,  subject  to compliance  
with all other relevant policies within this plan .  
 The Council will work with Essex County Council Social Services, in the delivery of specialist 
accommodation to meet the needs of people with disabilities and older people, as and when that 
need arises. Where  appropriate  other  partners  including  Registered  Providers  and Sempra  Homes  
may be engaged to secure this  provision.  
 To support the provision of specialist accommodation that assists in the delivery of health care 
services, the Council will work with Basildon and Brentwood (CCG) and the Basildon and Thurrock 
Univer sity Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, as and when the need arises and when larger 
development proposals come forward.  
 The Council will be seeking to deliver a proportion of new homes that are adaptable and accessible 
in line with the relevant Building Regula tions in order for people to live in their homes for longer.  
  
Policy H3: Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommodation 
Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF makes it clear that local planning authorities should consider the Government's  PPTS,  in 
conjunction  with the NPPF , when  preparing  plans  or making  decisions  on Traveller  sites in their 
area.  The PPTS  makes clear  that the Government’s  overarching  objective  is to ensure fair and 
equal treatment for Gypsies and Travellers, in a way that facilitat es their traditional and nomadic 
way of life while respecting the interests of the settled community. To deliver this it has established 
seven policies in the PPTS. In addition it sets out how the planning system defines Gypsies, 
Travellers and Travelling  Showpeopl e. 
 For the purposes  of planning  policy,  Gypsies  and Travellers  are defined  in the PPTS  as being:  
Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on 
grounds only of their own or their family’s or dependants’ educational or health needs or old 
age have ceased to travel temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of 
travelling showpeople or circus people travelling together as such.   
 
106  
 For completeness, Travelling Showpeople are defined by  the PPTS as being:  
Members of a group organised for the purposes of holding fairs, circuses or shows (whether 
or not travelling  together  as such).  This includes  such  persons  who on the grounds  of their 
own or their family’s or dependants’ more localised pattern of trading, educational or health 
needs or old age have ceased to  travel  temporarily,  but excludes  Gypsies  and Travellers  as 
defined  above.  
 
 In support  of Council's  legal  duties  in respects  of the Housing  and Planning Act 2016,  it has assessed  
the needs of Gypsies and Travellers in the Borough. Such an assessment also meets the 
requirements of Policy A of the PPTS which seeks early and effective engagement with the settled 
and traveller communities, to und erstand the current issues and understand their likely permanent 
and transit accommodation  requirements  over the lifespan  of the Local  Plan,  working  collaboratively  
with neighbouring local planning  authorities.  
 Policy B of the PPTS establishes that local planning authorities should set local pitch targets for 
Gypsies and Travellers and plot targets for Travelling Showpeople. These are expected to address 
the likely permanent and transit site accommodation needs of Travellers in their  area identified 
from Policy A and where a need is identified, policy criteria should be set to guide land supply 
allocations, including identifying and managing a rolling 5 year pitch supply where possible up to 
the plan's 15th year. In addition, it sets out basic expectations as to what should be considered 
when planning for Traveller sites including access to services, health and safety and protecting 
local amenity and  environment.  
 Policy C, D and E cover the considerations for rural communities and Gree n Belt, including what to 
take into account when determining whether new sites are appropriate and how to allocate them. 
Policy F and G focus on trying to ensure the residential and business needs of Travellers are 
accommodated where possible on the same s ite and what local planning authorities should do if 
faced with proposals for major development that may affect existing Traveller  accommodation.  
Evidence  
 In accordance with the PPTS , a Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Local Needs 
Accommodation A ssessment ( BBLN AA) was completed in January 2018. In addition, through the 
Duty to Cooperate, the Council participated in the collation of the wider  Essex  Gypsy,  Traveller  and 
Travelling  Showpeople Local Needs Accommodation  Assessment (E LNAA), also published  in 
January 2018,  which features the need results of all Greater  Essex  authorities. Both studies followed 
the same methodology and collectively represent a local and strategic picture of needs until  2034.  
Existing Provision  
 The BBLNAA  identified e xisting provision comprising of 25 pitches on a public site in Courtauld 
Road, Basildon , 96 pitches on 55 private sites that are authorised with planning permission, 7 
pitches  on 7 private sites  with temporary planning permission and 13 pitches on 12 priva te sites 
which do not beneit from planning permission, but have been present for a substantive period of 
time meaning they are immune from enforcement, also known as tolerated sites. Additionally, there 
is one  existing Travelling Showpeople yard  comprising  of 2 plots that is  authorised with planning 
permission within the Borough. The Basildon Borough Site Potential Study (2018) (BBSPS)  
recommends that these existing sites and yards are safeguarded for the provision of pitches and  
plots . 
Need for Additional Provision  
 The BBLNAA  covering the period 2016 -2034 identified a specific need of 47 additional nomadic 
pitches for Gypsies and Travellers. A further 6 pitches represent 10% of the unknown population’s 
projected growth needs as judged to be reasonable by th e BBLNAA  to include in the future pitch 
forecast and plan for. In addition 3 nomadic plots for Travelling Showpeople to be delivered within 
the Borough by 2034.  
 The 5 year land supply position required by the PPTS can be broken down as set out in Table 11. 3 
below.

Identified Land for the Additional Provision  
 BBLNAA The BBSPS  evaluated  whether  there were any  suitable  and available  locations  or specific 
land parcels available to meet the need for nomadic Gypsy and Traveller pitches  and Travelling 
Showpeople plots  within the  Borough using a sequential approach.  
 Each  specific  parcel  of land promoted  for new Gypsy  and Traveller  accommodation  provision was  
subject  to appraisal  against  criteria,  taking  a very similar  approach  to the appraisal  of housing sites 
within the HELAA. The BBSPS identified  the Gardiners Lane South  site in the existing urban area 
as being  appropriate for the accommodation of additional publically owned pitches . The site was 
previously id entified as being capable of delivering 2 pitches in the High Level Development 
Framework for Gardiners Lane South , however its capacity has been maximised, drawing on best 
practice evidenced in the BBSPS , to ensure the site is used efficiently to enable t he provision of a 
total of 10  pitches.  It will form part of the wider allocation for land west of Gardiners Lane South 
under policy H 5. 
 The study was unable to identify any further sites within the existing urban areas as being suitable 
or available for accommodating additional Gypsy and Traveller provision  which the Council also 
found acceptable from an access perspective . The Council therefore considered the 
appropriateness of allocating sites in the Green Belt  and making them inset  within the Green Bel t.  
 A significant number  of the Borough’s existing Gypsy and Traveller sites are located within the 
Green Belt , particularly within the Borough ’s Plotland areas. The highest concentrations are located 
along the A127 corridor to the east of Basildon, south of Wickford and  south of Crays Hill  and all of 
the existing Travelling Showpeople plots are in south Wickford.  The BBSPS  identified and 
assessed existing sites, many of which were located along the A127 corridor,  for their potential to 
be expanded and/or intensified , as well as new sites promoted through the study . A total of 7 
Green Belt sites were identified within the BBSPS , as being potentially available and suitable for 
additional provision. Of these 7 sites, 4  were located within the designated Hovefields and Honiley 
Neighbourhood Area and have  not been considered within the Local Plan due to a lack of safe and 
sustainable highways access. The other sites included 2 new sites within North Benfleet and 
Fobbing and one existing Gypsy and Traveller site in Crays Hill which could be intensified.  These 
sites could contribute a total of 5 additional pitches towards meeting local need.  
 The study identified a total of 45 unauthorised pitches across the Borough, of which a t least nine of 
these pitches are known to be occupied by Gypsies and Travellers that meet the PPTS  definition 
but are subject to planning e nforcement . The status of the occupants of the remaining pitches is 
unknown, however the BBLNAA expects at least 6 o f these pitches to be occupied by Gypsies and 
Travellers who meet the PPTS definition . Whilst these pitch es are not currently regularised they are 
already in a developed state. It is also acknowledged that t he provision  of any new pitches to meet 
the identified need will need to  be on land in non -Green Belt locations due to a lack of available 
sites within the urban areas. If existing  unauthorised  sites were not considered further for their 
potential, land in the Green Belt which is  likely to be currently undeveloped would be required.  
 Consideration was therefore given to whether there was merit in allowing for land already in  use by 
Gypsies and Travellers to be regularised for this use . This approach  would  not increase the  amount 
of derelict and degraded Green Belt land  as previously developed sites would not be vacated . It 
would also enable Gypsies and Travellers who meet the planning definition to remain in existing 
communities  and ensure that the needs of these households are rec ognised when services are  
 
108 being planned, such as health services.  The provision of pitches on existing sites and on land that 
is already owned by Gypsies and Travellers would provide more private pitches  which  could be 
delivered earlier in the plan period  and contribute towards a five year supply . It should be noted 
that the approach to  regularis ing unauthorised sites would only apply to existing  occupied  sites as 
at 18 October 2018,  and not  to any newly arising unauthorised sites.   
 The BBSPS  also concluded that there were no suitable sites within the existing urban area which 
could address the immediate 5 year land supply need for Travelling Showpeople plots . The  existing 
Travelling Showpeople yard within the Borough  which is in the Green Belt  also had no further 
capacity for additional plots. The Council has therefore made provision for a new Travelling 
Showpeople yard accommodating all 3 additional plots within the new employment land allocation 
at Burnt Mill s under policy E6 . Yards are typical mixed use and the allocation provides good access 
to the strategic highway network with sufficient land outside of the Green Belt for  the plots to be 
appropriately designed and sited.  
 The sites assessed as being suitable and available for new pitches within the BBSPS  and the  
subsequent review of existing unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller sites , as categorised within the 
BBSPS , would provide a minimum of  44 additional Gypsy and Travelling pitches across the plan 
period. It is anticipated that through new site provision and by working with the travelling 
community to regularise appropriate unauthorised sites occupied by Gypsies and Travellers, 34 of 
these pitches would be deliverable within the first 5 years of the plan period which means t hat the 
Borough’s nomadic Gypsy and Traveller needs arising within the first 5 years of the plan, as shown 
in Table 11.3, would be met. However, there remains a shortfall of 9 Gypsy and Traveller pitches to 
meet the identified need which will arise towards  the end of the plan period. Furthermore, w hilst the 
Local Plan makes provision for meeting the Travelling Showpeople need in full, the yard is unlikely 
to come forward within the first 5 years of the plan period when the need for one plot arises owing 
to strategic nature of development to be delivered on land allocated by policy E6 and the need for a 
masterplanned approach.  
 The Council will therefore work closely with the neighbourhood areas , where the community 
includes  Gypsy and Travellers to ensure that growth arising from within these areas is 
accommodated within the ir Neighbourhood Plan s. The Council will also continue t o work with 
neighbouring authorities  to identify a strategic approach to meeting the needs of Gypsies, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in accordance with the requirements of national policy.  
Policy H3  
Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommo dation Strategy  
 The Council will secure the existing nomadic Gypsy and Traveller pitch provision and nomadic 
Travelling Showpeople plots. It will also make provision for additional  Gypsy and Traveller pitches 
and Travelling Showpeople plots to contribute t o meet ing the accommodation  and well-being  needs  
of the Borough's  Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople, who meet the PPTS  definition. This 
will be achieved  by: 
a. Securing 25 existing authorised public urban pitches  and 116 private pitches currently 
authorised,  with temporary planning permission or tolerated . 
b. Securing the 2 existing authorised Travelling Showpeople plots.  
c. Working with the travelling community to ensure that existing unauthorised sites , where 
they had  been occupied for at least 3 months at the 18 October  2018 and meet specified 
design and location criteria as set out in policy H24 , are regularised and permitted  for 
use by the travelling community. This will contribute to delivering a minimum of 29 new 
pitches .  
d. Allocating  a public site for 10 pitches on land  west of Gardiners Lane South as part of the 
comprehensive redevelopment of that urban site in accordance with policy H5 . 
e. Allocat ing the following 3 sites found to be suitable and available for Gypsy  and 
Travellers accommodation within the BBSPS : 
i. One site with 2 pitches in Crays Hill  
ii. One site with one pitch in North Benfleet  
iii. One site with 2 pitches in Fobbing  
f. Making provision for a Travelling Showpeople yards comprising of 3 plots as part of the 
new employment land allocation at Burnt Mills  in accordance with policy E6.   
 
109 
 The Council will work  with the designated neighbourhood areas, where the community includes 
Gypsy and Travellers , to ensure that the growth arising from those households is met within the 
neighbourhood area as part of any development that occurs.  
 The Council will continue to work collaboratively with neighbouring authorities through the Joint 
Strategic Plan to develop a  strategic approach to traveller provision that meets the needs of 
Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople over the wider area for the longer term, consistent 
with the requirements of the national policy for traveller site provision.  
 Planning permiss ion for the change of use of all authorised and allocated Gypsy and Traveller 
pitches or Travelling Showpeople plots  to uses other than for residential use by Gypsies, Travellers, 
or Travelling Showpeople that meet the PPTS  definition  will be restricted,  unless acceptable 
replacement accommodation can be provided, or it can be demonstrated that the site is no longer  
required to meet any identified needs.  
 
ALLOCATION POLICIES  
Policy H4: New Gypsy and Traveller Pitch and Travelling Showpeople Plot 
Provision   
Policy Context  
 The PPTS  states that local planning authorities should ensure that Traveller sites are sustainable. 
Local Plans should therefore ensure their policies:  
 Promote peaceful and integrate co -existence between the site and the local community;  
 Promote access to health services;  
 Ensure children can attend school on a regular basis;  
 Provide a settled base that reduces the need for long -distance travelling and possible 
environmental damage caused by unauthorized encampment;  
 Provide for proper consi deration of the effect of local environmental quality on the health 
and well -being o f Travellers;  
 Avoid placing undue pressure on local infrastructure and services;  
 Do no locate sites in areas at high risk of flooding; and  
 Reflect the extent to which trad itional lifestyles can contribute to sustainability.  
 It goes on to say when assessing the suitability of sites in rural or semi -rural settings, local planning 
authorities should ensure that the scale of such sites does not dominate the nearest settled 
comm unity. In terms of Green Belt, the PPTS  reiterates the NPPF  that inappropriate development 
is harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved, except in very special circumstances  
which includes Traveller sites. The PPTS  does  allow for the alteration of Green belt boundaries 
providing this is done through the preparation of the Local Plan. A local planning authority may 
make an exceptional, limited alteration to the defined Green Belt boundary, which might be to 
allocate a site inset within the Green B elt specifically a s a traveller site , in order to meet a specific 
identified need . 
 Regard should also be had to the need for mixed use yards for Travelling Showpeople to allow 
residential accommodation and storage of equipment.  
Evidence Base  
 The BBSPS has evaluated the potential options for accommodating the need through  specific sites 
in the Borough that are suitable and available as required by the PPTS and NPPF . Sequentially,  the 
BBSPS  examined  urban  land available  for development  to determine  its suita bility for pitches and 
plots  and identified one site at Gardiners Lane South as being suitable with a capacity of 10 
pitches. Upon review, the Council concluded that access issues prevented further sites in the urban 
area from coming forward.  
 The study th en assessed sites within the Green Belt which had been promoted in terms of their  
 
110 suitability and availability.  2 new sites within Fobbing and North Benfleet and an existing site within 
Crays Hill which could be intensified were identified as being suitabl e and available. These sites 
collectively provide an additional 5 pitches.  
 To meet the identified need for Travelling Showpeople the Council has made provision for a 
Travelling Showpeople yard which will contain 3 plots as part of the new employment land 
allocation at Burnt Mills (E6). Travelling Showpeople plots tend to be mixed use requiring land for 
the storage and maintenance of vehicles and equipment , which is compatible with the type of uses 
within an employment area, as well as an area providing residential accommodation. The 
employment allocation also offers good highway access  which is preferably for any Travelling 
Showpeople yards due to the natur e of their business.  
 All other sites will be secured through a criteria based policy, as set out at H24.  
Policy H4  
New Gypsy and Traveller Pitch and Travelling Showpeople Plot Provision   
 To help meet  the identified  need  for Gypsy , Traveller  and Travelling Showpeople accommodation  
within the Borough,  the Council has allocated the following sites and yard, to deliver 15 new pitches  
for Gypsies and Travellers and 3 additional plots for Travelling Showpeople : 
a. One publically own ed site providing 1 0 pitches on land west of Gardiners Lane South as 
part of the strategic allocation H5 ; 
b. 3 sites , as listed in Appendix 3,  providing a total of 5 pitches  within North Benfleet, 
Fobbing and Crays Hill , which were identified within the BBSPS  as being suitable and 
available ; and 
c. One Travelling Showpeople yard providing 3 plots on land east of Burnt Mills as part of 
the new employment allocation E6.  
 In determining all planning applications  for the sites listed in Part 1 of this policy , only tho se that can 
demonstrate their status as a Gypsy, Traveller or Travelling Showperson will have weight attributed 
to the need for a site.  
 The Council  will manage  the siting  and design  of all applications  for new or extended nomadic Gypsy, 
Traveller and Trav elling Showpeople accommodation in accordance with specific criteria -based 
policy  H24. 
 
Housing Growth in Basildon (including Laindon, Pitsea, Steeple View and Noak 
Bridge)  
Policy H5 : Land West of Gardiners Lane South, Basildon  
 The urban site known as Land  West of Gardiners Lane South  will create a new neighbourhood for 
central Basildon which provides areas for employment, new homes and open space . This site was 
initially identified in the Basildon District Local Plan and allocated for the provision  of 16ha  of 
employment  provision  and 20ha  of housing  and open space  provision. However comprehensive 
development of the site was not realised as a result of viability challenges, due to complex 
infrastructure requirements. Since then, a resolution to grant plannin g permission for a 15 pitch 
Gypsy and Traveller site and  two separate but adjacent  developments  for 41 and 32 (net) residential  
units  have  been  approved  subject  to separate  S106 agreements for affordable housing and 
contributions towards education and  health. To date only the scheme for 41 residential units has 
proceeded, as legal issues associated with land ownership and covenants have stopped the other 
schemes from proceeding.  
 The Council  has re-examined  the allocation  and the site remains  suitable, a vailable and achievable for 
residential development if planned for differently. Owing to the site's position within the A127 
Enterprise Corridor, and recent investment in the local road network, the site also has a future 
economic role in respects of new l and supply for employment purposes. The Council therefore 
expects this site to provide for new B -Class business premises, alongside residential development.   
 
111 
 An identified constraint to the successful delivery of Gardiners Lane South has always been the re -
provision of some of the existing sports facilities located within the site, which have been  identified 
as being an important local resource. The loss of sports pitches, particularly grass pitches will 
therefore be resisted by the Council in accordance wit h the NPPF, PPG  and advice by Sports 
England. Any sports provision that would otherwise be lost on site through redevelopment must be 
relocated commensurate and prior to  any residential  or employment development taking place that 
would otherwise affect it.  
 Whilst this challenge creates its own additional land requirements and costs the Whole Plan 
Viability Assessment and the Playing Pitch Relocation Study (2018),  which examined viability 
options for their relocation elsewhere in Basildon, concluded that future development on this site 
would still be viable. As such, any lost provision at Gardiners Lane South will be relocated to new 
community sports hubs on sites H8 to the west of Basildon a nd H1 1 to the east of Basildon. There 
is also opportunity to consolidate the sports facilities remaining on site to create a central 
community sports hub that serves both residents of the new development and the wider 
community.  
 To assist in the delivery of this site the Council commissioned a High Level Development 
Framework for Gardiners Lane South  (2017) which sets out the overall development concept and 
development principles for the site, as well as tests different development options and phasing. 
This policy is aligned with Option A of the preferred Development Framework with a 3 form of entry 
primary school on -site requiring 2.9ha of D1 education land as per the recommendation of Essex 
County Council, and the provision of 10 Gypsy, Traveller or Trave lling Showpeople pitches/plots.  
 In order to facilitate the delivery of this site and secure the relocation of some of the existing 
recreational uses to bring forward land for the alternative uses, a more detailed Development 
Brief/Masterplan will need to be prepared. Drawing down from the principles established by the 
High Level Development Framework , it should provide further detail on how the site will be 
delivered, either on a phased basis, or more  comprehensively. It should also set out the scale, 
layout and massing of housing, employment, community facilities, open space, ecology,  drainage,  
and the internal  highway  and transport  network that will serve the site. It is important that the 
Development Brief/Masterplan sets out the relocation strategy for the existing sports provision.   
 Whilst the exact layout of the site will be determined through the Development Brief/Masterplan, 
the High Level Development Framework  recommends employment land be directed within the 
north east of the site, closer to the a djacent Cranes employment area; public open space to the 
north west where the remaining sports provision is currently sited, and the primary school and 
residential areas including a small local centre to be directed to the southern part of the site close 
to the established residential area of Fryerns.  
 This site is not within  close  proximity  of national  or local wildlife  designations,  but previous  ecological 
surveys in the area for the Masterplan in 2003 and subsequent planning applications have 
demonstrated that biodiversity issues are nevertheless present. Therefore proposals for this site 
will need to be accompanied  by new ecological  assessments,  and any harm  will need  to be 
addressed  in accordance with policy  NE4. 
 Additionally, the site is in a Critical Drainage Area, BAS14 in the adopted Surface Water 
Management Plan  (2012),  and also in an area where improvements will need to be made to 
drainage capacity  to accommodate  growth.  Compliance  with policy  CC4 is therefore  essential  in 
relation  to this site, as is the need for Anglian Water to be satisfied that the nearby water recycling 
centre can accommodate the growth proposed. The developer may need to work with Anglian 
Water to enable this through improvements to the capacity of the water recyc ling centre.  
 In terms of highways, access arrangements for this site will need to be in accordance with the 
Local  Transport  Plan Development  Management  Policies.  In order  to ensure  that there  is sufficient 
highways capacity within the local area to accommo date growth in this location highways 
improvements will be required. Development in  this location will  be expected  to make  a contribution  
towards  these  improvements  and also contribute  towards improvements to cycling and public 
transport provision within the vicinity of the site in order to facilitate a modal shift towards active and 
sustainable transport  modes.  
  
 
112 Policy H5  
Land West of Gardiners Lane South, Basildon  
 37ha of land west of Gardiners Lane South, Basildon, as identified on the Policies Map with the 
notation H5, will be developed into a high quality mixed -used community. Re -development of the 
site will provide the following, subject to an updated Developmen t Brief/Masterplan and a strategy 
for the re -provision of existing sports pitches:  
a. at least 790 homes at an average density of 56 duph;  
b. 2.9ha of D1 education land for primary and early years provision;  
c. open space provision comprising 9.9ha of sport pitche s and supporting facilities, amenity 
open space, landscaping and drainage;  
d. 10 Gypsy and Trave ller pitches or Travelling Showpeople plots; and  
e. 5.5ha of B -class employment floorspace as required by policy E5.  
 Development  of the site must be informed by an up to date Development Brief/Masterplan, which 
considers the detailed matters of how to deliver the site's strategic policy requirements, including its 
scale and layout, massing, supporting facilities, open space, ecology, drainage, and internal 
highway an d transport network. It must demonstrate  how it can best be  integrated  within  the 
neighbouring  Cranes  employment  area to the east,  and Fryerns  neighbourhood to the south, for the 
purposes of connectivity, access to off -site services and  place -making.  
 The relocation of some of the existing sports clubs and their supporting facilities onto strategic sites 
on the edge  of the Borough's  main  town,  as set out in policies  H8 and H1 1, will be required prior to 
the redevelopment of pitches on this site. Any relocat ed provision must be replaced with equivalent 
or better facility provision both in terms of quality and quantity. Where sports facilities are to remain 
on site, the Council will support opportunities to consolidate and reconfigure the provision to create 
a sports community hub to ensure that it meets both the needs of the existing community and the 
additional need generated by the new residential development.  
  The site should be delivered following a comprehensive scheme, however in order to maintain 
flexibility and  account  for previous  delivery  challenges,  a phased  delivery  programme must be 
prepared to help manage land assembly and cause less disruption to existing residents or  new 
occupiers.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or  locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applic ants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of  this plan.  
 
Policy H6 : Land North of Dry Street, Basildon  
 Land to the north of Dry Street in Basildon was allocated as an Area of Special Reserve in the 
Basildon District Local Plan . The site which includes the South Essex College Nethermayne 
Campus received planning consent for 725 homes, a primary school, a local centre and open 
space in 2013. There is a Section 106 Agreement accompanying the planning consent which has 
secured local infrastructure  improvements  and affordable housing provision. The site is currently 
under construction and will be built out in phases. The fir st phase of  residential  development  
enables  the college  relocation to Market Square in Basildon Town Centre, once the relocation of 
the market is completed into St Martins Square. The subsequent phases deliver the remaining 
residential development, open sp ace and the retail units.  
 
 
  
 
113 Policy H6  
Land North of Dry Street, Basildon  
 Land  to the North  of Dry Street,  Basildon,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation  H6, will 
be developed to provide 725 high quality homes, a primary school, a local centre and open space. 
Land to the west of the site will be protected for nature conservation purposes. Its delivery will  be 
aligned  with the provision  of infrastructure,  as detailed  in the associated  Section 106  Agreement,  and 
the relocation and re -provis ion of South Essex College into Basildon Town  Centre.  
 In order to ensure that the detailed proposals for development in this location respond to the 
environmental  constraints  within  and adjacent  to this site, it is expected  that the requirements  of the 
relevant policies of this plan are met.  
 
Policy H7 : Land North and South of London Road, Vange  
 This allocation forms an extension to Vange with good access to local amenities, schools, Basildon 
Hospital and the Town Centre.  Land to the north and south of London Road is identified as being 
capable of delivering residential development, open space, as well as an extension to Vange 
Primary School which abuts the northern part of the allocation.  
 The 24.5ha allocation comprises t wo development areas and is capable of delivering around 650 
new homes.  The first development area, hereafter referred to as H7a, is located to the south of the 
London Road immediately adjacent to the existing urban area and Brickfield Road and covers 
approximately 1ha. The second development area, hereafter referred to as H7b, is around 23.5ha 
in size and  located to the north of the London Road. This parcel comprises the former Basildon Zoo 
which benefits fr om extant consent for low density housing and neighbouring  land at Tompkins 
Farms.  
 H7a will require a strong physical landscape buffer to the south of the site to manage the effects of 
noise and air pollution arising from the A13. Open space provision is to be located on land adjacent 
to the Grade II* L isted All Saints Church  which will remain within the extent of the Green Belt . This 
will help to preserve its historic setting and value despite the new development.   
 Development within H7b will also require a landscape buffer  towards  the south  west of the site to 
manage the effects of noise and pollution arising from the A13 and Five Bells junction. 
Development should avoid causing harm to the Local Wildlife Site  (LoWS)  designations 
surrounding the site , and existing open land adjacent to these designat ions should be retained for 
biodiversity enhancements improving the development’s integration with its surroundings and 
reduce its visual impact with adjacent open  land.  
 These development areas are within close proximity to Basildon Meadows SSSI and Langdo n Hills 
Country Park and mitigation will be required through contributions towards recreation amenities in 
response to expected increases in visitor numbers. All development proposals will need to be 
accompanied by ecological assessments, and any harm iden tified to any national and local wildlife 
designations will need to be addressed in accordance with policy NE 4.  
 CLH Pipeline System (CLH -PS) has provided a location plan extract of its pipeline apparatus which 
may be affected by housing allocations in the  borough. Th is plan shows that H 7 is in close 
proximity to CLH -PS apparatus. CLH-PS has  standard requirements for crossing or working in 
close proximity to its pipelines , in order to ensure that  the existing fuel pipeline crossing the 
Borough can be accomm odated within th e design of new development, together with  any 
accompanying mitigation that might be required,  It is therefore expected that the design and layout 
of development on this site must be in accordance with CLH -PS requirements for proposed 
devel opment sites, and must be carried out in consultation with CLH -PS. 
 The development areas will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of 
growth proposed. There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare an d 
primary school provision in the local area, which includes the provision of sufficient land for the 
proposed expansion to Vange Primary School in H7b. Development will also impact on the demand  
for GP provision within the area and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to  
 
114 accommodate growth at existing surgeries. There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution 
towards the expansion of GP services within the area to serve the resi dents of the site,  unless  the 
NHS  determine  that on-site provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that these sites are well served by existing power supply networks, 
but improvements  will need  to be made  to the drainage capacity  to accommoda te growth. They are 
also in a Critical  Drainage  Area. Compliance  with policy  CC4 is therefore  essential  in relation  to 
these  sites,  as is the need  for Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the nearby  water  recycling  centre 
can accommodate the growth proposed.  The developer may need to work with Anglian Water to 
enable this through improvements to the capacity of the water recycling  centre.  
 In terms  of highways,  access  arrangements  for these  sites will need  to be in accordance  with the 
Local Transport Plan Dev elopment Management Policies. As such it is expected that access to 
H7a, will be secured from the existing Brickfield Road. Access for H7b will utilise existing  access  for 
the former Basildon Zoo  and a second access point onto London Road.  In order  to ensure  that there  
is sufficient  highways  capacity within the local area to accommodate growth in this location, junction  
improvements  at the A13/A176  Five Bells Interchange North  will be required. Development in this 
location will be expected to make a con tribution towards these improvements, and also contribute 
towards improvements to cycling and public transport provision within the vicinity of the site in order 
to facilitate a modal shift towards active and sustainable transport modes.  
Policy H7  
Land Nor th and South of London Road, Vange  
 Land to the south of London Road, Vange, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H7a, 
will be developed for high quality housing at a density of 35duph to provide around 35 homes; and 
land to the north of Lond on Road, Vange, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H7b, 
will be developed for high quality housing at a density of 35duph to provide around 615  homes.  
 Access to these sites must be secured in accordance with the policies of the Highways Au thority. 
Access to H7a should be secured from the existing Brickfield Road , and H7b should utilise existing, 
as well as create a new access onto London Road.  
 Development area H7b will be expected to provide sufficient land to support the expansion of Vange  
Primary School. The development areas will also be expected to meet the full costs of expanding 
the primary school, and providing sufficient on -site early years provision to accommodate the needs  
of the development.  
 Development area H7b will be required to include open space provision within its area. H7a will be 
required to provide open space provision adjacent to All Saints Church, as identified on the Policies 
Map.  
 In order to ensure that development on these sites is well screened from noise and air p ollution 
arising  from the A13, and in order  to limit harm  to the open  landscape and wildlife designations  to the 
north,  landscape  buffers should  be provided  to the southern  boundary  of H7a and to the south -western  
and northern  boundaries of H7b. Where appr opriate, these landscape buffers should be multi -
functional and also seek to deliver open space, ecological and surface water management  benefits.  
 The design and layout of development must take into account the existing fuel pipelines in close 
proximity to  the site. Consideration will be given to the requirements of CLH Pipeline System, in 
order to ensure safe working in close proximity to buried CLH -PS pipelines  
 Development on these sites will be required to make contributions to mitigate the impact it wil l have 
on the nearby Basildon Meadow SSSI and Langdon Hills Country Park to the west.  
 Development on these sites will be required to contribute towards, and be aligned with 
improvements to the nearby A13/A176 Five Bells Interchange North . 
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential imp act, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where  
 
115 appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable mea sures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of these sites must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of  this plan.  
 
Policy H8 : West of Basildon  
 Land within this allocation has been identified as being suitable for the delivery of around 300 new 
homes. The site is adjacent to the urban area of Basildon and has good access to employment 
areas, local services and amenities includin g Laindon railway station and Laindon Town Centre, 
which is receiving significant investment to improve the retail offer and access to healthcare.  
 The site will also provide open space, which includes a 7.8ha community sports hub, in order to 
meet the need s arising from this site and to relocate sports facilities from Gardiners Lane South, as 
set out in policy  H5. The open space and community sports hub will be located on land to the east 
of the site with residential development located to the west.  
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area. The site will also impact on the deman d for GP provision within the area 
and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. 
There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP services 
within the Laindon area to serv e the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site 
provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensu re that this remains the  case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with sewage flooding arising. This is important due to the 
location of this site within a Cri tical Drainage Area. It is expected that measures will be  taken on -
site in accordance  with policy  CC4 to ensure  that surface  water  flood  risk does  not affect  future 
occupiers of the site and/or any existing properties  nearby.  
 This site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive. It is however recognised that there will be 
wildlife living within natural features of the site such as trees and hedgerows. Any application for  
the site must  therefore  be accompanied  by appropriate  ecological  assessments,  and must also seek 
to retain and enhance natural features where  wildlife  may be prevalent.  
 The allocation is in proximity to the historic settlement of Dunton and the surrounding landscape 
includes historic field patterns and also Medieval buildings includin g Dunton  Hall, St Mary  the Virgin  
Church  and the Old Rectory. Development will therefore be expected to respect the historic setting of 
these features and mitigate any harm through appropriate landscaping, layout and design. There is 
also potential for non -designated heritage assets of archaeological interest within the site and 
policy HE4 will be applicable.   
 In terms  of highways,  access  arrangements  for this site will need  to be in accordance  with the Local 
Transport Plan D evelopment Management Policies. Access to the eastern part of the site will be 
secured via a new link road from West Mayne and a secondary access will also be secured into the 
sports facilities from Mandeville Way. Access to the western part of the site wi ll be secured from 
Lower Dunton Road. Development in this location will be expected to make a contribution towards 
these junction improvements, and also contribute towards improvements to walking, cycling and 
public transport provision within the vicinity of the site in order to facilitate a modal shift towards 
active and sustainable transport modes.  
Policy H8  
West of Basildon  
 20ha of land to the west of Basildon, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H8, will be 
developed  to provide  around  300 high quality  homes  at a density  of around 30duph, as well as open  
 
116 space including a 7.8ha sports hub.  
 The on -site open space provision will be located to the eastern part of the site. It should provide a  new 
sports  hub incorporating the relocated sport s pitches from Gardiners Lane South, in accordance 
with policy  H5, and additional provision that meets the needs arising from this development.  
 Access will be secured from West Mayne for the residential element of this proposal to the east of 
the site, an d from Lower Dunton Road for development to the west of the site in accordance with 
the policies of the Highways Authority.  A secondary access will be secured to the sports facilities 
from Mandeville Way.    
 The design and layout of development must respe ct the nearby historic assets of the settlement of 
Dunton,  the medieval  field patterns  in the area and  medieval  buildings.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastr ucture provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expecte d standards of provision.  
 Development on this site must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of  this plan.  
 
Policy H9 : Land West of Steeple View, Laindon  
 Land adjacent to the established residential area of Steeple View has been identifi ed as a 
sustainable location for the delivery of 245 new homes and associated open space.    
 The requirements for on -site open space, active travel modes and surface water management 
should be integrated into the landscape and new green infrastructure provision made within the 
site, connected as appropriate into the wider countryside. A buffer to the south of the site to 
physically screen the development from noise and air quality issues associated with the A127 
should  be provided,  in addition  to a buffer on the western  boundary  to screen  long distance  views 
into the  site. 
 This site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive. It is however recognised that there will be 
wildlife living within natural features of the site such as trees and hedgerows.  Any application for  
the site must  therefore  be accompanied  by appropriate  ecological  assessments,  and must also seek 
to retain and enhance natural features where  wildlife  may be prevalent.  
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requiremen t for contributions towards education and childcare provision in the local 
area. Sites H9 and H10 , which are both located to the north of the A127, when combined will result 
in the  need for a pproximately  1 form of entry of additional capacity . Basildon Council considers that 
it would be appropriate to expand Noak Bridge Primary School but detailed feasibility work is 
required before Essex County Council, as the Local Education Authority,  can co nfirm this as their 
preferred option.  The school is on a constrained site, and its extension will therefore incur greater 
costs than would arise on a less constrained site e.g. 3G pitch provision, and more complex built 
structures. The development on sites  H9 and H10 will be expected to m eet the full costs of this 
extension, if proved feasible. The cost is likely to be higher per dwelling than the typical cost quoted 
in the Essex Developer Contributions Guidance . 
 The site will also impact on the demand  for GP provision within the area and the NHS have a 
strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. There will therefore 
be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP services within the Laindon area 
to serve the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the  case at  
 
117 the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with sewage flooding arising. This is important due to the 
location of this site within a Critic al Drainage Area. It is expected that measures will be  taken on -
site in accordance  with policy  CC4 to ensure  that surface  water  flood  risk does  not affect  future 
occupiers of the site and/or any existing properties  nearby.  
 In terms  of road infrastructure, upgrades to the A127  Dunton junction and improvements to  the 
Fortune of War junction  will be required to support growth in this location and on other nearby sites 
that contribute to traffic pressures at these junctions. Whilst this development would not be able to 
pay for these alone, it will be required to contribute towards local and st rategic highway upgrades, 
alongside other developments in the area, to ensure road safety and reduce congestion. 
Contributions towards improvements to cycling and public transport provision within the vicinity of 
the site will also be expected in order to facilitate a modal shift towards active and sustainable 
transport modes.  
 The Fortune of War junction on the A127, which is the nearest junction to the site allocation, has 
been identified in the UK Air Quality Plan  for Nitrogen Dioxide  as exceeding the sta tutory limit for 
NO 2 concentrations and therefore is recognised as posing a risk to human health. Whilst it is 
acknowledged that the A127 plays a strategic role and carries traffic from a wide area and will 
therefore require a coordinated approach to deali ng with this exceedance, it is important to avoid 
exposing more people to air quality levels that pose a risk to human health. NO 2 concentrations are 
expected to fall to within statutory levels by 2023. It is expected that this site will not come forward 
for development purposes until such time as air quality in the vicinity of the site has been shown to 
sit below these statutory limits.  
Policy H9  
Land West of Steeple View, Laindon  
 9ha of land to the west of Steeple  View,  Laindon,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation 
H9, will be developed to provide around 245 high quality homes at a density of  35duph.  
 In order to ensure residents of this development are not exposed to unsafe air quality, development 
on this site must not come forward until such time as air quality within the vicinity of the site has 
been shown to be within statutory limits for NO 2.  
 In order to ensure that development on this site is well screened from noise and air pollution arising  
from the A127  to the south,  and in order  to limit harm  to the open  landscape  to the north,  the existing  
tree belt to the south  and west should  be retained,  along  with the hedgerow  on Dunton  Road and  
incorporated into hard and soft landscape  buffers  along  these  boundaries.  Where  appropriate,  these  
landscape buffers  should  be multi -functional  and also seek  to deliver  open  space,  ecological  and 
surface  water management benefits.  
 Access  to the highway  network  will be provided  from Dunton  Road  to protect  the amenity of nearby 
residential properties. Contributions towards local highway network management will be sort to 
ensure the highway safety of road users and pedestrians , including extending the public footpath 
along Dunton  Road.  
 Development on this site w ill be required to contribute towards, and be aligned with improvements 
to the nearby A127 Fortune of  War and/or A127 Dunton  junctions  
 In the event that sufficient expansion of Noak Bridge Primary School to meet the demand for 
primary school places from th is development  and H10  proceeds, a commensurate developer 
contribution to this project will be required. The costs associated with this expansion may exceed 
normal standard costs due to the constrained nature of the primary school site. In any event, 
appro priate developer contributions will be sought towards education infrastructure and 
development of H9 will not be permitted until a scheme to provide sufficient school places to serve it 
has been agreed with Essex County Council.  
 Development  must  be support ed by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where  
 
118 appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitiga tion must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply wi th all other relevant policy requirements of  this plan.  
 
Polic y H10: Land East of Noak Bridge , Basildon  
 Land  adjacent to the existing urban area of Noak Bridge has been allocated to deliver around 400 
new homes .  On-site open space will also be required an d the site must incorporate  a buffer to the 
south and south east to physically screen the development from noise and air quality issues 
associated with the  A127.  
 CLH Pipeline System (CLH -PS) has provided a location plan extract of its pipeline apparatus wh ich 
may be affected by housing allocations in the borough. This plan shows that H10  is in close 
proximity to CLH -PS apparatus. CLH -PS has standard requirements for crossing or working in 
close proximity to its pipelines, in order to ensure that the existin g fuel pipeline crossing the 
Borough can be accommodated within the design of new development, together with any 
accompanying mitigation that might be required, It is therefore expected that the design and layout 
of development on this site must be in acco rdance with CLH -PS requirements for proposed 
development sites, and must be carried out in consultation with CLH -PS. 
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contribu tions towards education and childcare provision in the local 
area. Sites H9 and H10, which are both located to the north of the A127, when combined will result 
in the need for  approximately  1 form of entry  of additional capacity .  Basildon Council considers 
that it would be appropriate to expand Noak Bridge Primary School but detailed feasibility work is 
required before Essex County Council, the Local Education  Authority, can confirm this as their 
preferred option. The school is on  a constrained site, and its extension will therefore incur greater 
costs than would arise on a less constrained site e.g. 3G pitch provision, and more complex built 
structures. The development on sites H9 and H10  will be expected to meet the full costs o f this 
extension, if proved feasible. This cost  is likely to be higher per dwelling than the typical cost 
quoted in the Essex Developer Contributions Guidance . 
 In addition to education contributions, there will  also be a requirement for a contribution towa rds the 
expansion of GP services within the area to serve the residents of the se sites. This is in line with 
the NHS’s strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries.  
 In terms  of highways,  it is expected  that two points  of access are secured  to serve  development 
within H10, both from Wash Road.  Additionally, a footpath link will be provided into the existing 
Noak Bridge village.  
 The Publication Local Plan THIA  shows  that localised improvements to the Pipps Hill Interchange 
are necessary in order to provide the capacity  to accommodate growth in Noak Bridge. It will 
therefore be necessary for development on this site to contribute towards any localised 
improvements to the Pipps Hill Interchange. Alongside this, it will be necessa ry to ensure that the 
development is well served with access  to active and sustainable travel modes from early in the 
site's occupation.  
 Utility providers have indicated that the site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities.  There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient  to avoid  issues  associated  with surface  and sewage  flooding  arising. Ther e is surface water 
flood risk, and risks associated with reservoir flooding of the Pipps Hill (Aquatels) Lake, which 
means that the south -eastern part of the site should be used for open space purposes only.  It is 
expected  that measures  will be taken  on-site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that this 
flood risk does not affect future occupiers of the site and/or any existing properties  nearby.  
 The site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive. It is however recognised that there will be 
wildlife living within natural features of the site such as trees and hedgerows. Any application for 
development  must therefore be accompanied by appropriate ecological assessments, and must  
 
119 also seek to retain and enhance natural features where wildlife m ay be prevalent . 
 Development in  this location  will be in the vicinity  of the Noak Bridge Conservation Area , designated  
heritage  assets  and long distance views to St Mary Magdelene Church in Great Burstead to the 
north west. Proposed development must not ca use harm to the setting of the Conservation Area 
and all historic features should be respected in the layout and design of the development proposed 
for the whole  allocation.  
Policy H10  
Land East of Noak Bridge, Basildon  
 20ha  of land to the east of Noak  Bridge,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation H10, will 
be developed for around 400 high quality homes at 45duph. On -site open space provision will be 
secured towards the south -east and east of the site, aligning with those areas at risk of f looding.  
 In order  to ensure  that the development  does  not cause  the coalescence  of built form between  Noak 
Bridge  and Crays  Hill, a landscape buffer  must  be provided  to the east of the site.  A further  landscape 
buffer  must  be provided  between  development  in H10 and the Noak  Bridge  Nature  Reserve and any  
development  on this site must  be well screened  from noise  and air pollution  arising from  the nearby  
A127  to the south.  
 The design and layout of development must take into account the existing fuel pipelines  in close 
proximity to the site. Consideration will be given to the requirements of CLH Pipeline System, in 
order to ensure safe working in close proximity to buried CLH -PS pipelines.  
 The development should complement the existing character of the Noak Bridge village in  respects 
of building styles, street layout, open spaces and boundary treatments, with Wash Road forming a 
key frontage to ensure that the development relates well to its surroundings. Careful consideration 
must be given to the setting of the Noak Bridge Conservation Area, and the designated heritage 
assets at Laindon Pond and Daniels Farm on Wash Road in preparing the design and layout of 
development.  
 Access to the highway network will be provided from Wash Road. Additional pedestrian and cycling 
routes will be secured via a link to Bridge Street, and also through the extension of the public 
footpath on Wash Road to the highway access points for this site.   
 In the event that sufficient expansion of Noak Bridge Primary School to meet the de mand for 
primary school places from this development  and H9  proceeds, a commensurate developer 
contribution to this project will be required. The costs associated with this expansion may exceed 
normal standard costs, due to the constrained nature of the pr imary school site. In any event, 
appropriate developer contributions will be sought towards education infrastructure and 
development of H10 will not be permitted until a scheme to provide sufficient school places to serve 
it has been agreed with Essex Coun ty Council.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contri butions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements o f this plan.  
 
Policy H1 1: East of Basildon  
 H11 is a 53ha allocation located to the east of Basildon urban area  which is expected to deliver a 
residential extension to Pitsea comprising of 650 home s, a new local  centre , strategic open space , 
and a new commu nity hub which includes an education  and leisure provision . The allocation was 
identified in the preferred Development Framework as part of a much larger opportunity site which  
 
120 is set out in the High Level Development Framework for East Basildon  (HLDF)  (2017). The 
employment element of the preferred Development Framework for an extension to Burnt Mills  
employment area  is a strategic employment allocation which is located to the north of H1 1 and will 
be delivered through policy E6. Much of the remaining land  within the preferred Development 
Framework forms part of the designated Bowers Gifford and North Benfleet Neighbourhood Area. 
As such , the remaining residential provision in this area  will be delivered through an adopted 
Neighbourhood Plan . 
 The HLDF  sets out the overall development concept and development principles for this allocation . 
However the Council will require a more detailed Masterplan or Development Brief for the site to be 
produced prior to development to ensure the site is cohesive and  any necessary infrastructure is 
delivered alongside development. Phasing of H1 1 will be aligned with the provision of 
infrastructure, as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan . 
 The residential development  will be located on 30ha of land in the south ern part of the allocation 
adjacent to the existing urban  area of Pitsea  and will include a new local centre . The Eversley 
Leisure Centre and associated pitches currently within this area will be relocated to  form part of the 
new community  hub. The loss of sports pitches, particularly grass pitches, will be resisted by the 
Council in accordance with the NPPF, PPG  and advice by Sports England . Any sports provision 
that would otherwise be lost on site through redevelopment must be relocated p rior to  any 
residential  development taking place.  
 Access  into the residential extension should be secured from existing roads including Ilfracombe 
Avenue, Eversley Road and Woodcote Crescent. It is also important to provide access to local 
services and en sure connectivity between the new development and existing neighbourhoods in 
Pitsea.  
 In the north of the allocation will be  a new community hub on land either side of Trenham Avenue , 
adjacent to the urban area of Pitsea  and the new strategic open space whi ch will remain within the 
extent of the Green Belt . The hub  and strategic open space  will provide community playing pitch es 
that meet the needs arising from the new residential development and some of the relocated sports 
provision from Gardiners Lane Sout h, in accordance with policy H5 . It will also  include  the 
relocated Eversley Leisure Centre and associated pitches.   
 In addition to sports and leisure provision the community hub will also include land for D1 
educational use to accommodate additional primary and secondary school provision . There is 
opportunity to relocate an existing  primary  school  to the hub in order to meet  existing needs and 
those arising from the new development or  to provide an additional 1 form of entry primary school  
and associa ted early years provision . Access to the community hub should be secured from 
Tyefields and the upgraded Trenham Avenue , subject to highways approval.  
 This allocation  is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive. It is however recognised that there 
will be wildlife living within natural features of the development areas  such as trees and hedgerows. 
Any application for  development  must  therefore  be accompanied  by appropriate  ecological  
assessments,  and must also seek to retain and enhance natural featur es where  wildlife  may be 
prevalent.  In addition,  existing  tree belts  and hedgerows  around  the existing  field system  must  be 
retained, alongside significant trees and tree groups, including along the London Road  frontage.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this allocation  is well served by existing power supply and 
water recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the  
case at the time of development, and to ensure that any dra inage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with sewage flooding arising. This is important due to the 
location of this allocation  within a Critical Drainage Area. It is expected that measures will be  taken 
on-site in accordance  with policy  CC4 to ensure  that surface  water  flood  risk does  not affect  future 
occupiers of the site and/or any existing properties  nearby.  
 Development will also impact on the demand for GP provision within the area. The NHS have a 
strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. There will therefore 
be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP services within Pitsea to serve the 
residents of the site, unless the NHS determine that a standalone faci lity is  required.  
 It will be necessary to secure local upgrades to the highway and transport network to achieve 
suitable access to the allocation  by both private vehicles and by public transport, bicycle and for   
 
121 pedestrians. This will include a new east -west link road between Tyefields  and Pound Lane for 
public transport and active travel only to enable residents of Bowers Gifford  and North Benfleet  to 
access the new community hub, as well as upgrades and extensions to the PRoW  network.  
 In terms  of strateg ic highway  infrastructure  upgrades,  major changes to the road network would be 
required to enable all development to occur to the east of Basildon, including in this allocation, 
within the designated n eighbourhood area and within the employment allocation  at Burnt Mills , as 
set out in policy E6, and also the development proposed for Wickford.  This includes  a new grade  
separated  junction  on the A127  which will require new development to provide funding through 
developer contributions, and/or justification f or funding provision from the SELEP and/or 
Government.  Development within H1 1 will therefore be required to make contributions towards 
upgrades to the A127 junction.  
Policy H1 1 
East of Basildon  
 53ha of land to the east of Basildon , as identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation H1 1, will be 
expected to deliver  around  650 high quality  homes  at a density  of 35 duph , a new local centre, 
strategic open space , and a new community hub  comprising of leisure and educational faci lities. 
 Development of the site must be informed  by an up to date  Masterplan, which considers the 
strategic matters to deliver the site's policy requirements, including its scale and layout, massing, 
supporting facilities, open space, ecology,  drainage,  and internal  highway  and transport  network.  
 A 30ha residential extension to Pitsea to the south of the allocation  will include a new local centre  
with access from existing roads into the area. The relocation of sports pitches from this area to the 
community hub will be required prior to their redevelopment.  
 A new community hub providing leisure facilities and land for D1 educational use will be located  to 
the north of the allocation .  In terms of leisure provision, t he hub  will comprise of the relocated 
Eversley Leisure Centre  while t he strategic open space  will be expected to provide  a community 
playing pitch provision that meet s the needs arising from the residential development in H1 1 in 
accordance with HC2, as well as offset the loss of playing fields from elsewhere in H1 1 and 
accommodate the relocated sports pitches from Gardiners Lane, as set out in policy H5. The 
strategic open space will remain within the extent of the Green Belt . It is expected that any relocated 
provision will be replaced with equivalent or better fac ility provision both in terms of quality and 
quantity.   
 The hub will also comprise of a new or expanded relocated primary schoo l and associated early 
years provision  and land for the provision of a secondary school. A ccess to the hub will be secured 
from Tyefields and the upgraded Trenham Avenue.  
 The design and layout of development must respect the designated historic assets on the London 
Road, and ensure that elements of the historic environment and their setting are adequately 
protected from  harm.  
 Development will be required to  provide a new east -west link road for public transport and active 
travel only between Tyefields and Pound Lane. They will also be required to  contribute towards the  
delivery  of a new grade  separated  junction  of the A127  at Pound Lane/Cranfield  Park Road.  
 Development must be supported by sufficient infrastructure to ensure that it is sustainable, and 
does not exceed the capacity of existing infrastructure, including highways, community facilities and 
services. Proposals are re quired to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with 
nationally and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure 
provider where appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in t he form of 
contributions or other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants  should refer to 
the relevant policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply with all other relevant poli cy requirements of this  plan.  
  
 
122 Housing Growth in Wickford  
Policy H1 2: Land South of Wickford  
 29ha of land within this location has been identified as being suitable for the delivery of around 
1,100 new homes  and a primary school. The northern part of the site is adjacent to the urban area 
of Wickford while the Wick Country Park and farmland form the southern boundary. An open space 
provision to the south -west of the allocation, which will remain within the extent of the Green Belt, 
forms part of the requirements for this allocation, as does landscape buffers to the eastern and 
southern boundaries of the site. The total size of the allocation is 38ha.   
 The open space provision on land to the south -west of the alloca tion will  help the area stay semi  
natural and ensure separation between the development and the Fairmead Plotlands which are 
further westwards. The landscape buffers to the south and east of the site should be retained and 
enhanced to help ensure a defensi ble Green Belt boundary can be maintained during this plan  and 
not lead to coalescence with Basildon to the south, which is more important given that the urban 
area i s to expand eastwards under policy E6. In addition, the buffer to the south should act as a 
barrier to mitigate the impact that may otherwise be caused from noise and air pollution from the 
A127, and to soften the new settlement boundary against the Wick Country Park to the south.  
 Opportunities to retain, enhance and extend existing  hedgerows  and PRoW  forming  an east -west 
green corridor between the existing and new urban areas should be explored and integrated into 
the development. Development will also be expected to incorporate enhancements to the entrance of 
the Country Park from its junction  with Tresco Way/Mersea Crescent to ensure improved access to 
the facility.  
 This site is not known  to be highly  ecologically  sensitive,  however  it does  border  the Wick  Country 
Park, which is a Local Wildlife Site (LoWS), and the North Benfleet Brook runs in a north easterly 
direction through the eastern part of the site before joining the River Crouch. It is therefore 
recognised that  there  will be wildlife  living  within  natural  features  of the site such  as trees, hedgerows 
and watercourses.  Any application  for development must therefore be accompanied by appropriate 
ecological assessments, and must also seek to retain and enhance natural features where wildlife 
may be prevalent in accordance with policy NE 4. Opportunities to deliver ecological enhancement 
of the river corridor should also be explored. Additionally, its western extent is on  the edge  of 
Critical  Drainage  Area  BAS22  and therefore  it must  ensure  that measures  to manage  land drainage  
are installed. The layout of the site should also ensure that flood risk associated with North Benfleet 
Brook does not affect future occupiers of the site and/or any existing properties nearby and that the 
maintenance of the river corridor is not impeded.   
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well serve d by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues  associated with surface and sewage flooding arising. It is expected  that 
measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not 
affect future occupiers of the site and/or any existing properties nearby. There remai ns a need 
however  for Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the serving  water  recycling  centre  can accommodate 
the growth proposed. The developer may need to work with Anglian Water to enable this through 
improvements to the capacity of the water recycling ce ntre prior to  development.  
 The site will also impact on the demand for GP provision within the area. The NHS have a strategy 
of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. There will therefore be a 
requirement for a contribution toward s the expansion of GP services to serve the residents of the 
site, unless the NHS determine that a standalone facility is  required.  
 In terms of highways, access will be taken from appropriate points along Cranfield Park Road and 
Tresco Way, which will also  be the key frontage and will need to be designed in accordance with 
the Local Transport Plan Development Management Policies. In order to ensure that there is 
sufficient highways capacity within the local area to accommodate growth in this location , and to 
improve the  capacity  and flow of local roads  serving  the rest of Wickford,  major changes to the 
strategic and local highway network is needed. This  includes  the provision  of a new grade  
separated  junction  on the A127  at Cranfield  Park Road and Poun d Lane, upgrades to the 
A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange, together with improvements to the A132 between the A127 and  
 
123 Golden Jubilee Way junction.  
 Development  of this site  will be expected  to make  a contribution  towards  the local and strategic road 
network  improvements . Phasing of the site will be aligned with the provision of infrastructure, as set 
out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. It is expected that proportionate  contributions  will also be 
made  towards  improvements  to walking , cycling  and public  transport access within the vicinity of the 
site, particularly towards Wickford town centre to the north and the A127 Enterprise Corridor to the 
south. These will be required in order to facilitate a modal shift towards active and sustainable 
transport  mode s. 
Policy H1 2 
Land south of Wickford  
 29ha of land  to the south  of Cranfield  Park Road,  Wickford,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with the 
notation H1 2, will be developed  to provide  around  1,100  high quality  homes  at a density  of 45duph  
and a primary school . An open  space provision will be located on land in  the south -western part  of 
the allocation  which will remain within the extent of the Gree n Belt.  
 Access should be secured from Tresco Way and Cranfield Park Road in accordance with the 
policies of the Highways Authority.  
 2.1ha of D1 education land for the provision of primary school and early years childcare places will 
be provided on -site, as specified by Essex County Council, to align with the educational needs 
arising from the  development.  
 In order to ensure  that development  on this site is well screened  from noise  and air pollution  arising 
from the A127 to the south, and in order to limit harm to the open landscape and strategic Green 
Belt gap to the south separating Wickford and Basildon, landsc ape buffers should be provided to 
the southern  and eastern  boundaries  of the site. These  landscape  buffers  should  be multi -functional 
and should also seek to deliver open space, ecological and surface water management  benefits, as 
well as ecological enhanc ements to the river corridor. The amenity and open space provision should 
be complimentary to the semi natural facilities provided at the nearby Wick Country Park the access 
to which should be enhanced from Tresco Way.  
 The layout of development must have regard to the level of flood risk across the site associated with 
the North Benfleet Brook and development should be designed to ensure sufficient access is 
provided to the river channel for maintenance.  
 Development on this site will be required to contrib ute towards,  and be phased  to align  with, the 
provision  of a new grade  separated  junction of  the A127  at Pound  Lane/Cranfield  Park Road  to serve  
Wickford  and east of Basildon.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed me thodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to t he relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan.  
 
Policy H1 3: Land North of Southend Road, Shotgate  
 Land within this allocation has been identified as being suitable for the delivery of around 280 new 
homes and open space. The allocation covers 17ha of land adjacent to the Shotgate area of 
Wickford.  
 A substantial landscape buffer must be provided to the  north and east of the site to reduce impacts 
of odour, air and noise pollution on residential amenity from the Shotgate Water Recycling Centre,  
 
124 the High Voltage Transmission Lines (HVTL) and from the elevated A130 to the east. It should 
retain and  enhance  the existing  hedgerows,  tree groups  and PRoW , and be multi -functional by 
providing strategic open space, PRoW , ecological and surface water management benefits. The 
landscape buffer should also help ensure a defensible Green Belt boundary can be maintained 
during the Local P lan.  
 This site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it does adjoin l and owned by 
Essex Wildlife Trust and designated as a Local Wildlife Site  (LoWS)  at Giddings Copse to the north 
and to the River Crouch. It is therefore recognised that there will be wildlife living within natural 
features of the site such as trees, hedger ows and watercourses.  Any application  for the site must  
therefore  be accompanied  by appropriate  ecological assessments, and must also seek to retain 
and enhance natural features where wildlife may be prevalent in accordance with policy  NE4. 
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area, to be achieved through the expansion of existing  schools. The site will 
also impact on the demand  for GP provision within the area and the NHS have a strategy of 
expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. There will therefore be a 
requirement for a contribution towards the expansio n of GP services within the Wickford area to 
serve the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the  case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage flooding ar ising, given the  River 
Crouch's location to the north. It is expected that measures will be taken on -site in accordance with 
policy CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not affect future occupiers of the site and/or any existing 
properties nearby. The develo per may need to work with Anglian Water to enable this through 
improvements to the capacity of the water recycling centre prior to development. The presence of 
HVTL to the east will mean at least minimum separation standards between the line’s route and 
new properties will have to be adhered to in the design of the new development to the satisfaction 
of National Grid and the Health & Safety Executive.  
 In terms of highways, access for this site will be secured from the A129/Southend Road, which will  
also serve as a key frontage , and will need  to be designed  in accordance  with the Local  Transport Plan 
Development Management Policies. In order to ensure that there is sufficient highways capacity  
within  the local area to accommodate  growth  in this location , and to improve  the capacity and flow 
of local roads serving the rest of Wickford, major changes to the strategic and local highway 
network will be needed. This  includes the consideration of a new grade separated junction on the 
A127 at Cranfield Park Road and Pound Lane, upgrades to the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange, 
together with improvements to the A132.  
 Develo pment on this site will therefore be expected to make a contribution towards improvements 
to the local and strategic  road network  as appropriate.  Proportionate  contributions  towards 
improvements to walking, cycling and public transport access within the vicinity of the site, 
particularly towards Wickford Town Centre to the east and the Wickford Business Park to the south 
in order to facilitate a modal shift towards active and sustainable transport modes will also be  
required.  
Policy H1 3 
Land North of Southend Road, Shotgate  
 17ha of land to the north of Southend Road, Shotgate, Wickford, as identified on the Policies Map 
with the notation H1 3, will be de veloped to provide around 280 high quality homes at a density of 
35duph, and strategic open space incorporating formal and informal areas.  
 Access to the site should be secured from Southend  Road in accordance with the policies of the 
Highways Authority.  
 In order  to ensure  that the impacts on new homes from noise  and odour pollution  arising from the 
Shotgate Water Recycling Centre are minimised, the strategic open space provision will be located 
to the northern part of the site. A landscape buffer should also be provided to the eastern boundary  
 
125 of the site to ensure that development o n this site is well screened from noise and air pollution 
arising from the A130. Landscape  buffers  should  be multi -functional  and should  also seek  to deliver 
new open space, Public Rights of Way, ecological and surface water management benefits . 
 Proposals must be informed  by Odour  Plume  Modelling  to the satisfaction  of Anglian  Water if new 
homes are to be located within 400m of the Shotgate Water Recycling Centre , and any mitigation 
works  required  to enable  development  closer  to the centre  must  be completed  and operational, prior 
to the site’s residential  occupation.  
 The siting of new homes should ensure the minimum distances from the High  Voltage  Transmission  
Lines is maintained,  including  maintaining  the recommended  separation  distances advised by 
National  Grid and the Health and Safety  Executive.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply with all oth er relevant policy requirements of this  plan.  
 
Policy H1 4: Land South of Barn Hall, Wickford  
 Land within this allocation has been identified as being suitable for the delivery of around 540 new 
homes and replacement strategic open space provision. The allo cation covers 14ha of land part of 
which was  previously designated  as an Area  of Special  Reserve in the Basildon District Local Plan.  
 The open space provision will be delivered to the west of the development area on land within the 
Green Belt. The open space should retain and enhance the  existing  hedgerows,  tree groups  and 
PRoW  and connect to the existing neighbourhoods of north -west Wickford. This will be achieved by 
providing multi user access through the developed area of H1 4 into the open space.  
 A key component of delivering this allocation will be the relocation of the Barn Hall Recreation 
Ground and its facilities to the west of the housing development , the majority of which will be on 
land within Green Belt and allocated for open space. The loss o f sports pitches, particularly grass 
pitches, will be resisted by the Council in accordance with the NPPF, Planning Practice Guidance  
and advice by Sports England. Any sports provision that would otherwise be lost on -site through 
redevelopment must be relo cated commensurate to  any residential  development taking place.  
 This site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it is recognised that there will be 
wildlife living within natural features of the site such as trees and hedgerows. Any ap plication for  
the site must  therefore  be accompanied  by appropriate  ecological  assessments,  and must also seek 
to retain and enhance natural features where  wildlife  may be prevalent in accordance with policy  
NE4. 
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area. The site will also impact on the demand  for GP provision within th e area 
and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. 
There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP services 
within the Wickford area to serve the residents of the site , unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site 
provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage flooding arising. It is expected  that 
measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy  CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not  
 
126 affect  future  occupiers  of the site and/or  any existing  properties  nearby.  There  remains  a need  for 
Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the serving  water  recycling  centre  can accommodate  the growth 
proposed.  The developer  may need  to work with Anglian  Water  to enable  this through  improvements to 
the capacity of the water recycling centre prior to  development.  
 Principal access for this site should be secured from Haslemere Road and Farnham Avenue, and 
will need  to be designed  in accordance  with the Local  Transport  Plan Development  Management 
Policies. In order to ensure that there is sufficient highways capacity within the local area to 
accommodate  growth  in this location,  and to improve  the capacity  and flow of local roads  serving 
the rest of Wickford, major changes to  the strategic  and local highway  network  will be needed in 
Wickford . This includes  alterations to the A132/Runwell Road roundabout which is in  the vicinity  of 
this site. In addition, enhancements are required to Wickford  Town Centre, the northern extent of 
which is only a few hundred metres from the southern extent of this site.  
 Development on this site will therefore be expected to make a contribution towards improvements 
to the local and strateg ic road network as appropriate. Proportionate contributions towards 
improvements to walking, cycling and public transport access within the vicinity of the site, 
particularly towards Wickford Town Centre to the south will also be required in order to facil itate a 
modal shift towards active and sustainable transport  modes.  
Policy H1 4 
Land South of Barn Hall, Wickford  
 14ha allocation of land  south  of Barn Hall, Wickford,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation  
H14, will be developed  to provide  around  540 high quality  homes  developed  at a density  of 45duph 
and new and enhanced open space.  
 Access to this site will be secured from Haslemere Road and Farnham Avenue in accordance with 
the policies of the Highways Authority.  
 The Barn  Hall Recreation  Ground  will be relocated to the west of the development area on land 
identified as open space and Green Belt on the Policies Map. Its relocation must be commensurate 
to the redevelopment of its current site and it should form part of the new strategic open  space for 
north Wickford with new connections to the existing Public Rights of Way. It is expected that any 
relocated provision will be replaced with equivalent or better facility provision both in terms of quality 
and quantity. It will be in addition to any sports provision required to meet the needs arising from the 
new development.  
 A landscape  buffer  should  be provided  to the western  boundary  of the development area.  This 
landscape  buffer should  seek  to deliver  ecological  and surface  water management  benefits in 
conjunction with the proposed open space uses located further west of the development area.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructur e, including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provisi on. 
 Development of this site must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan. 
 
Policy H1 5: Land North of London Road, Wickford  
 This allocation is located  to the west of Wickford  and comprises land between  Castledon  Road  and 
Sudgen  Avenue. Development  of this site will complete  the urban  infilling  between existing ribbon 
development along London Road, whilst also providing new open space.  
 The site is suitable for the delivery of around 300 new homes, subject to a landscape buffer b eing 
provided to the north to accommodate the floodplain of the River Crouch, and the retention of  
 
127 natural and semi -natural woodland to the east. The landscape buffer  will provide the locally 
accessible informal open space. The site is also expected to retain and enhance  the existing  
hedgerows,  tree groups  and PRoW , as well as extend these linear features to promote better 
access to the countryside and rural  landscape.  
 The site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive,  however  it is recognised  that there  will be 
wildlife  living  within  natural  features  of the site such as trees and hedgerows. Any application for the 
site must therefore be accompanied by appropriate  ecological  assessments,  and must also seek to 
retain and enhance natural features where  wildlife may be prevalent in accordance with policy  NE4. 
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area. The site will also impact on the demand  for GP provision within the area 
and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. 
There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution t owards the expansion of GP services 
within the Wickford area to serve the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site 
provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage f looding arising. It is expected  that 
measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not 
affect  future  occupiers  of the site and/or  any existing  properties  nearby,  given  the presence  of the 
River  Crouch  functiona l floodplain  outside  the developable  area.  There  remains  a need  for Anglian 
Water  to be satisfied  that the serving  water  recycling  centre  can accommodate  the growth  proposed. 
The developer may need to work with Anglian Water to enable this through improvements to the 
capacity of the water recycling centre prior to  development.  
 In terms  of highways,  principal  access  arrangements  for the site will be secured  from Castledon  
Road  and London  Road.  Access points and internal roads will need to be designed in accordance 
with the Local Transport Plan Development Management Policies and all roads should provide 
frontage development . In order to ensure that there is sufficient highways capacity within  the local 
area to accommodate  growth  in this location , and to improve  the capacity  and flow of local roads 
serving the rest of Wickford, major changes are needed to the strategic and local highway network 
in Wickford. This includes the consideration of a new  grade separated junction on the A127 at 
Cranfield Park Road and Pound Lane,  upgrades  to the A127/A130 Fairglen Interchange,  together  
with improvements  to the A132  near Nevendon and Runwell.  
 Development on this site will therefore be expected to make a contribution towards improvements  
to the local and strategic  road network  as appropriate.  Proportionate contributions towards 
improvements to cycling and public transport access within the vicinity of the site, particularly 
towards Wickford Town Centre to the east in order to facilitate a modal shift towards active and 
sustainable transport modes will also be required.  
Policy H1 5 
Land North of London Road, Wickford  
 14ha allocation on land to the north  of London  Road,  Wickford,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with 
the notation  H15, will be developed at a density of 35duph to provide around 300 high quality 
homes.  
 Access to the site should be secured from Castledon Road and London Road, through the upgrade 
of existing access points to standards that meet the requirements of the Highways Authority.  
 A landscape buffer should be provided to the northern boundary of the site. This buffer should be 
multi -functional  and should  also seek  to deliver  informal open  space,  ecological,  flood  risk 
management  and surface water management  benefits.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally  
 
128 and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitiga tion must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply wi th all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan.  
 
Housing Growth in Billeric ay 
Policy H1 6: Land North East of Potash Road, Billericay  
 Land within this allocation has been identified as being suitable for the delivery of around 255 new 
homes. In  order to mitigate  the visual  impact  that development  would  otherwise have  on the area,  
landscape  buffers  incorporating  open  spaces  and green  corridors  will be required, together with the 
retention of any hedgerows and notable tree  groups, particularly along the boundaries of the site.  
 The site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it is recognised that there will be 
wildlife living within natural features of the site such as trees and hedgerows. Any application for  
the site must  therefore  be accompanied  by appropriate  ecological  assessments,  and must also seek 
to retain and enhance natural features where wildlife may be prevalent in accordance with policy 
NE4. Additionally, it is on the edge of Critical Drainage Area BAS3 and therefore it m ust ensure 
that measures to manage land drainage are installed. Compliance with policy CC4 is therefore 
essential in relation to this  site. 
 CLH Pipeline System (CLH -PS) has provided a location plan extract of its pipeline apparatus which 
may be affected by  housing allocations in the Borough. This plan shows that H 16 is in close 
proximity to CLH -PS apparatus. CLH -PS has standard requirements for crossing or working in 
close proximity to its pipelines, in order to ensure that the existing fuel pipeline crossing the 
Borough can be accommodated within the design of new d evelopment, together with any 
accompanying mitigation that might be required, It is therefore expected that the design and layout 
of development on this site must be in accordance with CLH -PS requirements for proposed 
development sites, and must be carried  out in consultation with CLH -PS. 
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area.  The site will also impact on the demand  for GP provision within the area 
and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. 
There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP s ervices 
within the Billericay area to serve the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site 
provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. Ther e is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage flooding arising. It is exp ected  that 
measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not 
affect  future  occupiers  of the site and/or  any existing  properties  nearby.  There  remains  a need  for 
Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the serving  water  recycling  centre  can accommodate  the growth 
proposed.  The developer  may need  to work with Anglian  Water  to enable  this through  improvements to 
the capacity of the water recycling centre prior to  development.  
 In terms  of highways,  principal  access  will be secured  from Potash  Road and it will need to be 
designed in accordance with the Local Transport Plan Development Management Policies. In order 
to ensure that there is sufficient highways capacity within  the local area to accommodate  growth  in 
this location  and to improve  the capacity  and flow of local roads serving the rest of Billericay, 
development in this location will be expected to  make a contribution towards the improvements to 
the local and strategic road network as appropriate. Proportionate  contributions towards 
improvements to cycling and public transport access within the vicinity of the site in order to 
facilitate a modal shift towards active and sustainable transport modes will also be required.  
  
 
129 Policy H1 6 
Land North East of Potash Road , Billericay  
 11ha  of land north  east of Potash  Road,  Billericay,  as identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation  
H16, will be developed  to provide  around  255 high quality  homes  at a density  of 35duph.   
 Access to this site must be secured from Potash Road, utilising existing access points.  
 Landscape  buffers  should  be provided  along  the boundaries  of the site. These  landscape  buffers 
should  be multi -functional  and should  also seek  to deliver  open  space,  ecological  and surface  water 
management  benefits.  
 The design and layout of development must take into account the existing fuel pipelines in close 
proximity to the site. Consideration will be given to the requirements of CLH Pipeline System, in 
order to en sure safe working in close proximity to buried CLH -PS pipelines.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are id entified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must  also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan.  
 
Policy H1 7: South West Billericay  
 H17 is the largest site allocation in the Local Plan for Billericay and consists of five distinct areas. 
The allocation builds on the South West Bille ricay High Level Development Framework  (2017) . The 
allocation covers approximately 95ha of land, some of which will remain within the extent of the 
Green Belt, and seeks to deliver around 1,700  new homes across four residential extensions to the 
south west of Billericay. The allocation will also deliver  a new primary school and early years 
provision, relocated tennis and cricket clubs, a south west relief road and a network of open space 
provisi on.  
 The relief road , stretching from the A129/London Road heading towards Brentwood, south -
eastwards to the junction of the B1007/Laindon Road with A176/Noak Hill Road , is key to the 
release of land for development in this location. It will provide both a ccess to the development 
sites, and also help to alleviate the impacts of growth on the nearby Sun Corner junction in 
Billericay Town Centre, which experiences significant congestion. Various alternative highway 
options were tested prior to the identificat ion of the need for a relief route, however mitigation 
testing indicated that these would be insufficient to address current congestion and provide 
capacity for growth.  
 Various options have been considered with regard to the relief road, and the most appropriate, 
deliverable option , as set out in the South West Billericay High Level Development Framework , will 
pass along Frithwood Lane from its junction with Tye Common Road to development area H1 7d. 
This will  require the widening of Frithwood Lane , within its highways boundary , to its junction with 
Tye Common Road . This section of the relief road will not be as wide as the rest of the route , due 
to existing residential development . Therefore a separate route will be required to make provision 
for cyclin g and a bridleway.  
 The relief road acts to define the development area in this location and form s much of the  revised 
Green Belt boundary for south west Billericay. The  allocation consists of four residential extensions 
and also land allocated for the relocation of the cricket club and tennis club to the west of the 
residential allocations . Whilst this land is allocated for the provision of these clubs, it will remain 
within the extent of the Green  Belt to ensure that the land remains protected from future 
redevelopment. Access to these sport facilities will be secured  to the satisfaction of the Highway 
Authority.   
 
130 
 The first development area,  hereafter referred to as H1 7a, is an 18ha residential ext ension on  land 
west of Mountnessing  Road. The site is capable of delivering around 540 new homes alongside 
open space provision. Development will be expected to retain and enhance existing tree belts, field 
boundaries, hedgerows and the PRoW  crossing the s ite. The majority of open space provision , 
including the relocated cricket club  will be located on land to the west of the allocation and will 
remain within the extent of the Green Belt. It will form part of a multi -functional landscape buffer to 
the west of the residential development, which should also seek to  deliver ecological and surface 
water management benefits. In terms of highways, principal access for H17a should be secured 
from A129/London Road at the new junction where the relief road meets Lond on Road from the 
south. A secondary vehicular access could be taken from Mountnessing Road to the satisfaction of 
the Highway Authority.  
 The second  development area, hereafter referred to as H1 7b, is a 17ha residential extension on 
land south of London Ro ad which includes the current location of the cricket and tennis clubs. The 
site has been identified as being suitable for the delivery of around 290 new homes following the 
relocation of the cricket club and tennis club. The loss of sports pitches will be  resisted by the 
Council in accordance with the NPPF, P PG and advice by Sports England . Any sports provision 
that would otherwise be lost on site through redevelopment must be relocated and be in 
operational use prior to  any development taking place.  
 In addition to residential development, this site will be required to deliver a new primary school and 
early year’s provision, as it is the best location within the wider H1 7 to meet the requirements of the 
Essex County Council’s Developers’ Guide to Infrastr ucture Contributions . This school will serve 
the needs of the entire development, and the developers of all development areas within H1 7 will 
therefore be expected to contribute towards the costs of this provision. A total of 2.1ha is required 
to meet the needs arising from this site for primary and early year’s provision.  
 Local open space provision is also required within this development area, along with a new 
landscape buffer on the western boundary. It should be multi -functional and should seek to  deliver 
open space, ecological and surface water management benefit. The site will also be expected to 
retain and enhance existing tree belts, field boundaries, hedgerows and the PRoW  crossing the 
site.  In terms of highways, this site will be accessed via the new relief road which will form the 
edge of the development area. Secondary points of access to the site should be taken from Heath 
Close and Mountnessing Road to provide integration with the neighbouring urban area to the 
satisfaction of the Highway Autho rity.  
 The third development area, hereafter referred to as H1 7c, is a 14ha residential extension on land 
west of Tye Common Road. The site is capable of delivering around 350 new homes with the open 
space provision integrated within the development and al so located to the western boundar y of the 
site within the extent of the Green Belt , as part of a multi -functional landscape buffer. . It should also 
seek to  deliver ecological and surface water management benefits and retain existing tree belts 
and hedgerow s. In terms of highways, principal access for H1 7c should be secured from the new 
relief road which will form the western edge of  the development area. Secondary access points 
could also be taken from Tye Common Road and/or the upgraded Blunts Wall Road to  the 
satisfaction of the Highway Authority.  
 The fourth  development area, hereafter referred to as H1 7d, is the southern residential extension to 
Billericay on land east of Frithwood Lane. The allocation is 22ha of land capable of delivering 
around 520 new homes, as well as a substantial landscape buffer to the south of the development 
area. H17d will also be expected to deliver a green corridor through the site accommodating the  
tree belt, hedgerows,  PRoW  and landscape buffer. The landscape buffer should be  multi -functional 
and also seek to deliver open space, ecological and surface water management benefit. An 
Archaeological Assets  and Impact Assessment (2016) has identified the potential for 
archaeological assets within the site due to previous finds withi n, and on land surrounding the site. 
As such a field evaluation in addition to an archaeological assessment must be undertaken and 
form part of any application, in accordance with policy HE4.  
 In addition to contributions to the provision of the relief roa d, new development will also be 
expected to make a contribution towards the improvements to the local and strategic road network 
as appropriate. This is in order to ensure that there is sufficient highways capacity within the local 
area to accommodate grow th in this location. Proportionate contributions towards improvements to 
walking, cycling and public transport  access  within  the vicinity  of each site  in order  to facilitate  a 
modal  shift towards  active  and sustainable transport modes will also be  required.   
 
131 
 This allocation  will require  community infrastructure  provision  to support  the development  proposed.  
In terms of early years and primary education the provision will be on site, as set out in relation to 
parcel H1 7b.   
 The allocation will also im pact on the demand for GP provision within the wider area. The NHS 
have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries however 
owing to level of development planned for Billericay it is likely that a new GP hub will be requir ed to 
serve residents of this allocation. Consultation with the NHS will be needed to establish whether 
on-site provision will be required and to identify a suitable location for it within the allocation. If the 
NHS determine that an on -site provision is n ot required, all development will be expected to make 
a contribution towards the expansion of GP services within the area to serve the new residents.  
 Utility providers have indicated that the allocation is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on -site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage flo oding arising. It is expected  that 
measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not 
affect  future  occupiers  of the site and/or  any existing  properties  nearby.  There  remains  a need  for 
Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the serving  water  recycling  centre  can accommodate  the growth 
proposed.  The developer  may need  to work with Anglian  Water  to enable  this through  improvements to 
the capacity of the water recycling centre prior to  development.  
 The allocation will be required to bring Frith Wood into active management for the lifetime of the 
development and ideally beyond , in accordance with the NPPF. Frith Wood is a designated Ancient 
Woodland and Local Wildlife Site  (LoWS)  and documented evidence set out in  the Historic 
Environment Assessment of Frith Wood, Billericay (2018)  reports that the area has been wooded 
since  at least 1260AD whilst ecological work has indicated the potential presen ce of dorm ice within 
the site.  Any recreational impacts on Frith Wood a nd Laindon Common , which is also a designated 
LoWS,  arising from population growth will also need to be managed for the purpose of ensuring the 
integrity and well -being of the se areas  and their nature conservation ensemblage. Beyond this, the 
allocation is  not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it is recognised that there will be 
wildlife living within natural features of the developable area such as trees and hedgerows. Any  
application relating to this allocation  must  therefore  be accompani ed by appropriate ecological  
assessments,  and must seek to retain and enhance natural features where wildlife may be 
prevalent in accordance with policy NE4. Whilst  the allocation  is not in any Critical  Drainage  Areas,  
development  must  nevertheless  ensure  that measures  to manage land drainage are installed.  
Policy H1 7 
South West Billericay  
 Approximately 95ha of land to the south west of Billericay will create a series of linked, urban 
extensions to the town with a new relief road and a network of new open s paces. The allocation will 
be expected to deliver:  
a. around 1,700  high quality homes at an average density of 35dph across four residential 
extensions;  
b. 2.1ha for D1 education uses within H1 7b; 
c. the relocation of the cricket club and tennis club to land west o f the residential 
allocations ; 
d. open space provision and landscape buffers; and  
e. a new relief road extending from A129 London Road to the B1007/Laindon Road/ 
A176/Noak Hill Road junction.  
 Development  as part of this allocation  must be informed by  an up to date Masterplan, which 
considers the strategic matters to deliver the site's policy requirements, including its scale and 
layout, massing, supporting facilities, open space, ecology,  drainage,  and internal  highway  and 
transport  network.  
 The relocation of t he cricket club and tennis club will be accommodated on land to the west of the 
residential allocations , as identified on the Policies Map. It is expected that any relocated provision 
will be replaced with equivalent or better facility provision both in te rms of quality and quantity. This 
land will remain within the extent of the Green Belt and the facilities should have access  
 
132 arrangements which meet the satisfaction of the Highway Authority.  
 Land west of Mountnessing Road, as identified on the Policies M ap with the notation H1 7a, will form 
a residential extension of around 540 new homes accessed from London Road with Mountnessing 
Road providing secondary access. Some open space provision should be integrated within the 
development area, but additional ope n space and the relocated cricket club is expected to be 
provided to the west of the development area within the extent of the Green Belt.  
 Land south of London Road, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H1 7b, will form a 
residential extensio n of around 290 new homes and include 2.1ha of land for D1 education uses. 
The new school provided on the D1 education land is expected to accommodate children and 
primary pupils from the entire site, with all developers contributing proportionately. To un lock 
development, the cricket club and tennis club must be relocated prior to any redevelopment of their 
current locations. Access to H1 7b will be taken from the new relief road to the west of the 
development area.  
 Land west of Tye Common Road, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H1 7c, will form 
a residential extension of around 350 new homes. Access should be taken from the new relief road 
to the west of  the development, as well as from Tye Common Road and/or the upgraded Blunts 
Wall Road.  
 Land east of Frithwood Lane, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H1 7d, will form a 
residential extension of around 520 new homes which is served by the new relief road. 
Development will be expected to provide a green corridor throu gh the site incorporating the Public 
Rights of Way, existing landscape features and new open space. Due to the likelihood of 
archaeological assets within the site a field evaluation will be required as part of any application in 
accordance with policy HE4.   
 Landscape buffers should be provided to the western boundaries of H1 7a, H1 7b and H1 7c and to 
the southern boundar y of H1 7d. These landscape  buffers  should  be multi -functional  and should  also 
seek  to deliver  open  space,  recreation, ecological and surface water management  benefits. Existing 
Public Rights of Ways  should be retained and enhanced, where possible. T ree belts, hedgerows 
and other natural landscape features should also be retained and enhanced.  
 The allocation will be required to bring the ancient  woodland of Frith Wood into active  woodland 
management, with provisions put in place for this management to be ongoing for the lifetime of the 
development.  
 Additional GP services will be required to serve the residents of the  allocation, either on -site wi th a 
new GP hub or through contributions to expand existing facilities in Billericay, as specified by the 
NHS.  
 All development areas will be expected to contribute towards the delivery of the new relief road 
including all associated junctions  and the wide ning of Frithwood Lane . It is expected that a cycle 
way and bridleway will be required as part of the delivery of the relief road. Where the section of the 
relief road is too narrow a segregated cycle  way and bridleway will be required.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this allocation must comply with all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan.  
 
 
 
  
 
133 Policy H1 8: Land South of Windmill Heights, Billericay  
 Land adjacent to the South Green neighbourhood of Billericay has been identified as being a 
sustainable location for the delivery of around 200 new homes and associated open space. The 
site is contained by the e xisting urban area and the road network, and represents a logical 
extension to the existing urban area which will align with the southernmost extent of allocation H1 7, 
to the west. There will be landscape impacts arising from development on the western par t of this 
site. However, there is an existing hedgerow and veteran trees which can be retained on the 
western boundary to reduce the visual impact, and this can be supplemented with additional 
landscaping along this boundary.  
 On-site open space and surface water management should be integrated into the landscape of the 
site. The PRoW  along the north eastern edge of the site should be retained and enhanced to 
provide connectivity between the new development and the adjacent resi dential area.  
 The site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it is recognised that there will be 
wildlife living within natural features of the site such as trees and hedgerows. Any application for  
the site must  therefore  be accompanie d by appropriate  ecological  assessments,  and must also seek 
to retain and enhance natural features where wildlife  may be prevalent  in accordance  with policy  
NE4. This site is on the edge  of Critical  Drainage Area BAS5, and must therefore ensure that 
measur es to manage land drainage are installed or enhanced. Compliance with policy CC4 is 
therefore  essential.  
 An Archaeological Assets and Impact Assessment has identified the potential for archaeological 
assets within the site due to local heritage and previous finds on land surrounding the site. As such, 
a field evaluation in addition to an archaeological assessment must be undertaken and form part of 
any application, in accordance with policy HE4. The evaluation may require a geophysics survey 
and targ eted trial trenching.  
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area. The site wi ll also impact on the demand  for GP provision within the area 
and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. 
There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP services 
within the Billericay area to serve the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site 
provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however  a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage flooding arising. It is expected  that 
measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not 
affect  future  occupiers  of the site and/or  any existing  properties  nearby.  There  remains  a need  for 
Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the serving  water  recycling  centre  can accommodate  the growth 
proposed.  The developer  may need  to work with Anglian  Water  to enable  this through  improvements to 
the capacity of the water recycling centre prior to  development.  
 In terms of highways, access will be taken from Kennel Lane and internal  roads  will need  to be 
designed  in accordance  with the Local  Transport  Plan Development Management  Policies.  In order  
to ensure  that there  is sufficient  highways  capacity  within  the local area to accommodate growth in 
this location , and to improve the capacity and flow of local roads serving the rest of Billericay, 
development in this location will be expected to make a  contribution towards the improvements to 
the local and strategic road network as appropriate. Proportionate contrib utions towards 
improvements to cycling and public transport access within the vicinity of the  site in order  to 
facilitate  a modal  shift towards  active  and sustainable  transport  modes  will also be  required.  
Policy H1 8 
Land South of Windmill Heights, Billericay  
 8ha of land south of Windmill Heights, South Green, as identified on  the Policies  Map with the 
notation  H18, will be developed  to provide  around  200 high quality  homes at a density of 35duph.   
 
134 
 Access to this site should be secured from Kennel  Lane in accordance with the policies of the 
Highways Authority.  
 Multi -functional landscape buffers should be provided to the western and southern boundaries of 
the site. These landscape  buffers  should  retain existing hedgerows and trees and  should  also seek  
to deliver  open  space,  ecological and surface water management  benefits.  
 Due to the likelihood of archaeological assets within the site, a full field evaluation, in addition to a 
desk -based archaeological assessment will be required as part of any application.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contri butions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.  
 Development of this site must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements o f this  plan.  
 
Policy H 19: Land East of Greens Farm Lane, Billericay  
 This allocation will expand the neighbourhoods of Sunnymede and South Green in Billericay 
through two residential extensions, as well as create a 16ha extension to the existing Mill Meadow s 
Nature Reserve. The residential extension to Sunnymede is 9ha of land north east of Greens Farm 
Lane, hereafter referred to as H 19a. The site is expected to deliver around 300 new homes. Land 
south east of Greens Farms Lane, hereafter referred to as H 19b, is a 3ha residential extension to 
South Green capable of delivering around 100 new homes.  
 Landscape buffers will be required along the southern boundary of H 19a and the northern 
boundary of H 19b to screen development from the new strategic open space wh ich will be located 
on land between the two development areas. The strategic open space will form the extension to 
Mill Meadows Nature Reserve and provide locally accessible public open space for the wider area 
of Billericay, as well as meet the needs aris ing from this allocation.  
 The allocation is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it is recognised that there is 
a SSSI in the neighbouring Mill Meadows Nature Reserve to the west and that there will be  wildlife 
living within natural featu res of the site such as trees and hedgerows. Any application for 
development must therefore be accompanied by appropriate ecological assessments, and must 
also seek to retain and enhance natural features where wildlife may be prevalent in accordance 
with p olicy NE 4.  
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area. The site will also im pact on the demand  for GP provision within the area 
and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. 
There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP services 
within the Bil lericay area to serve the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site 
provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this allocation is well served by existing power supply and 
water recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the 
case at the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided within the 
allocation is sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage flooding arising. It is 
expe cted that measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that flood 
risk does not affect  future  occupiers  of the allocation  and/or  any existing  properties  nearby.  There  
remains  a need  for Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the servi ng water  recycling  centre  can 
accommodate  the growth proposed.  The developer  may need  to work with Anglian  Water  to enable  this 
through  improvements to the capacity of the water recycling centre prior to  development.   
 
135 
 The allocation is within the boundaries  of two Critical Drainage Areas BAS4 and BAS5, and must 
therefore ensure that measures to manage land drainage are installed or enhanced. Compliance 
with policy CC4 is therefore  essential.  
 In terms of highways, principal access will be from Greens Farm Lan e for development to the west 
of both H 19a and H 19b, and from Outwood Common Road for development to the east of H 19a 
and H 19b. In order to ensure that there is sufficient highways capacity within the local area to 
accommodate growth in this location , and to improve the capacity and flow of local roads serving 
the rest of Billericay, development in this location will be expected to make a contribution towards 
the improvements to the local and strategic road network as appropriate to the satisfaction of the 
Highway Authority.  
 Proportionate contributions towards improvements  to cycling  and public  transport  access  within  the 
vicinity  of H19a and H 19b in order  to facilitate a modal shift towards active and sustainable transport 
modes will also be  required.  
Policy H 19 
Land East of Greens Farm Lane, Billericay  
 Land to the north east of Greens Farm Lane, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation 
H19a, will be developed to provide around 300  homes at a density of 35duph. Land to the south 
east of Green s Farm Lane, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H 19b, will be 
developed to provide around 100  homes at a density of 35duph.  
 Access to these sites must be secured in accordance with the policies of the Highways Authority.  It 
is expected  that access to H 19a and H 19b will be secured  from Greens Farm Lane and Outwood 
Common Road.  
 Land between H 19a and H 19b, as identified on the Policies Map as public open space, will provide 
the 16ha extension to Mill Meadows Nature Reserve as strategic open space provision. It will 
remain within the extent of the Green Belt and be multi -functional, incorporating open land, formal 
recreational open space, and ecological and surface water management  benefits.  
 The extension to Mill Meadow Nature Reserve  must  be gifted  to the Council,  or a third party  agreed  
by the Council, prior  to the first occupation  of any development,  and mechanisms to  ensure the 
ongoing maintenance of this open space for a minimum period of 20  years will need to be secured.  
 Landscape buffers  should be provided around the edges of both H 19a and H 19b in order to  
integrate the  development  into the local environment.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastr ucture provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expecte d standards of provision.  
 Development of these sites must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan.  
 
Policy H2 0: Land East of Southend Road, Billericay  
 Land within this allocation has been identified as being suitable for the delivery of around 190 new 
homes and the creation of a linear landscape buffer which follows the existing watercourse and 
incorporates open space, field boundaries and tree belts.  
 The site is not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it is recognised that there is a 
SSSI in the nearby Mill Meadows Nature Reserve to the north and that there will be wildlife  living 
within natural features of the site such as trees, hedger ows and watercourses. Any application for 
the site must therefore be accompanied by appropriate ecological assessments, and must also  
 
136 seek to retain and enhance natural features where wildlife may be prevalent  in accordance  with 
policy  NE4. It is within  the boundaries  of Critical  Drainage  Area  BAS5 and must therefore ensure that 
measures to manage land drainage are installed or enhanced. Compliance with policy CC4 is 
therefore  essential.  
 Development in  this location  must not cause harm to the setting of the  Grade II listed buildings 
within the vicinity of the site including Sames Cottage, Elm Cottage, Southend Farmhouse and 
Coxes Farmhouse. The setting of all historic assets should be respected in the layout and design of 
the development proposed.  
 This site will require community infrastructure provision to support the level of growth proposed. 
There will be a requirement for contributions towards early years childcare and primary school 
provision in the local area. The site will also impact on the demand  for GP provision within the area 
and the NHS have a strategy of expanding provision to accommodate growth at existing surgeries. 
There will therefore be a requirement for a contribution towards the expansion of GP services 
within the Billericay area to serve the residents of the site,  unless  the NHS  determine  that on-site 
provision  is required.  
 Utility providers have indicated that this site is well served by existing power supply and water 
recycling facilities. There is however a need for developers to ensure that this remains the case at 
the time of development, and to ensure that any drainage infrastructure provided on site is 
sufficient to avoid issues associated with surface and sewage flooding arising. It is expected  that 
measures will be taken on -site in accordance with policy CC4 to ensure that flood risk does not 
affect  future  occupiers  of the site and/or  any existing  properties  nearby.  There  remains  a need  for 
Anglian  Water  to be satisfied  that the serving  water  recycling  centre  can accommodate  the growth 
proposed.  The developer  may need  to work with Anglian  Water  to enable  this through  improvements to 
the capacity of the water recycling centre prior to  development.  
 In terms of highways, access will be taken from Southend Road, which will be one of its key 
frontages. Internal roads will need to be designed in accordance with the Local Transport Plan 
Development Management Policies. In order to ensure that there is sufficient highways capacity 
within  the local area to accommodate  growth  in this location , and to improve  the capacity  and flow of 
local roads serving the rest of Billericay, development in this location will be expected to  make a 
contribution towards the improvements to the local and strategic road network as appropriate. 
Proportionate contributions towards improvements to walking, cycling and public transport access 
within the vicinity of the site in order to facilitate a modal shift towards active and sustainable 
transport modes will also be required.  
Policy H2 0 
Land East of Southend R oad, Billericay  
 9.5ha  of land east of Southend  Road,  as identified  on the Policies Map with the notation H2 0, will be 
developed to provide around 190 high quality homes at a density of 35duph. On -site open space 
provision should be included within the deve lopment.  
 Access to this site should be taken from Southend  Road in accordance with the policies of the 
Highways Authority.  
 A linear landscape buffer should feature throughout the development and continue to the  junction 
with Coxes Farm Road. This landscap e buffer should be multi -functional and should also seek to 
deliver open space, ecological and surface water management  benefits.  
 The design and layout of development must respect the setting of designated historic assets 
surrounding the site including sev eral Grade II listed buildings.  
 Development  must  be supported  by sufficient  infrastructure  to ensure  that it is sustainable, and does  not 
exceed  the capacity  of existing  infrastructure,  including  highways, community  facilities  and services. 
Proposals are required to assess the development’s potential impact, in accordance with nationally 
and/or locally prescribed methodology, and consult with the relevant infrastructure provider where 
appropriate. Where impacts are identified mitigation must be provided in  the form of contributions or 
other reasonable measures, as agreed with the Council. Applicants should refer to the relevant 
policies within this plan for expected standards of provision.

 Development of this site must also comply with all other relevant po licy requirements of this  plan.  
 
Policy H2 1: Self-Build Allocations  
 The Council maintains a register of people who are seeking to acquire a serviced plot of land to 
develop as a home for their own need. These are either in the form of self -build or custom  
housebuilding, as defined in the  Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 (as amended) . 
Local planning authorities are expected to identify demand and consider future need for this type of 
housing and plan accordingly, including through policies withi n their Local Plan. By developing 
policies within their Local Plans for this type of development local planning authorities can identify 
suitable sites and assist in increasing the number of planning permissions for self -build. Demand 
identified by the reg ister is limited, and mainly indicates a need for sites in the northern part of the 
Borough.  
 Through the preparation of this plan, the Council assessed all sites which were submitted to them 
for development and identified three small parcels of land as bei ng suitable specifically for self -
build due to their size and access to existing services. The sites are adjacent to the existing 
settlement boundary of Billericay and whilst suitable , their development potential would not be 
realised unless they were allo cated through policy and subsequently removed from the extent of 
the Green Belt. No suitable sites of a similar scale were identified in other parts of the Borough.  
 The first site is land east of Laindon Road, Billericay , hereafter referred to as H2 1a. It is 0.8ha in 
size and capable of delivering around 6 self -build homes. Access will be taken from Laindon Road 
with a new internal road serving the new homes.  
 The second site is 1.5ha of land at Maitland Lodge, Great Burstead, hereafter referred to as H2 1b. 
The site is capable of delivering around 20 self -build homes which are served by a new internal 
road that is accessed from Southend Road.  
 The third site is on land adjacent to The Mount, Billericay, hereafter referred to as H2 1c. It is 0.6ha 
in size and c apable of delivering around 6 self -build homes. Access to the site will be taken from 
The Mount with a new internal road to serve the new homes. Development on this site will need to 
be mindful of the nearby SSSI and Scheduled Monument of Norsey Woods, and  ensure that no 
harm arises that impacts on these designated features.  
 The sites are not known to be highly ecologically sensitive, however it is recognised that there is a 
SSSI, ancient woodland and Local Nature Reserve nearby to H2 1c at Norsey Woods. The re will be 
wildlife  living within natural features of the sites such as trees, hedgerows and watercourses. Any 
application for the sites must therefore be accompanied by appropriate ecological assessments, 
and must also seek to retain and enhance natural f eatures where wildlife may be prevalent  in 
accordance  with policy  NE4. None of these sites fall within a critical drainage area, or are affected 
by flood risk.  
Policy H2 1 
Self-Build Allocations  
 Land east of Laindon Road, Billericay, as identified on the P olicies Map with the notation H2 1a, has 
been allocated for the purposes of self -build to deliver around 6 new homes. Access will be taken 
from Laindon Road, subject to approval by the Highways Authority.  
 Land at Maitland Lodge, Great Burstead, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H2 1b, 
has been allocated for the purposes of self -build to deliver around 20 new homes. Access will be 
taken from Southend Road, subject to approval by the Highways Authority . 
 Land adjacent to The Mount, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H2 1c, has been 
allocated for the purposes of self -build to deliver around 6 new homes. The development must be 
sensitive to the nearby Norsey Wood for its ecological and historic asset designations. Access w ill 
be taken from The Mount, subject to approval by the Highways Authority . 
 Proposals must demonstrate that the development meets the criteria and definition of self -build or  
 
138 custom housebuilding as part of any planning application.  
 Development of these si tes must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan.  
 
Policy H2 2: Housing Growth in Crays Hill  
 Crays Hill is a small distinct serviced settlement centrally located in the Borough just south of 
Ramsden  Bellhouse  in between  the larger settlements  of Wickford  and Billericay,  with Basildon  a 
short distance away to the south. Crays Hill may be medieval in origin with the presence of a 
moated enclosure, and although suffering some boundary loss from plotland divisions, the basic 
structu re of the field system has  survived.  
 Crays Hill is a mainly residential settlement located around the London Road as it runs between 
Wickford and Billericay. It has a small shop, a primary school and some limited public transport 
services. There is limited  commercial or industrial activity, and limited provision of public open 
space.  However,  due to the settlements  rural location  there  are informal  opportunities  for recreation in 
the surrounding  countryside.  
 The surrounding countryside to the north of Crays  Hill is of high landscape value. Meanwhile the 
countryside to the south plays an important role in separating Crays Hill from Basildon. There is a  
plotland  settlement  in this area,  which  due to inappropriate  development  has caused  the landscape in 
this ar ea to become degraded in  places.  
 The Service d Settlement Review recommended several parcels of land around the village core that 
would represent suitable housing development locations and which would support improvements to 
local infrastructure, in particu lar local public  transport  services. The sites that have been allocated 
have potential to deliver between 64 and 69 homes across the plan period, as a result of the 
revision to the Green Belt boundaries which form the village envelop.  
 One particular amendment brings Southlands Road, previously within the Crays Hill Plotland, but 
detached from the rest of the Plotland area, into the village envelop. Southlands Road was 
identified as providing opportunity for development, but its full dev elopment potential would not be 
realised if it was to remain in the Green Belt. However to ensure that the area is not over 
developed, given its location on the edge of the village, only road frontage development will be 
permitted.  
 The Service d Settlement  Review  and the HELAA  identified two sites as being suitable for delivering 
infill development. One site is located on land to the rear of Barnsfield, Crays Hill and is capable of 
delivering between 10 and 12 homes with the creation of an access road into the site to serve the 
new homes, subject to Highways Authority approval. The site’s capacity has been reduced, in order 
to allow for separation between the new homes and existing properties which surround the site on 
three sides. The other site is located on land between London Road and Corner Road which can 
deliver up to 11 homes. An access road into the site to serve the new homes from Approach Road 
would be required, subject to Highways Authority approval.  
 Road frontage development only will be permitted  on the remaining sites due to their size, location 
and relationship with existing residential development. Sites providing road frontage development 
would be able to accommodate between 43 and 46 homes.  
 Whilst the Service Settlement Review and HELAA  cons idered a larger number of sites as having 
potential to accommodate housing development, some sites have not been included in the Local 
Plan due to other overriding considerations. Additional sites to the east of the village had been 
promoted, but they woul d extend the village further eastwards and in the long term risk the 
coalescence of Crays Hill with Wickford and/or Ramsden Bellhouse. Sites promoted within Crays 
Hill Plotland within the extent of the Green Belt may be suitable for infill however they wou ld be 
determined against Policy GB4.  
 All new homes should be in keeping with the existing pattern and style of development in the 
village and the plot sizes will be expected to reflect the sizes of neighbouring plots. A table showing 
how this should be dis tributed across the sites is below.

Policy H2 2 
Housing Growth in Crays Hill  
 Local amendments have been made to the Green Belt boundary in order to extend the village 
envelop of Crays Hill. Within the village envelop, the allocated sites are capable of delivering up to 
69 new high quality  homes.  
 Infill development for between 10 and 12 homes will be permitted on land to the rear of Barnsfield, 
Crays Hill, as identified on the Policies Map with the notation H2 2a. Access should be taken from 
London Road, subject to Highways Authority approval . The layout of the site must provide some 
degree of separation between the new homes and the properties that surround the site.  
 Infill development for up to 11 homes will be permitted on land between London Road and Corner 
Road, as identified on the Polic ies Map with the notation H2 2b. Access into the site should be taken 
from Approach Road, subject to Highways Authority approval.  
 Only road frontage development will be permitted on all other sites within the village envelop, 
including on the sites as ident ified on the Policies Map as notations H2 2c to H2 2j. 
 All new homes should  be designed  in accordance  with the local character  and existing pattern of 
development in the village. Plot sizes will be expected to reflect the sizes of neighbouring plots.  
 Develop ment  will be required to  contribute in a proportionate way to the provision of local 
infrastructure, community and services improvements.  
 Development proposals must also comply with all other relevant policy requirements of this  plan.   
 
140 DEVELOPMENT MANAGEME NT POLICIES  
Policy H2 3: The Location of Residential Development  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects  Local  Plans  to identify  locations  where  development  is encouraged,  and where 
development will be restricted. This should be based on the strategic priorities for the  area.  Local 
planning authorities should support proposals for the change of use of buildings into residential use 
where there is an identified need for additional housing in that area , unless there are good 
economic reasons for not doing  so. 
Evidence Base  
 A significant  part of the Borough's  existing  urban  area is used  for residential  purposes.  There  are 
however  employment  areas,  retail  parades  and community  uses  which  are also located  within  the 
urban areas, and are essential for ensuring a sustainable  community.  
 The employment  and retail areas in the Borough are very well used, and although there are some 
vacancies in some employment and town centre locations, the EDNA, ELPS , and the Basildon 
Retail and Commercial Leisure Capacity Study  show  that there  will be a need beyond those 
vacancies available for additional employment  land and additional  retail  floorspace  to support  the 
level of housing  growth  proposed. There is therefore a need to retain employment and retail 
premises from redevelopme nt for residential  purposes.  This is particularly  the case  where  
regeneration  proposals  are in place  such as Basildon town centre, and a residential development 
proposal may undermine the delivery of a  comprehensive  programme  of regeneration  that would  
benefit  the wider  community  and economy.  
 Additionally,  there  are likely  to be instances,  particularly  in areas  allocated  for employment,  where 
residential development is unlikely to be compatible with surrounding uses, and may ultimately 
undermine their ec onomic activity if new residents are affected and make complaints. There is 
therefore an economic imperative for limiting housing development to those locations allocated for 
such purposes, and for protecting allocated commercial areas from residential  development.  
 It is however  recognised  that town  centres  can benefit from  mixed  use developments. It is  known 
that homes  above  shops  and other  commercial  uses  can contribute  towards  the vitality  and success of 
town centres and help with natural surveillance  and reducing fear of crime. It is expected that 
additional housing will be provided above shops and on edge of centre sites within Basildon, 
Laindon, Pitsea and Wickford in order to support the vitality of these centres moving  forward.  
Policy H2 3 
The Loca tion of Residential Development  
 Proposals  for housing  development  will be supported  in the following  locations,  subject  to compliance 
with all other relevant policies within this  plan:  
a. Areas that are currently predominantly residential in nature;  
b. Areas allocated for residential purposes on the Policies Map, in accordance with policies 
H5 to  H22; 
c. Above shops within shopping frontages in town centres and local centres, as identified 
on the Policies Map;  or 
d. On edge of town centre sites promoted for resident ial purposes within approved 
regeneration proposals for that town centre.  
 Proposals for housing development elsewhere within the urban area will be supported where it  can 
be demonstrated  that: 
a. The site is unlikely to be re -used for its allocated  purpose;  
b. The site would not disrupt an active shopping frontage within a town centre or local 
centre, or otherwise undermine any approved regeneration proposals in place for that  
centre;  
c. The use of the site for housing is compatible with other uses within the surrou nding area  
 
141 and would provide a good level of amenity to future residents;  and 
d. The proposal is compliant with all other relevant policies in this  plan.  
 
Policy H2 4: Applications for  Gypsy and Traveller Sites and Travelling 
Showpeople Yards  
Policy Context  
 Paragraphs 22 to 28 of the PPTS sets out the development management criteria applicable  when 
considering the merits of applications for Gypsy, Traveller or Travelling Showpeople sites.  
Evidence Base  
 Residential Gypsy and Traveller sites and Travelling Show people yards provide permanent homes 
for their communities. They can be privately owned,  rented  out by local authorities  as affordable  
pitches,  or privately  owned  and rented  to other Gypsies, Travellers or Travelling Showpeople.  
 The size and the amount of facilities available on the Gypsy and Traveller sites varies. On average 
however, usage in the Borough is approximately 1.7 caravans per pitch. Sites are typically  made up  
of a number  of caravan  pitches  and associated  facilities.  Good  practice  guidance  has previously 
advised an average family pitch must be capable of accommodating an amenity building, a  large 
trailer and touring caravan , drying space for clothes, a lockable shed , parking space for two 
vehicles and a small garden7. The amount of facilities o n a site also varies between public  and 
private  sites.  Public  sites will generally  have  amenity  blocks  and sometimes  play areas and 
communal spaces for residents. Private site facilities vary enormously depending on the 
requirements and aspirations of the individual  residents, but will commonly have a brick -built day 
room for sanitary purposes.  
 The design requirements of Travelling Showpeople yards on the other hand are different.  These 
sites often  combine  residential,  storage  and maintenance uses. Typicall y a site contains areas for 
accommodation, usually caravans and mobile homes, and  areas  for storing,  repairing  and 
maintaining  vehicles  and fairground  equipment.  Sites  are often known  as yards  and can be lived on 
by several  families.  Individual  family  areas  (within  a site/yard) are called  plots.  
 Although Travelling Showpeople often travel for extended periods throughout the year, the PPTS 
recognises  they require  a permanent  base  for storage  of equipment  and for residential  use during 
the winter months. These plots are also occupied throughout the year, often by older people and 
families with children, for example, who as a result of individual needs/circumstances no longer 
travel.  
Policy H2 4 
Applications for  Gypsy and Traveller Sites and Travelling Showpeople Yards  
 Applications for new Gypsy and Traveller Site s or Travelling Showpeople Yards will be permitted 
where the proposal is for a site allocated for this purposes, or for any other site where the principle 
of residential dev elopment is acceptable ; the proposed occupants meet the relevant planning 
definitions set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites ; and the proposals meet the  design and 
location criteria set out in part 3 of this policy.   
 Applications to regularise  existing unauthorised Gypsy and Traveller Sites or Travelling Showpeople 
Yards within the Green Belt will be exceptionally permitted where the site was occupied for this 
purpose for at least 3 months at the 18 October 2018; the proposed occupants meet the  relevant 
planning definitions set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites ; and the proposals meet the 
design and location criteria set out in part 3 of this policy.  
 Any applications for planning permission for Gypsy and Traveller sites and Travelli ng Showpeople 
                                                      
 
7 Designing G ypsy and Traveller Sites - Good Practice Guide, CLG, 2008 ; revoked  2015   
 
142 yards received throughout the plan period must meet  following local design and location criteria:  
a. The site must reasonably be accessible to services and  facilities;  
b. The number of pitches /plots  on any one site  should be of a scale that is approp riate and 
which promotes peaceful and integrated co-existence  between occupiers of the site and 
the local community;  
c. The site must  be able to be adequately  serviced  with drinking  water,  utilities  and 
sewerage  disposal facilities that accord with Envi ronment Agency  standards;  
d. The site should have good access to the highway network and not promote inappropriate  
traffic generation for the  locality;  
e. The site must  be of sufficient  size to accommodate  the proposed  number  of caravans,  
vehicles  and ancillary work areas as appropriate;  
f. The site must not be affected by environmental hazards that may affect residents’ health 
and well -being, or be located in an area of high risk of flooding;  
g. Proposals for yards accommodating Travelling Showpeople should allow for a mixed -use 
yard with separate areas for residential and the storage and maintenance of  equipment 
that protect residential amenity;  
h. All sites should be well planned in respects of their internal layout and through a 
combination of soft and hard landscaping positively enhance their setting and promote 
opportunities for healthy lifestyles including play areas for children;  
i. All other pro posals for mixed residential and business activities will be assessed on a site  
specific basis, taking the above criteria into account;  and 
 Any development  granted  under  this policy  will be subject  to a condition  limiting  occupation  to Gypsies 
and Travelle rs or Travelling Showpeople, as  appropriate.  
 
Policy H2 5: The Size and Types of Homes  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires planning policies to deliver  a wide choice  of high quality  homes  and create 
mixed and balanced communities.  It expects  local planning authorities  to identify  the size and types  
of new homes  that are required in particular locations , reflecting  local demand.  
Evidence Base  
 The SHMA and SHMA Addendum examined the current dwelling characteristics for all authorities 
across South Essex. It recognised there are  some  significant differences between authority areas, 
both in  terms of the number of bedrooms, and the size of  dwellings.  
 In response,  the Council  will consider  accommodation  requirements  for specific  groups  as part of 
creating sustain able, mixed, socially inclusive communities. In relation to the size of properties, the 
SHMA  identifies  the proportional  split by type and number of bedrooms for additional households. 
These are set out in Tables 11. 6 and 11.7. 
Table 11. 6 Size of Accommodation Required (Extracted from South Essex SHMA Addendum 2017  Table 5.3)  
1 Bed 2 Beds  3 Beds  4+ Beds  
14% 26% 40% 20% 
 
Table 11. 7 Type of Accommodation Required (Extracted from SHMA 2016  Figure 8.11)  
Detached  Semi -Detached  Terraced  Flat 
22% 28.3%  32.6%  17.1%  
 
 The tables above indicate that during the plan period there is a need for a mix of different type and  
 
143 sized properties  to meet  the diverse  needs  of the Borough's  residents with a greater requirement for 
3 bedroom properties and terraced housing above all other sizes and types.  
 The estimated need for affordable housing by size across the plan period, according to the SHMA 
Addendum , is similar to that of the overall  housing mix for the Borough. However, this assumes 
that households will continue to occupy properties of the same size as equivalent households have 
occupied in the past. Recent Government welfare reforms which restricts under occupation has 
resulted in a  greater demand for smaller sized properties for downsizing households. The Housing 
Strategy  provides updated figures that have regard to the impact of these reforms and reports a 
greater need currently for 1 and 2 bedroom properties for Affordable Housing  as shown in the table 
below.  
Table 11. 8 Current Size of Accommodation Required for Affordable Housing (Extracted from Housing Strategy 2018 -
2023  Appendix 3 Table 5)  
1 Bed 2 Beds  3 Beds  4 Beds  
39% 53% 5% 3% 
 
 The Council  will keep  the requirement  for different  housing types and sizes for different tenures  under  
periodic  review and the most up to date requirements will be set out in the Council’s separate 
Housing  Strategy . 
 Whilst there is a demand for a large proportion of smaller properties, there is a lso a need for a 
proportion  of new homes  to be larger  4 bedroom  plus homes.  Whilst  this need  is across  all tenures, it  
is also reflective  of an insufficient  number  of ‘executive -type’  dwellings  within  the Borough  to suit the  
needs  of higher -income  households  and professionals.  Provision  of more  of these  units  would help  
diversify  the Borough's  housing  offer and reduce  out-migration  of these  households,  improving the 
Borough’s socio -economic profile and overall  sustainability.  
 In order  to ensure  that homes  meet  the needs  of local residents,  whatever  their income  level,  and 
also respond to the aspiration of delivering more 'executive -type' dwellings that would  encourage 
economically active and high income households and professionals to live in the Bor ough, it is 
important that internal space standards are also improved alongside the overall mix of housing 
provision.  New homes  built in the UK are some  of the smallest  in Europe,  and this has implications 
for the quality of life, and the attractiveness of a place to live. The Government has set out a 
Nationally Described Space Standard for new homes, which local areas may optionally apply, 
subject  to considerations  of need  and viability.  These  standards  provide  the opportunity  to improve 
the quality of the housing offer within the Borough and will therefore be applied to all new build 
homes.  
 It is however recognised that the space standards may be difficult to achieve within conversions, 
particu larly where the existing building is of an irregular shape, or is a designated heritage  asset. In 
order to encourage the re -use of existing buildings, the Nationally Described Space Standard will 
not normally be applied to conversions, although the need fo r space and light for the level of 
occupancy proposed should still be a consideration in determining the appropriateness of a 
development  proposal,  in order  to ensure  that conversion  developments  contribute  towards  meeting 
the need for high quality  homes.  
 In terms of the specialist accommodation needs of older people policy H2 identifies the need for 
1,491 units of extra care, sheltered housing and enhanced sheltered housing within the Borough in 
the period to 2034. This represents around 10% of the minimum  housing target for the Borough set 
out in policy SD1. Policy H2 expects that this requirement is met alongside other housing  in order 
to ensure that older people are not isolated from the community. Consequently, such 
accommodation should be provided on -site alongside other types of housing  provision.  
 The Council has published a Specialist Accommodation Briefing Paper (2017)  which examined 
locational criteria for the suitability of strategic sites to provide specialist accommodation. This 
report draws on t he information provided by Essex County Council as part of their Independent 
Living Programme and identifies a number of strategic  housing  sites that are suitable for providing 
specialist accommodation for older people in respect of their location to centr es, existing local 
amenities and public transport. It also highlights sites that are capable of being suitable where  
 
144 amenities and services are provided as part of (or nearby) the development scheme. The 
Independent Living Programme recommends that special ist accommodation schemes for older 
people should consist of a minimum of 60 units to a maximum of 300 units for reasons of 
affordability and the ability to create and support an active community. According to viability testing 
carried out as part of the L ocal Plan preparation some sites can deliver a minimum of 45 retirement 
units or 30 extra -care units and remain viable.  
 Whilst the Council recognises the importance of providing suitable housing for an ageing 
population, and people with other social or learning support needs, it also believes that people  
have  the right to continue  to live in their own homes  for as long  as is practica lly and safely possible. 
The SHMA indicates that the number of private household residents with support needs will 
increase by 3,371 by 2034 (3,877 by 2037). As such, alongside the provision of specialist 
accommodation for older people, the Council will be  seeking to secure a proportion of new homes 
to meet the requirements of Part M4(2) of the Building Regulations on accessible and adaptable 
dwellings. Part M4(2) provides the opportunity for people to live in their homes for longer as they 
can be adapted t o accommodate changing needs in terms of accessibility.  
 There is insufficient evidence to indicate a demand for wheelchair accessible homes in the 
Borough. Furthermore, the Whole Plan Viability Assessment  work has shown that requirements to 
make homes whe elchair accessible can cost upwards of £23,000 per dwelling. This is a significant 
development cost to impose without evidence. Needs will however arise for wheelchair accessible 
housing over the plan period, and the Council will therefore seek for wheelch air accessible housing 
to be provided as part of the affordable housing provision where a need has been identified, as part 
of policy H2 6. 
Policy H2 5 
The Size and Types of Homes  
 All proposals for residential development will be expected to provide high quality homes with 
sufficient private amenity space to meet the needs of residents.  
 All sites delivering 10 or more homes should comprise a housing mix of 40% one and two bedroom 
homes, 40% three bedroom homes, and 20% four or more bedroom homes. Considera tion will be 
given to schemes proposing a different housing mix where they relate to urban regeneration 
schemes to ensure the most effective use of urban land is attained.   
 Sites delivering 600 homes or more must provide specialist accommodation for older  people on site, 
which accounts for 10% of the total number of homes being delivered. Specialist accommodation 
should comprise of sheltered housing and/or extra care accommodation.  
 On all other sites delivering 10 or more homes, 10% of homes should be con structed to the 
requirements of Part M(2) of the Building Regulations . 
 In order to ensure that new homes offer sufficient, well -designed living space to meet the needs of 
residents,  the Nationally  Described  Space  Standard  will be applied  to all new housing  developments, 
and conversions.  
 
Policy H2 6: Affordable Housing Provision  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  defines  affordable  housing  as social  rented,  affordable  rented  and intermediate  housing, 
provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. Eligibility is determined 
with regard  to local incomes  and local house  prices.  Affordable  housing  should  include  provisions to  
remain at  an affordable  price for  future  eligible  households  or for  the subsidy to  be recycled for 
alternative affordable  housing  provision.  
 The NPPF  states  that local plans  should  seek  to meet  the full, objectively  assessed need  for 
affordable  housing,  as far as is consistent  with all other  requirements  of the NPPF . Where an 
affordable  housing  need  is identified , planning policies  should   require this to be met on site, unless  
 
145 off-site provision or a financial contribution of broadly equivalent value can be robustly justified  and 
the agreed approach contributes to the objective of creating mixed and balanced communities .  
 Plans should be  deliverable . The NPPF  requires  the costs  of any requirements  likely  to be applied  to 
development, such as requirements for affordable housing  provision , standards, infrastructure 
contributions or other requirements , to be set at a level that  would not undermine the deliverability 
of development and the plan as a whole.  
Evidence Base  
 The SHMA Addendum identifies the need for at least 6,274 new affordable homes to be delivered 
within  the Borough over the plan period. This represents 31% of the total need. It identifies a newly 
arising need of 288 units per annum and an additional shortfall of 514 homes to meet the backlog 
of need, which should be addressed within the first five years of the plan period.  
 The outcomes of the SHMA Addendum are base d on an assessment of affordability within the local 
housing market, as reported in the SHMA , which  shows  that 54% of households  cannot  afford  to 
purchase  a property  in the Borough (of a lower quartile priced property), and 39% of households 
cannot afford to rent in the private rented  sector.  
 Due to the significant size of the existing stock of social housing in the Borough, a significant 
quantum  of the need  is met through  the re-let of Council  housing  and housing  owned  by Registered 
Providers.  However,  the need  is such  that the additional  units  identified  above  are required  on top of 
the existing  stock.  
 The analysis of affordability shows that 29% of the need for affordable housing could be met 
through the provision of properties for affordable rent at 60% market rent. The remainder of 
households  falling  into need  will require  rents  less than this, and therefore  social  rented  properties 
will be  sought.  
 The affordability  data shows  that 15% of households  can afford  private  rents,  but cannot  afford  to 
purchase a property in the Borough. However, the private rented sector only makes up 9.4% of the 
current housing stock. Consequently, demand for this stock will outstrip supply reducing its 
affordability over time. There is therefore a need to consider the role that intermediate products 
such as shared equity homes can play in ensuring that housing market is fully accessible for all 
levels of income. The SHMA indicates that those who can access the private rented market can 
also access a 40% shared equit y home. There is therefore a need to introduce further shared 
equity provision within the housing mix in order to ensure sufficient provision of housing for those 
who do not need social housing, but cannot afford to buy a home on the open market. Provision  
representing 5% of the total housing requirement or 800 homes in total would be appropriate to 
bridge the gap between the social rent and market  housing.  
 Due to changes  to the welfare  system,  which  caps  the total amount  of benefits  that any one 
household may receive,  and also reduces  benefit  payments  for spare  bedrooms,  there  is a particular  
demand for  affordable  homes  with a smaller  number  of bedrooms.  The SHMA  indicates  that across  
South Essex the demand is for affordable housing provision to deliver 44%  one bedroom homes, 
28% two bedroom homes, 25% three bedroom homes and 2% four bedroom homes. This demand 
represents the position at 2015, and is likely to change over time as a consequence of different 
drivers.  
Accommodation for Disabled Adults  
 A positio n statement by Essex County Council, as part of their Independent Living Programme , 
identifies a need for a further 103 accommodation units for disabled adults within the Borough by 
2022 to enable independent living. Approximately 13% of these homes requir e wheelchair access 
and should therefore be built to  Category 3 - wheelchair user dwellings of the Building Regulations , 
hereafter referred to as Part M4(3). To enable independent living accommodation must be in 
accessible locations, provide sufficient spa ce and be designed in such a way to meet the needs 
and support required. It is also important that any scheme providing independent living offers 
affordable rent tenures.  
 The provision of accommodation for this group of people is not normally made at a la rge scale, as  
 
146 needs differ from person to person. Provision is normally made in smaller schemes such as shared 
housing, individual self -contained housing, or in specially commissioned self -contained housing 
within a development. Such schemes typically comp rise between 6 and 10 units of accommodation 
at the most. Due to the scale of these schemes and also the need for social services to fund their 
delivery, it is difficult to plan at the Local Plan level for this type of accommodation need. However, 
there is  the opportunity to secure schemes of this nature as part of the affordable housing element 
of development schemes at the planning application stage through consultation with Essex County 
Council Social Services.  
 Consequently, homes built to Part M4(3) will be expected to form part of the affordable housing 
provision and be built to a specification to be wheelchair accessible. The distinction between 
wheelchair accessible which is provided at point of completion an d wheelchair adaptable which 
enables later adaption are set out within Part M of the Building Regulations . 
 Specialist accommodation can also assist in the delivery of health care services through the 
provision of step -down accommodation for adults being di scharged from hospital with no ongoing 
need to remain in hospital but who can not immediately return home. The requirement for such 
schemes within the Borough would be identified in consultation with the Basildon and Brentwood 
CCG  and the Basildon and Thurr ock University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.  
Development Viability  
 The Whole Plan Viability Assessment has determined that development within the Borough is 
generally viable at 31% affordable housing provision, taking into account the other policy 
require ments of the Local Plan. However, it is noted that there are viability challenges for schemes 
of up to 150 houses in Basildon, 150 flats in Basildon and 150 flats in Wickford.  
 The headroom identified in the testing undertaken for the Whole Plan Viability Assessment means 
that most types of schemes in the Borough will remain viable over time, even if there are small 
fluctuations in costs or in the market. Additionally, contingency for abnormal costs has been built 
into the modelling. Consequently, the Counc il does not believe it is necessary to entertain 
development proposals which seek to reduce the provision of affordable housing on the basis of 
economic viability arguments, except in relation to urban and flatted developments in Basildon for 
150 units or less, and flatted development schemes in Wickford of around 150 units. In these 
cases, careful analysis of the viability of proposals will be undertaken to secure a reasonable 
proportion of affordable housing on site, as testing has shown that schemes in W ickford, and 
housing schemes in the Basildon urban area can normally tolerate 25% affordable housing 
provision.  
Delivering Affordable Housing  
 Whilst the best way to secure affordable housing in most cases will be through on -site provision, 
the Council reco gnises the additional need for flexibility in securing greater housing choice 
throughout the Borough. For some schemes, it may be better to seek a partial on -site provision and 
a financial contribution, particularly on smaller sites where the requirement f or affordable housing 
may affect the efficient use of land. There may also be instances where there may be other sound 
planning reasons why affordable housing should be provided in other ways, such  as through 
financial contributions pooled through commuted  payments for off -site provision in  areas of  greater  
need  of affordable  housing  provision,  or where  small  scale  infill within  Green  Belt villages is required 
to meet recognised local community  needs.  
 It is expected that a Registered Provider or the Council  will normally be engaged in the delivery of 
the affordable housing on development sites. Registered Providers receive funding from Homes  
England and are restricted  in the properties  that they can acquire in  terms  of design  and 
sustainability  in particular . The Council  meanwhile  will also seek  to ensure that the homes it 
provides through Sempra Homes are of a good standard. Additionally, both Registered  Providers  
and the Council  have  management  requirements  which  mean  that affordable housing provision 
should be self -contained and not part of a leaseholder  arrangement.  
 
 
  
 
147 Policy H2 6 
Affordable Housing Provision  
 31% affordable housing provision will be required on all sites of 11 units or more.  
 The tenure split of affordable housing provision is 70% affor dable rent accommodation at 60% 
market value, and 30% intermediate housing.  
 The size  and mix of affordable housing provision should be determined on a site by site basis in 
discussion with the Council’s Housing Service, having regard to the Council’s late st Housing 
Strategy and the overall mix of development proposed and its locality. Where directed by the 
Council, discussions should also take place with the Basildon and Brentwood Clinical Commission 
Group, the Basildon and Thurrock Hospital NHS Foundation  Trust, and Essex County Council 
Social Services to determine if any specialist affordable housing provision is required in lieu of 
standard homes.  
 All strategic housing sites as identified in policies H5 to H2 0 of this Local P lan must meet their full 
affordable housing requirement on site. In respect of all other sites, g enerally all affordable housing 
should be provided within the development site. However, where it can  be demonstrated that other 
sound planning reasons exist for not doing so, either of th e following alternatives will  apply:  
a. Partial on -site provision and a financial contribution;  or 
b. A full financial contribution in lieu of no on -site provision.  
 A Commuted Payment up to 31% provision will be sought on sites where it is determined that it  is 
not possible to deliver 31% affordable housing on -site. The Council will establish and periodically 
review a Commuted Payment methodology in its Housing  Strategy.  
 Viability assessments will only be accepted for affordable housing provisions of less than 31 % for 
the following types and locations of schemes and, where a lower provision is justified, affordable 
housing will be required at the level at which the development becomes viable:  
a. Flatted development schemes of around 150 units in Basildon Town and Wic kford;  
b. Housing development schemes of around 150 units in Basildon Town and Wickford; and  
c. Other schemes only where there are exceptional development costs.  
 The Council will require that all affordable housing:  
a. is designed and built to the same standard as the market housing:  
b. is integrated into the development and from an external appearance should be 
indistinguishable from the market housing: and  
c. has vehicle parking provided at the same ratio as for the development as a whole.  
 Significant  weight  will be given to this policy  when  considering  the suitability  of applications  for housing 
development and mixed use proposals including a housing  element.  
 
Policy H2 7: Houses in Multiple Occupation and the Subdivision of Family 
Homes  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF requires local planning authorities to plan for a mix of homes  that creates sustainable 
and inclusive  communities.  
Evidence Base  
 Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) and small flats have a role to play in sustainable and 
inclusive communities. They provide accommod ation for single people on low incomes, and can 
also be the accommodation of  choice  for young  professionals moving  to an area for work,  be this on  
a permanent  or temporary  basis.  However,  a proliferation of  such  houses  can also undermine the   
 
148 sustainability  of the community  by reducing  the availability  of family  housing  and lead to amenity issues 
in respect of parking.  
 Consequently, proposals for flats, bedsits and houses in multiple occupation are often controversial 
and can have significant impact on the a menity of an area. The Council therefore requires 
applicants to consider the amenity of residents in adjacent dwellings, and within the building itself. 
This will be achieved through careful internal layout, which for example avoids positioning living 
room s next to bedrooms in adjacent dwellings.  The Council will also require the level of parking to 
support such proposals to be in accordance with the parking standards for use class C1: hotels as 
set out in the latest  adopted Essex  Parking  Standards,  and any future  iterations  of these  standards . 
This level of provision is more reflective of the demand likely to be generated fr om this type of 
accommodation.  
 Whether there is a proliferation of these forms of accommodation will be assessed in relation to 
each application on the basis of the existing proportion of houses in multiple occupation in the area. 
Generally, no more than 30% of the dwellings in the area would be expected to be houses in 
multiple occupation.  
Policy H2 7 
Houses in Multiple Occupation and t he Subdivision of Family Homes  
Development involving the conversion of houses into flats, bedsits or houses in multiple occupation will be 
permitted provided that it:  
a. incorporates a convenient principal entrance door for each unit of accommodation and 
provides an appropriate standard of residential accommodation;  
b. would not lead to a proliferation of flats, bedsits or houses in multiple occupation in a 
particular area causing unacceptable levels of traffic congestion or activity;  
c. the internal layout minimise s possible noise disturbance and/or overlooking to immediate 
neighbours; and  
d. the proposal will not result in an unsatisfactory living environment for prospective 
occupiers.  
 
Policy H 28: Maximising the Housing Stock  
Policy Context  
 As set out in the  NPPF , local planning authorities should identify and bring back into residential use 
empty housing and buildings in line with the local housing and empty homes strategies and, where 
appropriate, acquire properties under Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPO) . 
Evidence  Base  
 It is important that existing homes are kept within the housing stock. The projections of future 
housing need set out in the SHMA are based on the assumption that the existing housing stock will  
continue  to meet  the housing  needs  of the future  population.  Therefore,  the redevelopment  of 
housing  for alternative  uses  would  act to increase  the total need  for housing  and should  therefore be  
avoided.  
 Additionally,  it is also important  to ensure  that any empty  homes  are brought  back  into productive 
use. The SHMA shows that there were around 1,500 vacant properties in the Borough in 2011. This 
represents just under 2% of the housing stock, and is considered to be a normal vacancy level. A 
small proportion of vacancies are required to enable  people to move within the housing market, 
and a level of vacancy less than 3% is therefore considered acceptable. However, there are 
occasions where long term vacancies arise. Such vacancies can detract from the quality of the 
local area due to the deteri oration of the building and garden, and can also attract anti -social 
behaviour and  vermin.  
 
  
 
149 Policy H 28 
Maximising the Housing Stock  
 The re -development of residential properties for alternative uses will only be permitted in 
exceptionable circumstances and  if the proposal can demonstrate that it furthers other sustainable 
development objectives in this plan.  
 Subject to compliance with other relevant policies within this plan, the Council will support planning 
applications that will result in empty homes be ing brought back into residential  use.

 Requiring Good Design  
STRATEGIC POLICY  
Policy DES1: Achieving Good Design  
Policy Context  
 The Government emphasises the importance of good design in planning for sustainable 
development and theref ore it is an integral part of delivering policy  SD4. Design is not limited  to 
how an area or development looks, but also how it functions. It should be informed by an 
understanding of its prevailing character, history and identity.  
 It is expected that Local Plans should include robust and comprehensive policies that set out the 
quality of development expected in an area, based on an understanding and evaluation of its 
defining  characteristics . Such  policies  should  ensure  that developments  seek  to create  long-term 
value  and add to the overall  quality  of the area throughout their lifetime; establish a strong sense of 
place by creating attractive  and comfortable  places  where  people  want  to live, work  and visit; sustain  
an appropriate mix of uses; respond to  the local  character and history ; and create safe and 
accessible environments.  
 The NPPF  states that design policies should avoid unnecessary prescription or detail, but rather 
concentrate on guiding the overall physical form of new development. The context  in which a 
development site is located is also considered to be important. Although visual appearance and 
architecture are very important factors, securing high quality and inclusive design goes beyond just  
aesthetic  considerations.  Planning  policies  shou ld therefore  address  the connections  between people 
and places, and ensure that new development integrates well into the natural, built and historic  
environment.  
 The NPPF  recommends that local planning authorities have local design review arrangements in 
place to provide assessment and support to ensure high standards of design  are achieved . It 
advises that any recommendations from design reviews should be given due regard when 
assessing planning applications, highlighting that early engagement on design is  generally of the 
greatest benefit. In addition, the Planning Act 2008  requires local planning authorities to exercise 
this function when producing local development documents, with the objective of contributing to the 
achievement  of sustainable  development,  and to have  regard  to the desirability  of achieving  good 
design.  
 The NPPF  states that planning permission should be refused for development  of poor design  that 
fails to take the opportunities  available  for improving  the character and quality o f an area and the way 
it functions.  
 The PPG  emphasises  the importance  of good  design  in creating  places,  buildings,  or spaces  that 
work well for everyone, look good, last well, and wi ll adapt to the needs of future generations. Good 
design can help development deliver a wide range of planning objectives; enhance the quality  of 
buildings  and spaces,  by considering  amongst  other  things  form and function;  and address the need 
for different uses sympathetically. The planning objectives, as set out in the PPG , state that well-
designed  places  which  are successful  and valued  should  be functional;  support  mixed -uses and 
tenures; include successful public spaces; be adaptable and resilient; have a distinctive character; be 
attractive and encourage ease of movement. The PPG identifies five key characteristics which should 
be considered when assessing the design quality of buildings and spaces. These are layout, form, 
scale, detailing and materials.  
 The way places are designed affects the way residents and users behave. Active Design (2015)  
published by Sport England in conjunction with Public Health England highlights the way design 
can be used to encourage greater leve ls of activity amongst resid ents and users of development. It 
sets out nine principles that can be applied when designing and masterplanning development 
proposals in order to support healthy lifestyles by facilitating participation in sport and physical 
activity, including encouragin g walking and cycling for short journeys and introducing space for 
sport and recreation within development proposals.   
 Secured by Design  is an official UK Police flagship initiative that focuses on crime prevention in  
 
151 homes and  commercial premises, by combining minimum standards of physical security and well -
tested principles of natural surveillance and defensible space. The objective is to promote the use 
of security standards for a wide range of applications by designing out c rime through physical 
security and processes. The physical security standards of Secure by Design have now been  
incorporated  into the Building  Regulations , however,  the design  principles  relating  to natural 
surveillance and defensible space are still valid , and regard should be had to these in planning new 
developments which are  safe.  
Evidence Base  
 Important  land use types  within  the Borough  include  residential,  industrial,  commercial,  
community /institutional uses, leisure facilities, and areas of open space or recreation. The Local 
Plan sees the Borough’s land cover made up of 59% Green Belt and 41% urban or expanding 
urban areas.  
 The Historic Environment Characterisation Assessment (2011), Green Belt Study Review (2017), 
Settlement Hi erarchy Review (2015)  and Urban Characterisation and Design Review Study (2015)  
reveal that it is difficult to  establish a single cultural identity for the whole of the Borough. 
Collectively they identify it as an area of contrasts with historic town centr es, New Town 
development, areas of open countryside, small villages and plotland settlements, as well as a 
unique and biodiversity rich wildlife habitat in the form of the Thames Estuary marshes. However, it 
is important to value and celebrate the differen ces between the communities, while also 
recognising their inherent  interdependence.  
 One of the Borough’s  more  unique  character traits is reflected in the south of the Borough dominated 
by the development of a Mark 1 New Town, masterplanned in phases from 1951. The New Town 
brought a comprehensive transformation to the area, with significant changes to its landscape and 
original village and plotland communities. Whilst pockets of its more historic origins remain in a 
physical sense, the impact of the mid -20th Century onwards is characterised by a fragmentation of 
built form much of which has largely failed to relate well t o the townscape of previous centuries. 
Therefore, the prevalent urban layers that form the south of the Borough's ‘sense of place’ are 
almost exclusively post 1950’s in date; although distinct design variations exist between 
neighbourhoods, which helps to create a sense of place and distinct local identities.  
 Elsewhere  in the Borough,  Billericay  is a more  historic  town,  its position  between  the Thames  and 
Chelmsford  making  it an ideal  staging  post for travellers  from the 1500s.  The arrival  of the railway in  
1889  caused  the town  to expand,  although  this was not significant  until the inter-war period  and after 
when more large scale development occurred. It therefore retains a historic core, with  more eclectic 
styles radiating  outwards.  
 Similarly,  prior to the 20th Century,  Wickford  was a small  village,  clustered  around  the cross  roads of  
the High Street  and London  Road.  The arrival  of the railway  however  meant  it found  itself situated in 
London's commuter belt and experienced significant expansion from the 1950 's onwards, the 
largest area of which, The Wick started in the 1970s and is still to be  completed.  
 Safety and security are important issues for local people and this is reflected in current and past 
strategies within the Borough, most notably of its Crime and Disorder Partnership. Through the 
arrangement of uses, appropriate landscaping, the provision of good lighting and sight lines, a 
choice of routes in, out and across public spaces, clear delineation of public and private spaces 
and their maintenance an d durability, the Council can through its local planning authority powers 
assist  in creating  safer  and more  accessible  environments  by designing  out opportunities  for crime 
and encouraging community  cohesion.  
 The quality achieved in the design and layout of the built environment is one of the long term 
legacies  development  gives  to an area.  The appearance  of new development  and its relationship 
with its surrounding built and natural environment has a significant effect on the character  and 
appearance of an  area. New development should be safe and accessible, incorporate green 
infrastructure, support local facilities, encourage sustainable modes of travel, and provide sufficient 
access for delivery and service vehicles. Securing new development that can posi tively contribute 
to the character of its local environment is therefore of key importance, and is as relevant in urban 
areas, as in more rural locations . 
 Urba n areas will see significant growth across the plan period and will therefore need to adapt and   
 
152 respond  to these  pressures,  both within  their existing  boundaries  and beyond,  while  retaining their  
unique  character  and heritage.  A balance  will need  to be struck  between  making  best use of land 
and respecting established urban character, whilst creating new and vibrant sustainable 
neighbourhoods.  
 Settlements within the Green Belt that need to accommodate new development to deliver the 
objectives of this plan, will need to embrace their locally distinctive character. Development in these 
areas should be se nsitive in terms of location, scale, materials and design, reflecting the traditional 
pattern of development within the  settlement.  
 Across  the Borough,  the Council  will work in partnership  with architects,  urban  designers,  developers 
and community support or management initiatives to create new developments that relate better to 
their surroundings and improve the standard, as well as the safety of the Borough's built 
environment and its relationship  with the natural  environment.  The Council  will pro-activel y manage  
growth  and change, and  work  with applicants  to explore  and shape  design  issues  through  the pre-
application  process. This will ensure that significant design matters are addressed at the earliest 
possible stage to influence a positive development  outcome.  When determining new development 
proposals the Council will have regard to the latest design guidance including the Essex Design 
Guide.  
Policy DES1  
Achieving Good Design  
The Council  will protect  and enhance  the quality  and local distinctiveness  of the Borough's  built environment  
through  high quality  and inclusive  design  that makes  effective use of land, supports healthy lifestyles and creates 
better places  for people.  This will be achieved  through the  following:  
 Working  with partners  to deliver  regeneration  and public  realm  improveme nts in the Borough's  town 
centres as set out in policies R2 to  R6; 
 Expecting all development proposals to adopt high quality design that optimises the use of land, 
whilst complementing and enhancing the quality, appea rance and functionality of an area. In 
particular, the design of development proposals  should:  
a. Contribute  positively  to an area’s  visual  and architectural  character  by reflecting  and 
responding to locally distinctive patterns of development including elements of 
construction, architectural detailing, building and surfacing materials, scale, density, 
massing, height and  layout;  
b. Correspond  with the natural  features  and historic  quality  of the area that contributes  to its 
special interest including all he ritage assets together with their settings, in acc ordance 
with those policies in c hapters 16 and 17 of this plan;  
c. Respect the amenity and function of both existing and future development, including  
matters of privacy, security, overlooking, outlook, natura l lighting, ventilation, highway 
safety, traffic congestion, any form of pollution or other  disturbance;  
d. Provide well -designed streets and spaces which support and sustain a broad variety of 
users and community activity. Within the street there should be a  clear  distinction 
between  public  and private  spaces,  continuity of  street frontages, and appropriate levels 
of enclosure to create active, comfortable, and safe public  spaces;  
e. Address community safety issues in accordance with 'Secure by Design'  principle s, to 
reduce the incidence of crime and anti -social  activity;  
f. Create the conditions for walking and cycling between locations within and beyond the 
development, and prioritise these travel modes through the safe integration of walking 
and cycling routes. O pportunities for new walking and cycling routes will be sought when 
the existing permeability is poor;  
g. Incorporate a network of multifunctional open spaces which provide opportunities for a 
range of different active uses, and also offer benefits in terms o f wildlife and 
environmental mitigation, having regard to policies NE1 and HC1 of this plan;  
h. Deliver  buildings,  places  and spaces  that promote healthy  lifestyles  and can adapt to 
changing social, technological, economic, and environmental  conditions;  
i. Suppo rt diversity and choice through the efficient use of land and infrastructure by 
ensuring  a mix of compatible uses and development densities that respond to local 
needs and enhances the special qualities of an area;  and 
j. Foster an inclusive and accessible environment that functions safely for  all.  
 
153 
 Where appropriate , design guidance, development briefs, masterplans, regeneration strategies , 
public realm strategies, and design guidance in Supplementary Planning Documents  will be 
prepared  and used to consider new development proposals  to ensure  that new development  is well 
designed to  reflect  its context  and respond  to future  needs.  When new development proposals are 
brought  forward  within a designated  neighbourhood area , the local design policies and guidance 
within the adopted Neighbourhood Plan will be applicable . 
 For larger  single  use schemes  or mixed  use developments  applicants  are encouraged  to engage  in 
a relevant  Design  Review  process.  This should  initially  form part of the pre-application  process,  with 
further review panels carried out through the formal planning application process if  required.  
 
ALLOCATION POLIC Y 
Policy DES2: Areas of Special Development Control  
Evidence Base  
 There  are three  areas  where  Special  Development  Control  (SDC)  policies  have  existed  since  the 
1980s  to protect  the character  of these  and their surrounding  areas.  These  are Ramsden  Bellhouse, 
Bowers  Gifford  and Sugden  Avenue,  Wickford.  These  ensure  that only development  of a satisfactory 
design and layout takes place by setting out a series of measures which are designed to ensure 
that new dwellings do not dominate the street scene, are not out of character, and do not cause 
excessive overlooking or overshadowing of existing  properties.  
 Ramsden Bellhouse is characterised by low d ensity residential development set in large plots.  In 
order  to retain  its semi -rural,  spacious  character,  a practice  of requiring  minimum  plot widths  was 
formalised in 1986, and applies to all new dwellings. Similarly, special development control 
standards  are applicable in Sugden Avenue, Wickford which limit the floor space, plot widths and 
types of new  dwellings.  In Bowers  Gifford,  the use of maximum  ridge  heights,  and the retention  of a 1 
metre gap between flank walls of new chalets and site boundaries a ims to minimise the impact of 
any new chalets on the surrounding  area.  
 While  SDC  policies  have  influenced  the character  of these  areas,  marked  by low density  residential 
development set in large, spacious plots, it is important to consider whether SDC poli cies will 
continue to be required given that these areas are now built up , with new housing site  allocations  
adjacent  to some  of them and with two of the areas now being part of designated neighbourhood 
planning areas . Having  regard  to planning  applications that went  to appeal  over the last 5 years  in the 
three  Areas  of Special  Development  Control,  SDC policies  were  often  not given  significant  weight  
when  making  appeal  decisions,  with considerations given instead to the overall design objectives.  
Given the relatively built -up nature of the Areas of Special  Development  Control,  the trends  
presented  by past appeal  decisions,  and future  indications of  strategic  housing  allocations  on 
surrounding  countryside,  the effectiveness  of SDC  policies  may cont inue to  lessen.  It is also likely 
that policies managing development  and those  regard ing design and local character for the areas 
within the designated neighbourhood areas will be incorporated within Neighbourhood Plans. 
However , until such a time that the re are up to date Neighbourhood Plans for these areas  with 
relevant policies,  and to ensure that the area outside of a designated neighbourhood area 
maintains its unique character , it is important that policy which preserves the existing character  of 
these areas is included within this plan.  
 While these areas do not have the same status or level of protection as Conservation Areas, it  is 
still appropriate for them to be recognised and some thought given to their preservation and 
enhancement. The th ree existing Areas of Special Development Control have a recognisable and 
distinctive special character and appearance, often identifiable and cohesive. Previous  policies 
may have been ineffective  in preserving  the open  character  of the surrounding  country side and the 
adjacent  Green Belt,  but it is worth  noting  that the localised  character  and amenity  of these  
settlements  should  be preserved in order to minimise the impact of new development. This is to 
ensure that only development of a satisfactory design and layout takes place, which would shape 
the potential  for area specific characteristics to be effectively  considered . 
  
 
154 Policy DES2  
Areas of Special Development Control  
 Within  Areas  of Special  Development  Control  as defined  on the Policies  Map,  new development  will 
be critically  examined  in strict  accordance  with the criteria  set out in policy  DES1  to ensure  the special 
character of the area is maintained. This policy will apply to proposals within the two designated 
neighbourhood areas until such a time that Neighbourhood Plans for the relevant Special 
Development Control Areas are adopted which cover the design and management of development  
within these areas. Extensions to dwellings should respect the symmetry of the original  buildings.  
 Any proposals for residential development including new build, replacement dwellings, infilling and 
extensions  should:  
a. Be constructed on building plots of a similar average width as surrounding residential 
development;  
b. Harmonise with the building he ights predominant in the  area;  
c. Be constructed on a similar building line (formed by the front main walls of existing 
houses) and be of a similar scale, form and proportion as adjacent  houses;  
d. Reflect the materials, design features and architectural style p redominant in the area;  
and 
e. Achieve sufficient architectural variety in order to retain the area characteristics of large 
individually designed  houses.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES   
Policy DES3: Urban Character Areas  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  establishes that development should respond to an area’s character and identity, 
creating or reinforcing its local distinctiveness. Policy DES3 expands upon this requirement by 
setting  out the criteria  against  which  a development’s  response  to local chara cter and distinctiveness will 
be assessed.  
Evidence Base  
 The Urban Characterisation and Design Review Study  identifies, describes and analyses the 
character and quality of the Borough and its different areas. This identifies a number of distinct 
urban  character  areas  within  the Borough  that reflect  social  and functional  geographies,  as opposed to 
administrative boundaries. Each character area has been assessed in order to understand its local  
distinctiveness  by examining  the relationships  between  topography,  settlement  patterns  and 
developments in human activity that have helped to form the character of a particular area. By 
understanding the characteristics that give a particular area its own sense of place, it is possible to  
identify  the context  for future  design  and respond  effectively  by guiding  development  principles so 
that they reinforce this local  character.  
 Twelve  distinct  Urban  Character  Areas  have  been  identified  which  operate  differently  and distinctly 
enough in the Borough. These  are: 
 Little Burstead  
 Modern Billericay  
 Great Burstead & South Green  
 Historic Billericay  
 Ramsden Bellhouse & Crays Hill  
 Old Wickford  
 Modern Wickford  
 Basildon Enterprise Corridor  
 Basildon New Town  
 Langdon Hills   
 
155  Noak Bridge  
 Bowers Gifford  
 The study identified the k ey components which contribute to the local character of each urban 
character  area.  It highlights  those  features  of the existing  urban  environment  that contribute  to, or 
detract  from their quality,  and also the future  development  opportunities  to manage,  maintain  and 
improve the built environment in order to promote the Borough's distinctiveness and maintain a 
sense  of place.  Designing  for local distinctiveness  involves  reconciliation  of local practices,  against 
different construction techniques, materials , building types and local needs. If designed 
appropriately,  new and old buildings  can co-exist without  conflicting  with one another.  
Policy DES3  
Urban Character Areas  
 The Borough’s  Urban  Character  Areas will be managed  and where possible, enhanced through  
development proposals using character assessments as part  of the planning application  process, 
and taking int o account the Basildon Borough u rban design evidence base. 
 Planning applications will be expected to respond effectively to local character and di stinctiveness. 
Where  there  are local features  or characteristics  that are considered  to undermine  the overall  character 
of the area,  and/or  it relates  poorly  to the surrounding  development  or lacks  a coherent  and integrated 
built form,  new development  will be expected  to take reasonable  steps  to improve  the area’s  character, 
enclosure, permeability, public realm and appearance and better integrate the area with its 
surroundings.  
 Where there are no significant or predominant local design styles, innovative contemporary design 
is encouraged, however regard should be had to characteristic features of the wider Borough such 
as using local materials or adopting successful urban  forms.  
 
Policy DES4: High Quality Buildings  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects  Local Plans to include  robust  and comprehensive  policies  that set out the 
quality of development expected in an area, using amongst other things, buildings to establish  a 
strong  sense  of place. Policies should not attempt to stifle innovation or originality, although they 
may seek to reinforce local character and distinctiveness.  
 In order to achieve h igh quality and inclusive design for all development, including individual 
buildings, public and p rivate spaces and wider area development schemes, positive planning is 
important.  
Evidence Base  
 The Urban  Characterisation  and Design  Review  Study  of the Borough  reveals  that the urban  area 
within the Borough is characterised by extensive residential development. Housing largely 
comprises an eclectic mix of suburban two -three storey detached, semi -detached and terraced 
houses, interspersed with bungalows, and mid -rise apartment blocks. Residential uses  located 
outside of the main built -up areas vary considerably in terms of the design and  quality.  
 The appearance of buildings and the differing architectural treatments found within the Borough 
relate strongly to specific periods of development and reflect  spatial variations, which has led to the  
Borough's  mixed  character.  Until the 19th century,  the vast majority  of buildings  and structures were 
constructed from locally produced materials, mainly timber, plaster, and tiles. Post -war buildings  
which  are the most  prevalent  within  the Borough  are in a variety  of styles  using  traditional materials 
such as bricks, concrete, copper, timber frame and some with cladding, render and pebble dash. 
Some construction styles in the 21st Century have also used more contem porary materials and 
surface treatments, often in combination with traditional materials including glass, steel, aluminium 
and resin  bond.   
 
156 
 Influence from period features of traditional Essex towns and villages is evident in architectural 
detailing and faça des of buildings over much of the Borough, adding visual richness and interest to 
the character and image of the townscape. However, poorer quality buildings which are  falling into 
disrepair and under -use, as well as unsympathetic conversions and alteratio ns are starting to 
undermine the overall quality of the built  environment.  
 Although  there  are only a few older  buildings  that have  been  intentionally  designed  for adaptability 
and sustainability, some are capable of responding to changing environmental  circumstances 
depending upon the additional investment required to achieve adaptable designs and materials. 
Going forward, new and refurbished buildings should be ad aptable over time, and incorporate 
energy efficient design and sustainable construction techniques, following the principles of a 
sustainable development  in conjunction  with the relevant  sections  of policies  CC5 and CC6.  In 
addition,  building orientation  and the impact  of any microclimate  should  be considered  within  the 
design  and layout of new development from an early  stage.  
 Commercial properties are concentrated in specific areas within the Borough, as the New Town 
was planned using strong segregation between land uses. Buildings  in these areas can have  a 
uniform  character,  with building  blocks  of standardised  shapes of  muted  or metallic  finish  and limited 
architectural  detail.  Mostly constructed from brick, metal, glass or prefabricated panels they are 
designed to be functional and commercially aesthetic. Further enhancements can serve to improve 
the character and quality of these premises.  
 Features  and detailing  on commercial  properties  can help to add interest  to the commercial  street 
scene and appearance of the economic area. The composition of non -residential frontages is 
important in order that these buildings contribute positively to the character and appearance of 
buildings as a whole, and their inter -relationship with neighbouring buildings and the  surrounding 
area.  Within  many  of the town  centres,  local centres  and employment  areas,  signs/brands  feature 
heavily on the frontage of commercial properties and on building façades, promoting the name and  
operations  of businesses,  which  vary in quality.   
 Roller  shutters  and other  forms  of security  of varying aesthetic desirability are also a common 
feature of commercial frontages. Shopfronts, securi ty shutters and canopies in town and local 
centres can also influence perceptions of the accessibility and security  of an area and visually  
impact  on the street  scene.  External roller shutters however can often obscure the architectural 
features of the bui ldings they are attached to and can become targeted by graffiti and fly posting, 
which often leads to a more unwelcoming and hostile  environment. A  proliferation  of solid security  
shutters can often create a fortress -like atmosphere in town centres and local centres when 
premises  are closed, and can make the public realm feel unsafe. Generally, shutters with a 
transparent 'open mesh'  design  help to maintain  visual  interest  and along  with a mix of appropriate  
town  centre  uses, help to enliven town centres  during the  evening.  
 While it is necessary for security to be provided for such properties, a balance must be reached 
between  security  and the impact  on the appearance  of the street scene.  Such  holistic  outcomes  are 
best achieved  when  they are explored  as an integral  part of the property's  frontage  at the design  
stage, which the Council will  encourage.  
Policy DES4  
High Qua lity Buildings  
 Buildings should be designed to a high standard, responding appropriately to their location and 
reflecting  their function  and role in relation  to the public  realm.  Proposals  for new buildings,  extensions, 
and alterations to existing buildings will be expected  to: 
a. Use good quality and durable building materials, that are appropriate to the context of  the 
development;  
b. Be clearly organised in terms of their form and internal layout and circulation to reflect 
the hierarchy of function they will accommodate, the uses they will serve and the context 
they will address;  
c. Establish a coherent and consistent building line that rela tes to the existing street  
alignment;  
d. Incorporate active frontages to the public realm that emphasise corners, establishes new, 
or reinforces the most prominent existing frontages, and provide natural surveillance over 
all publicly accessible  spaces;   
 
157 e. Creat e distinct public frontages and private areas with clear and delineated  boundaries;  
f. Allow for flexibility in future adaptation or extension to accommodate alternative uses, or 
to respond  to the changing  future  needs  or circumstances  of occupiers  by means  of their 
internal arrangement, internal height, detailed design and  construction;  
g. Incorporate  exteriors  and elevations  that provide  visual  interest,  and are visually  organised  
and well -proportioned to contribute positively to the legibility of the area;  and 
h. Enable  the provision  of adequate,  appropriate  and usable  private  or communal  amenity  
space, defensible space, as well as parking and servicing as  necessary.  
 In addition, extensions and alterations to existing buildings or spaces will be expected  to: 
a. Respe ct the siting, scale, form, proportions, materials, details and the overall design  and 
character of the host building, its curtilage and the wider street scene;  and 
b. Retain and/or reinstate traditional or distinctive architectural features and  fabric.  
 In all cases, the  provision  of security  measures  should  form an integral  part of the design  approach 
for buildings. External roller  shutters will only be acceptable if it can be demonstrated that there is 
no other suitable alternative. In such instances the r oller shutters must be weaved or  open -grille.  
 
Policy DES5: High Quality Landscaping and Public Realm Design  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  emphasises  the importance  of planning  positively  for the achievement  of high quality  and 
inclusive  design  for public  and private  spaces  in Local  Plans,  in particular,  establishing a strong 
sense of place using streetscapes to create attractive and comfortable places to live, work and  
visit. The PPG  states that all forms of new development should be designed so that they are 
successfully integrated with their surrounding context, irrespective of whether the site lies on the 
urban fringe, or at the heart of a town  centre.  
 In addition, best practice8 sets out what is meant by good design, and how streets and spaces can 
feel and function better. It emphasises the need to design streets as social spaces, and to ensure  
the public  realm  is designed  for a variety  of users  and is visually  attractive  and encourages social  
interaction.  
Evidence Base  
 The Borough’s  public  realm  comprises  streets,  movement  corridors,  squares,  parks,  and areas  of 
open space within the built and natural environment which are publicly accessible. Public realm is  
not limited  to land within  public  ownership,  but can also include  privately  owned  spaces,  or those 
areas  within  communal  developments  which  the public  have  access.  Its role is vital for social  and 
community cohesion and ensures people remain in places to shop or do business, sit, interact with 
others and generally have the freedom to spend time outside.  As the Borough's population 
increases, so will the importance of having a range of high quality public spaces to make 
communities sustainable.  
 Landscaping, in terms of both hard and soft features, plays an integral part in defining the  quality of  
the public realm  and delineating  areas  for specific  activities.  Trees,  shrubs,  grass  verges,  hedging and  
other  planting  treatments  form soft landscaping.  Hard  landscaping  comprise  the use of paving, bricks, 
timber and other materials to form paths, parking areas, driveways, public squares and boundaries. 
Landscaping schemes are therefore important on sites in prominent locations such as along main 
road frontages, transport corridors, places where people gather (including town centres) and areas 
of high townscape or  landscape  quality. They are also important when seeking to integrate new 
developments on the edge of towns into the landscape in which they sit, and the neighbouring 
urban area.  
 Trees, hedges and surfaced areas contribute to a sense of place by helping to  create attractive, 
safe and usable outdoor spaces. In parts of the Borough, particularly in and around Billericay, 
                                                      
 
8 Including The Manual for Streets 1 and 2, and the Urban Design Compendium   
 
158 Langdon Hills, and Noak Bridge there are a greater presence of street trees, low hedging and 
different  planting  or surface  treatments  that contribute  to a high quality  streetscape.  Where  streets 
are absent  of soft landscaping,  the public  realm  and urban  form can feel more  harsh  and oppressive to 
users.  
 Consideration  of the location  of any landscaping  is important.  Soft landscaping  should  be provided in  
areas  where  vegetation  is able to thrive  and survive  in the long term.  It should  however  also be 
appropriate in terms of amenity. For example, the provision of fast growing shrubs, would not be 
suitable in areas where visibility splays or natur al surveillance is required, and evergreen trees are  
not normally  suitable  in more  confined  areas,  where  light may be limited  or restricted.  Subject to 
their appropriateness to the location however, defensible planting, such as spiny or thorny species, 
can be both unusual and attractive features in any landscaping scheme, as well as an aid in the 
security of a  development.  
 The selection  of species  for soft landscaping  is also of importance.  Suitable  native  species  should be  
the primary  choice,  particularly  having  regard  to the potential  ecological  and biodiversity  benefits. 
Consideration should also be given to climatic conditions and air quality conditions, appropriate to 
relevant  species. It is recognised that there may be instances where the use of non -native species 
can be justified. For example, where a non -native species may offer specific environmental benefits 
that make them particularly suitable for use on a site. The use of non -native species should 
however normally be avoided.  
 In respect  of hard landscaping,  this succeeds  when  it is integrated  into the public  realm  as a whole. If  
treated  as an afterthought  such  features  can be seen  as obtrusive  or alien. In some locations, such 
as town centres there may be a public realm strategy in place to direc t the provision of public realm 
works which complement the wider area. Relevant development proposals should apply  the design 
principles embedded in such strategies. Some developments however, especially those in town 
centres without a public realm strateg y, on the edge of settlements, or where new places are being 
created within the A127 Enterprise Corridor will re quire a public realm strategy themselves in order 
to ensure effective integration.  
 When preparing proposals for the public realm, consideration should be given to the way people 
use spaces. For example, consideration should be given to potential desire lines when identifying 
paved areas, and materials should be used which safeguard against anti -social behavio ur, such as 
graffiti and vandalism.  
 Consideration should also be given to how car parking is integrated into the layout and design of 
the public rea lm as increased levels of car ownership and multi -car households has led to 
pressures for on -street parking. In some areas this causes problems wit h excessive on -street 
parking, parking on pavements and a loss of landscape from the street scene as frontages are 
paved to accommodate off -street parking. This acts to make the public realm appear cluttered and 
less green in many parts of the  Borough, and  should be avoided.  
 Attention should also be given as to how public open spaces and play areas are integrated into the 
design of the public realm. The Borough  benefits  from a network  of public  open  spaces,  play areas  and 
recreation  grounds which  provide  opportunities  for exercise,  sport  and active  or passive  recreation.  
There  are however some public spaces that are more isolated or enclosed, which means they do 
not benefit from natural surveillance and can feel less safe or secure to  use. Again, such design  
should be avoided.  
 There  is scope  for public  realm  improvements  in the Borough  and the Council  will continue  to seek 
the introduction of new high quality public realm, or improvements to existing areas as part of its 
future  development. This should incorporate landscaping to create greener feeling, more 
welcoming places which also contribute to environmental well -being through flood risk 
management, urban cooling, air quality amelioration and habitat creation.  
Policy DES5  
High Quality Landscaping and  Public Realm Design  
 All development  must contribute  to safe,  inclusive,  accessible,  attractive, and  user friendly  streets  
and spaces  that encourage  appropriate  levels  of activity,  social  interaction, and  connections  for all 
users.    
 
159 
 Proposals for new development or the redevelopment of prominent sites within town centres, and 
for developments comprising 50 homes or more, or 1,000 m2 or more in other locations will be 
expected to be supported by a Public Realm Strategy setting out how they will:  
a. Incorpor ate appropriate materials, street furniture, and lighting of high quality,  
environmental performance and  durability;  
b. Harmonise with the street scene and enhance the quality, character and appearance of  
the public realm through their siting and  design;  
c. Conserve and enhance any historic fabric, features and  assets;  
d. Seek to minimise visual  clutter;  
e. Ensure legibility and permeability within and surrounding the  development;  
f. Incorporate good quality landscape design with an emphasis on creating an attractive 
green environment;  
g. Incorporate public  art in accordance with policy DES 6; 
h. Sensitively integrate and prioritise appropriate levels of movement infrastructure for all 
users, having regard to age, gender and disability, including provision for convenient 
pede strian  and cycle  movement;  
i. Ensure that any vehicle and cycle parking and provision for servicing are appropriate and 
are sensitively integrated so as not to dominate the public realm;  and 
j. Be designed  to enhance  safety  and security  in the environment  by creating  natural  
surveillance.  
 In all cases where a Public Realm Strategy is required, and in any other case where landscaping is 
required to make a development proposal acceptable, a detailed Landscape Strategy should be 
prepared and approved by the Counc il, which can be incorporated into the Public Realm Strategy if 
appropriate, which:  
a. Includes  planting  plans  identifying  the species  types,  sizes,  numbers,  densities  of plants  
proposed in the planting regime and any necessary aftercare arrangements;  
b. Include s native species, as a biodiversity priority, appropriate to the location and  climatic 
conditions and if applicable, justifies why non -native species are  proposed;  
c. Incorporate  hard detailing and  materials  for all elements  including  surfacing,  changes  of 
level, boundary treatments, and street  furniture;  
d. Integrates measures to manage climate change, improve air quality and promote 
biodiversity;  
e. Integrate sustainable drainage systems to help manage surface water and run -off; 
f. Take account of the function, cir culation and servicing of places and any site constraints;  
and 
g. Set out the maintenance and management of landscaping  areas.  
 All significant development proposals, as defined by Part 2 of this policy, will be required to 
contribute to the provision, enhance ment and  maintenance  of the public  realm,  either  by means  of 
on-site provision,  and/or a financial  contribution. Where  appropriate,  a Planning  Obligation  may be 
used  to secure  off-site public  realm  improvements.  
 Integrated or incidental landscaping that will be disturbed or removed during  construction  of 
development  will be expected  to be reinstated  following  the development's  completion to a standard 
the same, or better, than that which existed prior to the development occurring. This will be secured 
by a planning condition, or where necessary a planning obligation.  
 
Policy DES6: Public Art and Cultural Interpretation  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  stresses  the importance  of creating  places  that reinforce  local identity,  and are visually 
attractive as a result of good architecture and appropriate landscaping. High quality inn ovative 
design, in new buildings and public realm, including public art improves the quality of life for 
everybody by creating attractive and comfortable places to live, work and  visit. 
 The Essex Public Art Guide  stresses the benefits of public art on the quality of the environment, 
and associated benefits for the economy and for communities. It advocates a ‘Percent for Art’  
 
160 whereby developers use 1% of the development cost for commissioning artwork.  
Evidence Base  
 Public art can enhance the aesthetics, character and interest of the public realm and inspire 
community pride and ownership. It can contribute to local distinctiveness, increase the use of public 
open space, and can attract further i nvestment and high quality forms of development  into an area. 
Public art can be incorporated into development in a number of ways, through the introduction of 
physical elements such as sculptures and monuments, to elements of detailing in paving, elevation  
treatment, as well as space for temporary art exhibitions or  installations.  
 Developing and delivering public art is best achieved as a collaboration between artists and 
developers  from the concept  stage,  rather  than being  a stand -alone  project.  Furthermore,  working 
with local communities  in developing  ideas  and actual  art work  results  in the local people  creating 
their own environment and bringing about a better sense of ownership and pride in their locality 
and could result in less anti -social b ehaviour or vandalism to  installations.  
 It is important  to consider  what  the public  art is seeking  to achieve  and how appropriate  it is to its 
surroundings. The size and complexity of each project will vary depending on the site, as well as 
the size and type of development proposed, and it is important to ensure that its design, palette of 
materials and location are sensitive to its surroundings, but at the same time not losing the 
'statement' to be made by the public  art. 
 Opportunities for public art in open and civic spaces should be considered at an early stage of a 
development or scheme, to ensure that they are successfully integrated into the final design. 
Where works of public art are sited in the public realm, they should be endowed to secure their 
appropriate  maintenance  in perpetuity,  and their retention  will be secured  by conditions  in planning 
permissions,  or legal  agreements  where  appropriate.  Where  works  of art form part of a development or  
are on private  land it is expected  that those  pieces  will be maintained  to a high standard  by the land  
owner.  
Policy DES6  
Public Art and Cultural Interpretation  
 The Council will encourage the provision of high quality, sustainable, new  or extended public art 
within the Borough.  
 The provision of all public ar t and interpretation/information infrastructure must contribute  positively 
to the locality, be site specific, and have regard to all other relevant policies in this plan.  
 The Council  will require  the provision  of public  art within  the following types of  development. The 
scale of public art provision should be proportionate to the scale of development, with a value 
equivalent to 1% of the construction value of the development, subject to viability:  
a. Developments comprising 50 or more residential  dwellings;  
b. Developments comprising 1,000m2 or more commercial  floorspace;  
c. Developments which are likely to have a significant impact upon the public realm due to 
their nature or location;  or 
d. Developments which are likely to have a high degree of public  access.  
 The Council  will seek the protection of existing  public  art, requiring  the appropriate  reinstatement  or 
re-siting  of artworks and other objects of cultural significance when such buildings or sites are  
redeveloped. Planning Conditions, or, if necessary, Planni ng Obligations, will be used to secure 
arrangements for protecting public art affected by development activities.  
 
Policy DES7: Managing Advertisements  
Policy Context  
 Advertisements are controlled under the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertiseme nt)  
 
161 Regulations 2007 . Some advertisements benefit from deemed consent , where ce rtain criteria are 
met. Others require express consent  as a consequence of their potential to impact on amenity and 
public safety. The regulations do not establish the meaning o f amenity or public safety, and this is 
therefore a matter for local determination, although there is clear rules preventing the setting of 
criteria related to the content or subject matter of advertisements.  The NPPF  states that 
advertisements should be s ubject to control only in the interests of amenity and public safety, 
taking into account cumulative impacts.  
 Guidance on whether express consent for advertisement is required can be found in the DCLG 
publication Outdoor advertisements and signs: a guide f or advertisers (2007).  
Evidence Base  
 Well designed  and considerately  located  outdoor  advertisements  add to the interest  and vibrancy of 
town centres and other commercial areas. Advertisements contribute positively to the  legibility of  
the urban  environment  to help attract  the attention  of passers -by either  to inform,  guide  or direct. It  is 
therefore  important  to ensure  that the cumulative  effects  of advertisements  do not detract  from the 
character of an area, and are not detrimental to amenity and public  safety. 
 Advertisements within residential areas, or at the interface of commercial and residential areas can  
adversely  affect  the amenity  of the residential  area if not adequately  managed.  Advertisements which 
are illuminated, emit noise or contain moving parts can have greater potential to cause nuisance to 
people living or working nearby, as well as causing distraction to drivers. In the  more commercial  
context  of town  centres,  illuminated  and moving  display  units  are to be more  expected, but  could  
nevertheless  adversely  impact  upon  residential  premises  above  ground  level.  Furthermore, a 
proliferation  of freestanding  advertisements  can add to street  clutter  and obstructions  within  the 
wider  public  realm.  
 Areas that are particularly sensitive to advertisements include the Green Belt, open spaces, 
environmentally  sensitive  areas  and Conservation  Areas.  Designated  and non-designated  heritage 
assets are also sensitive to advertisements, and the act of fixing the advertisement may require 
specific consents in respects of Listed  Buildings.  
Policy DES7  
Managing Advertisements  
 Advertising structures should be of high quality, integrate with the street scene, and relate positively 
to the  surrounding  environmental  context.  In determining applications for express advertisement 
consent, the Council will have regard to their impact on public safety and  amenity  including their 
cumulative impact . 
 Proposals for advertisements will be approved  where:  
a. They do not adversely affect the amenity of residential occupiers and/or the area, by  
reason of their design, siting, scale, illumination or noise, having regard to the character 
and use of the building and/or  area;  
b. They  will not  result  in a proliferation  of adver tisements;  
c. They contribute to an inclusive, legible, and safe environment for pedestrians, cyclists 
and drivers;  and 
d. They contribute positively to public perceptions of  security.  
 Within  Conservation  Areas  and residential  areas,  internally  illuminated  box fascia  signs  and projecting 
signs will not be permitted unless they are successfully related to the design and detailing of the 
building and positively contribute to the special character of a group of buildings or the  street.  
 Advertisement  consent  will not be permitted  for poster  advertising  in the Green  Belt. Other  forms  of 
advertisement  in the Green  Belt which  require  consent  will be considered  against  whether  they affect 
the openness or purposes of including land within the Green Belt, including the cumulative effects of 
advance signs along the highway, and may be refused to avoid a proliferation of  advertisements.

STRATEGIC POLICIES  
Policy HC1: Health and Well -being Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF identifies the role of the planning system in facilitating social interaction and creating 
healthy, inclusive communities. Local planning authorities are expected to  promote inclusive  and 
active environments which promote opportunities for community cohesion and activity, to enable 
communities to independently support their own health, social and cultural  well-being.  
 The PPG  defines a healthy community as a place that  ‘supports healthy behaviours and supports 
reductions in health inequalities’. This is not only restricted to promoting physical and recreational 
activities, but also includes enabling the creation of healthy living environments for people of all 
ages whic h supports social interaction and emotional health and well -being, which are equally 
important to resilient communities.  
 It is not however the role of the Local Plan alone to deliver healthy communities . The NPPF 
expects local planning authorities to work with public health leads and health organisations to 
understand and take account of the health status and needs  of the  local population,  including  
expected  future  changes,  and any information  about  relevant  barriers to improving health and  well-
being.  
 Local authorities have a crucial role in delivering sport and physical activity opportunities. Local 
health and well-being strategies9 have highlighted physical inactivity as an issue that needs to be 
tackled. Sport England, through their ‘Active Design’ p olicy, promote 10 principles that promote 
activity, health and stronger communities through the way towns and cities are designed and built. 
Sport England also have a strategy ‘Towards an Active Nation’ which sets out their vision to 
encourage everyone to feel able to engage in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, 
background or level of ability.  
 Essex County Council have a statutory duty to 'improve the health of their local populations' and 
are responsible for public health across the county. A local Health and Well -being Board has been 
established in the Borough to facilitate this delivery, alongside the Essex Health and Well -Being 
Board. The Joint Health and Well-Being Strategy for Essex (2012)  established a strategy for 
achieving this statutor y duty. Basildon Council is one of the partners that has joined up with Active 
Essex, a publicly funded organisation hosted by Essex County Council, to be part of the ‘ Active 
Essex Strategy 2017 – 2021’ , which has received national lottery funding to creat e innovative 
partnerships to make it easier for people to access sport and physical activity within Essex, 
therefore improving health and well -being.  
 At this time, NHS England commissions core GP services. Meanwhile, the Basildon and Brentwood 
CCG covers B asildon Borough and Brentwood Borough. The CCG is responsible for 
commissioning other primary and secondary healthcare services needed in this area, and prepares 
plans for this purpose. It is responsible for ensuring that its commissioning plans link to th e Joint  
Essex Health  and Well -being Strategy . As an acute service provider Basildon and Thurrock 
University Hospital has an important role in delivering services required by the CCG, and is 
therefore essential to the health and well -being of residents in the Borough , and neighbouring 
areas. There are a range of other providers for GP, community health and mental health services.  
 Meanwhile, Essex County Council is responsible for social care provision across all Essex Districts 
and Boroughs. Various strateg ies have been produced in order to ensure that social care provision 
responds to the various needs of different groups within the population including both young people 
and older people, however increasingly community based initiatives which reduce the nee d for 
costly residential based responses are  favoured.

163 Evidence Base  
 The Linking Planning, Health and Wellbeing  Topic Paper  draws together evidence from a range of 
sources to identify how the L ocal Plan can most effectively address matters of health and we ll-
being in the Borough. In particular it draws on the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment  and the Joint 
Essex Health and Wellbeing Strategy , as well as deprivation information in order to identify 
priorities for health and well -being that should be addressed  through the Local Plan. The priorities 
identified are:  
 Deprivation and inequality in health outcomes  
 Low rates of physical activity within the population  
 An ageing population (ageing well)  
 Improving mental health and well -being  
 Reducing the prevalence of adult and child obesity  
 Whilst it is likely that most people will suffer some form of ill health at some point, the Linking 
Planning, Health and Wellbeing  Topic Paper  presents evidence which shows that there is a 
significant link between deprivation, espec ially employment deprivation, and health outcomes. It is 
therefore essential in Basildon, where life expectancy for men varies by 10 years between the most 
deprived and least deprived wards, that access to services and employment are as much a focus 
for he alth and well -being as matters which are more traditionally linked to health.  
 Evidence from studies and research across various urban areas, also shows that access to a good 
quality environment, with green spaces and places to walk, contributes towards bot h the physical 
and mental well -being of people ensuring that they are in the best health to engage in employment, 
or training which leads to employment. The quality of the physical environment is therefore key to 
addressing both health outcomes and issues associated with deprivation. However, this would 
indicate that the Basildon urban area (including Laindon and Pitsea) has a poor quality 
environment with limited green space and opportunities for walking etc., which is not the case. 
Whilst there is a need for the quality of some open spaces to be improved to promote increased 
appeal, use and activity there is an over -supply of open space in Basildon and most areas are of 
an adequate to good standard. The Basildon urban area also has a good, planned cycle ne twork 
compared to other areas, albeit there is a need for some links to be improved. Despite this, 
Basildon has low rates of participation in regular physical activity and one of the lowest rates of 
cycling to work in Essex. Similarly, rates of walking to work could also be increased. Therefore, 
whilst the quality of the environment is important to health and well -being, it does not necessarily 
mean that people will engage in activity, or be less deprived, as there are a more complex range of 
matters to be addressed. Nonetheless, it cannot but help to remove or reduce the physical barriers 
to activity.  
 Obesity is also an issue within the Borough and is linked to poor health outcomes. Whilst physical 
activity can help to manage obesity, it is important to als o create opportunities for people to eat 
well. The Hot Food Takeaways Assessment  shows that there is a particular prevalence of 
takeaways in those parts of the Borough which are more deprived. Takeaway food is typically more 
calorific than home cooked food  and can contribute towards obesity. There is evidence from other 
parts of England that actions to manage the prevalence of takeaways can contribute towards better 
health outcomes. Furthermore, opportunities to grow food locally such as in gardens and 
allotments can also contribute towards better eating, and better health outcomes. There is 
therefore evidence to suggest existing allotments should be retained and improved, whilst new 
allotments and gardens should be appropriately incorporated into developmen ts. 
 Access to services and the right types of accommodation can also enable, or otherwise isolate 
people. This has implications for their ability to participate in both the community and in 
employment and training. Poor quality, or the wrong type of accomm odation can make people ill, or 
else see them trapped in their homes. Opportunities to access services meanwhile ensures people 
can interact with others and get the support they need to thrive. It cannot however be assumed that 
services, and jobs are acces sible if people cannot walk, cycle or get a bus to them, as not 
everyone, especially in deprived communities, has access to a car. The need for specialist 
accommodation in accessible locations for older people and disabled adults is especially important, 
as it will help these groups of people to stay healthy and well for longer.  
 Whilst there are measures that can be taken to ensure that both existing communities and new 
development create opportunities for people to live well, there will always be a demand for health  
 
164 services, and evidence has indicated that an ageing population will continue to give rise to strains 
on these services into the future. There is therefore a need for the CCG and health service 
providers to review how they deliver their services to respond to current and emerging patterns of 
demand, and also new technologies. The Council has been working closely with NHS England, the 
CCG and Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital in this regard, and has already delivered a 
new health centre in Wickford via joint working arrangements and is about to commence work on a 
similar joint project with the hospital to moderni se visitor and patient facilities as well as create 
additional clinical space.  
 There is also a requirement to consider how need ari sing from growth can be accommodated 
within the system. In the first instance, developments will be expected to limit need through the 
application of good quality design and layout which applies active design principles , as advocated 
in the Essex Design Gu ide. The Essex Planning Officers Association has prepared Health Impact 
Assessment Guidance , and this will be applied to all appropriate developments to ensure that 
opportunities to promote good health, and reduce impacts on health services have been  
incorporated into development.  A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) allows for assessment of the 
development against a number of criteria that are known to influence health and well -being and 
enable Basildon Council to meet the NPPF  objectives of creating hea lthy communities. The use of 
a HIA, as a material consideration, also enables Basildon Council to ensure that the positives 
benefits from the proposed development can be maximised whilst any identified negatives are 
either removed or mitigated against. In addition, a HIA may be required when it is identified through 
an Environmental Impact Assessment. In this instance, a HIA may be part of an expanded element 
to human health, as an integrated assessment or be required as a full HIA. The approach should 
be agreed by the Council early in the preparation of a planning application.  
 Whilst the Council expects development to minimise health impacts , there  will remain  a need for 
additional healthcare provision, and developments will be expected to contribute toward s the 
expansion of services necessary to support growth. This may take the form of new GP hubs, the 
expansion of existing facilities, or the provision of infrastructure which enables existing facilities to 
be used more effectively, or for longer. It will b e for NHS England and the CCG, in consultation with 
the service providers, to determine the types of interventions needed in each area to support 
growth. The Council will continue to work with NHS England and the CCG, and the service 
providers including Basildon  Hospital, to determine the types of interventions needed as early as 
possible and incorporate these into the Borough’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan . 
Policy HC1  
Health and Well -being Strategy  
Throughout the plan period, the Council will seek to deliv er development and growth which has a positive 
impact on th e health and well -being of residents, and address issues of health deprivation and health inequality 
in the Borough. In order to achieve this, the Council will:  
 Promote good physical and mental health and healthy lifestyles amongst residents by:  
a. Ensuring access to high quality open spaces, and opportunities to engage in sport and 
recreation;  
b. Providing opportunities for people to walk and cycle, both for recreation purposes, and 
also as part of th eir day to day activities; and  
c. Encouraging residents to grow their own foods, and managing further provision of 
takeaways within the Borough.  
 Ensure that everybody has the opportunity to participate within the community, and access 
employment opportunities  within the Borough by:  
a. Ensuring community facilities are of a good quality and are located where they can be 
accessed by walking, cycling and public transport; and  
b. Ensuring that the accommodation needs of older people and disabled adults are met, 
and are met in locations which enable residents to remain active members of the 
community.  
 Ensure that growth in the Borough is aligned to improvements in the provision of healthcare 
services by:   
 
165 a. Working with NHS England, the Clinical Commissioning Group, the Basi ldon and 
Thurrock University Hospital and other providers of healthcare services in the Borough to 
ensure those organisations have the bui lt facilities they need to deliver their service 
plans;  
b. Requiring developers to contribute towards the provision of bu ilt facilities, and other 
improvements to healthcare services alongside their proposals for residential 
development . Where specified in policies H5 to H 22, contributions may be required in -
kind upon the development sites. In all other cases, financial cont ributions towards off -
site provision will be secured.  
 Ensure new development is designed and located to promote good health, and avoid sources of 
harm to health by:  
a. Requiring all developments of 50 homes or more, 1,000m2 of floorspace or more, or fall 
within the A5 use class, set out in p olicy R16, to be accompanied by a Health Impact 
Assessment prepared in accordance with local guidance;  
b. Requiring good quality design in new developments, including design which incorporates 
active design principles; and  
c. Avoiding development in locations which may cause harm to human health by way of 
disturbance to the quality of life, or pollution.  
 
Policy HC2: Strategic Approach to Leisure and Recreation  
Policy Context  
 Access to high quality open spaces and opportunities  for sport  and recreation  can make  an important  
contribution  to the health  and well-being  of communities. The NPPF makes it clear that planning 
policies need to plan positively for the provision of open space, sports and recreation facilities, 
based on robust and up -to-date assessments of the needs and opportunities for new  provision.  
 The NPPF  guards  against  the unnecessary  loss of existing  open  space,  sports  and recreational 
buildings  and land,  including  playing  fields.  This is to ensure  that sports  and recreational  provision 
are able to meet  the changing  needs  of the community,  and are well integrated  with the community in 
which they are  located.  
 Sport England is the organisation which provides the strategic lead for sport in the country. The 
organisation fulfils the function as a statutory consultee for all relevant planning applications 
affecting playing fields, and also provides design guidance for the development of sports facilities. 
Working within the provisions of the NPPF , Sport England encourages local planning policy to 
protect, enhance and provide for sports facilities based on robust and up -to-date assessments of 
need, as well as helping  to realise the wider benefits that participation in sport can  bring.  
 At the Essex level, the Essex Sports Facilities Strategy 2007 –2020 identifies  a number  of 
significant  issues,  challenges  and opportunities  which  provide the framework for the strategic 
planning process for sports facility provision across the County. Its approach to future community 
sports facility provision focuses on areas that have low participation across all age groups including 
Basildon Borough, which is also  one of the areas  that is expected to see a growth in population. It 
identifies that there will be demand for increased access to both facilities and services as a  result.  
Evidence Base  
 The Council has regularly updated its evidence base with regard to open space provision, playing 
pitch provision and indoor sports facilities. Previous updates took place between 2010 and 2012, 
and have enabled the Council, alone and in conjunction with pa rtners, to plan for and deliver a 
number of improvements to open spaces, playing pitch provision and sports facilities in the 
Borough.  However, over the course of time circumstances change. For example, the demand for 
indoor gymnasium facilities has outstr ipped expectations due to the competitive success of local 
athletes and the legacy of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. Furthermore, the 
number of homes planned for in this Local Plan is greater than that anticipated in 2010 -2012. It has 
theref ore been necessary to commission a review of this evidence base, and it is likely to be the 
case that this need will arise again through the lifetime of the Local P lan.  
 
166 
 The most recent work to assess and plan for open spaces, playing pitches and indoor spo rts 
facilities has been undertaken at a South Essex level. This has enabled the consideration of cross -
boundary movements for sport and recreation to take place, recognising that some facilities, such 
as Basildon Sporting Village, have a wider than local d raw. It has also enabled the consideration of 
opportunities for joint working and shared facilities to occur. It is these strategies, and the 
standards that they contain, which will be applicable when developers are seeking to bring forward 
residential dev elopment proposals within the Borough which generate an additional need for open 
space, playing pitches and indoor sports facilities.  
 Whilst the Council has consistently planned for and delivered improvements to open space, playing 
pitch and indoor sports provision within the Borough, the  level of uptake  of sport  and physical  
activities  by local residents  has remained  particularly  low, with the Borough having  the lowest  adult  
physical  activity  rates  in Essex.  Data  collected  for the Joint  Strategic  Needs Assessment which looks 
at health outcomes identifies a significantly higher proportion of obese adults  when  compared  to the 
national  average,  and this correlates  to only 1 in 10 adults  participating in the recommended physical 
activity  levels.  
 The Bo rough's Community Strategy identifies that whilst everyone in the Borough has access to 
initiatives and services that will support them to improve their own health and well -being, there are 
nonetheless lifestyle related factors that adversely impact on hea lth outcomes. The Borough has  
particular  challenges  with respects  to the needs  of its current  population,  in part related  to the 
relatively high levels of deprivation in the south. Men from the least deprived areas can expect to 
live eight years longer than those in the most deprived areas. As such, there is a need  to target  and 
provide  services  differently  for those  groups  within  areas  of the Borough  where health inequality 
exists. The evidence provided by the Gardiners Lane South Playing Pitch Relocati on Feasibility 
Assessment , highlights the opportunity to create three new community sports hubs at Gardiners 
Lane South, East Basildon and West Basildon, and this will therefore form part of the strategy for 
targeting investment into this part of the Borou gh, along with other measures in the Open Space, 
Playing Pitches and Built Facilities Strategies.  
 In addition to formally identified open spaces, the wider network of Green Infrastructure in the 
Borough and beyond provides the opportunity for outdoor recre ation such as walking and cycling. 
PRoW and the cycle network therefore have an important role to play in ensuring the health and 
well-being of Borough residents. Furthermore, the provision of high quality local opportunities to 
walk and cycle will help to  stop local residents from travelling for such activity , protecting sensitive 
habitats on the Essex coast from disturbance, and also reducing the need to travel. Ensuring new 
developments are connected to the PRoW network and the delivery of the Basildon C ycling Action 
Plan are therefore also essential to the Council’s approach to leisure and recreation.  
 Whilst the Council has delivered a number of open space, playing pitch and indoor sport provision 
projects in recent years, it cannot deliver everything t hat is needed going forward, and there is a 
role for communities, sports clubs, governing bodies, private businesses and developers in bringing 
forward facilities that meet the needs of local people. In some instances, opportunities will arise to 
bring for ward land in the Green Belt for open space/playing pitch use. This will normally be 
consistent with the requirements of national Green Belt policy where the scale and proliferation of 
ancillary buildings do not harm the openness of the Green Belt, and cons equently it may be 
possible for the Council to support such proposals. It should however be noted that the Council will 
normally expect those bringing forward new facilities outside the Council’s own programme of 
works to manage and maintain them using the ir own resources. This is particularly applicable to 
those open spaces brought forward by developers to meet the needs of growth arising from their 
development.  
Policy HC2  
Strategic Approach to Leisure and Recreation  
 The Council will promote active and hea lthy lifestyles amongst all its residents by promoting, and 
where necessary delivering alone, or in partnership with others, improvements to leisure and 
recreation provision in the Borough. During this Local Plan period the Council will:  
a. Seek improvements to the quality, quantity and accessibility of open spaces in the 
Borough, with the aim of encouraging recreation in the local area, and preventing 
additional recreational disturbance to Natura 2000 sit es elsewhere is Essex by:   
 
167 i. Protecting existing public op en spaces, including Country Parks, from 
development unless a strategy is  in place to fully compensate such loss;  
ii. Bringing the landfill site at Pitsea, or parts thereof, into use as a public 
open space;  
iii. Securing new public open space, including Country Pa rk or nature reserve 
provision, alongside all new housing sites as identified in policies H 5 to 
H20. Where the specific location of open space provision is not identified 
on the Policies Map, this must be secured within the development in 
accordance with local standards for open space provision; and  
iv. Securing open space provision in accordance with local standards on all 
residential development sites not identified in policies H 5 to H20. 
b. Seek improvements to the quality, quantity and sustainability of playi ng pitch provision in 
the Borough through the implementation of the Playing Pitch Strategy . Where necessary 
playing pitch provision will be secured on strategic housing sites as identified in policies 
H5 to H20. All other residential developments will be e xpected to contribute towards off -
site provision in accordance with local standards for playing pitch provision.  
c. Seek improvements to the quality, quantity and sustainability of indoor sports facilities in 
the Borough through the implementation of the Built Facilities Strategy . Unless on -site 
provision is specified within a strategic housing site allocation policy (H 5 to H20), all 
residential developments will be expected to contribute towards off -site provision in 
accordance with local standards for indoor  sports provision.  
d. Seek improvements to the Public Rights of Way and cycle networks through the 
provision of routes to and through development sites, connecting to the existing 
networks.  
e. Support the provision of outdoor sports facilities in the Green Belt  where associated built 
development does not harm the openness of the Green Belt or the purposes on including 
land within it.  
 Where  appropriate,  the Council  will seek  to secure  the required provision  of public open spaces, 
Country Parks, playing pitches an d indoor sport facilities, PRoW  and cycle networks , and their 
ongoing maintenance through planning conditions and/or developer contributions.  
 
Policy HC3: Strategic Approach to Education, Skills and Learning  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  places  great  importance  on ensuring  that a sufficient  choice  of school  places  is available to 
meet the needs of existing and new communities. Local planning authorities are expected to take a 
proactive, positive and collaborative approach to promoting development  that will widen  choice  in 
education  by giving  great  weight  to the need  create,  expand or alter  schools.  
 At a local level meanwhile, the Council recognises the role good education opport unities at all 
levels, including at early years, has on ensuring that local people are able to fulfil their potential. 
This is considered particularly important given the levels of deprivation and the inequalities that 
exist in the Borough. The Council is therefore committed to improving education opportunities in 
the Borough in partnership with others as part of its Corporate Plan  and its priorities . 
Evidence Base  
 Evidence demonstrates that the Borough will need to improve existing educational f acilities t o 
create a more balanced distribution of occupied school places, in order to raise aspirations and 
diversify the skills of the workforce, as well as strengthening the economy to ensure local people 
can make the most of any new job opportunities that arise.  This will contribute towards the health 
and well -being of local residents by helping to reduce employment deprivation. Education facilities 
includes, but are not  limited  to nurseries,  pre-schools , Essex Child and Well -being Service , 
children's  centres,  schools,  colleges,  librarie s, youth  facilities and other community learning spaces. 
The Local P lan recognises that the level of population growth will result in the need to improve 
existing educational facilities throughout the Borough, including new provision where sites are at  
capacity.   
 
168 Schools  
 The Borough is currently generally well ser ved by school provision. However, Commissioning 
School  Places  in Essex  (2017-2022 ) shows  that many  of the primary  schools  in the Borough  are 
operating close to, or at, capacity. There is some capacity within the secondary school provision in 
the Basildon urban area  given an outflow of pupils from Basildon . As a result , the secondary 
schools in Billericay and Wickford are at capacity,  and some  pupils  also travel  outsi de of the Borough  
to schools  in Benfleet  and Thundersley in neighbouring Castle Point to the east. However, efforts 
have been made by the schools in Basildon, through partnership working, to raise educational 
attainment in the town and most of the secondar y schools are now on the path to achieving an 
OfSted Good rating. This will help to stem the outflow of pupils from Basildon, and any impacts it 
consequently has on traffic and congestion. This will potentially see some secondary school 
capacity withi n Billericay and Wickford freed up to accommodate local growth, but will see the 
capacity of the secondary schools in Basildon to accommodate growth reduced as existing pupils 
stay within the town for their secondary  education.  
 Much  of the responsibility  for planning  future  schools  provision  rests  with the Essex  County  Council, 
the Local Education Authority (LEA). Their annual report entitled Commissioning School Places in 
Essex forecasts change in pupil numbers based on a number of factors including committed  
development proposals (i.e. those development proposals with full planning consent). It does  not 
however  take a longer  term perspective  on the need  for school  places,  and consequentially  does 
not fully consider the implications of growth in the Borough th at stem from this plan's  proposals.  
 However, the Council has worked closely with the LEA to identify the potential need for school 
places in the future having regard to the scale of growth set out in this plan, and also the locations 
of growth. Overall, it  is anticipated that there is a need for at least one new secondary school and 
at least 5 new primary schools, along with extensions to some existing schools. Where appropriate, 
policies H 5 to H20 indicate the need for on -site provision of a school to accommodate growth 
arising from either that site alone, or the combination of sites in that location. The Council will work 
collaboratively with developers, LEA and other relevant bodies responsible f or faith schools, 
foundation schools , academies and grammar school annexes to deliver the schools required to 
support the growth arising from this plan.  
 Whilst this plan makes some provision for windfall growth, it does not make provision for unplanned 
growth arising from large scale speculative development proposals. This will ne ed to be considered 
and planned for on a site by site basis. Where sufficient provision cannot be secured this may 
affect the acceptability of development.  
 In relation to both pl anned and unplanned growth re gard should be had to Essex County Council’s 
Guide to Developer Contributions  in order to determine the level of contribution likely to be sought. 
Where new school provision is required , the land provided by the developer must also meet the 
criteria set out in the Guidance  including  the design and layout of school sites  and evidence in the 
form of a Land Compliance Report.  
Further and Higher Education  
 The availability  of A-level and higher  education  tuition  in the Borough  is limited,  and many  students 
travel outside the Borough to study. The Borough has one of the largest volumes of 16 -18 year olds 
within Essex, but one of the lowest number of destinations to access learning post -16. The range 
and offer of Further Education pr ovision is not always set into the context of the local employment 
offer and the needs of local  employers. However, South Essex College are due to move into 
Basildon Town Centre by 2020 as part of a wider programme of regeneration. This will improve the 
accessibility of further education in the Borough, and potentially reduce the need to travel 
elsewhere. In addition, PROCAT, which  offers further and higher education training in advanced 
technologies, is seeking to expand its provision at its site at the Pi pps Hill Industrial Estate. There 
are no universities within the Borough, however the University of Essex and Anglia Ruskin 
Universities have campuses in Southend and Chelmsford respectively, which can be reached from 
the Borough by private car and public transport . 
Adult Community Learning  
 Adult  learning  has a role to play in addressing  deprivation  issues  associated  with a low skills  base 
and inequalities  in educational  attainment.  It also has a role to play in reducing  social  isolation  by  
 
169 providing opportunities for the active older population to get involved in new activities and meet 
new people. The Joint Strategic Needs Assessment  shows that 8.8% of the adult population of the 
Borough  had no qualifications  as at 2013.  Those  with no qualifications are more at risk of not being 
in paid work, and of receiving lower rates of pay. Educational deprivation, as measured by the 
Indices of Multiple Deprivation, is particularly high in the Borough, reflecting the inequalities that  
exist.  
 Essex County  Council,  through  the Adult  Community  Learning  Scheme,  have  increased  the profile of 
Adult Community Learning in bot h supporting the economy, and in providing opportunities for 
people  to learn  new skills.  While  the demand  for adult  education  may grow  over time,  this will not 
necessarily be linked to demographic change. In general, Adult Community Learning can make use 
of existing facilities, and multi -use facilities such as community halls and community spaces in  
libraries.  
 Additionally, there  are three  day centres  for the over 50s in the Borough offering  a range  of day-time 
activities,  social  events, catering and welfare services for over 3,000 members. There are also 
similar services run by volunteers and community groups throughout the  Boroug h. 
Early Years and Childcare  
 Summer 2017 childcare sufficiency data suggests that there are 230 early years and childcare 
settings with the Borough at that time. These include sessional pre -schools, nurseries, primary 
school nurseries, independent schools,  out of school clubs and childminders. This does not include 
parent groups and community run activities within local community buildings.  
 In addition to early years and childcare provision, the Essex Child and Family Well -being service 
play an important ro le within the early years development and childcare service as they provide the 
opportunity for families to access services and support that assist in ensuring the well -being of 
children and young people.  
 The LEA has indicated that around  606 additional  spaces will be needed to support the level of 
growth identified in this plan. With demographic changes  and the Extended Funding Entitlement 
offer which was introduced in September 2017 there will be need for flexibility within the supply of 
different types o f early years and childcare services and facilities in order to respond to the different 
needs of families as their economic and working arrangements change. In providing new facilities, 
preference is given to the co -location of early years services alongs ide primary school provision as 
well as other essential services and infrastructure. It may prove necessary to locate new early 
years and childcare facilities close to major existing and new employment locations, where demand 
is identified.  
Youth Services  
 The Essex Youth Service provides young people in the Borough with the opportunity to extend their  
skills  and abilities  beyond  traditional  education  through  community  engagement  and activity, and 
through participation in extra curricula  activities.  
 The Borough has four Youth Councils: Basildon New Town, Billericay, Wickford and Northlands 
Park and a representative  on the UK Youth  Parliament.  Furthermore,  there  are a range  of community 
projects  such  as outreach  football  and basketball  projects  that are aimed  at 'hard  to reach'  groups of 
young people in an attempt to alleviate social  exclusion.  
 There are also educational facilities, including activities and residential opportunities at Wat Tyler 
Country Park, Pitsea and Barleylands Farm, Billericay wh ich have in -house educational teams  to 
support their visitors and are linked to the delivery of the National  Curriculum.  
 While there is no immediate requirement for additional facilities to run these services, there is  a 
need for the regular and continuing  use of existing facilities within the  community.  
Libraries  
 The Library Service for the Borough is provided by Essex County Council, which provides seven 
libraries located in Basildon, Billericay, Wickford, Fryerns, Laindon, Pit sea and Vange. These 
provide  opportunities for the whole community to access self -learning tools including books,  
 
170 computers and other types of media. The Library Service also provide cultural space and have 
display spaces ava ilable for arts and  exhibitions.  
 There are no proposals in the immediate future for new libraries in the Borough, rather county -wide 
initiatives, such as Essex Book Festivals are promoted to encourage people to use existing  
facilities.  
Policy HC3  
Strategic Approach to Education, Skills and Learning   
 The Council  will work  with Essex  County  Council and  other  education and skills development 
providers to provide new, continued, and where appropriate, enhanced provision  of schools  and 
other  educational  facilities  which  seek  to improve  the quality  and choice  of educat ion and learning 
opportunities in the  Borough.  
 In particular, the Council will support in principle, proposals  which:  
a. Provide new or expanded early years and childcare, primary and secondary schools as 
required to accommodate residential growth;  
b. Enable local people to better access employment opportunities within the  Borough;  
c. Provide  parental  choice,  having  regard  to both the local area,  and other  areas  from which  
pupils or students may  come;  
d. Provide opportunities for community activity and engagement to  reduce social  isolation, 
particularly amongst older people;  and 
e. Encourage additional or existing joint use of education land, buildings or facilities by 
other community groups or activities. Such uses shall not compromise the educational 
interests  of the  pupils . 
 In order to ensure sufficient school place provision to align with growth, new schools will be secured 
on strategic housing sites as identified in policies H 5 to H20. All other residential developments will 
be expected to contribute towards off -site provision in accordance with Essex -wide standards for 
education and early years contributions.  
 Where it is not possible to address a deficit in education provision throug h the on -site provision of a 
sustainable school and/or early years setting, or through developer contributions towards a feasible 
scheme for the expansion of an existing school and/or early years setting, planning consent may be 
refused . 
 
ALLOCATION POLICI ES 
Policy HC4: Community Facilities  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF emphasises the links between the provision of community facilities in appropriate 
locations with health, well -being and inclusive communities. Community facilities include  local 
shops, meeting pla ces, sports venues, cultural buildings, public houses and places of worship. 
Planning policies should ensure an integrated approach to considering the location of community 
facilities and  services  alongside housing and economic uses . 
Evidence Base  
 Communit y facilities are facilities generally available to, and used by, the local community for the 
purposes of leisure, social interaction, health and well -being or learning. For the  purposes  of this 
policy,  a community  facility  is defined  as a building  or space  where  community led activities for 
community benefit are the primary use and the facility is managed, occupied or used primarily by 
the public, voluntary and community sectors. This will include, but is not confined to, community  
and cultural  centres;  premises  for sport,  leisure  and recreation;  non-residential  health and  social  
care facilities;  crèches,  playgroups,  libraries,  schools  and other  training  and educational facilities; and 
places of  worship.   
 
171 
 The importance of existing leisure, education and health facilities are set out previously. In addition 
to this there are a more limited number of public performing art venues, galleries and museums 
within the Borough  and also a number of public and privately owned community buildings . 
 The Council has a p ortfolio of forty -four community buildings, as shown in the Council's Asset 
Management Plan (2014) , ranging from traditional halls for hire, small centres used by 
community/social clubs to larger facilities that offer multiple recreational opportunities in cluding 
small scale sports activities. Many of these facilities were inherited from the Basildon Development 
Corporation/Commission for New Towns in 1994 and most were built during the 1960's and 1970's 
when most neighbourhoods in Basildon New Town were bu ilt. 
 An independent quality review undertaken in 2012 discovered that just over a third of these 
community buildings were either of a 'poor' or 'bad' condition suggesting that a number of these 
facilities are coming to the end of their design life unless t hey can be refurbished. The Council 
regularly  reviews  its community  buildings  portfolio  with a view to increasing  their use, investing  in 
their condition  and standardising  their operation  and leases  with community  groups,  but there  are 
occasions where the future of a facility's continued provision needs to be considered, in light of 
other provision nearby and maximising limited  resources.  
 The Council  seeks  to protect  and improve  the provision  of viable  community  facilities  that play an 
important  role in the social  infrastructure  of the Borough  in order  to ensure  that community  facilities 
can continue to cater for the needs and demands of the Borough's communities. Decisions will 
need  to be taken  during  the plan period  as to whether  existing  community  facilit ies are appropriate or 
could be more effective if provided elsewhere in an alternative  way. 
Policy HC4  
Community Facilities  
 The locations of existing community facilities within the Borough are identified on the Policies Map 
with the notation HC4, and a schedule of these community facilities is included in Appendix  5. 
 Community facilities will be retained for their uses, and opportunities to enhance them will be 
encouraged where they contribute positively to the well -being and social cohesion of local 
communities, having regard to all other relevant policies set out in this  plan.  
 
Policy HC5: Public Open Spaces  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  is clear  that access  to high quality  open  spaces  and opportunities  for sport  and recreation 
can make an important contribution to the health and well -being of communities. There is an 
expectancy that once identified, open spaces, allotments, playing fields and other recreational land 
will be preserved from  development.  
Evidence Base  
 Open  space  in the Borough  can be defined as publicly accessible land consisting of Urban Parks 
and Gardens; Natural and Semi -Natural Green Space; Outdoor Sports Fa cilities; Amenity Green 
Space; Provision of Places for Children and Young People; Education Fields; Allotments, 
Community Gardens and City Farms; Churchyards and Cemeteries; and Urban Civic Spaces. 
Public open space does not include private open space and land which has no public right of 
access such as domestic gardens, grounds around buildings, car parks, agricultural land and 
forestry  plantations.  
 Local open spaces provide most of the Borough's 1,300ha of green spaces. They therefore offer 
great value as  places for people to participate in organised sport, play, informal recreational activity 
and appreciation of the natural environment, and the need to retain open space for these uses will 
continue to be important as the Borough's population  grows.  
 The Co uncil’s most recent Open Space Assessment (2010) and Playing Pitch Strategy Review and  
 
172 Technical Addendum (2011)  considered the quantity, quality and accessibility of open spaces, and 
playing pitches, in the Borough and advised on the approach that should be taken to each site. In 
particular it highlighted where open spaces should be retained for leisure and recreat ion purposes. 
They also set standards for the quantity, quantity and accessibility of open space and playing pitch 
provision.  
 As set out in respect of policy HC2, the level of growth now proposed in the Local P lan is greater 
than that considered in 2010, and consequently both the Open Space Assessment  and Playing 
Pitch Assessment  are subject to review at a South Essex level. However, the projected growth in 
population is such that open spaces will become more important resources for the future rather 
than less, and therefore the ongoing protection of those open spaces identified in 2010 remains 
justified. It will however be necessary to consider the most up to date local Open Space 
Strategy/Playing Pitch Strategy  when considering the appropriateness of prop osals for the 
redevelopment of public open spaces, as these will contain the most up to date local standards.  
Policy HC5  
Public Open Spaces  
 Public  Open  Space  designations  within  the Borough  are defined  on the Policies  Map with the notation 
HC5, and a sched ule of these Open Spaces is listed within Appendix  5. 
 There  is a presumption  against  development  within  designated  Public  Open  Spaces.  Land  identified 
as public open space on the Policies Map will be retained for open space uses, and opportunities to  
impro ve them  will be encouraged  or sought  having  regard  to other  relevant  policies  set out in this 
plan.  
 The reconfiguration of land identified as Public Open Space identified on the Policies Map will  only 
be supported  where:  
a. The reconfiguration is part of a comprehensive, deliverable  scheme;  
b. The open space is replaced with an equivalent or better facility either on -site as part of 
the new development, or off -site in a suitable location;  
c. The development would not result in a net loss of open space  overall;  
d. The reconfiguration would achieve enhancements to address identified deficiencies in 
the capacity, range, quality and accessibility of the open space, informal recreation 
provision and maintenance;  and 
e. The reconfiguration would not be detrimental to any other  active travel, environmental  or 
cultural function performed by the existing open  space.  
 
Policy HC6: Local Green Spaces  
Policy Con text 
 The NPPF  introduces the ability for local communities to protect green spaces of local significance 
by designating them Local Green Spaces in Local  Plans  and Neighbourhood Plans. This 
designation would prevent new development being permitted on these spaces unless  very special 
circumstances exist.  
 Local Green Spaces should only be designated when a plan is prepared or reviewed, and be 
capable of enduring beyond the end of the plan period. When identifying land as a Local Green 
Space a consistent approach to local p lanning for sustainable development should be adopted and 
it should complement investment in sufficient homes, jobs and other essential services.  
 Criteria on what areas should be considered suitable for the Local Green Space designation are 
set out within the NPPF  and relate to the proximity of the green space to the community it serves, 
its particular local significance and whether it is local in character.   
 The NPPF  states that local policy managing development within Local Green Spaces should be 
consiste nt with policy for Green Belts. The local policies in this plan place strict controls over 
development within the Green Belt and only allow inappropriate development where  very special  
 
173 circumstances can be demonstrated. The NPPF  defines very special circum stances in the context 
of Green Belts as being when the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, 
and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations.  
Evidence Base  
 Local people and some Local Councils expressed , during  public consultations , the desire to have 
some of the Borough’s green spaces designated as Local Green Spaces in accordance with the 
NPPF . The Council subsequently received and assessed 87 nominations for possible Local Green 
Space designation.  
 All the sit es put forward were tested against the NPPF  criteria, having regard to the advice in the 
PPG . As a consequence of this assessment 39 sites were considered to meet the criteria for Local 
Green Space designation and are listed as Local Green Spaces in Append ix 6 of this plan.  
 It should be noted that green spaces protected by law, including areas of Common Land, Village 
Greens, Town Greens, allotment gardens, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and Local Nature 
Reserves were excluded from inclusion on the li st of Local Green Spaces due to the level of 
protection already afforded to them.  
Policy HC6  
Local Green Spaces  
Local Green Space designations within the Borough are defined on the Policies Map with the notation HC6, and 
a schedule of these Local Green Spa ces is listed within Appendix 6. Consistent with the NPPF, there is a 
presumption against development on, or the redevelopment of a Local Green Space, unless the development 
would enhance the use of the Local Green Space for outdoor sport or recreation purposes, or would otherwise 
improve the quality of the Local Green Space through enhancements to its visual amenity or biodiversity.  
 
Policy HC7: Allotment Gardens  
Policy Context  
 The Government recognises that allotme nts are valuable green spaces and community assets 
providing  people  with the opportunity  to grow  their own produce  as part of the long-term promotion of 
environmental sustainability, health and well -being, community cohesi on and social inclusion. 
According  to Section  23 of the Small  Holdings  and Allotments  Act 1908,  local planning  authorities 
including parish and town councils, have a duty to provide all otments where they perceive a 
demand for them in their  area.  
Evidence Base  
 Allotments  are a very specific  form of open  space,  being  plots  of land that are rented  by individuals for  
growing  fruit and vegetables.  They  have  direct  and indirect  benefits  including  providing  a healthy 
physical and mental activity, personal satisfaction from growing produce, the fos tering of social 
relationships and providing an alternative place to relax. Although allotments are used by less than  
0.5%  of the Borough's  population,  they remain  an important  specialist  feature  of the Borough's green 
infrastructure  network.  
 There  are seven  allotment  sites across  the Borough  with a total of 513 plots.  The Council  manages 
three of these sites and the other four are run by allotment associations under a devolved 
management arrangement. Spatially, they are concentrated to the south and nor th-east of the 
Borough, with no provision in Billericay despite there being indicators of need. The Council will 
continue  to lend its expertise  to town  and parish  councils  to assist  in their efforts  to secure  allotment 
provision  for their residents,  as well as using  the strategic  housing  allocations  in H5 to H20 to secure  
additional provision for the growing  population.  
 
 
  
 
174 Policy HC7  
Allotment Gardens  
 The locations  of existing  allotment  gardens  are identified  on the Policies  Map with the notation  HC7, 
and a schedule  of these  allotment  gardens  is included  in Appendix  5. 
 These  areas  are to be retained for use as allotment gardens, and opportunities to improve these 
spaces and create more plots through the delivery of the housing set out in policies H 5 to H20 will 
be pursued having regard to other relevant policies set out in this  plan.  
 
Policy HC8: Playing Fields Associated with Education Facilities  
Policy Context  
 The policy  framework  generally  protect s and seeks  to enhance  educational  playing  fields,  however, 
the Government has also introduced programmes aimed at renewing school sites, upgrading 
facilities and encouraging schools to branch out their role to the community. The dual use of 
facilities outside of school hours is encouraged, including schoo ls’ sports facilities with support from 
Sport  England.  
 The Advice on Standards for School Premises (2015) confirms that all maintained schools and 
academies must provide suitable outdoor space to enabl e physical education in accordance  with 
the school curriculum and to enable pupils to play outside. Whilst this is a separate consent 
framework to requirements under the planning system, there is a very strong policy presumption 
against the disposal of school playing field land whilst the educational prima ry use  remains.  
 Any proposal  which  involves  the loss of school  playing  field land must  take account  of the provisions of  
Section  77 of the School  Standards  and Framework  Act 1998  which  requires  the agreement  of the 
Secretary of State before planning permission is sought for development or change of use. It is a 
requirement that any proceeds from the disposal of the school playing field must be used towards 
specific projects to improve or enhance sports or educational facilities in the  area.  
Evidence B ase 
 Playing fields provide the valuable space required to maintain and enhance opportunities for 
people to take part both in formal team sports, and in other more informal activities. Sport England 
defines a ‘playing field’ as the whole of a site which enc ompasses at least one playing pitch. A 
‘playing pitch’ is defined as a delineated area which, together with any run off area, is of 0.2 
hectares or more, and which is used for association football, American football, rugby, cricket, 
hockey, lacrosse, round ers, baseball, softball, Australian football, Gaelic football, shinty, hurling, 
polo or cycle polo.  
 School  based  playing  field provision  exists  primarily  to meet  educational needs,  however,  it also has 
the potential  to be used  by the wider  community  where  there  is a policy or  practice  promoting  such  
dual use, outside  educational  hours.  The re-use of educational  premises can help to meet modern 
expectations of the quality of provision and residents' needs for such facilities, particularly in areas 
where access is otherwise limited as identified within the Playing Pitch Strategy Review and 
Technical Addendum . Such playing fields can also help to improve access to opportunities in rural 
areas otherwise remote from venues in the larger  settlements.  
Policy HC8  
Playing Fields Associated with Education Facilities  
 Playing fields associated with education establishments ar e identified on the Policies Map with the 
notation HC8, and listed within Appendix 5. These will be  protected  from development,  unless for 
education and sports provision, and opportunities  to improve  them  will be pursued  having regard to 
other relevant policies set out in this  plan.  
 Where possible , the Council will work with education establishments to encourage the shared use of 
playing pitches, indoor sports facilities and ot her appropriate community spaces outside school  
 
175 hours . 
 Where  an educational  facility is relocated  or removed,  the playing  field(s)  associated  with such  facility 
should  be retained  as open  space  where  possible.  Any development  proposed  for the resultant  space 
will be subject to policy  HC12.  
 
Policy HC9: Private Open Spaces  - Conditional Access  
Policy Context  
 The po licy agenda and context for delivering quality open space is shifting, as is the way local 
authorities manage public services. More importance is being placed on the better integration of 
strategies  and programmes,  partnership  working  and effective  community  involvement  relating  to 
the provision and accessibility of open space and recreational facilities, whether the land is in 
public, private or educational  use. 
 Sport England’s policy relates to all land in use as p laying fields, last used as such, or allocated as  
playing  field land in a Development  Plan and is applied  to all varieties  of site ownership  including local 
authority, education and private sports  grounds.  
Evidence Base  
 There are a range of private and voluntary club facilities within the Borough which offer a  greater or  
lesser  degree  of community  use for their activities.  Sports  clubs  and other  private  facilities  make an 
important contribution to open space provision in the Borough.  The venues, activities,  opportunities  
and sports  development  work  offered  by various  sports  clubs  are identified within the Playing Pitch 
Strategy Review (2011) . Private sports clubs are extremely important in the  provision  of playing  
pitches  for football,  rugby,  cricket  and bowls  greens  offering  opportunities for community sport and  
recreation.  
 A number of private clubs at Gardiners Lane South currently provide sports based recreational 
facilities for their members. Policies E5 and H 5 anticipate the redevelopment of parts of this land, 
given its  location  within  the A127  Enterprise  Corridor,  adjacent  to existing  employment  areas.  It is 
however expected that the current sports facilities are relocated within the Borough, as a 
prerequisite of development of this site, and a Playing Pitch Relocation Feasibility Assessment  has 
been undertaken to identify how this will be achieved in accordan ce with the requirements of Sport 
England. Any relocation must be carried out in accordance with that assessment, or a replacement 
document of a similar standard, and must allow for adequate access, the use of the facilities for 
junior development programm es and potentially for increased community use, where this is 
applicable and  desirable.  
 Land  within  the Green  Belt, predominantly  at Barleylands  Farm  which  is in private  ownership,  also 
offers important sporting facilities within the Borough. There are in the region of thirty adult and 
junior pitches at Barleylands Farm, currently used by 10 -12 football clubs. Notwithstanding the 
existing  provision  provided  at this location,  there  are a lack of essential  supporting  facilities  provided 
including toilets, cha nging rooms and parking. Nonetheless, land in this area continues to play a 
significant role in access to sports for people of all ages, and this plan therefore supports the 
development of essential  facilities.  
Policy HC9  
Private Open Spaces - Conditional Access  
 The locations of private open spaces with conditional access for primary users are identified on  the 
Policies Map with the notation HC9, and listed within Appendix  4. 
 These  will be retained  for their primary  sport  or recreation  uses,  as well as occasional  use to support 
agricultural diversification  activities.  
 The development of essential facilities including changing rooms, toilets and car parking will be 
supported having regard to other relevant policies set out in this  plan.   
 
176 
 The principle  of pitch  relocation  will apply  to any proposal  for development  on allocated  private  open 
spaces, where such proposals would involve the loss of private pitches, in order to maintain the 
security of local playing pitch provision in the  Borough.  Private open spaces including ancillary 
facilities, should be replaced with an equivalent or better facility, in a suitable location.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy HC10: New and Enhanced Community Facilities  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF expects local planning  authorities  to plan positively  to deliver  community  facilities,  sports 
venues, cultural buildings and other local services to enhance the sustainability of communities and  
residential  environments.  Planning  policies  and decisions  should  ensure  facilities  and services are 
able to  develop and  modernise in a sustainable way and be retain ed for  the benefit of the 
community.  
Evidence Base  
 There are long term infrastructure issues which need to be addressed such as the need for 
increased provision of certain types o f facility to accommodate population growth in the Borough as  
set out in this plan.  This growth  will require  the provision  of additional  community  facilities  and 
services in order to ensure communities can meet their day to day needs. As such, new 
developm ent proposals  should  exploit  the potential  for enhancement  and extension  of community 
facilities to serve future residents and other  users.  
 As well as providing  additional  facilities,  proposals  for enhanced  uses  of existing  facilities  can help to 
secure their future. Existing community facilities are often in poor condition and in need of 
investment in order to meet current day needs. Ageing premises affect maintenance costs and limit 
the quality and accessibility of services provided. In the interests of  sustainability and cost 
efficiency, it may be appropriate to re -use unoccupied existing buildings or increase out -of-hours 
usage  of buildings  that are only used  during  certain  times.  However,  there  is the risk of alternative 
uses of facilities in poor con ditions resulting in the loss of legitimate capacity, undermining the 
proper functioning of the facility, or generating demand for additional, replacement  development.  
 There  are also instances  where  small  scale  ancillary  facilities  can often  enable  users  of the space, 
such as sports clubs, to continue to use and enjoy it. While such proposals can often add to the 
value  of the asset,  insensitive  design  and siting  of ancillary  facilities  can detract  from the character of 
the site; be detrimental to the envir onmental functions performed by the site; can conflict with other 
uses of the space and neighbouring occupiers; and may limit potential future uses of the facility.  
 Accessibility  is also fundamental  when  considering  new and enhanced  facilities.  As such,  community 
facilities  should  be capable  of being  used  by everyone  within  the community  regardless  of disability, or 
the ability of an individual to drive or own a car. Community buildings should be designed to allow 
for disabled access and should be located in order to provide the opportunity for as many people 
as possible to access the facility by foot and/or by public transport. The co -location of facilities is 
supported due to the cumulative benefits this will offer to those without private means of  transp ort. 
Policy HC10  
New and Enhanced Community Facilities  
 New and enhanced community facilities such as community and cultural centres; premises for sport, 
leisure  and recreation; public open space and managed informal recreation including Country Parks;  
non-residential  health  and social  care facilities;  crèches,  playgroups,  libraries, schools and other 
training and educational facilities; and places of worship will be supported  where it can be 
demonstrated  that: 
a. The facility and activities are of appropriate  scale, design and intensity, and would have  
no unacceptable impacts on the character, appearance or amenity of the surrounding 
area;   
 
177 b. The facility is well connected to, and associated with existing facilities and readily  
accessible to adequate public trans port, cycling and walking links for the benefit of non -
car users;  
c. Vehicle  access  and on-site vehicle  parking  would  be provided  to an appropriate  standard;  
and 
d. There is adequate access to and between the facilities for disabled people.  
 New community facilities will be located at a site that relates well to the defined settlements within 
the Borough unless it can be demonstrated that there is a clear community need for such a  facility 
and: 
a. There are no suitable premises within or adjacent the defined  settlements;  
b. The proposal is predominantly for outdoor sport or recreation activities (including 
recreational buildings provided in association with, and ancillary or complementary to 
those activities)  and is consistent with the requirements of policy HC1;  or 
c. There are overriding community, amenity and environmental benefits deriving from an 
out of town  location.  
 Where possible, the council will work with community facility providers to encourage the shared use 
of facilities to increase out of hours usage.  
 
Policy HC11: Loss of Community Facilities and Policy HC12: Loss of Open 
Space  
Policy Context  
 
 The NPPF  states  that existing  open  space,  sports  and recreational  buildings  and land, including 
playing fields, should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken which  has clearly  
shown  the open  space,  buildings  or land to be surplus  to requirements;  the loss of the open space is 
to be offset elsewhere (with gre ater quality or quantity); or the development is for alternative sport 
and recreation  provision.  
Evidence Base  
 An important element of sustainable development and creating sustainable comm unities is the 
provision and protection of community uses such as leisure, health, education, places of  worship 
and community  halls at locations  that are readily  accessible.  The existing  sport,  leisure,  public  and 
private open spaces including allotments within the Borough, represent important assets serving 
the communities in which they are located or in some instances wider areas. Providing these 
faciliti es at a local level,  in convenient  locations,  increases  their accessibility  for users  and reduces 
the need  to travel.  These  facilities  further  raise  quality  of life creating  community  cohesion,  reducing 
isolation,  reducing  fear of crime  and creating  opportunities  for information  sharing  and participation in 
community activity. In addition, and especially outside the urban areas, open spaces and 
community facilities can perform a vital function in terms of the economic and social welfare of such 
areas,  which help to ensure the continued vitality of rural  communities.  
 Basildon is generally well provided with open space, and benefits from a range of outdoor 
recreational facilities which provide locations for activities such as team sports, walking, cyclin g, 
nature  conservation,  horse -riding,  fishing  and golf. However,  the Borough's  Open  Space  Assessment 
highlights substantial open space deficiencies when recommended standards of provision are 
applied  to the existing  and projected  future  population  of the Borough,  particularly  in Billericay  and 
Wickford. There is also an uneven distribution of community centres around the Borough and some  
areas  are deficient  in the provision  of such  facility.  However,  an analysis  of usage  indicates that 
there may well be ov er provision of community centres  due to a lack of demand for services, 
particularly in the smaller community  centres.  
 The quantity  of provision  is only one part of the assessments.  The Council  has also assessed  the 
quality of provision and accessibility across the Borough. These highlighted some significant 
variation particularly in the quality of provision, affecting the carrying capacity and attractiveness of  
 
178 some facilities, and identified areas with deficient  accessibility. As well as protecting existing 
community  facilities  from inappropriate  development,  it is essential  that the quality  of such  facilities 
can be improved, and their accessibility enhanced so that residents and visitors can continue to 
enjoy t hem. In the longer term, the survival of local open spaces and community facilities rely on 
the use and value attributed to them by the community. It is therefore in the community’s  interest 
that the Council preserves, improves and upgrades the existing community facilities and provide 
additional facilities in areas where there are not  enough.  
 For these reasons, the Local  Plan resists the loss of existing social, community, leisure and cultural 
facilities in the Borough which is in, or has the potential o f being put to, beneficial and viable  use 
unless it can be demonstrated that that the new use would help improve deficiencies in the area or 
lead to qualitative improvements that would outweigh the loss of the previous  use. 
Policy HC 11 
Loss of Community Fa cilities  
 Proposals  resulting  in the loss of an existing  community  facility  as identified  on the Policies  Map with 
the notation HC 11 will only be permitted  where:  
a. The community facility is replaced with an equivalent or better facility, in terms of the 
quantity and quality of provision, either on -site as part of new development, or off -site in 
a suitable location;  
b. The use concerned is genuinely redundant, and all reasonable efforts have been made 
to preserve the facility but it has been demonstrated that  it would not be economically  
viable, feasible or practicable to retain the building or site for its existing use;  or 
c. The facility  or service  which  will be lost will be adequately  supplied  or met by an easily  
accessible existing or new facility in the locality or settlement concerned, unless it has 
been accepted as redundant under criterion ( b) above.  
 Where it is demonstrated that an existing community use is not viable, preference will be given to 
the change  of use or redevelopment  to alternative  commu nity uses  before  other  uses  are considered 
except  where:  
a. Evidence is provided to confirm that the premises or site has been marketed for a  
meaningful period;  and 
b. There is no realistic interest in its retention for the current use or for an alternative  
community use.  
 The involvement of the local community will be sought in identifying the importance of community 
facilities, including them (where appropriate) on the statutory list of assets of community value,  and 
in developing appropriate solutions for t heir retention and  enhancement.  
 The loss of community facilities that are identified to be of particular value to a local community will 
not be permitted, except in very special circumstances, for purposes other than those which would 
be appropriate  in the area and which  would  not substantially  affect  the character  of the land or detract 
from its amenity  value.  
Policy HC12  
Loss of Open  Space  
 Any development resulting in a loss of land identified as public or private open space, allotment 
garden,  or playing  fields  associated  with educational  facilities,  on the Policies  Map,  or any recreational 
buildings ancillary to and directly associated with the open space and essential to its recreational 
function, will only be permitted  where:  
a. The proposal would result i n an overall qualitative or quantitative improvement to 
recreational facilities, either within the open space or on an alternative accessible site in 
the locality; or 
b. The development is for alternative sports and recreational provision, the  needs for which  
clearly outweigh the loss; or  
c. There are cumulative community benefits identified, the need for which clearly outweighs  
the loss; or   
 
179 d. An assessment shows that the site is no longer required for, or is demonstrably 
unsuitable  for its original intended  purpos e; or 
e. There  is no viable  or reasonably  practicable  means  of restoring  or re-using  it for an 
alternative form of open space; and  
f. There  are no significant  detrimental  impacts  on amenity,  the character  of the surrounding  
area, ecology and any historical or archaeological  features.  
 Proposals  for limited,  minor  scale  ancillary  development  on land identified  as public  or private  open 
space,  allotment  garden,  or playing  fields  associated  with educational  facilities,  on the Policies  Map 
will be permitted where it  can be demonstrated  that: 
a. The development  will increase  opportunity  for public  recreation  use or improve  the 
recreational quality of the  space;  
b. It would not detract from the open character of the site or  surroundings;  
c. The overall use of the open space is retained for recreation  purposes;  
d. The development will not be detrimental to any other function that the open space  
performs; and  
e. The proposal would comply with all other relevant policies within this  plan.

 Protecting Green Belt Land  
STRATEGIC POLICY  
Policy GB1: Strategic Approach to Green Belt Protection  
Policy Context  
 Basildon  Borough  lies wholly  within  the London  Metropolitan  Green  Belt and more  than half of its 
total land area is designated  as Green  Belt. The Green  Belt plays  a key role in shaping  settlement 
and development patterns in the Borough and forms an important element of the Borough’s 
character. It is also a highly valued asset to local people, as well as having wider strategic 
significance across South  Essex.  
 The Bor ough's Green Belt contributes significantly to the Borough's green infrastructure and 
includes  agricultural  land,  woodland,  open  space,  country  parks,  designated  areas  for wildlife  and a  
large  area of the Thames  Estuary's  coastal  grazing  marshland.  Althoug h the majority  of the Borough's 
population  lives within  the urban  areas,  outside  the extent  of the Green  Belt, the Green  Belt is the 
location  of a number  of isolated  farms,  homesteads  and unserviced  settlements as identified in 
policy  SD2.  
 The existing Green Belt is land which has been identified in previous plans prepared by the Council 
and its predecessors. It is open land which, when it was defined, was intended to remain open on a 
permanent basis. In order to prevent inappropriate develo pment  within the Green Belt and to 
ensure its permanence:  
a. there is a strong presumption against planning permission being given for inappropriate 
development within the Green Belt: permission for such development should not be 
given except in very special circumstances  
b. once established, Green Belt boundaries should only be altered in exceptional 
circumstances, through the preparation or review of the Local Plan.  
 In the twentieth century and in the period before the Second World War there was generally no 
require ment for permission before erecting a new building. The result, particularly around London, 
was the proliferation of urban sprawl which also applied to South Essex. If the process had 
continued without restriction, it is possible that the whole of th e area would have been developed 
for housing and associated development.  
 After the enactment of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 , it became necessary to obtain 
planning permission before erecting a new building. In 1955, Gov ernment set out policy for  the 
establishment and maintenance of Green Belts ( Circular 42/55 ). 
 The Minister drew attention to the importance of checking the unrestricted sprawl of the built -up 
areas, and of safeguarding the surrounding countryside against further encroachment. He sa id that 
he was satisfied that the only really effective way of achieving these objectives was by the formal 
designation of clearly defined Green Belts around the areas concerned.  
 The purpose of including land in the Green Belt was:  
 to check the further gro wth of a large built -up area;  
 to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another; or  
 to preserve the special character of a town.  
 Planning permission was not to be given, except in very special circumstances, for the construction 
of new buildings or for the change of use of existing buildings for purposes other than agriculture, 
sport, cemeteries, institutions standing in extensive grounds, or for other purposes appropriate to a 
rural area. The Government said that these proposals, if strictly adhe red to, should prove most 
effective and the boundaries of Green Belts were to be defined in development plans.  
 Later, two new purposes for Green Belts were identified, so that the list of purposes now reads:   
 
181  to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built -up areas;  
 to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another;  
 to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;  
 to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and  
 to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban 
land.  
 The openness and permanence of Green Belts has therefore always been a key feature of Green 
Belt policy. The NPPF  states that the fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban 
sprawl by keeping  land pe rmanently  open.  
 The Government continues to attach great importance to Green Belts and t he NPPF  makes clear 
that the presumption in favour of sustainable development does not apply in respect of land 
designated as Green Belt   
 Whilst this plan has been prepared in accordance with the original NPPF , the Council 
acknowledges that the Neighbourhood Plans currently being prepared for the designated 
neighbourhood areas will not come forward in the transitional period and will therefo re be assessed 
against the newer version of the NPPF . The newer version , maintains the same level of protection 
for Green Belts but does allow for changes to Green Belt boundaries to be made through 
Neighbourhood Plans where strategic policies have identif ied a need for such a change. The Local 
Plan has justified a need to redefine Green Belt boundaries in response to the existence of 
exceptional circumstances and has set specific housing requirement figures for each of the 
neighbourhood a reas. Consequently , further changes to the Borough’s Green Belt boundar ies can 
and will occur through  Neighbourhood Plans . 
Evidence Base  
 In what is now the Borough of Basildon, the Green Belt were first designated in 1957 in the  County  
Development  Plan. The extent of the Gr een Belt was unaltered in the Approved  Review  
Development  Plan (1976)  and the Approved  Structure  Plan (1989).  The 1957, 1976 and 1989 plans 
were all prepared by Essex County Council. The detailed inner boundary of the Green Belt was 
defined in the Billericay Local Plan (1989)  prepared by Basildon Council. There were objections to 
both plans on the basis that the boundary of the Green Belt had be en drawn too narrowly. Those 
objections were considered by an Inspector at a local inquiry. Following his recommendations, the 
plans were adopted, as appropriately amended.  
 Since the plans were adopted there has been significant growth in population withi n the Borough. 
This has led to increased pressure for more development in order to provide enough homes and  
jobs for the population. The objectively assessed need (OAN) for housing and employment land 
(see policy SD1) is a quantification of that pressure. These circumstances emphasise the 
importance of the maintenance of the Green Belt – restricting  urban spraw l and providing open 
space for the urban population. It is not possible to accommodate all the OAN within the urban 
area. Accordingly it is not possible to maintain the existing extent of the Green Belt without an 
acceptance that some of the OAN will not b e met. Conversely, it is not possible to meet the OAN in 
full without development of land which is currently within the Green Belt.  The Council has therefore 
amended the previous Green Belt boundar y to allocate land for development around the Borough’s 
settlements  and created a new Green B elt boundary  within this plan .  
 As part of the preparation of the Local Plan, the Council commissioned a Landscape Character and  
Green  Belt Landscape  Capacity  Study (2014)  in order  to better understand the quality, sensitivity 
and context of the Borough's landscape within the Green Belt. The  Council  has also reviewed  the 
role of land within  the Borough's  Green  Belt through  a separate Green Belt Study Review (2017)  and 
sought once again to assess the whole of the Gree n Belt against the five Green Belt purposes.  The 
findings from these studies helped identify the areas that have been removed from the Green Belt 
but they also identified which areas and features play an important role in maintaining the 
openness and perma nence of the Borough’s Green Belt .  
 Both the Landscape Character and  Green  Belt Landscape  Capacity  Study  and the Green Belt Study 
Review  reported that the Borough's Green Belt plays a crucial  role in preventing  the merging  of 
settlements.  Historically,  development  within  the Borough has  been  well contained  within  the three  
main  settlements  (Basildon,  Billericay  and Wickford)  and there is a strong sense of separation  
 
182 between settlements. This is also the case in relation to separation from settlements in the area of 
adjoining authorities including those in Castle Point to the east.  
 The distances between settlements are generally small – for example, only 1km between Wickford 
and Basildon. It is very important accordingly that these key strategic gaps remai n in the Green 
Belt and development within them strongly resisted. The Green Belt between south Billericay and 
north Basildon  plays  a particularly  important  role in preventing  Billericay,  Little  Burstead,  Great  
Burstead, Noak  Hill and Basildon  from merging  into each other.  Similarly  the gaps  between  north -
east Basildon  and south -west Wickford, and between Pitsea, and Thundersley are very important in 
maintaining the separation of these settlements.  
 There are many parts of the Green Belt covered by wildlife,  historic, or public open space 
designations  which underscore the importance of keeping them permanently open. Although most 
of these  individually  are small  areas,  the Bowers  and Vange  marshes are an extensive area within the 
Green Belt to the south east of the Borough which are covered by national and local wildlife 
designations. There are other areas with a large number of designations which are valued for their 
scenic beauty, includin g the Langdon Hills and the wooded hillsides of east of Billericay. The 
Landscape Character and  Green  Belt Landscape  Capacity  Study  identified  qualities  across  the 
whole of the  Green  Belt which needed to be safeguarded including  rural and long distance  views; 
historic  field patterns; areas of mature woodland and meadows; PRoW ; river corridor; open and rural 
character; public open space; and land giving a sense of separation between  settlements. All these 
qualities of land within the Green Belt need to be protected.  
 Moreover there is opportunity to enhance the value of much of the Green Belt in the  Borough  by 
improving  accessibility  by the provision of  new or enhanced  routes  for pedestrians,  horse -riders and 
cyclists; increasing the biodiversity of the land scape and planting new hedgerows,  woodland and 
trees; and implementing measures to enhance the landscape setting of each of the main 
settlements.  
 The Landscape Character and  Green  Belt Landscape  Capacity  Study  and the Historic Environment 
Characterisation Assessment Project (2011)  also found that the Borough has a well -preserved 
historic landscape character, containing a rich  resource of historic features of high sensitivity. There 
are field patterns of Anglo -Saxon or Medieval origin which remain intact and  a number of historic 
churches and other listed buildings dispersed throughout  the open  components  of the landscape.  
There  are two Conservation  Areas within the Green Belt, namely Little Burstead and Great 
Burstead, each recognised  in the Conservation  Area  Character  Appraisals  (2011)  for their historical  
and architectural interest.  
 Finally, the Green Belt in its entirety plays an important role in encouraging regeneration within 
existing urban areas The  Council  wishes to encourage development within the urb an area, using 
where possible  redundant  greenfield  sites and previously  developed  land.  
Policy GB1  
Strategic Approach to Green Belt Protection  
 The Council will continue to protect the permanence and openness of land designated as Green 
Belt. Development within the Green Belt will only be permitted in very special circumstances , if it is 
not inappropriate development , or if it is in accordance with an adopted Neighbourhood Plan . 
 Development that is not inappropriate in the Green Belt is defined within the NPPF . Development 
that is not inappropriate as defined in the NPPF  will be subject to consideration against policies GB3 
to GB11 of this Local P lan to ensure that harm to the Green Belt is minimised.  
 Policy SD 4 does not apply to land within the Green Belt.  
 Opportunities that enhance the environmental quality and beneficial use of the Green Belt will be 
supported by the Council, in particular the provision of formal and informal green infrastructure to 
supp ort the quality of life of the urban  population (provided that it is appropriate development as 
defined in the NPPF ). 
 
  
 
183 ALLOCATION  POLICY  
Policy GB2: Green Belt Extent  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states  that local planning  authorities  with Green  Belts  in their area should establish 
Green Belt boundaries in their Local Plans which set the framework for Green Belt and settlement 
policy. Once established, Green Belt boundaries should only be altered in exceptional 
circumstances, through the preparation or review of the Local Plan. At that time, authorities shou ld 
consider the Green Belt boundaries having regard to their intended permanence in the long term, 
so that they should be capable of enduring beyond the plan period.  
 When drawing up or reviewing Green Belt boundaries , the NPPF  expects  local planning author ities 
to take account of the need to promote sustainable patterns of development. They should consider 
the consequences for sustainable development of channelling development towards  urban  areas  
inside  the Green  Belt boundary,  towards  towns  and villages  inset  within the Green Belt or towards 
locations beyond the outer Green Belt  boundary.  The NPPF  also sets out criteria that local planning 
authorities should meet when defining boundaries . 
 As set out above, the NPPF  makes clear that the presumption in favo ur of sustainable 
development does not apply in respect of land designated as Green Belt.  
Evidence Base  
 The extent of the existing Green Belt and, in particular its inner boundary, was determined in the 
Billericay Local Plan (1989)  following careful examin ation of all the relevant matters. It was 
considered that the Green Belt as defined fulfilled the purposes of the Green Belt as contained in 
Government policy. In accordance with the appropriate guidance, it was intended that the defined 
boundary  should be  permanent. With some exceptions, inappropriate development within the 
Green Belt has not been permitted.  
 Although all the land within the Green Belt was considered to fulfil the purposes of the Green Belt, 
it was not necessarily the case that each piece o f land contributed to each of the purposes of the 
Green Belt or that each piece, although by definition important, was of equal importance.  
 In the preparation of this Local Plan, the Green Belt Study Review  looked  at how the Borough's  
Green  Belt performed  against  the five purposes and  contributed  to the openness  of the Green  Belt. It 
identified  a number  of areas  within  the Green Belt which fulfilled all or most of the purposes of the 
Green Belt and which it was clearly important sh ould be kept open on a per manent basis. These 
areas included the area containing Norsey Woods and Mill Meadows SSSIs to the east of 
Billericay, the area surrounding  Noak  Hill and to the north -west of Little  Burstead,  the nature  reserves  
between  Langdon Hills  and Lee Chapel  North,  and the area between  Bowers  Gifford  and Thundersley  
(in neighbouring Castle Point Borough). There were however other areas within the Green Belt 
which it considered did not contribute as fully to the purposes of the Green Belt. This does not 
mean that they  may not form important parts of the Green Belt. Nonetheless if there is to be any 
modification of the boundary of the Green Belt to accommodate future development needs, it is 
these areas that need to be considered as potentially providing scope for chang e.   
 The Council considers that it is important that the Local Plan identifies land which can be 
developed in order to meet [a substantial part of] the OAN for land for housing and employ ment. It 
is not realistically possible both to meet the OAN and to maintain Green Belt boundaries as they 
are. The precise effects of not providing additional land for new homes and for jobs are not easy to 
predict, but it is likely that the quality of life of those living in the Borough and surrounding areas will 
suffer.  It is considered that the extent of this need was not foreseeable when the boundaries of the 
Green Belt were originally fixed. In these circumstances and in the light of the pressing need, it is 
considered that, on balance, exceptional  circumstances do ex ist to justify some modification of the 
boundary of the Green Belt.  
 Accordingly , and in the light of the Green Belt Study Review , the Local Plan proposes that there 
should be some modification of the boundary of the Green Belt. The Local Plan retains 6,551ha of 
land as Green Belt which it considers should continue to be protected for Green Belt purposes .  
 
184 Exceptionally it proposes that 399ha be removed from the Green Belt. The extent of the Green Belt 
as set out in this Local Plan is 59% of the land area of  the Borough, a reduction of 4%. It should be 
noted that in the event that a Neighbourhood Area revises its Green Belt boundaries through a 
Neighbourhood Plan, these figures will be adjusted. This will be reported through the Authority 
Monitoring Report.

DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy GB3: New Development in the Green Belt  
Policy Context  
 Within the Green Belt, there is a genera l presumption against inappropri ate development except 
where very special circumstances exist. In all other instances, proposals that would result in 
inappropriate development within the Green Belt will not be permitted in order to ensure that its 
open and rural character is not eroded. Very special circumstances are defined in the NPPF  as 
being when the potential harm to the Green Belt by way of inappropriate development, or any other 
harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations. Local planning authorities  must  give 
substantial  weight  to any harm  to the Green  Belt when  considering  planning applications.  
 There are instances when development within the Green Belt would be considered appropriate 
providing that the development preserves the permanent openness of the Green Belt and  does not 
conflict with the purposes of including land in Green Belt. Such exceptions are listed within the 
NPPF and relate to sports and recreation provision, cemeteries, agriculture, forestry, engineering 
operations, mineral extraction, local transport infrastructure, limited residential infilling and the 
modifications to, or replacement of, existing  buildings.  
Policy GB3  
New Development in the Green Belt  
Where very special circumstances have been demonstrated, and development is exceptionall y permitted within 
the Green Belt, the Council will seek to remove permitted development rights for any further works to, and 
within the curtilage of, the proposed development where it is likely that further development would cause h arm 
to the openness of the Green Be lt. 
 
Policy GB4: Green Belt Residential Infill Development  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states that the construction of new buildings in the Green Belt is inappropriate but 
identifies, as exceptions, several circumstances where new buildings will not be  considered as  
inappropriate development within the Green Belt. In particular, is the limited infilling or the partial or 
complete redevelopment of previously developed sites (brownfield land), whether redundant or in 
continuing use (excluding temporary bu ildings), which would not have a greater impact on the 
openness of the Green Belt and the purpose of including land within it than the existing 
development.  
 The identification of development of this kind not being considered as inappropriate was a change 
in policy, introduced by way of the NPPF . The effect of this is that some development is now 
considered not inappropriate which would have been considered as inappropriate at the time that 
the Basildon District Local Plan  was adopted in 19 98.  
 
185 Evidence Base  
 As a consequence of the change to national Green Belt policy permitting limited infilling, it has 
been necessary to review the Borough's Green Belt to determine the extent to which such infilling 
could take place and whether specific development managemen t policies are needed to limit its 
impact. A review of the Green Belt and the potential for infill development was therefore undertaken 
as part of the Green Belt Infill Topic Paper (2017)  to consider the potential for infilling to occur, 
which could in com bination, give rise to adverse impacts on the openness of the Green Belt. It also 
sought to identify whether any criteria should be applied to identify sites which may be 
appropriately infilled and limit harm to the Green Belt. The Green Belt Infill Topic Paper  identified 
that there is potential for localised Green Belt infill within the Borough, much of which would be 
possible in existing areas of established Plotland. It considered  that if infill was to be realised, and 
still accord with the NPPF,  it woul d need to be subject to a strict development management policy 
to ensure that the land could remain in the Green Belt.   
 Whilst the Green Belt already contains residential development, character i s not uniform, but tends 
to be more semi -rural in nature, co mpared to that of the main towns and serviced settlements. 
Consequently, it is necessary to ensure that any new infill development within the Green Belt  is 
designed  and located  in such  a way as to limit harm  on the Green Belt’s openness and purposes, as 
well as any prevailing local character. Having  regard  to the mix of current  development within the 
Green Belt, it is considered that where infill development is otherwise acceptable in principle, it will 
normally only be acceptable if the new structures are of a smaller scale. Infill dwellings therefore 
designed as either bungalow s, chalets or other low -height structures are expected to typify the 
predominant form new infill development should take. Given the semi -rural locations of existing 
residential areas in the Green Belt, residential plots  themselves  are normally  larger  than what  you 
would see in the Borough’s main towns and villages. The size of the plots means that dwellings can 
often be set back  from the boundaries  of the site and this helps provide  a sense  of openness,  
which is important  given the Green Belt location. Replicating such form with new infill development 
should therefore help ensure that th e scale, setting and character of any new buildings continues to 
be managed  appropriately to its Green Belt setting.  
 Some infill sites, which could meet the NPPF definition a re however larger in area and it may be 
argued that they could be subdivided. Doi ng so however, whilst also ensuring the openness and 
purposes of the Green Belt can be maintained is likely to be difficult. The  sub-division of infill sites 
would normally on ly be acceptable at a density that resp ects the existing pattern of development 
and providing the resulting subdivided plots meet all the criteria within the policy . 
 Infill development will also be expected to be well landscaped to minimise impact on the o penness 
of the Green Belt through appropriate greening and  screening. Infill development that would result 
in the removal of significant tree cover, regardless of whether Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are 
in place will not be supported. It will also need  to demonstrate compliance with other relevant 
policies in this plan which could otherwise affect the principle of development including the site’s 
flood risk status, drainage role or nature conservation value.  
 A review of the Green Belt’s infill potential , through the Green Belt Infill Topic Paper , has identified 
that existing Green Belt residential locations, predominantly in the Borough’s remaining Plotland 
settlements, have the potential to provide approximately 145 new individual building plots in the 
future, when applying the policy criteria. However t his estimate includes opportunities for infill 
development in the Hovefields and Honiley  Neighbourhood Area within the Fairmead Plotland area 
which is accessed directly from the A127. This access is not c onsidered safe or sustainable and , 
as a result , infill development will not be permitted in the Hovefields and Honiley Neighbourhood 
Area  under this policy.  As such, this  policy has the potential to deliver approximately 135 new 
dwellings  only.  
 Any potent ial infill site must  have appropriate  and safe  access to the public road network, or benefit 
from an internal  road network that connects to it.  In order  to be appropriate  for development,  infill 
plots  should  face onto the public road, or internal road network to ensure appropriate access, but 
should not face onto, and should be screened from any part of the Primary Route Network (PRM) 
in order to ensure that the site maintains its Green Belt  setting.  
 In striking the balance for Green Belt infill, it wi ll be necessary to remove any permitted 
development rights from new development permitted under this policy, which will ensure the scale 
of infill development within the Green Belt can continue to be managed without an adverse effect  
 
186 on the openness or pur poses of including land in the Green Belt.  
 
Policy GB4  
Green Belt Residential Infill Development  
 Limited residential infilling within the Green Belt will exceptionally be permitted where it does not 
have a greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt a nd the purpose of including land within it 
than the existing development.  This policy applies to all areas within the Green Belt with the 
exception of the designated Hovefields and Honiley Neighbourhood Area.  In order to be 
exceptionally permitted such infill development must meet all of the following criteria:  
a. The proposed development plot must be located between existing dwellings on an 
existing road frontage, or on a corner plot. The development however sh ould not front 
and directly access onto the Borough’s primary route network;  
b. The plot size must have a frontage which is of a similar average width as surrou nding 
residential development; The dwelling(s) must be low -rise in height, such as bungalows 
and ch alets, which harmonise with the building heights predominant in the area;  
c. The dwelling(s) must be set within the site, and must have circulation space around it 
comparable to adjoining properties;  
d. The dwelling(s) must be constructed on a similar building l ine (formed by the front main 
walls of existing dwellings) and be of a similar scale, form and proportion to those 
adjacent;  
e. The dwelling(s) must reflect the materials, design features and architectural style 
predominant in the area;  
f. The development of the  site must not involve the removal of significant existing tree 
coverage;  
g. The development must incorporate appropriate boundary treatments and soft 
landscaping; and  
h. Subdivision of plots may occur where the resulting plots would meet criteria a -g of this 
policy. 
 Where development proposals are permitted as infill development within the Green Belt, the Council 
will seek to remove the permitted development rights to, or within the curtil age of the new 
development in order to ensure that extensions, alterations  and ancillary buildings would not result 
in the development causing harm to the character or the openness of the Green Belt.  
 
Policy GB5: Extensions and Alterations to Buildings in the Green Belt and 
Policy GB6: Replacement Buildings in the Green Belt  
Policy Context  
 Whilst the NPPF  requires local planning authorities to regard the construction  of new buildings as 
inappropriate in the Green Belt, it does allow for certain exceptions including the following:  
 extensions and alterations of buildings in the Green Belt providing they do not result in a 
disproportionate addition over and above the size of the original building which is defined 
in the Glossary at Annex 2 of the NPPF as the building as it existed on 1 July 1948 or, if 
constructed after that date,  as it was built originally;  
 the replacement of an existing building in the Green Belt providing it is within the same 
use and not materially larger than the building it replaces; and  
 the partial or complete redevelopment of previously developed land, whet her redundant 
or in continuing use (excluding temporary buildings), subject to meeting certain  criteria.  
 The NPPF  defines previously developed land in Annex 2 as land which is or was occupied by a 
permanent structure, including the curtilage of the develo ped land (although it should not be 
assumed that the whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface 
infrastructure. There are a number of exclusions to this, one of which being land that was 
previously -developed,  but where  the remains  of the permanent  structure  or fixed  surface  structure 
have  blended  into the landscape  in the process  of time.  This is a particularly  relevant  consideration  
 
187 when  determining  applications  for replacement  buildings.  If the land has returned  to a natural state 
and now contributes to the character and openness of the Green Belt and cannot meet the criteria 
within GB4, it may not be appropriate to replace the building with  another.  
Evidence Base  
 There  are over 2,000  dwellings  within  the Green  Belt in the Borough  and it is reasonable  for those 
living within them to be able to extend or replace their homes to cater for changing family needs or  
to provide  essential  basic  amenities  where  these  are not available,  or are inadequate.  It is also 
recognised that i n order to support the rural economy local businesses should be given the 
opportunity  to expand  and be flexible  to adapt.  However,  it is essential  that such  changes  preserve 
the openness and rural character of the Green Belt. The Council has therefore set out policies that 
allow the replacement or extension of any building, subject to certain  provisions.  
 It is important to note that some existing buildings in the Green Belt are entitled to the same 
permitted  development  rights  as buildings  elsewhere  (provid ed permitted  development  rights  have 
not been removed), and therefore the local planning authority cannot control all extensions  or 
alterations  to buildings  in the Green  Belt. However,  where  permitted  development  rights  have  been 
removed  or the extension  does not meet  the requirements  to be classed  as permitted  development 
the proposal will require planning  permission.  
 When assessing proposals to extend or replace a building in the Green Belt the Council will give 
consideration  to the removal  of permitted  development  rights  if further  additions  to the building  or 
the site of the proposed development are likely to result in harm to the openness of the Green Belt.  
 Since  1982  the Council  has used  maximum  thresholds  to limit the scale  and size of extensions and  
replacements of dwellings within the Green Belt. The Basildon District Local Plan  policies allowed 
dwellings to be enlarged on replacement or extended by 35m2 or to 90m2 over and above the 
original dwelling whichever was the greater, as well as other stipulating  criteria.  
 In line with the NPPF , the Council will consider proposals  for extensions and replacements to 
buildings within the Green Belt where they do not result in disproportionate additions over and 
above the size of the original building, tak ing into account floorspace, mass and volume increase . 
The original  building  will be determined  based on its size as existing on 1 July 1948, or as first built 
if later than this date. The size of proposed extensions will be considered in combination with other 
extensions, alterations or outbuildings permitted after the original building was built and not viewed 
in isolation.  
 Proposals will also be assessed on the impact they will have on the character, appearance and 
openness of the Green Belt. The amount of enlargement is  not dependent on the size of the  plot or 
the general size of buildings in the area, but rather the size of the original building. While the size of 
the e xtension may be acceptable, the proposal will not necessarily be approved if the extension is 
poorly designed or overly intrusive in the Green  Belt. 
 The Council will only consider proposals for replacement buildings or extensions to an existing 
building if the existing building is lawful. The replacement of temporary or ancillary build ings that 
were not built as permanent residential accommodation will not be permitted for residential use. 
Such  instances  could  result  in the establishment  of new dwellings  in the Green  Belt which  in other 
circumstances would be deemed  inappropriate.  
 Development proposed on previously developed land should not have a greater impact on the 
openness  of the Green  Belt compared  to the existing  development.  For example,  an existing  area of 
hard standing can be regarded as ‘development’, but its impact on op enness is significantly less  
than if the proposal  was for a building  or structure.  Proposals  for redevelopment  should  make 
improvements to the openness of the Green Belt where possible, which could include focusing 
development in a less conspicuous or open  part of the site, or by removing a sprawl of buildings in 
favour  of a single,  cohesive  development  that leaves  the remainder  of the site open.  If an alternative 
location  within  the site would  reduce  the visual  impact  of the building  on the openness  of the Green 
Belt, a condition will be required to ensure the demolition of the existing building is carried  out. 
 Replacement  buildings  may be proposed  on sites which  have  been  vacant  for some  time.  However, 
where previous development has blended into the landscape, or been taken over by vegetation  
 
188 and wildlife, proposals for development will not be classed as replacement buildings or 
redevelopment on previously developed land, but will instead be considered a s a new building  in 
accordance with policy  GB3 or GB4.  
Policy GB5  
Extensions and Alterations to Buildings in the Green Belt  
 Extensions and alterations10 to a building will not be permitted where they result in disproportionate 
additions over and above the s ize of the original building, either individually or cumulatively, in line 
with the NPPF , unless it can be demonstrated that very special circumstances exist that require 
additional provision. Support will be given to proposals that meet the following crit eria: 
a. The existing building is lawful and permanent in nature;  
b. The total floorspace of the prop osal11, together with any previous extensions, alterations 
and outbuildings would not result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of 
the original  building, taking into account floorspace, mass and volume and excluding any 
alterations or extensions made under permitted development that do not alter size or 
shape of the building;  
c. The proposal does not harm the openness of the Green Belt;  
d. There will be no detrimental impact on the area’s character and appearance;  
e. There is sufficient space around the building, between neighbouring buildings and 
between boundaries;  
f. The design, siting and materials are sympathetic to the existing building and the 
charact er of its surroundings; and  
g. The scale, size, form, massing and height of the extension is proportionate to that of the 
existing building and its plot.  
 The Council  will seek to remove  relevant  permitted  development  rights  where it is likely that further 
development would cause harm to the character or the openness of the Green Belt.  
Policy GB6  
Replacement Buildings in the Gr een Belt  
 The replacement  of a building  in the same  use, including  those  delivered  through  the redevelopment 
of previously  developed  land,  will be permitted  provided  it is not materially  larger  than the building  it 
replaces  and it would  not have  a greater  impact  on the openness  of the Green  Belt than the existing 
development. Support will be given to proposals that meet the following  criteria:  
a. The existing building is lawful and permanent in  nature;  
b. The proposed building does not materially harm the openness of the Green Belt through 
excessive scale, height, bulk or visual  intrusion;  
c. The total floorspace12 of the replacement  building  would not result  in a disproportionate 
increase  above  the floorspace  of the original  building,  excluding  any alterations  or 
extensions  made under permitted development that do not alter size or shape of the  
building, unless it can be demonstrated that very special circumstances exist that require 
additional provision;  
d. The design,  siting  and materials  is sympathetic  to the existing  building  and the character  
of its surroundings, unless its resiting and design would be less obtrusive to the Green  
Belt; 
                                                      
 
10 Extensions to a building include porches, conservatories, attached garages and rooms in the roof. Rooms in a roof 
includes an alteration or extension to the roof and is defined as a room that has been purposely converted to and is 
used as living accommodation, which is accessed by stairs and is, or is capable of having, approval under the Building 
Regulations. Extensions and alterations does not include basements where the basement would not exceed the 
footprint of the original dwel ling, it is located entirely underground, not visible externally and is not artificially raised 
above natural ground level.  
11 Floorspace calculations are based on external dimensions  
12 Floorspace calculations are based on external dimensions and, where it relates to a dwelling, includes attached 
garages,  conservatories, porches and rooms in the roof. The roof space is defined as a room that has been purposely 
converted to and  is used as  living accommodation, which is accessed by stairs and is, or is capable of having, approval 
under the Building  Regulations   
 
189 e. There i s sufficient space around the building, between neighbouring buildings and  
between boundaries;  
f. It will not result  in an intensification  of the existing  use of the site or the creation  of an 
urbanised form of development;  and 
g. The site on which the building to be replaced sits has not returned to nature and 
developed greenfield  characteristics.  
 The Council  will seek to remove  relevant  permitted  development  rights  where it is likely that further 
development would cause harm to the openness of the Green Belt.  
 
Policy GB7: Change of Use of Buildings and Land in the Green Belt  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF allows  for the partial  or complete  redevelopment  of previously  developed land within the 
Green Belt, whether redundant or in continuing use (excluding temporary buildings), subject to 
meeting certain criteria . 
 The Glossary at Annex 2 defines previously developed land as land which is or was occupied by a 
permanent str ucture, i ncluding the curtilage of the developed land (although it should not be 
assumed that the whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface 
infrastructure. The following  exceptions to this would be applicable for Green Be lt locations : 
 Land that is or has been occupied by agricultural or forestry buildings;  
 Land that has been developed for minerals extraction or waste disposal by landfill 
purposes where provision for restoration has been made through development control 
procedures; and  
 Land that was previously -developed but where the remains of the permanent structure or 
fixed surface structure have blended into the landscape in the process of time.  
 The NPPF  identifies certain types of development that would also be considered appro priate within  
the Green  Belt including  the re-use of buildings  provided  that the buildings  are of permanent and 
substantial construction and that they preserve the openness of the Green Belt and do not conflict 
with the purposes of including land in Green  Belt. 
Evidence Base  
 The Council  recognises  that in some  circumstances  the conversion  or change  of use of buildings or 
land in the Green Belt may not be considered as inappropriate. The re -use or adaptation of 
buildings in particular  can help reduce demands for new buildings in the Green Belt and can be the 
means of conserving traditional buildings in the countryside. The conversion of buildings that 
require substantial rebuilding, in order to make them suitable for re -use, will not b e permitted.  
 Change of use will be accepted where the proposed use has no greater impact than the present 
use on the openness  of the Green  Belt. Consideration  will be given  to the nature  of the proposed 
use, the suitability of the building or land, its appearance in the landscape and whether it would 
have an unacceptable impact on the environment in terms of traffic generation, noise and other 
disturbances.  The building  should  be appropriate  for the proposed  use in order  to avoid  substantial 
redevelopmen t in the  future.  
Policy GB7  
Change of Use of Buildings and Land in the Green Belt  
 The Council will only support applications for the change of use of buildings and land in the Green 
Belt where:  
a. The proposed  use will not have  a materially  greater  impact  than the current  use on the 
openness of the Green Belt or conflict with the purposes for including the land within  it; 
b. The existing building is of a permanent and sustainable construction and is  lawful;  
c. The building  or land is suitable  for the proposed  use without  the need  for extensive   
 
190 alterations and extensions that would change its existing form and  character;  
d. There  will be no detrimental  impact  on the area’s  character  and it is not visually  intrusive  
within the wider  landscape;  
e. It will not result  in an intensification  of the site compared  to its existing  use through  the 
massing of buildings or the open storage of materials, machinery or vehicles;  and 
f. It will not result  in unacceptable  generation  of traffic,  or excessive  noise  or air pollution,  or 
other f orms of  disturbances.  
 The Council will seek to remove relevant permitted development rights where it is likely that further 
development or changes to land use would cause harm to the character or the openness of the 
Green Belt.  
 
Policy GB8: Ancillary Buildings and Structures in the Green Belt  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  does not make specific reference to ancillary buildings with regards to development 
within the Green Belt. However, it does  list the types and uses of development  that are 
exceptionally  permitted  within  the Green  Belt which  may require  the provision of associated ancillary 
buildings to support  them.  
Evidence Base  
 The Council  acknowledges  that, in certain  circumstances,  new development  in the form of ancillary 
buildings  are not inappropriate  within  the Green  Belt providing  they preserve  the openness  of the 
Green Belt and do not conflict with the purposes of including land in Green  Belt. 
 There  are a variety  of activities  and uses  established  within  the Borough's  Green  Belt which  either 
have,  or may need,  associated  buildings  or structures  which  are essential  to support  their operation. 
Ancillary  buildings  can include  changing  facilities  for outdoor  sports,  stables  for equestrian  activities, 
and buildings to store equipment or goods for existing commercial businesses and agricultural 
practices. There may also be instances where a shed, greenhouse or detached garage for a 
residential property could be considered appropriate development within the Green  Belt. 
 As with other types of works to building s, the provision of ancillary buildings such as those 
mentioned previously for dwellings may be permitted under permitted development rights  (where 
they have not previously been removed) and the Council has no control over their development. 
However, where  permitted development rights have been removed, or ancillary buildings do not 
meet the requirements for constituting permitted development, the proposed development will 
require planning  permission.  
 When  assessing  proposals  for ancillary  buildings  in the Green  Belt the Council  will give consideration to 
the removal  of permitted  development  rights  if further  additions  to the building  or the site of the 
proposed development are likely to result in harm to the openness of the Green  Belt. 
 Buildings which are ancillary to a main building must be subservient and proportionate in terms of 
its size, scale and massing to that of the main building in the same way that extensions are 
considered acceptable. Proposals for ancillary buildings on site s which  have  no previous  buildings  
or structures  will be determined  against  the criteria  in the policy and should be limited to a size, 
scale and height which is appropriate and necessary for its  use. 
 Ancillary buildings will not be permitted where they co ntribute to the urbanisation of  development 
within the site and beyond. Whilst the proposal may be for a single building consideration should be  
given  to the cumulative  impact  it and neighbouring  buildings  may have  on the open  nature  and 
character of the area. There are examples across the Borough where multiple buildings and 
structures have been constructed on a single site or along a road frontage leading to a massing 
effect and intensification. This is both harmful to the openness of the Green Belt and contrary to the 
purpose of the Green Belt which is to safeguard the countryside from encroachment. It is important 
that local policy is in place to ensure that this does not continue to happen in the  future.   
 
191 
 Proposals would need to demonstrate that the bui lding’s function is ancillary and appropriate  in 
scale, form and function to the use. In order to preserve the openness of the Green Belt and 
prevent the proliferation of buildings in the Green Belt every effort should be made to re -use or 
adapt existing b uildings on the site before applications are made for new development. Where 
applicable, proposals will be expected to justify why this is not  practical.  
Policy GB8  
Ancillary Buildings and Structures in the Green Belt  
 The Council  will only support  the provision of new ancillary  buildings  in the Green  Belt where the  
proposals are consistent with the advice in the NPPF  and can demonstrate that the following criteria 
will be  met: 
a. The building's function is ancillary and its design is appropriate to the use of the building;  
b. The proposed  development  does  not materially  harm  the openness  of the Green  Belt or 
conflict with the purposes for including land within it through excessive scale, height, bulk 
or visual intrusion;  
c. It is sited in an appropriate location that  would not be prominent in the landscape and  
would not result in the spread of urbanising  development;  
d. The design, siting and materials are sympathetic and proportionate to the main building 
or use of the site and the character of its surroundings;  and 
e. If there are existing buildings on  site: 
i. It would not be practical to re -use or adapt any existing buildings on the 
site; and 
ii. The total floorspace of the ancillary building, together with any previous 
extensions, alterations  to the original  building  and any outbuildings  would  
not result  in a disproportionate  increase  above  the floorspace  of the 
original  building,  excluding  any alterations  or extensions made under 
permitted development that do not alter size or shape of the building 
unless it can be demonstrat ed that very special circumstances exist that 
require additional provision.  
 The Council  will seek to remove  relevant  permitted  development  rights  when  determining  a proposal  
where it is likely that further development would cause harm to the openness of th e Green Belt.  
 Proposals  which  do not meet  criteria  1(a) will be classed  as new development  and determined  against 
policy  GB3 or GB4.  
 Extensions  or alterations  to existing  ancillary  buildings  will be determined  against  policy GB5 and 
replacement ancillary buildings will be determined against policy GB6.  
 
Policy GB9: Extensions to Residential and other Curtilages, and Boundary 
Treatments in the Green Belt  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states  that the fundamental  aim of Green  Belt policy  is to prevent  urban sprawl  by keeping  
land permanently  open.  It identifies  one of the purposes  for including land  within  the Green  Belt as 
being  to assist  in safeguarding  the countryside  from encroachment.  
 In terms of good design, the NPPF  makes clear that planning policies and decisions should aim to 
ensure that  development  establish a strong sense of place , respond s to local character and history , 
create s safe and accessible environments  and is visually attractive as a result of good arch itecture 
and appropriate landscaping . 
 The NPPF  enables local planning authorities to refuse  permission for development of poor design 
where it fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area 
and the way it functions. This is particularly relevant when considering proposals for development 
within the Green  Belt.  
 
192 Evidence Base  
 The Borough's Green Belt performs an important role in maintaining the separation between 
settlements  and preventing  urban  sprawl.  Whilst the Green  Belt is not devoid  of development  it is 
important that further encroachment into open countryside is resisted in order to maintain these 
strategic gaps between  settlements.  
 Applications to extend individual curtilage in the Green Belt may not seem significant when 
considered  in isolation  but in combination  will result  in the piecemeal  erosion  of open  countryside. 
The Council will therefore place strict controls over changes to curtilage boundaries and only 
consider  them  appropriate  where  there  would  be no impact  on the openness  of the Green  Belt or 
conflict with the purposes for including land within  it. 
 The use of boundary treatments not only ensures that spaces in different ownership are clearly 
defined, they also provide physical security and  privacy for the user of the space. As mentioned 
previously there are various land uses within the Borough's Green Belt including residential 
properties, commercial businesses and public spaces which use different types of enclosures.  It is 
important that they do not detract from the openness of the Green Belt and that they respect the 
character and special qualities of the  landscape.  
Policy GB9  
Extensions to Residential and other Curtilages, and Boundary Treatments in the Green Belt  
 The Counc il will safeguard the countryside from encroachment, therefore proposals which include 
the extension of the curtilage of a residential property or business premises within the Green Belt 
which  involves  an incursion  into the countryside  will not be supported  unless  it can be demonstrated 
that it would  maintain  the openness  of the Green  Belt and not conflict  with the purposes  for including 
land within  it. 
 Proposals  relating  to any enclosure  or boundary  treatment  within  the Green  Belt will only be supported 
where:  
a. It would not detract from the openness of the Green Belt or conflict with the purposes for 
including land within  it; 
b. The design, materials, positioning and height are appropriate for the proposal's intended 
purpose;  
c. It is not visually intrusive within the wid er landscape;  and 
d. The design and materials are of a high quality and sympathetic to the character of the  
area.  
 The Council will seek to remove relevant permitted development rights where it is likely that further 
development would cause harm to the charact er or the openness of the Green Belt.  
 
Policy GB10: Agricultural Worker Dwellings in the Green Belt  
Policy Context  
 Whilst local planning authorities are expected to regard the construction o f new buildings as 
inappropriate in the Green Belt, the NPPF  allows exceptions to this which includes buildings for 
agriculture and forestry. The NPPF  also recognises that there are special circumstances for 
dwellings to be sited within the countryside and one example given is the essential need for a rural 
worker to live permanently at or near their place of work in the countryside.  
Evidence Base  
 The majority of the Green Belt in the Borough is used for agricultural activities. The Council 
recognises a need to support rural activities and accepts that on occasions new dwellings in the 
countryside may be required to support such activities. The Council will consider a proposal if  an 
essential need for a new dwelling can be demonstrated in connection with existing agricultural, 
forestry  or other  appropriate  rural base d enterprise.  It is the need  of the enterprise  to function,  not  
 
193 the personal preferences or circumstance s of any of the individuals concerned, which is relevant to 
determining whether or not a new dwelling is  justified.  
 The availability of alternative accommodation in the vicinity or nearby settlements will also be a 
factor in determining applications, this includes the consideration of permitting residential infilling 
within the Green Belt in line with policy GB4. If the functional need could be fulfil led by another 
existing dwelling on -site or any other existing accommodation in the area which is suitable and 
available for occupation by the workers concerned permission for a new dwelling will not be given. 
The history of the holding may also be an impo rtant consideration. For example, planning 
permission will not normally be granted where residential buildings have been disposed of  recently.  
 The siting  of any new dwelling  should  be well related  to the existing  farm buildings  or other  dwellings, 
provided  other  normal  planning  requirements,  for example  on siting  and access,  are also satisfied. 
Dwellings which are unusually large in relation to the agricultural needs of the site, or unusually 
expensive to construct in relation to the income it can sustain in the long term, will not normally be 
permitted. Similarly, a new dwelling cannot be justified on agricultural grounds unless the farming 
enterprise itself is economically viable. A financial test would be able to demonstrate the viability of 
an enterpris e or the likely viability of a proposed enterprise as well as show that the proposed 
dwelling can be sustained by the  enterprise.  
 To avoid a proliferation of dwellings in the open countryside, the Council will attach agricultural 
occupancy  conditions  to ensure that any dwelling  is kept available  for meeting  its original  purpose. 
This will apply to any dwellings granted planning permission on the basis of agricultural need, 
together  with any existing  dwellings  on a farm holding.  It is important  that dwellings  for the use of 
agricultural  workers  are retained  as they may be required  to meet  the immediate  and future  needs of 
the associated farming enterprise and the needs of other farms in the locality. Applications for the  
removal  of agricultural  occupa ncy conditions  will therefore  be the subject  of careful  consideration in 
order  to assess  whether  a long term need  for an agricultural  worker’s  dwelling  exists.  The onus will 
be on the applicant to prove that such a need no longer  exists.  
 It is also important  to ensure  that the erection  of agricultural  buildings  under  permitted  development 
rights does not lead to an unacceptable proliferation of such buildings in the Green Belt, to the 
extent  that the openness  of the Green  Belt, or a particular  area within  the Green  Belt, is threatened. 
Where the openness of the Green Belt is threatened by a cluster of agricultural buildings within an  
area the Council  will remove  the permitted  development  rights  in respect  of agricultural buildings 
within that  area.  
Policy G B10 
Agricultural  worker dwellings in the Green Belt  
 Planning permission will not normally be granted for new dwellings in the Green Belt unless it meets 
any of the exceptions set out in the NPPF . However a dwelling  associated  with an agricultural,  
forestry  or rural based  enterprise  may be permitted  provided the Council is satisfied that 
accommodation for one or more workers to live at, or in the immediate vicinity of, their place of work 
is essential for the proper functioning of the  enterprise.  
 The applicant would need to demonstrate  that: 
a. There is a clearly established functional  need;  
b. The functional  need  relates  to a full time worker  or one primarily  employed  in agriculture,  
forestry or rural based enterprise  activities;  
c. There  is not another  dwell ing on the site or any other  existing  accommodation  in the area 
which is suitable and available to fulfil the  need;  
d. The dwelling and the enterprise are both economically  viable;  
e. The siting  of the proposed  dwelling  is well related  to the existing  buildings  and does  not 
impact on the openness of the Green Belt;  and 
f. The design and materials are of a high quality and sympathetic to nearby buildings and  
the character of the  area.  
 New dwellings granted planning permission on the basis of a recognised need will be  subject to 
conditions restricting occupancy. Occupancy conditions may also be applied to existing dwellings 
associated with the functioning of the enterprise to ensure they are kept available for meeting  their  
 
194 original purpose. Applications to remove such  conditions will not be permitted unless the applicant 
can demonstrate that there is no longer any realistic agricultural or forestry need both from the 
enterprise and the locality for the restriction to be  maintained.  
 In circumstances  where  the proliferation  of farm buildings  constructed  under  permitted  development 
rights is having a seriously detrimental effect on the openness of the Green Belt within a particular 
area,  the Council  will attach  a condition  withdrawing  permitted  development  rights  for new agricultural 
buildings within that  area.  
Policy GB11: Positive Uses of Land in the Green Belt  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states  that local planning  authorities  should  plan positively  to enhance the  beneficial  use 
of the Green  Belt. Once  Green  Belts  have  been  defined,  the use of land in them has a positive role 
to play in fulfilling the following  objectives:  
 to provide opportunities for access to open countryside for the urban population;  
 to provide opportunities for outdoor sport and outdoor recreati on near urban areas;  
 to retain attractive landscapes and enhance landscapes, near to where people live;  
 to improve damaged and derelict land around towns;  
 to secure nature conservation interest; and  
 to retain land in agricultural, forestry and related us es. 
Evidence Base  
 The Landscape Character and Green Belt Landscape Capacity Study Volume Two (2014)  which 
supports the Green Belt Study Review  assessed the landscape sensitivity of the Borough's Green 
Belt and identified special qualities to be safeguarded  through policy.  
 The study also identified opportunities to improve the environmental quality of the Green Belt as 
well as support proactive land management and benefit local communities through enhancements 
to recreation, accessibility and sports provision. Access to the majority of the Borough's Green Belt 
can be improved by extending or enhancing existing PRoW  and connecting the edge of 
settlements with outdoor recreation, open space and woodlands. There is also potential to create a 
green corridor with public footpaths along sections of the River Crouch which would contribute to 
the Borough's green infrastructure network.  
 Opportunities for wildlife enhancements were identified in areas of the Green Belt where nature 
conservation already exists, as well as between the set tlements of Basildon and Billericay, to the 
west of Billericay and to the south west of Basildon. Due to Billericay's historic context there were 
also opportunities to improve the character of the landscape within the Green Belt by re -
establishing hedgerow s to strengthen historic field boundaries.  
 The study also highlighted that there was scope to improve existing, and create new, outdoor 
sports and recreation provision at various locations across the Borough. These were primarily in 
areas of Green Belt clo se to the main settlements where they would serve the urban population. 
Potential extensions to the One Tree Hill Country Park, Queen’s Park Country Park, Wick Country 
Park and the River Crouch riparian open spaces were identified along with the creation o r 
enhancement of public open spaces and sports playing fields to the northwest and south of 
Basildon, the south and east of Billericay, and to the northeast and west of Wickford. These were 
recognised as suitable areas where the openness and character of t he landscape can successfully 
be maintained.  
Policy GB11  
Positive Uses of Land in the Green Belt  
A proposal that seeks to positively enhance the beneficial use of the Green Belt will be supported by the 
Council where it is compliant with all other relevant  policies of this plan and where it fulfils the following criteria:  
a. It does  not harm  the openness  of the Green  Belt or conflict  with the purposes  for including   
 
195 land within it;  
b. It is sited in an appropriate location which is not visually  intrusive;  
c. The design  and materials  are of a high quality  and sympathetic  to the surrounding  built 
form and the character of the  area;  
d. It will not result in unacceptable generation of traffic, noise, or other forms of 
disturbances;  and 
e. Provides opportunities for one or more of the  following:  
i. Improved  access;  
ii. Improvements to nature  conservation;  
iii. Improvements to the historic characteristics of the  landscape;  
iv. Improve the attractiveness of the  landscape;  
v. Outdoor sports and recreation;  and 
vi. Improvements to damaged and derelict  land.

 Meeting the Challenge of Climate Change and 
Flooding  
STRATEGIC POLICIES  
Policy CC1: Responding to Climate Change  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  is clear  that planning  plays  a key role in helping  shape  places  to secure radical  reductions  
in greenhouse  gas emissions,  minimising  vulnerability  and providing  resilience to  the impacts  of 
climate  change,  and supporting  the delivery  of renewable  and low carbon  energy and  associated  
infrastructure.   
 The NPPF  requires  planning policies  to mitigate and adapt to  climate  change,  taking  full account  of 
flood  risk, coastal  change  and water  supply  and demand considerations, both for the immediate 
future and in the long  term.  
 Local planning authorities are also expected to plan for new development in locations and ways 
which  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions,  and to actively  support  energy  efficiency  improvements to 
existing  buildings.  
Evidence Base  
 The Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report (SAscope) (2013)  states that there is widesprea d 
scientific consensus that the Earth’s climate is changing and that human activity could be the 
principal  cause.  Scientific  forecasts  suggest  that the UK’s  climate  will continue  to get warmer  and 
that heavy rainfall will be more frequent. Weather extremes, such as heat waves would become 
more  common  and others  such  as snowfall  would  become  less common.  Sea levels  will continue to  
rise and storm  surges  will become  more  frequent,  increasing  the risk of flooding  in coastal  areas. 
Activities in the Bor ough will therefore both contribute towards climate change, and will also be 
affected  by climate  change.  The strategic  response  in the Local  Plan to climate  change  therefore  
considers both elements.  
Impacts on Climate Change  
 It is widely  recognised  that a primary  cause  of climate  change  is the release  of CO2 emissions  into 
the atmosphere.  Whilst  there  are natural  sources  of CO2 emissions,  and intensive  agriculture  can 
also result  in significant  emissions,  the primary  cause  of excess  emissions  is the burning  of fossil 
fuels such as coal and gas to produce energy. The SAscope  reports that in 2005 396kT CO2 was 
generated  domestically  in the Borough,  equivalent  to 8% of the Essex  domestic  total.  In addition, 
497kT  of CO2 originated  from industrial  and commercial  sources  - 11% of the Essex  Industrial  and 
Commercial total. Road transport accounted for the smallest proportion of emissions at 289kT, 
which equal led 7% of the Essex  total.  
 The SAscope  also reports changes which have occurred since 2005 in terms of energ y 
consumption within the Borough. Between 2005 and 2011, the average domestic electricity and 
gas consumption of a Borough resident fell by 490kWh and 4,560kWh, respectively. Domestic 
electricity consumption is 100kWh per person lower than the national ave rage, whereas domestic 
gas consumption is 750kWh less than the national average. Between 2005 and 2011, the average 
industrial and commercial energy consumer in the Borough reduced their electricity consumption 
by 17MWh, bringing the total annual amount to  79MWh, which is still 4MWh higher than the 
national average. Industrial and commercial gas consumption went up slightly over the same time 
period from 544MWh to 564MWh; however the 2011 total is still 16MWh lower than the average 
national commercial and i ndustrial consumer.  
 There is therefore evidence that incentives to improve the energy efficiency of domestic properties  
such  as free insulation  schemes  have  been  successful,  contributing  to reduced  energy 
consumption.  Coupled  with improved  energy  efficiency  standards  for new homes  as set out in the 
Building  Regulations  this should  result  in further  reductions  in the per property  domestic  consumption  
 
197 going forward. The approach to climate change within the Borough therefore seeks to extend 
similar  incentives  to commercial  and industrial  properties,  and identifies  the need  to apply  energy 
efficiency standards to new commercial and industrial  properties. Research by the Building 
Research Establishment (BRE) concluded that the most cost effective way o f reducing the energy 
consumption of new buildings (by approximately 10%) lies in improving building fabric and services 
i.e. in improving the energy efficiency of new buildings.  
 The same research by BRE also showed that the greatest lifetime reduction in CO 2 emissions is 
achieved through the implementation of renewable energy sources i.e.by increasing the amount of 
energy being produced from renewable sources within the Borough. This approach saves 4.2 times 
more CO 2 emissions than energy efficiency alone.  The SAScope  reports that between June 2010 
and March 2013, the number of domestic solar photovoltaic installations in the Borough increased 
by 23,000% from 3 to 692. The development of new properties presents an  opportunity  to integrate  
on-site micro  gene ration  of energy  within  a buildings  fabric.  The widely applied Merton Rule seeks 
all new developments with a floorspace of 500m2 or one or more residential units to incorporate on -
site renewable energy equipment to achieve a percentage reduction  in CO2 emissions  from the site. 
BRE recommends that a fabric first approach should be taken with energy efficiency savings of 
10% achieved in the first instance through improvements to the building fabric and services, 
accompanied by a further 10% reduction in en ergy use through the implementation of renewable 
energy technologies.  
 Further opportunities to increase renewable energy generation within the Borough have also been 
considered in the Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Constraints and Opportunities Assessment  
(2015).  The assessment  found  that there  is capacity  within  the Borough  to generate  renewable  and 
low-carbon energy through a variety of methods which include, and are not limited to, larger scale 
onshore wind turbines, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants , solar photovoltaics and micro -
generation. In relation to CHP, and other forms of energy generated from waste, consideration has 
been given as to how this could be secured in a sustainable and deliverable way within Basildon 
Borough. The Renewable Energy Options Topic Paper (2017)  concludes that the Borough’s 
strength as an employment location makes it suitable for the application of Eco -Industrial Park 
(EcoIP) principles13 within its existing A127 Enterprise Corridor, where many waste facilities and 
manufa cturers are already c lustered. This approach closes the economic cycle, reduces the cost 
and impacts of transporting waste and enables delivery in stages aligned with investment. Policy 
CC7 sets out the criteria that will be considered when locating renewable energ y generating 
infrastructure.  
 Whilst  transport  formed  the smallest  component  of CO2 emissions  from the Borough  in 2005,  there 
has been growth in transport movements since that time. Going forward, transport movements are 
expected to increase  at a national level, and this is reflected in industry standard (TEMPRO) 
growth forecasts. The Borough's highways impact modelling shows that a number of junctions 
within  the Borough  alread y operate  at, or over their design  capacity  which  is increasingly  resulting in 
congestion. The modelling shows that the growth proposed in this plan will result in greater levels 
of congestion. Whilst Chapter 9 seeks to address this through mitigation, congestion and the 
resultant emissions from vehicles has the potentia l to increase over this period, impacting on the 
Borough's contribution to climate change. Therefore, the approach to climate change is intrinsically 
linked to the approach to sustainable transport set out in Chapter  9. 
 Whilst the Borough contributes towar ds climate change through its energy consumption, it also has  
a high quality  green  environment  which  contributes  towards  the positive  management  of effects of 
climate change. There are significant areas of woodland, including ancient woodland located within 
the Borough. Additionally, there are many trees within the urban environment as a consequence of 
the Borough's suburban character and New Town origins. Tr ees and woodlands play an important 
role in managing climate change by acting as a carbon sink for CO2 emissions, and the Local  Plan 
will seek to increase tree coverage within the Borough alongside development and as a part of 
delivering highway improvemen ts. Trees also play an important role in managing  the impacts  of 
climate  change  such  as managing  surface  water,  and contributing  towards  urban  cooling. 
Consequently, the approach to green infrastructure, as set out in Chapter 16 will also contribute 
toward s the approach to managing the effects of climate  change.

198 Impacts of Flooding  
 Flooding  is a natural  hazard  within  the Borough,  which  through  effective  long term planning  should be 
managed so as to better protect people and places. Flood risk management is particularly 
important as the likelihood of flooding is expected to increase, both in scale and frequency in the 
future as a result of climate  change.  
 The primary source of flood risk within the Borough is identified through the Strategic Flood Risk 
Assess ment  (SFRA)  (2011)  as pluvial  flooding  (heavy  rainfall)  within  the urban  centres  of Basildon, 
Billericay and Wickford which leads to high levels of surface water run -off that drainage systems 
cannot cope with. This pluvial flooding often coincides with fluvial (river) flooding associated with 
the River Crouch and its  tributaries.  
 The South Essex Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) (2012)  defines the extent and 
components of Critical Drainage Areas (CDAs) within the Borough. A CDA is an area over  which 
combined flood risk sources (pluvial, groundwater, sewer, main river and/or tidal) may result in the 
accumulation of flood waters affecting some people, property or infrastructure located within the  
CDA  during  a severe  rainfall  event.  Modelling  of CDAs  within the Borough  within  the SWMP  shows 
that the number  of properties  at risk from flooding  is likely  to increase  as a consequence  of climate 
change.  
 There is also a residual risk of flooding from tidal sources in the southern part of the Borough, close  
to Vange  Creek  and East Haven  Creek  which  are part of the tidal estuary  of the River  Thames. There 
are significant flood defences in the form of sea walls and two mechanical flood barriers providing a 
high standard of protection in this area. However, there i s still a risk of tidal flooding arising from the 
potential of the mechanical barriers failing, or the sea walls being breached by the sea. Modelling 
within the SFRA  indicates that the extent of tidal flood risk will increase as a consequence of 
climate ch ange, as of sea level rises. The Environment Agency's Thames  Estuary  2100  Plan 
(TE2100  Plan)  seeks  to manage  the different  areas  along  the Thames Estuary in terms of flood 
defence, and habitat management and creation. In places , the TE2100 Plan  proposes  to adopt 
managed  retreat  by making  greater space  for water,  where  defences  are less essential  or not cost 
effective. Whilst there is limited property within the area at risk of tidal flooding, this increased risk 
poses a threat to the freshwater marshes t o the south of the Borough, and to the wildlife that rely 
on them for shelter and  food.  
 Given  the issues  of flood  risk affecting  the Borough  now, and the likely  increased  risk in the future as 
a consequence of climate change, flood risk management is an essential component of the 
approach  to climate  change.  Despite  this flood  risk however,  the East of England  is the driest  part of 
the country. It is expected that climate change will exacerbate this by resulting in increased drought  
conditions.  The South  Essex Water  Cycle  Study  (WCS)(2011)  indicates  that water  resources  in the 
East of England are likely to become scarcer in the future. Opportunities to minimise water 
consumption and also store flood waters therefore form part of the approach to climate change 
within the Borough.  
 A changing climate can impact on the health  and well -being of people. A report by the Health 
Protection Agency entitled Health Effects of Climate Change in the UK (2012)  sets out evidence to 
this effect.  Potential  effects  of climate  change  range  from risks associated  with flooding,  to the 
effects o f extreme temperatures. The Essex Joint Strategic Needs Assessment indicates that 
excess seasonal  deaths  is an important  health  concern,  with an increase  in mortality  amongst  people  
with cardiovascular  diseases,  respiratory  diseases,  and amongst  the elderly  during  the winter,  and 
also during heatwaves. In the period 2008 to 2011, there were 20.9% excess winter deaths within 
the Borough. This is slightly higher than the national average. Data on deaths associated with 
heatwaves is not provided at a loc al level, however analysis of the 2006 heatwave set out  in the  
Heatwave  Plan for England (2015)  showed  that in the East of England  there  were  approximately  
12% excess deaths during the period than would otherwise have been expected. Consequently, 
the appro ach to climate change also considers how best to improve the warmth and cooling of new 
homes. Given the need to also reduce energy consumption, the approach focuses on improving 
the thermal efficiency of buildings, and on natural cooling  methods.  
 
 
  
 
199 Policy  CC1 
Responding to Climate Change  
 The Council  will seek  to reduce  carbon  emissions,  and the impacts  of the Borough  on climate  change 
by encouraging greater levels of sustainability through development, and by putting measures in 
place  that encourage  individuals  within  the community  to be more  sustainable.  This will be achieved 
by: 
a. Identifying  development  locations  with good  access  to services  and public  transport  
provision;  
b. Working with partners to deliver improvements to public transport, and active travel 
modes  as set out in policies T3 and  T4; 
c. Working  with partners  and developers  to deliver  multi -functional  green  infrastructure  as 
set out in policy  NE1;  
d. Seeking high quality sustainable design of new homes, commercial and industrial 
buildings that  promotes  energy, thermal  and water  efficiency  and opportunities  for natural  
cooling  as set out in policies CC5 and CC6;   
e. Seeking  the reduction of CO 2 emissions from buildings through the use of a “fabric first” 
approach and through provision  of commercial  and domestic  scale  renewable  energy  
and decentralised energy as part of development proposals in appropriate locations. The 
Council will require all developments,  either  new build  or conversions,  with a combined  
floorspace  of 500m2 or more,  or one or  more  residential  units,  to incorporate  the fabric 
first approach and on-site renewable  energy  equipment  to reduce  predicted CO 2 
emissions by at least 20%. If the percentage target is technically unfeasible, or can be 
proven to make the development financially unviable, off -site generation should be 
employed as an alternative approach; and  
f. Supporting and promoting the implementation of Eco -Industrial Park (EcoIP) principles 
within the A127 Enterprise Corridor.  
 The Council will seek to minimise the impacts of cli mate change on its communities through flood 
risk and drainage  management  that reduces  the risk to people  and properties  from extreme  flooding 
events.  
 
Policy CC2: Flood Risk and Drainage Management  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states that inappropriate develop ment in areas at risk of flooding should  be avoided  by 
directing  development  away  from areas  at highest  risk, but where  development is necessary, making it 
safe without increasing flood risk elsewhere. It expects that Local Plans are  supported  by SFRA  
and set out policies  to manage  flood  risk from all sources, taking account of advice from the 
Environment Agency and other relevant flood risk authorities14, such as Lead Local Flood 
Authorities and internal drain age boards. Local Plans should apply a sequentia l, risk -based 
approach to the location of development to avoid where possible flood risk to people and property 
and manage any residual risk, taking account of the impacts of climate  change.  
 The NPPF  does however recognise that on occasions development may  need to be located in 
areas at risk of flooding. In order for this to be permitted the Sequential Test must be passed. 
Additionally, the Exception Test may need in certain circumstances to also be passed for certain 
types  of development,  which  requires  the development  to be safe for the lifetime  of the development 
and to also offer wider sustainability  benefits.  
Evidence Base  
 As set out above,  the SFRA  and SWMP  identify  the sources  and risks  associated  with flooding  in 
the Borough.  Combined , the SFRA  and the SWMP  identifies  those  parts  of the Borough  that are, 
and are not, at risk of flooding from any source, and consequently enables the application  of the 
                                                      
 
14 Designated by th e Flood and Water Management Act 2010   
 
200 sequential approach to the location of development, and the consideration of development 
proposals.  There are substantial  areas  of the Borough  where  the risk of flooding  is low (Flood  Risk 
Zone  1 for tidal/fluvial).  There  is therefore  the scope  to apply  the sequential  approach  to its fullest 
effect in relation to these sources, avoiding those areas most at risk of  flooding.  
 In terms  of the area at risk of tidal flooding,  this is located  to the south  of the Borough,  in the area 
around  Vange  and East Haven  Creeks.  This area is currently  substantially  un-developed.  However, it 
does  includes  Wat Tyler  Country  Park and areas  of freshwater  marshland  nationally and locally 
valued  for their nature conservation.  There  is also a waste  landfill  site and civic amenity  site in this 
area that is allocated in  the Waste  Local  Plan,  and also essential  utilities  infrastructure  including  a 
Water  Recycling Centre and an electricity sub -station. Flooding in this area would therefore have 
consequences not only for people and property, but for the environment, with the potential loss of 
freshwater habitat, and water qu ality risks associated with the inundation of the landfill and water 
recycling centres. These risks need to be addressed in the long -term as climate changes have an  
effect.  
 The TE2100 Plan  sets out the Environment Agency's approach to flood risk management within 
this part of the Borough. It states that policy P4 should be applied to the Bowers Marshes area. 
This means that further action will be taken to keep up with climate and land use c hange so  that 
flood risk does not increase. In order to achieve this, it proposes that the sea defences  and 
mechanical  structures  protecting  this area will be maintained  and improved  to respond  to sea-level 
rises. However, it also expects that some parts o f Bowers Marsh, Vange Marsh and/or Fobbing 
Marsh, where limited development is present, will be turned into inter -tidal marsh (i.e. some 
inundation  by the River  Thames  will be permitted)  in order to off -set the loss of such habitat resulting 
from climate c hange. This may mean that some mechanical structures such as the East Haven and 
Fobbing Horse barriers may not be maintained in the future, in  order  to allow  for inundation.  This will 
require a  revised  approach  to flood  risk management  in this part of the Borough.  The TE2100  Plan 
requires the preparation of Riverside Strategies in order to improve floodplain management in the 
vicinity of the river, to create better access to the riverside and improve the riverside environment. 
The preparation  of a Riverside  Strategy  for Bowers  and Vange  Marshes  should  potentially  be 
developed in  line with similar  strategies  for Fobbing  Marsh  in Thurrock  and West  Canvey  Marsh in 
Castle Point,  and should seek to address the issues posed by the long -term requirement to create 
new intertidal habitat, and the changes to flood risk management this will  require.  
 In terms of fluvial flood risk, this is concentrated to the north and east of the Borough associated 
with the River  Crouch  and its tributaries  in Wickford  and Basildon,  and tributaries  of the River  Wid in 
Billericay. Historical flooding records show that these watercourses have previously burst  their 
banks causing flooding to properties in these settlements. The flood defences along these 
watercourses typically offer a 1 in 100 year level of protection, or less. Consequently there is a 
functional floodplain associated with each, where most forms of development would not  normally be 
permitted, consistent with the NPPF. There are also areas of flood zone 3a and 2 associated within 
each  water  course  where  only less vulnerable  development  should  exceptionally  be permitted. 
Proposals which provide for, or integrate flood defence schemes to manage risk arising from fluvial 
flood risk, should take into account the Environment Agency’s Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP)  
for the area concerned to ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere on the river. A partnership 
approach to flood defence projects will normally be advocated by DEFRA. However, where a scheme 
is required predominantly to protect a new development from flood risk, it is expected that the 
developer  will provide the funding.   
 Pluvial flooding in combination with other sources of flood risk, poses the greatest risk to people 
and property  within  the Borough.  National  Level  Pluvial  Modelling  set out in the SFRA  identified 7,900 
homes at risk of pluvial  flooding, and there are historical records of pluvial flooding in all of the main 
settlements in the Borough. Opportunities to manage this risk were taken in the early development 
of the New Town and also during the growth of Billericay and Wickford throu gh the introduction  of a 
series  of man-made  washlands  which  were  designed  to attenuate  high flood  flows and storm water 
and release it gradually into watercourses. However, these are not providing protection to all parts 
of urban area. The SWMP  identifies nine CDAs within the Borough where the risk posed by surface 
water is greatest. Within these areas people, property and/or critical  infrastructure  are at risk of 
surface  water  flooding,  and/or  further  growth  is proposed  which would also require  attenuation. For 
each of these CDAs surface water flow paths, and potential surface water flooding hotspots have 
been identified, and mitigation measures identified. Essex County  Council,  as the Lead  Local  Flood  
Authority  has adopted  the SWMP  with the aim of delivering the mitigation measures within it 
alongside partner organisations and/or  developers.   
 
201 
 Whilst  there  are nine CDAs  where  surface  water  flood  risk is significant,  the initial  modelling  work 
within the SWMP  identified a total of 22 CDAs within the Borough, covering much of the urban  
extent.  Therefore,  whilst  actions  to mitigate  surface  water  flood  risk will be directed  towards those 
areas most at risk, there is a need for surface water management to be a consideration in all new 
development prop osals within the Borough. Both the SFRA  and the SWMP promote the use of 
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) to manage surface water flood risk, however both also note 
that the underlying geology of the Borough will not allow for the successful function of infiltration  
SuDS.  As such  further  flood  attenuation  areas  such  as the washlands  should  be provided alongside 
new development to manage this  risk. 
 As the Lead Local Flood Authority, Essex County Council is a statutory consultee for major 
development  proposals.  In this role they have  developed  guidance  on the design  of SuDS  having 
regard to the local context. The Essex guidance builds on the National Standards for SuDS  by 
outlining  local expectations  within  Essex.  It sets out required  design  principles  and local standards 
that should be applied when delivering SuDS to ensure they are designed to respond to local 
conditions and priorities. These principles and standards will be applied within the Borough in order 
to ensure that SuDS are effective in addr essing the local flood risk  issues.  
Policy CC2  
Flood Risk and Drainage Management  
 In order to manage existing flood risk, and to address the implications of climate change on flood 
risk, the Council will work in partnership with the water authorities, Environment Agency, Essex 
County Council (as Lead Local Flood Authority) and other relevant flood management authorities to:  
a. Develop a riverside strategy covering the marshlands to the south of the Borough, in 
conjunction with neighbouring authorities, wit h the aim of providing ongoing flood 
protection for critical infrastructure and important habitats, whilst also preparing for the 
longer term need to create new inter -tidal habitat as detailed in the TE2100 Plan ; and  
b. Safeguard all  areas identified as floo d risk zone 3b, including the existing network of 
washlands, in order to provide ongoing flood and storm water attenuation, and support 
the delivery of further surface water management measures as set out in the South 
Essex Surface Water Management Plan , and any subsequent updates.  
 In order to ensure that new development within the Borough does not increase the number of 
people and properties at risk of flooding, the Council will:  
a. Apply a sequential risk based approach to the allocation of land for new deve lopment, 
and when considering development proposals, in order to guide development to areas 
with the lowest risk of flooding. In doing so, the Council will take into account the flood 
vulnerability of the proposed use. The Exception Test will be applied, i f required;  
b. Ensure that new development does not increase the risk of flooding elsewhere, and that 
pluvial flood risk is managed effectively on site. In appropriate circumstances, the use of 
attenuation based Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) will be req uired to achieve this. 
It will be expected that these systems are designed in accordance with  the National 
Standards for SuDS  , and also the principles and local standards arising from the Essex 
SuDS Design Guidance  as set out in Appendix 7;  
c. Expect develo pers to fund in full flood defence and/or mitigations schemes 
predominantly required to make a new development acceptable in planning terms; and   
d. Identify opportunities for new development to make a proportional contribution to off -site 
flood risk managem ent infrastructure and/or surface water management measures as 
identified in the Surface Water Management Plan Action Plan , where they will provide 
benefits and/or protection to the development proposed.  
ALLOCATION POLICY  
Policy CC3: Washlands  
Policy Conte xt 
 The NPPF  requires  local planning  authorities  to safeguard  land from development that is required for 
current and future flood  management.   
 
202 Evidence Base  
 The risk of surface water flooding in the Borough is managed, in part, by a series of 'washlands' 
connected by engineered surface and underground channels through the towns of Basildon, 
Billericay and Wickford. The Borough's washland system was largely installed in the 1960's and 
1970's  by Basildon  Development  Corporation  and Essex  County  Council  and attenuates  high flood 
flows  and storm  water  within  or on the edges  of the settlements,  thereby  reducing  fluvial  flood  risk 
from the Borough's main watercourses. The same principle is now part of the widely accepted 
solution for SuDS that are sought on mode rn development sites throughout the  country.  
 The SFRA  and SWMP  demonstrate how each washland plays an important role in helping to 
manage the Borough's drainage network and reduce flood risk in the urban areas, and as such, 
have been designated as part of the functional floodplain (flood risk zone 3b) within the SFRA . 
Additionally, their role is recognised and valued within the Environment Agency's South Essex 
Catchment Flood Management Plan (2009)  and also the TE2100  Plan. 
Policy CC3  
Washlands  
 The location  and extent of the Borough's washlands are defined on the Policies Map. Land within 
the washlands is safeguarded for the ongoing provision of flood and storm water storage as part of 
the drainage systems within th e Borough.  
 Development  of land within  the washlands  will not normally  be permitted,  consistent  with the national 
policy  approach  to flood  risk zone  3b. Where  development  is exceptionally  permitted  within  a washland, 
the following mitigation must be  secured:  
a. The area of washland  lost must  be replaced  with an area of water  storage  of an equivalent  
size within the development;  and 
b. The replacement provision must serve the same Critical Drainage Area as that which is 
lost, and must not result in flood risk increasing elsewhere on the drainage  network.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy CC4: Managing Flood Risk in New Development  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  sets out the approach that should be taken to determining applications for development 
in areas where flood risk is a consideration. Develo pment should not be permitted if there are 
reasonably available sites appropriate for the proposed development in areas with a lower 
probability of flooding. Only if the Sequential  Test has been  applied  and it is not possible,  consistent  
with wider  sustainability objectives, for the development to be located within an area with a lower 
probability of flooding, should the Exception Test be applied.  Vulnerability classifications are set out 
in the PPG, and should be considered in respect of both the Se quential and Exception  Tests.  
 The NPPF  states that for development to be exceptionally  permitted  in areas  at risk of flooding,  it 
must  be demonstrated  that the development provides wider sustainability benefits to the community 
that outweigh flood risk  and that the development will be safe for its lifetime taking account of the 
vulnerability of its users, without increasing flood risk elsewhere, and, where possible, will reduce 
flood risk overall. The test must  be informed by a site specific FRA and an SFRA  where one has been 
prepared.  
 The site specific FRA is used to ensure that development is directed towards those parts of the site 
with the lowest risk of flooding ; that development  is appropriately  flood  resilient  and resistant,  
including  safe access  and escape  routes where  required ; and that any residual  risk can be safely  
managed.  It also gives  priority  to the use of  SuDS.  
 The Sequential Test does not need to be applied to allocated sites, which have been subject to  
 
203 testing  as part of their allocation  process,  or for minor  development  proposals  such  as extensions 
and alterations  to existing  buildings.  Additionally,  it does  not need  to be applied  to applications  for 
the change of use of existing buildings. However, in all cases the development must be capable of 
being made safe in the event of a  flood.  
Evidence Base  
 As set out in relation  to policy  CC2,  the SFRA  and the SWMP  identify  the extent  of flood  risk within 
the Borough. These documents identify those areas at risk of flooding, and the extent and  potential 
depth of such flooding. Both documents consider the implications of climate change on flood  risk, 
and provide  mapping  which  shows  the extent  to which  flood  risk is expected  to change over time. It 
is therefore these documents that the Council wi ll initially consider when determining applications  
for development  in order  to identify  whether  a proposal  is at risk of flooding  in the first instance.  
 The SWMP provides mapping of the general extent of surface water flood risk within Basildon 
Borough,  and this mapping  will be used  to inform  the need  for site level flood  risk assessments  to 
address  surface  water  flood  risk. It also identifies  nine key CDAs  within  the Borough  where  surface 
water flood risk is most likely to affect people, property or crit ical infrastructure. Detailed maps of 
the surface water issues in each of these CDAs is provided allowing for sources, flow paths  and 
receptors to be identified. These maps will be considered when applications are received within 
these key CDAs to ensure t hat potential surface water flooding hotspots are avoided, and that flow 
paths and flood storage areas are maintained.  
 The SFRA  meanwhile provides mapping of the extent of fluvial and tidal flood risk within the 
Borough. This mapping will be used to inform  the need for site level flood risk assessment to 
address these sources of flood risk. It also provides a general consideration of all other sources of  
flooding.  Overall,  it demonstrates  that the majority  of the Borough  is not at risk of flooding,  and 
consequently the sequential approach should be strictly applied. The SFRA also considers the 
approach  that should  be taken  to managing  flood  risk and makes  recommendations  to the approach 
that should be taken when considering applications in areas at r isk of flooding. These 
recommendations have been considered alongside the advice of the Environment Agency and 
Lead Local Flood Authority, and also experiences of dealing with applications at a local level to 
determine the most appropriate approach to mana ging flood risk in new  development.  
 Recent  extreme  summer  rainfall  events  have  demonstrated  that there  is a need  for the continued 
use of SuDS to manage surface water and fluvial flood risk generally within the Borough, and to 
ensure that additional space for water is provided within new developments to cope with more 
extreme events. Policy CC2 sets out the need for SuDS to be provided with new developments, 
and for these  to be designed  in accordance  with National  Standards for  SuDS  , and the principles and 
local standards  set out in the Essex  SuDS  Design  Guidance  (2014).  The principles  and local 
standards are included at Appendix 7. The Essex SuDS Design Guidance sets out how these 
principles  and standards  can be applied  in practice  and should  therefore  be considered  alongside 
this policy.  
 In addition to SuDS, there is a need to ensure that new buildings are designed to be resistant to 
surface water and fluvial flooding. The SFRA  expects that properties can be made resistant to flood 
water up to a depth of 0 .6m. Such resistance should include measures which ensure that the 
structure of the building itself is resistant to the hydrostatic effects of flood water. Where it is 
predicted that flood waters will exceed 0.6m in depth, very serious consideration should  be given to  
the appropriateness  of development.  Where  it is exceptionally  permitted,  the SFRA  recommends that  
water  should  be permitted  to enter  the property,  and that the design  and fabric  of the building, 
should be such, that it will remain structurally  sound and capable of easy restoration. In such 
instances, space should be available within the property to remain safe, above flood level during 
the flooding event, and emergency plans should be in place to minimise the risk to  life.

washland  or within  an area at risk from surface  water  flooding  during  a 1 in 1,000  year event  will be 
considered against the Sequential Test as set out in the NPPF . Built development proposals  where 
the majority  of the land is within  a washland,  is within  flood  risk zone  3b, or is at risk of surface  water 
flooding  in a 1 in 20 year rainfall  event,  will not normally  be permitted,  having  regard  to those  exceptions 
for washlands set out in policy CC3. Built development proposals where the majority of the land is 
within  flood  risk zones  2 and 3a, or is at risk of surface  water  flooding  during  a 1 in 100 year rainfall 
event, will only be permitted in exceptional circumstan ces where it can be demonstrated that the 
sustainability benefits outweigh the risk to flooding, and all other requirements of this policy have 
been  met. 
 Where a development proposal is located in an area at risk of flooding but passes the  Sequential 
Test,  and where necessary the Exception Test, a sequential approach to the design and layout of 
development must be taken to avoid built development on those parts of the site most at risk of 
flooding. This includes those parts of the site that form natural or pre-existing flow paths for flood 
waters.  
 Where a development proposal for a site is in an area at risk of flooding, or is within a key Critical 
Drainage  Area  identified  in the Surface  Water  Management  Plan, any natural  or semi -natural  features 
such as dit ches, embankments and ponds must be retained in their natural or semi -natural form in 
order to maintain existing attenuation provision and existing flow  paths.  
 All development proposals, including the redevelopment of existing buildings, must incorporate 
Sustainable  Drainage  Systems  (SuDS)  which  attenuate  surface  water  on-site, and slow run off rates 
to natural levels. Proposals should seek to reduce the risk of flooding and ensure that it is not 
increased. SuDS must be designed in accordance with the National Standards for SuDS  , and the 
principles and local standards for SuDS design set out at Appendix 7, and incorporated into the 
development to offer multi -functional benefits. Where surface water cannot be attenuated fully on -
site, a proportional con tribution towards an off -site surface water management  project  may be 
acceptable  if it would  deliver  the reductions  in surface  water  necessary to off -set the residual 
development impacts. Development would however need to align with the delivery of the off -site 
project.  
 Consideration must be given to the capacity of existing flow paths, and to the designed capacity  of 
any SuDS proposals for a development, to cope with extreme rainfall events. Where appropriate, 
additional flow paths should be provided to direct excess surface water away from people and 
property. This must not increase the risk to existing properties  nearby.  
 Where the depth of flooding from any source during a 1 in 1,000 year event plus climate change is 
predicted to be 0.6m or less, or the building is intended for residential or some other form of more 
vulnerable use, buildings must be designed to be flood resistant. Flood waters should  not be able to 
enter  the property,  a 300mm  freeboa rd should  be provided  on the finished  floor levels,  and the 
building  should  be hydrostatically  and hydrodynamically  resistant  to prevent  damage to the  structure.  
 Where the depth of flooding from any source during a 1 in 1,000 year event plus climate change  is 
predicted to be greater than 0.6m, and the proposed use is less vulnerable to flood risk, any 
buildings must be designed and constructed to be flood resistant to 0.6m consistent with criterion 7 
of this policy, and flood resilient thereafter, allowing for water to enter the property without causing 
harm to the structure, and allowing for easy  restoration. Such  an approach  puts people  at risk, and 
therefore  such  buildings  must  provide  safe refuge  above predicted  flood  levels,  and an appropriate  
emergency  response  plan must  be put in place  to reduce risk to life as far as is  possible.  
 
Policies CC5 and CC6: Sustainable Buildings  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  places great importance on the design of the built environment.  In particular good 
design is a key aspect  of sustainable development, it is indivisible from good planning, and should 
contribute positively to making places better for  people.   
 
205 
 Local  Plans  should  actively  support  energy  efficiency  improvements  to existing buildings; and when 
setting any local req uirement for a building’s sustainability, do so in a way consistent with the 
relevant Government policy and nationally described standards. Nationally described standards for 
sustainable development were previously set out in the Code for Sustainable Homes  which have 
now been replaced by the Government by way of changes to the Building Regulations . In terms of 
energy efficiency, regard should be had to  Part L of the Building  Regulations , which  is progressing  
towards  zero carbon  homes  over time, as technologies for doing so become more accessible. With 
regard to water efficiency, the Government has introduced an optional requirement within Part G of 
the Building Regulations to be secured, where justifiable, through policy requirement in the Local  
Plan.  
 In addition to considering energy and water efficiency requirements, the NPPF  expects 
consideration to be given to local requirements for decentralised energy supply. However, such 
requirements  have  to be feasible  or viable.  It also expects  that consideration  is given to the ways in 
which landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping can also be used to minimise 
energy consumption. The  PPG details how passive solar design can make an important 
contribution towards minimising  emissions and improving the energy and thermal efficiency of new  
development.  
 The NPPF  expects  Local Plans to take account of climate change over the longer term, including 
factors such as flood risk, coastal  change,  water  supply  and changes  to biodiversi ty and landscape.  
New development  should be planned to avoid increased vulnerability to the range of impacts arising 
from climate change. When new development is brought forward in areas which are vulnerable, 
care should be taken to  ensure  that risks can be managed  through  suitable  adaptation  measures,  
including  through  the planning of green  infrastructure.  
Evidence Base  
 As set out in relation  to policy  CC1,  domestic,  commercial  and industrial  CO2 emissions  and energy 
consumption is significant in the Borough. There is a need for reductions in both CO2 emissions and 
energy consumption both from existing buildings and from new buildings in order to have an 
effective impact on climate change. Consequently, new development in the Borough will need to 
meet  higher  standards  for energy  and water  efficiency  in the future.  This will improve  the efficiency of 
buildings, minimise waste, and also ensure that new buildings minimise their lifetime demand for 
energy and water. This will help to reduce the Borough’s impact on climate  change.  
 In terms of energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions arising from the consumption of fossil 
fuels, the energy efficiency requirements of Part L of the Building Regulations  can be enhanced 
through other means to provide higher levels of energy efficiency still. The orientation of 
development  is an important  consideration  in influencing  the potential  to reduce  energy  consumption 
within  the development  and maximising  the potential  energy  production  from renewable  sources. 
Careful orientation and arrangement of development can provide efficient opportunities for solar 
gain and daylight  penetration,  rather  than seeking  a technological  solution.  This includes  capturing 
daylight  through  appropriately  located  and sized  windows  or atrium s, reducing  the need  for artificial 
light,  and designing  for passive  solar  gain to reduce  the need  for internal  space  heating.  Orientation 
and the design of glazing can also ensure passive air circulation, reducing the need for energy 
consuming air conditioning and fans in hot weather, and improving humidity levels during winter 
months to the benefit of the health of occupants.  
 In respect of layout, simpl e techniques such as locating taller buildings away to the north of a 
development;  providing  parking and garages  to the north  of buildings;  as well as providing  suitable 
landscaping  vegetation  in appropriate  locations  can improve  conditions  for solar  gain,  reduce  wind 
shadow and promote urban  cooling.  
 This can be complemented  with the provision  of on-site decentralised  and renewable  or low carbon 
energy sources, which reduce the demand for mains generated electricity, and can be most 
effectively integrated into the design and construction of new  buildings.  
 The materials used in development, the way they are sourced, and the location from which they are  
sourced  can also affect  the energy  efficiency  of new homes.  The re-use of construction  materials is 
encouraged, as is the use of sustainable construction materials. The use of locally sourced 
materials  is also encouraged due to the reduced energy expenditure required to transport them to  
 
206 site. The ongoing generation of waste from the use of the site is also a concern in terms of energy  
expenditure,  and the use of land.  Therefore,  a key aspect  of sustain ability  is ensuring  that new  
homes  are designed  in such a way that they encourage  activities  that contribute  to sustainability and 
environmental protection such as recycling and  composting.  
 As set out in relation  to policy  CC1,  water  resources  are scarce  in the East of England.  The Water 
Cycle Study  assessed the implications of growth on the demand for water in South Essex and 
recommended that water efficiency requirements equivalent to those set out in the former Code for 
Sustainable  Homes  should  be adopted  within  planning  policies.  Part G of the Building  Regulations  
however sets  out an optional  requirement  of 110 litres/person/day  which  may be required  in areas  of 
drinking water deficit such as the East of England. This is broadly equivalent to the l evel of 
efficiency recommended  in the Water  Cycle  Study  and will therefore  be sought  for new residential  
development within the  Borough.  
 Whilst the Building Regulations  establish standards for improving the sustainability of residential 
buildings, they are less stringent in relation to non -domestic buildings. However, as set out in 
relation to policy CC1, commercial and industrial energy consumption and CO2 emissions are  
significant in the Borough. Consequently, it is expected that non -domestic buildings will meet  the 
relevant BREEAM  standard, particularly in relation to energy and water  efficiency.  
 Many of the measures that would make new buildings more sustainable, also  apply to existing 
buildings. Applications for extensions and alterations present the opportunity to consider the 
installation of energy and water efficiency measures, use sustainable sources for materials and to 
make the best use of construction waste thr ough re -use and recycling. In addition, extensions and  
alterations  to existing  buildings  also present  the opportunity  to improve  the resilience  of existing 
buildings  to extreme  weather  events  including  heavy  rainfall  and periods  of hotter  or colder  weather  
including  raising  finished  floor levels  and improving  insulation  and by arranging  windows  to enable 
passive air  circulation.  
 In order to ensure successful integration into a development, it is essential that sustainability 
requirements  such  as energy  and water  efficiency  are considered  from the outset.  The installation, in 
particular, of renewable energy sources, onto existing buildings or within their grounds after 
construction  can result  in conspicuous  and prominent  structures  that detract  from the appearance of 
the building or its  surroundings.  
 The potential  for maximising  energy  and water  efficiency  and the use of renewable  energy  sources 
will vary depending on the size and nature of the development it relates to, as well as feasibility and 
viabili ty of a scheme. This is particularly the case within the Borough where there is a mix of 
development types and  sizes.  
 There  is also a balance  to be reached  between  achieving  the optimum  energy  and water  efficiency 
possible within a development through the installation of renewable energy plant and/or through the  
layout  and orientation  of development,  and the visual  and amenity  impacts  such  a development can  
have  on buildings  and the surrounding  area.  This is particularly  the case  in relation  to historic 
assets, and in Conservation Areas where special regard needs to be had to the integrity of the 
protected structure or  area.  
Policy CC5  
Sustainable Buildings - New Builds  
 All new development proposals will be required to satisfy the following criteria, unle ss the developer 
can robustly demonstrate why this is not technically or financially viable : 
a. New buildings should  be constructed  in a manner  that reduces the properties risk to 
extreme weather events. As a minimum they should be resilient to surface  water  flooding  
and provide  the opportunity  for passive  air circulation  within  habitable  rooms ; 
b. The design  of all new development  should  incorporate  measures  for achieving  high levels  
of energy efficiency and the use of decentralised energy sources, consistent with the 
requirement of policy CC1.  Development  is expected  to demonstrate  how its design,  
siting  and layout  has maximised  the opportunities for solar gain, daylight penetration, 
measures encompassed as part of the fabric first approach and the use of dece ntralised 
energy sources. As  a minimum:   
 
207 i. Residential development should achieve the energy efficiency 
requirements set out in Part  L of the Building Regulations ; and 
ii. Non-residential  developments  should  achieve  at least  50% of the credits  
available  for reduction in CO2 emissions (Ene1) under the relevant 
BREEAM scheme for the development  proposed.  
c. The design of all new development should incorporate measures for achieving high 
levels of water efficiency. As a  minimum:  
i. Residential development should achie ve the higher level of water 
efficiency (110 lpppd) set out under Regulation 36(2)(b) of Part G2 of the 
Building Regulations ; and 
ii. Non-residential development should achieve at least 50% of the credits 
available for water consumption (Wat1) under the releva nt BREEAM 
scheme for the development  proposed.  
d. Space  should  be made  available  within  the site to enable  segregated  waste  storage  for 
waste  arising from the proposed use of the  development;  
e. The materials,  including  aggregates,  used  in the construction  of all new buildings  should  be 
sustainable in terms of the energy that has been expended in their production, and the 
energy that is required to transport them to the location of the  development;  
f. The waste resulting from the construction of all new buildings should be managed in a 
way that maximises the re -use and recycling of materials, including aggregates, on -site 
where  possible;  
g. Sustainability measures installed, and sustainable materials must be consistent with the 
overall architectural approach of the de velopment. Their design and siting should be an 
integral part of  the development  and must  not result  in prominent,  dominant,  alien  or 
incongruous  features  which  detract from the visual appearance of the development or its  
surroundings; and  
h. Regard  should  be had to the requirements  of policies  HE1 to HE5 when  considering  the 
installation of sustainability measures in, on or nearby designated historic assets;   
 Where new national standards exceed those set out above, the national standards will take 
precedence.  
Policy CC6  
Sustainable Buildings - Extensions, Alterations and Conversions  
 All new extensions,  alterations  and conversions  will be required  to satisfy  the following  criteria,  unless  
the developer can robustly demonstrate why this is not technically or financially  viable:  
a. Extensions,  alterations  and conversions  to existing  buildings  should  be constructed  in a 
manner  that reduces the properties risk to extreme weather events. As a minimum they 
should be resilient to surface  water  flooding  and provide  the opportunity  for passive  air 
circulation  within  habitable  rooms;  
b. The materials  used  in the construction  of extensions,  alterations  and conversions  to existing  
buildings should be sustainable in terms of the energy that has been expended in their 
production,  and the energy that is required to transport them to the location of the 
development, unless it can be demonstrated that appropriate materials to complement 
the existing building cannot be  sustainably sourced;  
c. Site waste  should  be managed  in a way that maximises  the re-use and recycling  of 
materials,  on-site where  possible;  
d. The extension  or alteration  should  not prevent  the segregated  storage  of waste  arising  
from the use of the development, or otherwise prevent recycling by the end users of the  
building ; and  
e. Regard  should  be had to the requirements  of policies  HE1 to HE5 when  considering  the 
installation of sustainability measures in, on or nearby designated historic  assets.  
 Applicants are encouraged to consider whether opportunities exist to make improvements to the 
energy and water efficiency of the existing building, use of the fabric first approach and use of 
decentralised energy sources alongside the construction works required to deliver the proposed 
extension or alteration.   
 
208 
 Where new national  standards exceed those set out above, the national standards will take 
precedence.  
Policy CC7: Renewable Energy Infrastructure  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  is clear  that Local  Plans  should  support  the delivery  of renewable  and low carbon energy 
and associated infrastructure. Plans should include a positive strateg y to promote energy from 
renewable and low carbon energy development  and identify  suitable  areas  where  such  
development  could  occur.  Policies  should  be designed  to maximise  renewable  and low carbon  
energy  development  while  ensuring  that adverse impacts  are addressed  satisfactorily,  including  
cumulative  landscape  and visual  impacts.  The PPG  reaffirms that the need for renewable energy 
does not automatically override environmental protections and the planning concerns of local  
communities.  
 The NPPF  is also clear that local planning authorities should not require applicants for energy 
developm ent to demonstrate the overall need for renewable or low carbon energy. Furthermore 
they should  also recognise  that even  small -scale  projects  provide  a valuable  contribution  to cutting 
greenhouse  gas emissions.  Applications  should  be approved  if their impacts  are (or can be made) 
acceptable, unless material considerations indicate otherwise consistent with the presumption in 
favour of sustainable development as set out in policy SD1 of this  plan.  
Evidence Base  
 The Council recognises the valuable contrib ution to energy generation of a number of different 
renewable and low carbon technologies. From the perspective of infrastructure provision, the 
Council  has been  working  with UK Power  Networks  to ensure  the necessary  energy  infrastructure 
can be provided t o accommodate the level of growth proposed in the  Borough.  
 In addition  to supporting  the broader  infrastructure  requirements  of electricity  and gas companies, 
the promotion  of renewable  energy  technology,  which  will help diversify  the energy  markets,  where  
adequate  mitigation  of any adverse  impacts  can be demonstrated,  will be supported  by the Council.  
 Larger,  commercial  renewable  energy  source  developments,  whilst  broadly  acceptable  in principle, 
will need  to be considered  within  the Borough  context  and its Green  Belt. However,  smaller -scale 
schemes may be acceptable or permitted through Part 14 of the Town and Country Planning 
(General Permitted Development) (England) Order  2015 . 
 The Renewable and Low -Carbon Energy Constraints and Opportunities Assessmen t (2015)  for the 
Borough details the suitability for a number of renewable and low -carbon energy generation 
methods as detailed  below.  
Wind Turbines  
 There is sufficient wind speed in the whole Borough to enable the running of wind turbines. The 
Renewable a nd Low -Carbon Energy Constraints and Opportunities Assessment evaluated the 
locations tha t may be suitable having regard to accessibility, landscape significance, nature 
designations and designated heritage  assets.  
 Proposals  for wind turbines may however s till result in harm to the landscape or significant features 
within the landscape, ecology or historic assets , the openness of the Green Belt, and can cause 
noise pollution, depending on their exact location and scale. Proposals will therefore need to be 
considered against all relevant policies.  
Combined Heat and Power Plants (CHP)  
 CHP plants are best located near 'ancho r loads' where a large, relatively steady amount of  heat is 
generated to allow the plant to operate at its best capacity, therefore making it more  viable.  
 There  are currently  three  potential  anchor  loads  identified  by the Department  of Energy  and Climate 
Change (DECC) located within the Borough at Ford Dunton, Basildon and Thurrock University  
 
209 Hospital's Nethermayne site and in the A127 Enterprise Corridor along Cranes Farm Road. These 
locations have been identified as producing considerable heat to be successfully served by CHP 
plants. Eco -Industrial Park (EIP) principles would enable the succe ssful provision of variable scale 
CHP provision within the Borough’s existing employment areas along the A127 Enterprise Corridor, 
close to sources of heat  which would have wider sustainability and economic benefits.  
 Proposals  for CHP  plants  may give rise to harm  to the landscape or significant features within the 
landscape, ecology or historic assets, the openness and purpose of including land within the Green 
Belt, and may result in pollution or otherwise cause harm to local communities and infrastructure  
capacity, depending on their location and scale. Proposals will therefore need to be considered 
against all relevant policies.  
Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Panels  
 There is sufficient solar radiation to warrant the installation of solar PV panels. Large solar  farms 
are becoming increasingly common as they can produce more electricity than domestic panels, 
and their appearance can be properly addressed within the landscape if planned  well. 
 Proposals  for solar farms may however  result  in harm  to the landscape or significant features within 
the landscape, ecology or historic assets, or the openness or purpose of including land within the 
Green  Belt, dependin g on their location and scale. Proposals will therefore need to be considered 
against all relevant policies.  
Microgeneration  
 Microgeneration  (including  small  scale  wind energy,  solar  and ground  source  heat pumps)  is often 
permitted development and does not require planning permission. Where planning permission is 
required,  the impacts of proposals will need to be  considered to ensure they comply with all 
relevant policies, as there is the potential for harm to the built and/or historic environment, the 
landscape and residential amenity, depending on the type and location of the proposal.  
Policy CC7  
Renewable Energ y Infrastructure  
 Proposals  for renewable  and low carbon  energy  schemes, including schemes which apply Eco -
Industrial Park (EIP) principles,  will be positively  considered  provided  they are  in a sustainable and 
accessible  location  and comply with all other relevant policies within this plan.  
 Additionally, proposals for the installation of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and associated 
community heating networks should make use of an existing anchor load. Where a CHP plant would 
not be located within or adjacent the A127 Enterprise Corridor, evidence must be provided 
indicating that the intended anchor load is committed to the scheme and will make effective use of 
the heat resource.  
  
 
210 
 Conserving and Enhancing the Natural 
Environment  
 
 The protection of, and improvement to the Borough’s natural environment is important to those 
living in, working in and visiting the Borough and its long term sustainability. The Borough has a 
wealth of natural, semi -natural and planned green and blue space s habitats and corridors. These 
are part of our everyday lives; where we work, do business and learn, the way we travel around, 
where we play, celebrate  and spend  our leisure  time.  They  play host to wildlife,  are part of our cultural  
heritage and sit in a landscape shaped over time. Their cumulative presence also contributes to  
providing cleaner  air, managing  flood  risk, addressing  urban  cooling  and the wider  challenges  of our 
changing climate.  
 Given its strategic importance, high quality green infrastructure will continue to be integral to 
managing  new development  and change  in the Borough.  There  is already  an extensive  green 
infrastructure network covering an area of over 1,300ha, comprising a series of multi -functional 
spaces of different size  and purpose, linked by blue and green corridors and/or PRoW , in the urban 
areas, urban fringe, villages, plotland settlements and wider  countryside.   
 Development  must  have  regard  to statutory  designations  such  as Sites  of Special  Scientific  Interest 
(SSSI), Local Nature Reserves (LNR), as well as non -statutory area s such as Ancient Woodland. 
In addition, special regard will be given to sites of a more local importance, such as Local Wildlife 
Sites (LoWS) and country parks, integrating them as much as possible into the wider green 
infrastructure network and encouraging landowners to bring them into a state of positive  
management.  
 Valued green spaces and urban landscapes play a major role in enriching our quality of life, 
environment and the economy. The y give us a sense of place and are important to our physical 
and mental  health.  The policies  in the Local  Plan will therefore  play a key role in helping  to ensure  
such value is recognised, retained and enhanced where  possible.  
STRATEGIC POLICY  
Policy NE1: Green Infrastructure Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF defines green infrastructure as a network of multi -functional green space, urban and 
rural,  which  is capable  of delivering  a wide range  of environmental  and quality  of life benefits  for 
local communitie s. Green  infrastructure  is the collective  term used  to describe  assets  of the natural 
outdoor environment and includes the Borough's country parks, woodlands, wetlands, nature 
reserves,  river corridors, waterbodies,  allotments, etc.  It also extends  to include  elements  of the wider  
countryside such  as the PRoW  network,  hedgerows, watercourses , highway  verges  and the strategic  
landscape. In  most  parts  of the Borough,  green  infrastructure  extends  into the urban areas and is 
part of our town centres  and neighbourhoods in the form of local amenity and public spaces or 
groups of street  trees.  
 In protecting  and enhancing  the green  infrastructure  resource  within  the Borough,  the Council  will 
take into account  the contribution  made  by formal  open  spaces  and has set out policies  to protect 
and enhance these within chapter 13 of this  plan.  
 The NPPF sets out how sustainable development involves contributing to the protection and 
enhancement of the built, natural and historic environment, as well as supporting health y 
communities.  By bringing these qualities together, we will eventually be able to move away from a  
net loss of biodiversity  to achieving  net gains  for nature;  replace  poor design  with better  design; 
improve the conditions in which people live, work, travel and take leisure; and widen the choice of 
high quality homes in successful neighbourhoods.  
 In order  to move  away  from a net loss of biodiversity  towards  achieving  the gains  expected  by the 
NPPF , local planning authorities should  plan positively for the creation, protection, enhancement 
and management of networks of biodiversity and green infrastructure. It expects particular regard  
 
211 to be had to those sites which sit higher on the nature cons ervation hierarchy. Of the greatest 
importance are Ramsar and Natura 2000 sites (Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and Special Areas 
of Conservation (SACs). Whilst the closest of these (Benfleet and Southend Marshes SPA, and the 
Crouch and Roach Estuary SPA) , sit outside the Borough, the Habitat Regulation s Assessment 
which was prepared to accompany this plan identifies the potential for population growth in the 
Borough to have residual impacts on these coastal sites, as a consequence of recreation arising 
from population growth. The majority of Essex authorities are therefore working together to prepare 
a Recreation Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy (RAMS) to identify how the cumulative residual 
impacts of Local Plans across Essex can be addressed for all of the Essex coast Natura 2000 
sites.  
 In planning  for green  infrastructure,  the NPPF  recognises  that some  open  land can perform  many 
functions such as  for wildlife, recreation, flood risk mitigation, carbon storage, or food 
production.The  NPPF  is also clear  that planning  policies  should  protect  and enhance  PRoW  and 
access; adding links where needed to the existing rights of  way. 
 This approach to planning for green infrastructure is supported by Natural England, the 
Government’s advisory body on the natural en vironment. NE176 – Natural England’s  Green 
Infrastructure Guidance (2009) sets out how local planning authorities should plan for green 
infrastructure in order to ensure it is multi -functional and provides environmental, social and 
economic benefits to the  local community.  
 The Borough is split between the Thames and the Anglian River Basin Districts. The  Thames  River  
Basin  Management  Plan (2015), and the Anglian River Basin Management Plan (2015)  have  been  
prepared  by the Environment Agency to deliver the requirements of the EU Water Framework 
Directive, and also other relevant water related directives including the Shellfish Waters Directive , 
the Bathing Waters Directive , the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive  and the Habitats 
Directive  in relation to the water dependent Natura 2000 sites for the rivers and other water bodies 
within Basildon Borough and surrounding areas .  
 Currently, key water bodies in, or near to the Borough including the lower Thames Estuary, the 
Uppe r Crouch, the Crouch, the River Wid and the Crouch Estuary are all at less than ‘good 
ecological status’, thus are deemed to be failing their environmental targets. In order to meet the 
requirements of the Water Framework Directive , these water bodies need  to achieve ‘Good 
Ecological Potential’  and ‘Good  Chemical’  Status  by 2027.  The River Basin Management Plans  
contain  action  plans  for achieving  these objectives which requires local planning authorities to 
ensure that new development does not cause further  deterioration in water quality, and contributes 
towards improving water quality by delivering improvements to green infrastructure and biodiversity 
throughout the Borough.  
 The Greater  Thames  Marshes  Nature  Improvement  Area,  which  covers  50,000ha  of land in South 
Essex, North Kent and Greater London, includes the southern part of the Borough around Fobbing 
and Bowers Marshes. It was established by DEFRA in 2011 with the aim of creating ecological 
networks in strategic locations to benefit wildlife and  peop le. 
 The initial targets of the Nature Improvement Area’s Partnership are to deliver 158ha of restored 
grazing  marsh;  16km  of enhanced  ditches  with associated  flora and fauna;  the creation  of Thames 
Terrace Invertebrate habitat; and an improved green infras tructure network. Beyond 2015, the 
partnership aims to create a minimum 500ha of new priority habitat for focal species. The Nature 
Improvement Area Partnership has prepared a Planning Guidance Note (2013) explaining how 
development proposals can contribut e towards these  aims.  
 In terms of planning for green infrastructure, this has been occurring at a South Essex level for 
several years. The Thames Gateway South Essex Green Grid Strategy (2005) established a long -
term vision to develop a network of open spa ces and green links throughout South Essex. Its  
objectives  complement  those  of both the Nature  Improvement  Partnership  and also the Borough by 
seeking to enhance the image and confidence in South Essex as a high quality place to live, work 
and invest through embracing different habitats and land uses across rural and urban boundaries, 
connecting new communities with existing neighbourhoods and providing improved 'access for  all'. 
Actions have been taken to deliver elements of the South Essex Green Grid  Strategy throughout 
South Essex since its conception such as the expansion of recreation and nature education 
facilities at Wat Tyler Country Park in Pitsea and the creation of the RSPB’s Bowers Marsh Nature 
Reserve. Subsequently, there is a need for this  strategy to be reviewed to reflect both these  
 
212 positive changes, and any changes arising from development patterns or changes to pressures on 
green infrastructure in the meantime. This will be achieved through ongoing joint working across 
South Essex, and will seek to incorporate a wider area for the first time, including those parts of 
Basildon Borough and Rochford District, to the north, which fell outside the original strategy area.  
 Meanwhile, at a more local level Essex Wildlife Trust and local wildlife  organisations and groups 
have pursued local programmes of green infrastructure improvements. The most significant of 
these is Essex Wildlife Trust’s Living Landscape programme which seeks to take a landscape -led 
approach to planning for Green Infrastructu re, land use and management. There are several Living 
Landscape areas within the Borough, and those which extend across its boundaries.  
Evidence Base  
 The South Essex Green Grid Strategy has its own evidence base which describes and analyses 
the network of green infrastructure in what was defined as the Thames Gateway South Essex area 
at that time. This included just the southern part of the Borough south of the A127. This southern 
part of the Borough has significant green infrastructure assets including est uarine riverside; 
marshland  at Fobbing  and Bowers  Marshes;  and strategic  landscape features  offering  key views  at 
Langdon Hills.  
 Other  studies  such  as the Historic  Environment  Characterisation  Project , and the Landscape 
Character  and Green  Belt Landscape  Capacity  Study cover  the whole  of the Borough  and identify 
areas  of significant  historic  and landscape  character  respectively.  These  studies  combined,  identify 
areas of significant historic and landscape character value within the Borough around the Thames  
marshlands, the escarpments and ridges of Langdon Hills, east Billericay and Doeshill, Wickford.  
 The Open  Space  Assessments  also cover  the whole  Borough,  and identify  existing networks of 
green spaces and corridors that are used for informal recreation, habitats and  transport.  There  are 
also clear  opportunities  to enhance  these  networks through improving the accessibility of these 
spaces, providing new spaces and also the creation of additional green corridors throughout the  
Borough. It is essential that this occurs alongside new development proposals in order to ensure 
that recreational impacts arising from population growth are directed towards green spaces that 
have low levels of ecological sensitivity. This will ensure that ecologically sensitive sites  within the 
Borough, and Natura 2000 sites nearby in Castle Point and Rochford areas are protected from 
recreational pressures arising from an increased population.  
 Some of the green spaces within the Borough are protected by law, including areas of common  
land,  village  greens,  town  greens,  allotment  gardens,  Sites  of Special  Scientific  Interest,  and Local 
Nature Reserves. In addition, the Borough is in relative close proximity to Special Areas of 
Conservation and Special Protection Areas around the South E ssex coastline, and Ramsar  sites at  
Benfleet  and Southend  Marshes,  in the Roach  and Crouch  Estuary.  These  all benefit  from high 
levels of protection under international and European legislation. There is therefore a legal 
requirement  to ensure  that the growth  arising  from the Local Plan, or the cumulative  growth  arising  
from plans across South Essex do not place unmanaged pressure on these  areas.  
 There  are a range  of different  competing  users  for green  spaces  within  the Borough;  equestrians, 
cyclists, pedestrians and dog walkers all use the Borough's green spaces. Where one or more  of 
these uses are within proximity of each other there is the potential for conflicts to occur. There is 
also the potential for conflicts to arise between recreational uses o f green infrastructure and 
biodiversity.  In some  cases  it will be necessary  to take a restrictive  approach  to conflict  management to 
achieve net gains in  biodiversity.  
 As well as the amenity  and biodiversity  benefits  green  infrastructure  provides,  green  infrastructure 
can also help reduce the impact from sources of pollution. Trees can capture and absorb large  
amounts of  water  and thus help to reduce  surface  water  run-off, (a major  cause  of water  based  
pollution  in the Borough). They also act to reduce le vels of CO2 and other pollutants in the air. 
Whilst there are currently no declared Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) within the Borough 
increased levels of traffic congestion around main highway interchanges may give rise to increased 
Nitric Oxide (NOx ) levels which can be harmful to health, but which can also be ameliorated 
through tree planting and the retention of  trees.  
 Historically, blue spaces such as washlands have played an important role in managing flood risk  
 
213 in the existing urban areas of the Borough. It is important that blue spaces are also incorporated 
into new developments to minimize flood risk and support appropriate sustainable drainage going 
forward. Flooding arising from surface water runoff and the insufficient capacity of the local 
drainage network is a significant source of flooding in the Borough. The Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment  advises how there is a particular need to ensure that future development incorporates 
sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) to adequately manage surface water runoff and does not 
reduce the ability of the existing drainage network and washlands system to perform its function.  
Policy NE1  
Green Infrastructure Strategy  
 The Council  will work  with partners  to prepare and deliver a Recreation Avoidance and Miti gation 
Strategy (RAMS) for the Essex Coast Natura 2000 sites, ensuring that recreational activities 
resulting from the population growth arising in this plan, and the plans of other nearby authorities, is 
managed and mitigated in such a way as to avoid har m to these important nature conservation 
designations.  
 The Council will work with partners to prepare and deliver a review  of the South Essex Green Grid 
Strategy in order to ensure that it continues to deliver projects which protect ecologically sensitive 
sites from harm and deliver improved recreational opportunities for residents, building on existing 
networks of open spaces an d green linkages. As part of this review the Council will seek the 
expansion of the strategy into the northern part of the Borough, and will also integrate, where 
possible, projects arising from the Nature Improvement Area, the Essex Wildlife Trust’s Livin g 
Landscapes programme, and other locally -led schemes.  
 In delivering green infrastructure projects, and when considering applications for development,  the 
Council will work with partners and developers  to: 
a. Protect areas of ecological sensitivity from deve lopment and recreational pressures, by 
locating development away from such locations having regard to the hierarchy of 
designations, securing the on -site provision of green infrastructure for recreational 
activity, and seeking contributions towards the del ivery of the Essex Coast RAMS. All 
new housing and employment allocations should also secure strategic landscaping that 
incorporates space for biodiversity, including new habitat creation ; 
b. Recognise the importance of country parks, Local Wildlife Sites, an d PRoW  as key 
features of the Borough’s green infrastructure, and ensuring they  are protected and 
enhanced where  possible;  
c. Secure  a net increase  in biodiversity  across  the Borough's  area with a focus  on priority  
habitats and priority  species;  
d. Encourage the  preservation and enhancement of landscape and landscape  features;  
e. Provide green infrastructure which ensures buffering and enhancement of watercourses 
in order to bring their ecological and chemical status in line with the objectives of the 
Water Framewor k Directive ;  
f. Secure  the provision  of green  infrastructure  alongside  development  across all sites  to 
achieve  a reduction in pollution to air, water and  soil; 
g. Develop  and improve  the urban  environment  through  provision  of local scale  green  
infrastructure including  footpaths,  cycleways,  green  links,  parks,  gardens,  allotments,  
trees  and green  roofs; and  
h. Seek the provision of blue and green infrastructure which is multi -functional and 
incorporates measures that  will help to reduce  the extent  of climate  change  and/or  enable  
the Borough's  communities to adapt better to a changing  climate.  
 
ALLOCATION POLICIES  
Policy NE2: Country Parks  
Policy Context  
 Country parks are not only a recreation resource, but because of their tree cover, lakes, streams 
and other natural features, they are also important wildlife habitats and a landscape resource.  
 
214 There  are a number  of country  parks  within  the Borough  including  Queens  Country  Park, Wick 
Country Park and the Wat Tyler Country  Park.  
 The NPPF expects the planning system to contribute to and  enhance the natural and local 
environment by protecting and enhancing valued  landscapes.  Local Plans should identify and map 
local ecological networks, including the hierarchy of international, national and locally designated 
sites of importance.  
Evidence Base  
 The Landscape Character and Green Belt Landscape Capacity Study Volume One (2014) sets out 
how the country parks within the Borough should be preserved and enhanced. The study 
references how the country parks lie within important areas of green belt which help maintain the  
separation between settlements as well as being important for na ture conservation.  
 The Open Space Assessment Part I (2010) identifies a public desire for a focus on providing 
natural/semi -natural green spaces within the Borough. These spaces are considered to be 
particularly  important  and are well used.  Therefore  their quality  should  be maintained  and enhanced. 
However, it is important that the development and use of the country parks as a recreational 
resource does not come into conflict with their other role as a place for nature conservation and as 
such specific plan ning and land management practices are needed.  
Policy NE2  
Country Parks  
 Existing country parks, as identified on the Policies Map, will be retained and opportunities to 
enhance them as a recreational resource (both formal and informal active recreation) an d connect 
them effectively to the Public Right of Way network will be  supported where they will not cause 
harm by way of:  
a. Direct or indirect disturbance of areas of biodiversity significance within or adjacent to the 
country park; or  
b. Severance of biodivers ity corridors within the country park, or linking the country park to 
the wider network of habitats; or  
c. Urbanisation of the country park. 
 Development proposals which do not enhance a country park as a recreational or educational 
resource will not normally be supported.  
 
Policy NE3: Local Wildlife Sites  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects  locally  designated  sites of importance,  such  as Local  Wildlife Sites, to be 
identified and mapped so the ecological networks can be protected  through planning policy .  
Evidence  Base  
 The Basildon  Local  Wildlife  Sites  Register  (2009)  identifies  over 50 Local  Wildlife  Sites  within  the 
Borough.  These  comprise  a mix of habitat  types  including  ancient  woodlands,  grasslands,  meadows 
and marshes. Ancient woodland and rich grasslands tend to be found in Billericay and Little 
Burstead, and coastal marsh in Vange, Fobbing and Pitsea.  
 Local Wildlife Sites in the Borough can be negatively affected by actions such as development, 
poor agricultural practices,  inappropriate  management,  road-widening,  and recreational  activities.  If 
this occurs it can affect their wildlife value and the contribution they make to biodiversity, 
landscapes and the natural  environment.  
 Local  Wildlife  Sites  support  locally  and nationally  threatened  wildlife.  Many  sites will contain  species 
and habitats  that are priorities  under  the Essex  or UK Biodiversity  Action  Plans  (BAPs) . These  set  
 
215 out the strategies for the conservation of the most vulnerable  wildlife.  
Policy NE3  
Local Wildlife Sites  
 The extents  of the Local  Wildlife  Sites  in the Borough  are identified  on the Policies  Map.  A schedule  
of these sites is contained within Appendix  8. 
 The Council seeks the conservation and enhancement of Local Wildlife Sites and will support 
proposals which ensure the active management and improvement of biodiversity interest at  these 
sites.  
 Development  proposals, including proposals for recreational uses,  which  would  result  in harm  to a 
Local  Wildlife  Site will be considered  against the requirements of policy NE 4. 
 
DEVELOPMEN T MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy NE4: Development Impacts on Ecology and Biodiversity  
Policy Context  
 Planning policies should promote the preservation, restoration and re -creation of priority habitats 
and ecological networks  and minimise the impacts on biodive rsity. Plans should distinguish 
between the hierarchy of international, national and local designation  and the level of protection 
afforded to them should be commensurate to their status. Planning permission should be refused 
for development  where  signific ant harm  cannot  be avoided,  adequately  mitigated  or as a last resort 
compensated  for. 
 The NPPF  states  that potential  and designated  Special  Protection  Areas  (SPAs), Special Areas of 
Conservation (SACs) and Ramsar sites should be given the highest level of protection. 
Additionally, planning permission should be refused for developments resulting in the loss of 
irreplaceable wildlife habitats or landscapes such as Ancient Woodlands due to their irreplaceable  
features.  Where  a proposal  affects  an SPA,  SAC or Ramsar  site, a habitat  regulation assessment 
may be required in accordance with the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations  2010 . 
 Section  40 of the Natural  Environment  and Rural  Communities  Act 2006  places  a duty on all local 
planning authorities to have regard to the purpose of conserving biodiversity. A key purpose of this  
duty is to embed  consideration  of biodiversity  as an integral  part of policy  and decision  making which  
should  be seeking  to make  a significant  contribution  to the achievement  of the commitments made by 
Government in its Biodiversity 2020  strategy.  
Evidence Base  
 Although there are no International or European protected habitats within the Borough, Natura 
2000 sites which comprise Ramsar, SPA and SAC sites are situated within 5km  of the  Borough's 
boundaries. These sites are designated for their inter -tidal habitats and/or the presence of  rare and 
migratory bird species, therefore consideration must also be given to the impact that development 
within the Borough may have indirectly  on these fragile ecosystems as harm to these sites should 
normally be avoided , consistent with the NPPF. The Habitat Regulation s Assessment prepared to 
accompany the Local P lan identified a potential for population growth arising from the Borough, in 
comb ination with that arising elsewhere in Essex, to have a cumulative impact on Natura 2000 
sites through increased recreational pressure. Whilst on -site green infrastructure provision can 
offset some of this pressure, the coast will nonetheless be a draw to visitors as it provides an 
environment which cannot be replicated elsewhere. There is therefore a need for development in 
the Borough to contribute towards the Essex Coast Recreation Avoidance and Mitigation Strategy 
(RAMS)  to ensure these recreation press ures are appropriately avoided or mitigated.  
 Within the Borough, there are 50 Local Wildlife Sites. These include areas of Ancient Woodland 
around  Billericay,  Little  Burstead  and Langdon  Hills,  which  due to their irreplaceable  nature  should be  
 
216 afforded a high level of protection. Other Local Wildlife Sites comprise priority habitats, or are home 
to priority species, and any harm to these should normally be avoided consistent with the 
biodiversity conservation hierarchy, or otherwise fully mitigated or  comp ensated. Regard should be 
had to Natural England’s standing advice when proposing development within proximity of a 
recognised biodiversity asset in order to ensure that appropriate measures, commensurate to the 
importance of the asset are taken to avoid, mitigate, manage or otherwise compensate for harm 
are taken within the development proposal.  
 Beyond designated sites for nature conservation, biodiversity can be found throughout the rural 
and built environment. This includes species protected by law inclu ding badgers, bats and Great 
Crested Newts. Harm to these protected species will also need to be avoided or otherwise fully 
mitigated or  compensated.  
 In terms  of management  and mitigation,  the NIA Greater  Thames  Marshes  Planning  Policy  Advice 
Note  (2013)  sets out a number  of practical  measures  that can be applied  in order  to achieve  a net 
gain in biodiversity within development  proposals.  
Policy NE4  
Development Impacts on Ecology and Biodiversity  
 Proposals which can demonstrate a resultant net gain in biodiversity will in principle be supported, 
subject to compliance with other relevant policies in this plan.  
 Proposals resulting in any direct adverse impacts to biodiversity within Ramsar sites, Sp ecial 
Protection Areas, potential Special Protection Areas, Special Areas of Conservation, Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest and Ancient Woodland will be refused unless it can be shown that there is 
an overriding public interest which necessitates that development occurring in that location.  
 Proposals resulting in indirect adverse impacts on sites with these designations, such as 
recreational disturbance, must be fully mitigated through a combination of on -site measures such as 
the provision of suitable  alternative natural green space within the development site, and a financial 
contribution towards the measures set out in the Essex Coast Recreation Avoidance and Mitigation 
Strategy (RAMS) . A management scheme must be put in place to ensure the on -going maintenance 
of any on -site mitigation measures.  
 Proposals which may result in adverse harm to other sites with local biodiversity interest, including 
those sites with protected species, priority species and/or priority habitats, will only be supported if 
they can meet the following requirements:  
a. It must be demonstrated that there is a need for the development proposed and harm to 
biodiversity cannot be avoided through  locating the development on an alternative site 
with less harmful  impacts;  
b. Where an alternative site is not available, the development proposal should seek to avoid 
adverse  harm  to biodiversity  by virtue  of the design  and layout  of the development.  The 
Council must be satisfied that all reasonable opportunities to avoid harm to biodiversi ty 
have been taken;  
c. Where it has not been possible to avoid all harm to biodiversity, as required by a) and b),  
the development proposal should seek to apply management and mitigation techniques 
which retain and enhance biodiversity on site. The Council mu st be satisfied that all 
reasonable opportunities to secure on -site management and mitigation have been  taken;  
d. Where  it is likely  that harm  to protected  species,  or priority  species  is not fully addressed  
through a), b) and c), species translocation within  the site, or to a suitable site nearby, in 
accordance with Natural England licences will be required to address the remaining harm 
to that species. The Council must be satisfied that the relocation site will provide a long -
term suitable habitat for  the species  in question.  A management  plan must  be put in place  
to manage  the relocation site as a suitable habitat for a period of at least 20 years;  then  
e. As a last resort, if the harm to biodiversity in terms of both quantity and quality have not 
been fully  addressed  through  a), b), c) and d) off-site compensation  which  would  result  in 
a net gain in biodiversity will be required. A compensation site must be identified which 
has the  potential to be broadly equivalent to that habitat being lost, and a management 
plan prepared. Arrangements must be put in place to deliver that plan over a period of at 
least 20 years.   
 
217 
 Proposals affecting ecologically sensitive sites and designated sites  should be accompanied  by an 
ecological assessment which should conform with guidance set out by the Chartered Institute of 
Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) or an equivalent standard. Where insufficient 
information  is provided,  the Council  will take a precautionary  approach  to the protection  of ecological 
assets.  
 
Policy NE5: Development Impacts on Landscape and Landscape Features  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF,  in reference  to design,  expects  that Local  Plans  include  robust  policies that  set out the 
quality  of development  that is expected  in an area.  Such  policies  should  be based on an 
understanding of the defining characteristics of an area. This includes the local character and 
history, and requires development to have regard to local surroundings. Planning policies should 
consider  the connections  between  people  and places,  and the integration of new development into 
the natural, built and historic environment. The relationship between development and the 
landscape should therefore be  addressed when decisions are made  on planning  applications.  
 The NPPF  also expects the protection and enhancement of valued landscapes  in order to 
contribute to, and enhance the natural and local  environment.  
Evidence Base  
 The Borough  comprises  a variety  of landscapes  as a consequence  of its varied  topography,  ranging 
from elevated plateaux and local hills to the marshlands and creeks associated with the Thames 
Estuary.  The underlying  geology  is largely  formed  of London  Clay with Claygate  clays  and Bagshot 
Formation sands and gravels forming areas of higher ground at the Langdon Hills to the south west  
and also to the north  east around  Billericay.  The Vange  and Bowers  marshes  are comprised of tidal 
flat deposits while the valley -floor and tributaries associa ted with the River Crouch are alluvial. This 
varying topography needs to be considered when development proposals are put forward to ensure 
the effective integration of development into the landscape. Development  on ridge lines within 
elevated parts of the  Borough would appear prominent in the landscape and should  be avoided.  
Equally,  development  within  flatter  areas  of the Borough  would  appear  prominent within wide 
landscape views and should therefore be of an appropriate scale and well  screened.  
 The Historic  Environment  Characterisation  Project considers  the evolution  of the Borough,  and its 
landscape over time. It concludes that the Borough is now largely urban in character, being 
dominated by Basildon New Town, and the towns of Billericay and Wickfo rd. However, there are 
still extensive areas of open landscape. The northern part of the Borough is the most rural, and 
here the ancient rectilinear field pattern can still be discerned, albeit with superimposed areas of 
former plotlands and post 1950s fie ld boundary loss. To the south of Basildon New Town are the 
Langdon Hills, still well wooded with a mix of ancient woodland and secondary woodland on 
abandoned  plotlands.  The south -east corner  of the Borough  is still characterised  by grazing  marsh 
and form er grazing marsh on the Thames flood plain. These rural and vegetative aspects of the 
landscape also need to be considered when development proposals are put forward in order to 
ensure that they are retained and enhanced. This is particularly important in relation to the  areas of  
higher  value  landscape,  but is also important  for ensuring  high quality  development  that integrates 
with its  surroundings.  
 In order to ensure that landscape character is a consideration in the location, design and layout of 
development proposals within the Borough, a Landscape Character Assessment , which forms part 
of the Landscape Character and  Green Belt Landscape Capacity S tudy was undertaken in 2014. 
This provides a clear steer as to the nature and extent of development that may be appropriate 
outside the main urban areas of the Borough, and should be used as a starting point when 
preparing detailed development proposals in  these locations.  
 Within the urban areas the broader structures of the historic landscape such as field boundaries 
have been lost. However, the urban areas of Basildon are very green due to the presence of 
planting  in residential  garden,  open space provisi on and the  presence of  street  trees  and trees  of 
amenity  value.  The Urban  Characterisation  and Design  Review  highlights  the role these  landscape  
 
218 features play in the quality of the urban areas. There is an opportunity through new  development 
within urban areas to retain positive features of the urban landscape such as these, and where 
possible increase the quality of the urban environment by introducing new landscape features 
alongside  development.  
Policy NE 5 
Development Impacts on Landscape and Landscape Features  
The landscape character and local distinctiveness of the Borough shall be protected, conserved and, where 
possible, enhanced. Proposals for development shall take into account the local distinctiveness and the 
sensitivity to change of the distinct ive landscape character area as set out in the Borough’s Landscape 
Character and Greenbelt Landscape Capacity Study (2014),  or any subsequent review. Development will be 
permitted provided that it protects, conserves and, where possible, enhances:  
a. The land scape character and local distinctiveness of the area including its historical, 
biodiversity and cultural character, its landscape features, its scenic quality, its condition 
and its tranquillity ; 
b. The distinctive setting of, and relationship between, settl ement and buildings and the 
landscape including important views, landmarks and the degree of openness ; 
c. The nature conservation value of the area including the composition, pattern and extent 
of woodland, forests, trees, field boundaries, vegetation and oth er features ; 
d. The recreational value of the landscape ; 
e. The special qualities of rivers, waterways, wetlands and their surroundings  and 
f. The topography of the area including sensitive skylines, hillsides and geological features.  
 
Policy NE6: Pollution Control  and Residential Amenity  
Policy Context  
 Pollution  can be anything that affects the quality of land, air, soils or water which could lead to an 
adverse  impact  on human  health,  the natural  environment  or general  amenity.  Pollution  can arise 
from a number of emissions including smoke, gases, dust, fumes, odour, steam, noise and  light.  
 The NPPF  details  how the planning  system  should  prevent  both new and existing development  from 
contributing  to or being  put at unacceptable  risk from,  or being  adversely  affected  by unacceptable  
levels  of soil, air, water  or noise  pollution.   
 It states that to prevent unacceptable risks from pollution, planning policies and decisions should 
ensure that new development is appropriate for its location. The effects (including cumulative 
effects) of pollution on health, the natural environment or general amenity,  and the potential  
sensitivity  of the area or proposed  development  to adverse  effects  from pollution, should be taken 
into account.  
 The NPPF also expects  planning  polici es to contribute  towards  EU limit values  or national  objectives 
for pollutants. It is therefore important to have regard to the legal requirements, objectives and 
targets set out in key pieces of European legislation  including:  
 The Air Quality Framework Di rective 2008/50/EC which sets limits for air quality related to 
the following pollutants: Sulphur Dioxide; Nitrogen Dioxide and other oxides of Nitrogen; 
Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5); Lea d; Benzene; and Carbon Monoxide.  
 The Water  Framework  Directive  2000/60/EC  which  requires  Member  States  to aim to 
reach good  chemical  and ecological  status  in inland  and coastal  waters  by 2015  subject  to 
certain limited  exceptions.  
 With regard to noise, planning policies and decisions should aim to avoid noise giving rise to 
significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life as a result of new  development.  While in 
terms of light pollution  the NPPF  states  that planning  policies  should  limit the impact of light pollution 
from artificial light on local  amenity , intrinsically dark landscapes and nature conservation . 
 The PPG sets out detailed guidance on specific types of pollution including light, noise, air and  
 
219 water pollution, and how they should be considered when determining planning  applications. 
Meanwhile, t he Environment Agency advises that it may be appropriate to restrict new sensitive 
development (e.g. residential or offices) within 250m of certain permitted activities, such as 
combustion operations, incinerators, composting operations, anaerobic plants, existing landfill 
operations and intensive pig and poultry installations to avoid exposure to excess levels of noise, 
odour, dust and pests.  
Evidence Base  
Air pollution  
 The Environment Act 1995  gives local authorities the responsibility to periodically rev iew and 
assess local air quality and where air quality objectives are unlikely to be achieved, to designate Air 
Quality Management Areas (AQMAs). Subsequently the local authority develops action plans 
aimed at reducing air pollution. As a result of the rev iew and assessment process, three pollutants 
have been identified as potential threats to air quality in the Borough. They are Nitrogen Dioxide, 
Particulate Matter (PM 10), Dust and Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2). There are no AQMAs designated in the 
Borough, and industrial  and residential  land uses  are largely  separated  thereby minimising  potential  
instances  of air quality  conflicts.  The main  source  of air pollution  in the Borough is therefore from traffic 
emissions, particularly along major routes and at key junctions. The UK Air Quality Plan  identifies 
a stretch of the A127 where modelling indicates that EU Limit Values for Nitrogen Dioxide  
emissions are at risk of being exceeded up until 2023. Ongoing primary data collection is therefore 
underway to assess the extent of this harm. As the type and location  of new development  will 
influence  traffic  generation  and the pattern  and volume  of vehicular movement, impact on the 
potential for EU Limit Values to be exceeded,  the Council  will look to locate  new development,  
particularly  those  expected  to generate a  large  number  of vehicle  journeys,  to the most  accessible  
locations encouraging alternative travel by active and sustainable travel modes.  It will also seek  to 
mitigate  the highway impacts of development by improving highway and junction capacity. This will 
help to prevent congestion which can lead to cars remaining idle or queueing in peak  periods. 
Developers will b e expected to contribute towards accessibility and junction capacity improvements 
as detailed in chapter 9.  
 Increasing risks to air quality should also be addressed through tree planting to ameliorate impacts 
from emissions, and by ensuring the design of n ew development adopts appropriate energy 
efficient building techniques, contributing to a reduction of local greenhouse gas emissions and 
pollution levels.  
Noise Pollution  
 Noise can constitute a statutory nuisance and is subject to the provisions of the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990 and other relevant  law. 
 There are no EU monitored Noise Agglomerations in the Borough. As the Borough has largely 
separated  land uses,  industrial/residential  noise  quality  conflicts  are not regarded  a major  problem, 
but this  will need to remain a consideration as permitted development occurs incrementally over 
time as granted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order 1995  
(as amended), as the Borough grows, and as proposals, such as those for Gardi ners Lane South 
(site allocation s H5 and E5 ), are progressed bringing employment and residential uses into closer  
proximity through careful planning and design.  
Water pollution  
 The South Essex Water Cycle Study indicates that new development in the South Essex area is 
likely  to impact  on water  quality  owing  to Essex  being  the driest  county  in England.  This will require 
mitigation within new development. The study found that it would be preferable to ensure that water 
efficiency is achieved in new developme nts, and that Sustainable Drainage Systems  (SUDS ) are 
secured as part of new development proposals in order to minimise impacts on water  quality.  
Light pollution  
 The Landscape  Character  and Greenbelt Landscape Capacity Study  concludes  that the impact  of 
light pollution  in the Borough has  become  more  apparent  in recent  times  resulting  from settlement   
 
220 growth  and road infrastructure improvements.  Light  pollution  obscures  the night  sky and amenity  
around  many  urban  areas  within England, and can also have a disruptive impact on wildlife and 
habitats. At a local level light nuisances exist where a source of artificial light significantly and 
unreasonably interferes with a person's use and enjoyment of their property, or is prejudicial to their 
health. When dec isions  are made consideration should be given to potential light spillage and its 
effect on both the local environment, including wildlife, and on nearby local residents and their 
health and  well-being.  
Residential amenity  
 Residential amenity may be harmed  where different uses come into conflict with one another,  for 
example  employment  and residential  uses.  It may also occur  where  a new residential  development is 
poorly located, poorly designed, or constitutes over -development, resulting in a significant increase 
in disturbance to existing residents nearby. Individual development proposals should  be considered  
in terms  of their impact  on residential  amenity  having  regard  to matters  such  as noise, light, heat, 
dust and  vibrations.  
Policy NE 6 
Pollution Control and Residential Amenity  
 All development proposals must be located and designed in such a manner as to not cause  a 
significant adverse effect upon the environment, the health of residents or residential amenity by 
reason of pollution to land, air or  water, or as a result of any form of disturbance including, but not 
limited to noise, light, odour, heat, dust, vibrations and  littering.  
 New residential  and office development, and other forms of development which may be sensitive to 
excessive exposure to noise, light, odour, heat, dust or vibrations, located  near to existing  pollutant,  
noise,  odour  or light generating  uses will be expected to demonstrate that the proposal is 
compatible, and will not result in unacceptable living  standards. Such sensitiv e uses will not 
normally be permitted within 250m of uses such as, but not limited to, combustion operations, 
incinerators, composting operations, anaerobic plants, existing landfill operations, and intensive pig 
and poultry installations.  
 The installation  of Sustainable Drainage Systems should be incorporated wherever practical to 
reduce the discharge of surface water to the sewer network, in order to minimise impacts on water 
quality, in accordance with policy  CC4.  
 Planning  conditions  may be used  to manag e and mitigate  the effects  of pollution  and/or  disturbance 
arising from development. Where required, conditions limiting hours of construction, opening hours 
and the movement of construction traffic, and placing requirements on applicants to submit further  
proposal details will be implemented in order to ensure impacts on the environment and residential 
amenity are kept within acceptable limits and where possible reduced  both during construction and 
during ongoing use and occupation.  
 
Policy NE7: Developmen t on Contaminated Land  
Policy Context  
 National policy places great importance on safeguarding the health of the environment and the 
public from contaminated land. Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 defines 
contaminated land as “ any land whic h appears to the local authority in whose area it is situated to 
be in such a condition, by reason of substances in, on or under the land, that: (a) significant harm  is 
being  caused  or there  is a significant  possibility  of such  harm  being  caused;  or (b) pollution of 
controlled waters is being, or is likely to be caused ". With regard to contaminated land and the 
pollution of controlled waters the Environment Agency recommends that consideration is given to 
their guidance on Groundwater Protection: Principl es and Practice (GP3), the Model Procedures 
for the Management of Land Contamination (CLR11) and Guiding Principles for Land 
Contamination.  
 The NPPF states that planning policies and decisions should also ensure that the  site is suitable  for  
 
221 its new use taking  account  of ground  conditions  and land instability,  including from natural hazards or 
former activities of the land and pollution arising from previous uses. Proposals  or remediation  of 
land should  ensure  that after remediation,  as a minimum,  land should not be capable of being 
determined as contaminated land under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 . In order 
to ensure this, adequate site investigation information, prepared by a competent person, should be 
presented as part of a plann ing application.  
 The Contaminated  Land  Strategy  (2013)  identifies  how the Council  will address  contaminated  land 
issues within the Borough. It identifies the two main areas of activity it will engage in; firstly, to 
undertake an assessment of its area for contaminated land through a strategic approach and, 
secondly, where contaminated land posing an unacceptable risk to health or the environment is 
identified, to ensure the contamination is remediated to reduce that risk to an acceptable  level.  
 The Essex  Contaminated  Land  Consortium's  Land  Affected  by Contamination  - Technical  Guidance for 
Applicants and Developers (2014) , provides detailed information on how to deal with land 
contamination in a planning context and provides guidance on how planning conditions may be 
used  to secure  appropriate  methods  of remediation  when  dealing  with a planning  application  where 
contaminated land is evident.  
Evidence Base  
 Survey  work  undertaken  in 1990  of derelict  and contaminated  land showed  that about  0.3%  of the 
Borough’s  total land area was at that time contaminated.  Given  that the Environmental  Protection 
Act has been  in place  since  that time,  it is not thought  that this proportion  has increased.  Historically, 
the Borough  has been  a predominantly  rural area with only a few heavy  processing  industries  and 
mineral  excavation  sites.  Whilst  there  are a few pockets  of dereliction  in the area,  there  is relatively 
little land that may be classed as contaminated. Most despoiled land in the Borough, such as 
landfill sites,  has, over time, been reclaimed for amenity and recreation through appropriate 
remediation  measures.  
Policy NE7  
Development on Contaminated Land  
 Where development is proposed on land which is either classified as contaminated, potentially 
contaminated,  or suspected  as being  contaminated,  a phase  1 desk  study  report  must  be submitted 
with the planning application.  
 Where  a site is found  to be contaminated,  the Council  will only permit  development  where  it is satisfied 
that land is capable of remediation and is fit for the proposed  use. 
 An agreed  programme  of remediation  must  be undertaken  before  the implementation  of any planning 
consent  on a contaminated  site. Following  the remediation,  the site must  not pose  a threat  to public 
health  or that of the environment,  nor pose  a threat  of pollution  to controlled  waters  including  ground 
water. Evidence of remediation should be to the satisfaction of relevant statutory  regulators.  
 Where  insufficient  information  is submitted  with a planning  application  for a contaminated,  potentially 
contaminated  or suspected  contaminated  site, the Council  will take a precautionary  approach  when 
making a  decision.  
 
Policy NE8: Ensuring Health and Safety in Development  
Policy Context  
 As stated in the NPPF planning policies and decisions should ensure that the site is suitable for its 
new use taking account of ground conditions and land instability, including from natural hazards or 
former activities of the land and pollution arising from previous uses.  
 The NPPF  advises  that local planning  authorities  should  consult  the appropriate  bodies  when 
planning, or determining applications, for development around major hazards. The Health and 
Safety Executive (HSE) provides planning advice to local authorities on developments which fal l  
 
222 within the consultation zones of hazardous  installations.  
Evidence Base  
Hazardous Installations  
 There is one identified  major hazard located within the Borough which is the former Transco Gas 
Holder in Archers Fields, Basildon. This installation has been  redeveloped so that it is no longer as  
obvious  from the surface,  but the site continues  to be regulated  by the HSE in accordance  with 
Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations  2015 . 
 In addition,  within  the Borough  there  are also underground  High Pressure  Gas Mains,  and a Liquid 
Fuel Transportation  Pipeline.  
 Each installation or pipeline has consultation zones around it which are determined by the HSE 
depending on the materials stored and technology operated at the site; these are periodically  
updated by the HSE. When considering application for development in or near a hazardous 
installation or pipeline regard is given to the most up to date consultation  zones.  
 Where proposals fall within the HSE consultation zones for hazard installations or pipelines then 
the local planning  authority  will consult  the HSE and/or  have  regard  to any standing  advice  issued.  
Wastewater treatment  
 There are four water recycling centres located within the Borough. In accordance with  guidelines 
provided  by Anglia  Water,  a 400m  ‘cordon  sanitaire’  exists  around  these  centres,  where  additional 
scrutiny  will be applied  to determine  if a proposal  for residential  development  is appropriate.  Where it 
is likely that the odour from the water recycling centre will cause a nu isance to residents of the 
proposed development, the development is unlikely to be  appropriate.  
 Whilst most non -residential uses are considered to be suitable within 400m of water recycling 
centres, there may be some uses which may be affected by odour, su ch as retail, takeaways  or 
schools, and which may also not be appropriate within the 400m ‘cordon  sanitaire’.  
Policy NE8  
Ensuring Health and Safety in Development  
 Development  proposals  will be assessed  in accordance  with the Health  and Safety  Executive  (HSE) 
Guidance where a new hazardous development is proposed, or where proposed development  falls 
within a consultation zone for one or more hazardous installations. Where the HSE advises against 
development the planning application will be  refused.  
 Anglia  Water  will be consulted  on development  proposals  falling  within  use classes  A, C and D where 
they fall within 400m of a water recycling centre. Such applications will need to be accompanied  by 
Odour  Plume  Modelling  in order  to determine  what  impact  may be experienced  by potential  occupiers 
of the development. Where the modelling shows that odour arising from the water recycling centre 
is likely to pose a nuisance to future occupiers the application will be refused unless satisfactory 
mitigation measures ca n be applied.  
 
Policy NE9: Development of Agricultural Land  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  requires local planning authorities to consider the economic and other benefits of the 
best and most versatile agricultural land. Where significant development of agricultu ral land is 
demonstrated to be necessary, areas of poorer quality land should be used in preference to that of 
higher quality.  
 
  
 
223 Evidence Base  
 Agricultural land is an important natural resource which is vital to sustainable development. The 
Agricultural La nd Classification System was introduced in 1966 and it provides a framework for 
classifying land according to the extent to which its physical or chemical characteristics impose 
long-term limitations on agricultural use. Agricultural land is classified int o grades 1 to 5 with grade 
3 being sub -divided into two further subgrades , 3a and 3b. Agricultural land that is classified as 
grades 1, 2 or 3a is considered to be the best and most versatile, with grades 3b, 4 and 5 of 
moderate to poor quality.  
 Natural En gland’s Agricultural Land Classification Map  for the Eastern region shows that there is a 
small area of land to the south within the Borough that is grade 4, whereas the rest of the land is 
grade 3. However, it does not provide information relating to the subgrades 3a and 3b.  
 Natural England expect regard should be had the DEFRA’s standing advice entitled Construction 
Code of Practice for the Sustainable Use of Soils on Construction Sites when considering 
development proposals on agricultural land within th e Borough.  
Policy NE 9  
Development of Agricultural Land  
Development of the best and most versatile agricultural land shall be avoided, unless it can be demonstrated to 
be the most sustainable choice from reasonable alternatives. Where it cannot be avoided,  standing advice from 
Natural England shall be applied . 
  
 
224 
 Conserving and Enhancing the Historic 
Environment  
STRATEGIC POLICY  
Policy HE1: Strategy for Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  states  that local planning  authorities  should  set out in their Local  Plans a positive strategy 
for the conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment, including heritage assets most at 
risk through neglect, decay or other threats. It expects that the heri tage assets  are recognised  as 
irreplaceable  resources  and conserved  in a manner  appropriate  to their significance. It goes on to 
state that the highest level of protection should be given to heritage assets  of the highest  
importance  and where  substantial  harm may occur  to a designated  heritage assets.  
 The NPPF expects the strategy to take into account the  following:   
 The desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and 
putting them to viable use, consistent with their conservation;  
 The wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits that conservation of the 
historic environment can bring;  
 The desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and 
distinctiveness; and  
 Opportunit ies to draw on the contribution made by the historic environment to the 
character of a place.  
 The NPPF recognises the importance of all heritage assets and defines them as buildings, 
monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes identified as having a degr ee of significance 
meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of a heritage interest. A heritage asset 
includes  designated  heritage  assets,  such  as listed  buildings,  conservation  areas and scheduled 
monuments, and non -designated assets identifie d by the local planning authority, including those 
on a local  list.  
 Local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance  of any heritage  
assets  affected,  including  any contribution  made  by their setting.  The level of detail should be 
proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential 
impact of the proposal on their significance. As a minimum the relevant historic environment record 
should have been consulted and the heritage ass ets assessed  using appropriate expertise where  
necessary.   
 Where a proposed development is likely to lead to substantial harm to or total loss of significance 
of a designated heritage asset, the local planning authority should refuse consent, unless the 
proposal can demonstrate that the substantial harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial 
public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss, or all of the following  apply:   
 the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site;  
 no viable  use of the heritage  asset  itself can be found  in the medium  term through  
appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation;   
 conservation  by grant -funding  or some  form of charitable  or public  ownership  is 
demonstrably not possible;  and 
 the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.  
 In determining applications where the development is likely to lead to less than substantial harm to 
the significance of a designated heritage asset, the NPPF expects local plann ing authorities to 
weigh the harm it will cause against the public benefits of the proposal. A development's  impact  on 
the significance  of a non-designated  heritage asset, be it direct or indirect, should also be taken into  
account.   
  
 
225 Evidence Base  
 The Bor ough has a locally distinctive historic environment which has been influenced by human 
activity spanning many hundreds of years. Industry, commerce and agriculture have shaped the 
Borough's  landscape  and created  unique  local historic  characteristics  that have  defined  and helped to 
shape  communities  and settlements  and which  should  be preserved  for future  generations.  As a 
resource, the historic environment is  irreplaceable.   
 There is a wide variety of heritage assets across the Borough, including those tha t are legally 
designated  and those  that have  been  noted  and defined  locally.  The Council  has a duty to conserve 
and enhance the significance, character and appearance of the Borough's historic environment 
when carrying out its statutory functions and through the planning  system.   
 In accordance with national policy, significant weight should be given to the conservation of all 
designated heritage assets with nationally designated assets being awarded the highest level of 
protection followed by non -desig nated local assets. Development proposals should also have 
regard to the impact they could have on non -designated but locally important  heritage  assets.   
 It is important to note that, as a result of lack of information or awareness, many heritage assets 
remain  undiscovered  or without  official  recognition.  The existence  of an asset  may become  apparent 
as a result of a planning application, at which time the Council may deem that it is appropriate to 
apply this  policy.   
  Nationally designated assets within th e Borough comprise of 127 Listed Buildings15 and three 
Scheduled  Monuments16. Local  designations  comprise  of four Conservation  Areas17 and several areas 
of archaeological importance, where finds have previously  arisen.   
  Conservation Areas are designated to pro-actively manage the quality and condition of specific 
areas of the built environment designated for their special architectural or historic interest, rather 
than individual  buildings.  The character  and appearance  of these  areas  should  be preserved  and 
enhanced  and development  will be expected  to have  regard  to the relevant Conservation  Area  
Appraisals and Management Plans that have been prepared for each Conservation Area. There 
are a large number of sites of archaeological interest within the Borough which are identified in the 
Essex Historic Environment Record . They are considered to be a finite resource and the Basildon 
Borough Historic Environment Characterisation Project suggests that there are likely to be more 
which remain undiscovered in below -ground  deposits.   
  Throughout the Borough there are also a number of buildings, structures and places, which may 
not merit  formal listing  or designation,  but nevertheless  have  local historic  or architectural  importance 
and contribute to a sense of local character and identity. These non -designated heritage assets 
should  be conserved,  and where  possible  enhanced.  The landscape  also contributes  to the historic 
context  of the Borough  and development  should  have  regard  to this. The Borough  can be divided 
into areas  of distinctive  historic  landscapes  which  are faced  with varying  sensitivities  to change due  
to their character,  context  and potential  for further  archaeological  deposits.  These  landscapes are 
identified in the Basildon Borough Historic Environment Characterisation Project and the Basildon 
Borough Landscape Character and Green Belt Landscape Capacity  Study .  
 The Council is committed to protecting, and where appropriate seeking to enhance the  Borough's 
heritage  assets.  Enhancement  of a heritage  asset  can take many  forms,  including,  but not limited to  
restoration,  repair,  removal  of inappropriate  development,  increasing  access , increasing  visibility, 
increasing the educational value, conversion to a more appropriate use or enhancement of the 
asset’s setting. Only rarely will there be no opportunity for  enhancement.   
  The Council will work pragmatically with owners of heritage a ssets, developers, designers and 
other  specialists  to find positive  solutions  to secure  sustainable  development  sympathetic  to their 
status, including adapting them where necessary to mitigate against climatic change. Such 
alterations will only be acceptable where they are consistent with the conservation of a heritage

226 asset’s  significance.  Consequently,  it is expected  that develo pment  will be of the highest  standard in  
order  to maintain  and enhance  the quality  of the area or building,  and be sensitive  to its character and 
appearance. In considering applications for new development in such areas, the Council  will seek 
to ensure that the form, scale, design and materials of new buildings are complementary to the 
historic  context.   
  Support  will generally  be given  by the Council  to development  proposals  that restore  the Borough's 
heritage  assets  identified  as being  'At Risk'  on the latest  local Heritage  At Risk Register  (HARR) .  
  Development  proposals  relating  to a heritage  asset,  or its setting,  should  be supported  by a Heritage 
Statement which contains the information required to assess the impact of the proposal. The 
Heritage Statement should address issues raised in relevant character appraisals, management 
plans  or other  relevant  evidence -based  documents  to ensure  that local issues  are clearly  identified, 
and that the most up -to-date information guides  decision -making.  
Policy  HE1 
Strategy for Conserving and Enhancing the Historic Environment  
 The Council will seek to protect, conserve and enhance the Borough’s historic environment. This 
includes  all heritage  assets  including  historic  buildings  and structures,  Conservation  Areas,  
landscapes and  archaeology.  
 Development proposals should be sensitively designed and should not cause harm to the historic 
environment.  All development  proposals  which  would  have  an impact  on the historic  environment, or 
any features of the historic  environment, will be expected  to: 
a. Safeguard, or where appropriate enhance, the significance, character, setting and  local 
distinctiveness of heritage assets;  
b. Make a positive contribution to local character through high standards of design, which  
reflect a nd complement its significance, including through the use of appropriate 
materials and construction  techniques;  
c. Ensure alterations, including those for energy efficiency and renewable energy, are 
balanced alongside  the need  to retain  the integrity  of the historic  environment  and to respect  
the character and significance of the asset;  and 
d. Submit a Heritage Statement as part of the  application.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy HE2: Conservation Areas  
Policy Context  
 Conservation  Areas  are places  that the local planning  authority  have  designated  as having  special 
architectural or historic interest and whose character and appearance it is desirable to preserve or 
enhance. By law, special attention must be paid, in the exercise of planning functions, to t he 
desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of Conservation  Areas18.  
  Conservation Areas are designated not on the basis of individual buildings, but because of the 
overall quality of the area, the mix of uses, historic layout, characteristic materials, scale and 
detailing of buildings, structures and open spaces. The designation also takes into account the 
need to protect trees, hedges, walls, railings and other characteristic features, including street 
furniture.   
  Once designa ted, local planning authorities are required by law to review Conservations Areas 
from time to time, and to determine whether any further parts of their area should be  designated 
that are not already. If there is any further needs, the local planning authority has the power to 
                                                      
 
18 Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservations Area) Act 1990   
 
227 designate  outside the Local Plan process.   
 When  determining  planning  applications  that affect  a heritage  asset  (including  Conservation  Areas), 
the NPPF expects local planning authorities to take account of the  following:    
 the desirability  of sustaining  and enhancing  the significance  of the heritage  asset  and 
putting them to viable uses consistent with their  conservation;  
 the positive contribution t hat conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable 
communities including their economic vitality; and  
 the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and 
distinctiveness.  
Evidence Base  
 There are four Conservat ion Areas within the Borough namely, Billericay, Great Burstead, Little 
Burstead and Noak Bridge. They were all reviewed by Conservation Area Appraisals and 
Management Plans in 2011/2012 and in the case of Billericay and Great Burstead, were subject to 
amendment procedures. The Council will continue to keep under review the Borough's 
Conservation  Areas  and where  appropriate,  designate  new areas  in accordance  with the legislation.  
 The character appraisals reviewed the Conservation Areas and defined what is special about them.  
They  also identified  the specific  features  that contribute  to their character,  such  as significant 
buildings, historic features or important open spaces and views, and made recommendations 
regarding  any revisions  to the boundaries.  The management  plans  followed  on from the appraisals 
and set out what  measures  may be needed  to maintain  or improve  the character  of the Conservation 
Areas in the longer term. These documents are a material consideration in the determination of 
planning applications that affect any of the Borough's Conservation Areas and their  consents.   
 The impacts of development on a Conservation Areas may relate to matters affecting its  balance of  
land uses,  pattern  of daily activity,  vitality  and viability,  layout  or form pattern  of spaces  between 
buildings and design. Matters of design, including scale, height, bulk shape, massing, and 
proportions, patterns of opening, vertical or horizontal emphasis, materials and colour are of 
particular importance and contribute to  the historic significance of an area. In considering 
applications for new development in Conservation Areas, the Council will seek to ensure that  the 
form, scale, design and materials of new buildings are complementary to the historic  context.   
  In respect of design, regard will also be given to the design policies within this plan and, for  all 
relevant applications relating to Billericay Conservation Area, the Billericay Conservation Area 
Shop Front and Design Guide SPD which is a material planning  consideration.  
Policy HE 2 
Conservation Areas  
 Development within or affecting the setting of the Borough's Conservation Areas, as defined on  the 
Policies Map, including views in or out, should preserve or enhance the character and appearance 
of the area. Co nsideration must be given to the streetscape, plot and frontage sizes, materials and 
relationships  between  all existing  buildings,  structures  and spaces.  Proposals  should  have  particular 
regard  to the special  features  and key characteristics  identified  within the relevant  character  appraisal 
and management plan for the Conservation  Area.  
 Open spaces, trees and other hard and soft landscape features important to the character or 
appearance of the area should be retained, or if replaced or enhanced, still be in keeping with  the 
character of the  area.  
 Proposals for all new development, including alterations and extensions to buildings, their re -use 
and the incorporation  of energy  efficiency  and renewable  energy  technologies,  must  be of exemplar, 
but sensitive  design.  
 Proposals to demolish buildings and/or structures will be assessed against their contribution to the 
significance  of the Conservation  Area  as a heritage  asset.  Where  substantial  harm  would  be caused 
to a Conservation  Area's  significance,  the proposal  will be resisted  unless  exceptional  circumstances 
where substantial public benefits outweighing any harm to the Conservation Area can  be  
 
228 demonstrated.  Where  the harm  would  be less than substantial,  it will be weighed  against  any public 
benefits  of the proposal,  including  securing  optimum  viable  use of the heritage  asset  and whether  it 
would enhance or better reveal the significance of the Conservation  Area.  
 A programme of recording and understanding of the heritage asset which is to be affected will be 
expected as part of the development proposal and the recordings must be submitted for  inclusion on 
the Essex Historic Environment  Record . 
 
Policy HE3: Listed Buildings  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF attaches ‘great weight’ to the conservation of heritage assets and their  significance,  and 
any harm  or loss should  require  clear  and convincing  justification.  The NPPF considers Scheduled 
Monuments, protected wreck sites, battlefields, grade I and II* Listed Buildings,  grade I and II* 
registered  parks  and gardens,  and World  Heritage  Sites  as being  of the highest significance and 
any substantial harm to or loss of any one of these should be wholly exceptional. The substantial 
harm to, or loss of a grade II Listed Building, grade I and II* registered parks or garden s would be 
exceptional and should still be  resisted.   
 When determining planning applications that affect a heritage asset, such as a Listed  Building, the 
NPPF expects local planning authorities to take account of the  following:   
 the desirability  of sustaining  and enhancing  the significance  of the heritage  asset  and 
putting them to viable uses consistent with their  conservation;  
 the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable 
communities including their economic vitality; and  
 the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and 
distinctiveness.  
 National legislation provides for the protection of Listed Buildings under the Planning (Listed 
Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1 990. In considering whether to grant permission for 
development  that would  affect  a Listed  Building  or its setting,  regard  must  be had to the desirability of 
preserving the building, its setting or any features of special architectural  interest.   
 There  is also a presumption  in favour  of retaining  Listed  Buildings,  therefore  permission  to demolish 
them will be as an exception and only considered if all other options to retain the building are 
demonstrated to have been thoroughly  explored.   
Evidence Base  
 127 Listed Buildings19 are scattered around the Borough, but the highest concentration is  found 
within the historic town of Billericay to the north. The Church of St Mary Magdalene in Great 
Burstead and the Church of St Nicholas in Laindon are the Borough’s on ly grade I Listed Buildings, 
which receive the highest level of legal protection that can be awarded to buildings of historical or 
architectural importance. The majority of other Listed Buildings within the Borough are grade II 
listed and represent  a diver se range  of buildings  and structures  that help shape  local character  and 
identity. These  include  K6 telephone  kiosks  designed  by Sir Giles  Gilbert  Scott  from 1936,  war 
memorials in Little Burstead, Pitsea and Billericay, 16th century timber framed cottages, 
farmhouses and barns, 18th and 19th century red brick houses with parapets and moulded cornice, 
ragstone churches  dating  as far back  as the 12th century,  and a 1960s  tower  block  and pool with 
sculpture by architect Anthony B Davis in Basildon Town Centre.   
 In order  to preserve  the Borough's  Listed  Buildings  and prevent  them  falling  into disuse  or disrepair, 
the Council will consider favourably  a development proposal to repair, renovate, alter and extend a 
Listed Building if it compliments and enhances the qualities that make the building special. 
Proposals should not dominate the Listed Building or group of buildings within its curtilage by scale , 
                                                      
 
19 As of 31 March 2017   
 
229 form, mass or appearance or harm the visual relationship between the Listed Building  and its 
formal, or natural landscape  setting.   
  The Council will support proposals that retain and enhance traditional features and where the 
design and use of materials  are sympathetic to those used in the original  building.   
  The Council  acknowledges  that there  may be instances  where  a Listed  Building  becomes  vacant, 
or has been derelict for some time and an alternative use is proposed. If the building is no  longer 
required for its original use the Council will consider applications for a change of use providing the 
alternative use for the Listed Building is compatible with its character and built form, and will not 
result in material harm to the historical importance of  the building.    
Policy HE3  
Listed Buildings  
 Proposals  for development,  including  change  of use, that involve  any alterations  to a Listed  Building 
or within its curtilage, will be supported where  they:  
a. Do not lead to substantial  harm  to, or total loss of, the significance  of the building,  
including  its setting, unless exceptional circumstances can be  demonstrated;  
b. Harmonise with the period, style, materials and detailing of the  building;  
c. Retain and repair existing features and fabric, or, if missing, replace them in a 
sympathetic manner;  
d. Not harm the structural integrity or stability of the building, or that of adjoining buildings  or 
structures;  and 
e. Relate sensitively to the original building and not adversely affect the internal or  external 
appearance  or character of the building, curtilage or its  setting.  
 Proposals affecting the significance of a Listed Building will be required  to: 
a. Be supported by a Historic Building Survey carried out in accordance with Historic 
England guidelines, which demonstrate  an understanding of the significance of the 
Listed Building and its setting  by describing it in sufficient detail to determine its historic 
or architectural interest to a level proportionate with its  importance;  
b. Justify  any harm  proposed  to the Listed  Building  and demonstrate  the overriding  public  
benefits which would outweigh the harm to the Listed Building or its setting. The greater 
the harm  to the significance of the Listed Building, the greater justification and public 
benefit that will be required be fore the application could gain support; and  
c. Minimise any identified harm or loss to the Listed Building through  mitigation.  
 
Policy HE4: Scheduled Monuments and Archaeology  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  considers  Scheduled  Monuments  as being  of the highest  significance and any substantial 
harm to, or loss of them should be wholly  exceptional.  
  When  determining  planning  applications  that affect  a heritage  asset,  including  Scheduled  Monument, 
local planning authorities should to take account of the  following:   
 the desirability  of sustaining  and enhancing  the significance  of the heritage  asset  and 
putting them to viable uses consistent with their  conservation;  
 the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable 
communities including their economic vitality; and  
 the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and 
distinctiveness.  
 The scheduling  of monuments  derives  from the Ancient  Monuments  Act 1882  and the later Ancient 
Monuments and Ar chaeological Areas Act 1979 and provides protection for archaeological sites 
that are of national importance. A monument refers to any building, structure or work, or site  
 
230 comprising their remains, whether above or below the surface of the land and any cav e or 
excavation. It also refers to any site comprising of any vehicle vessel, aircraft or other movable 
structure provided the situation of that object or its remains in that particular site is a matter of 
public  interest.   
 While  some  change  may be possible,  Historic  England  states  that there  is a presumption  that they 
will be handed  on to the future,  in much  the same  state  that we have  found  them.  Once  a monument is 
scheduled any works to it, and flooding and tipping operations that might affect it,  with a few 
exceptions, require Scheduled Monument Consent from the Secretary of State and not the local 
planning  authority.   
 As part of local planning  authority's  statutory  duties  and planning  function,  it is required  to ensure 
that development does not harm a Scheduled Monument or its setting and, where possible, it 
should support opportunities that would ensure its preservation long into the  future.   
 Non-designated  heritage  assets  of archaeological  interest that are demonstrably of equivalent 
significan ce to scheduled monuments, should also be considered subject  to the policies  for 
designated  heritage  assets  like Scheduled  Monuments.  The PPG  identifies three  types:  
 those that have yet to be formally assessed for designation;  
 those that have been assessed  as being nationally important and therefore, capable of 
designation, but which the Secretary of State has exercised their discretion not to 
designate; and  
 those that are incapable of being designated by virtue of being outside the scope of the  
Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 because of their physical nature.  
 To judge whether non -designated sites of archaeological interest are demonstrably of equivalent 
significance to Scheduled Monuments, and therefore considered subject to t he same policies as 
those for designated heritage assets, the PPG recommends local planning authorities refer to 
Government produced criteria for scheduling  monuments.   
 The PPG identifies other non -designated heritage assets of archaeological interest as b eing of 
lesser heritage significance although they should still be conserved. To assess whether a site on 
which development is proposed, includes, or has the potential to include heritage assets with 
archaeological interest, an assessment may need to be ca rried out. The NPPF refers  to the 
submission  of an appropriate  desk -based  assessment  and, where  necessary,  a field evaluation in 
these instances.   
Evidence Base  
Scheduled Monuments  
 There are three Scheduled Monuments within the Borough that are statutorily required to be 
conserved in situ. Two are moated sites at Botelers in the Fryerns neighbourhood of Basildon and 
at the site of the former Basildon Hall, in West Thorpe, Basildon. The third is the multi -period 
Norsey Wood, Billericay .  
 The Scheduled Monument at Botelers dates back to the medieval period and comprises a water 
filled moat, approximately 90 square metres in size, with a causeway which is no longer extant. 
The moated  site at the former Basildon  Hall is also medieval  in origin  and an example  of a 
homestead  moat. Whilst there are no buildings within it, there is evidence of possible remains of 
old brickwork showing  upon  an eroded  pathway  in the interior  of the site. Norsey  Woods  is a multi -
period  site which contains  an extensive  collection  of visible  and documented  archaeological  features.  
These  include the Bronze Age bowl barrow, the Iron Age and Roman cemeteries and the medieval 
deer bank. Numerous artefacts some dating back to the Iron Age have also previously been  
unearthed.   
Non-designated heritage assets of archaeological interest  
 The location  of all known  archaeological  remains  can be found  in the Essex  Historic  Environment 
Record  (HER)  which  is maintained  by Essex County Council. There are over 800 records included 
within t he HER for the Borough which includes both the location of in -situ remains and also finds  
 
231 which were removed from site. The records cover sites and finds from the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic 
and Neolithic eras, the Bronze and Iron Ages, as well as from Saxon,  Roman Medieval and Post -
Medieval periods. Remains of ditches, pillboxes and other structures from WWII including  an 
explosives factory on Vange Marshes are the most recently dated  finds.   
 In addition  to the HER , information  gained  from the Basildon Borough Historic  Environment  
Characterisation  Project will also be utilised  to assist  decision -making.  This project  examined  the 
historic  and archaeological processes which have influenced the form and use of the whole modern 
landscape and reveals  the sensitivity, diversity and value of the historic environment resource 
within the  Borough.   
 The Council will resist development which adversely affects remains, if important remains are 
found,  and seek  to minimise  the impact  from developments,  by requiring  either  in situ preservation, or 
a programme of excavation, recording, publication and archiving of remains. The Council's position  
is a general  presumption  in favour  of in-situ preservation  of important  remains  and measures should 
be used to allo w the remains to be permanently preserved in -situ. If this is not possible, 
development  should  not take place  until satisfactory  excavation  and recording  of the remains  has 
been carried out on site, and subsequent analysis, publication and archiving  undert aken.   
 To ensure  that the Borough's,  as yet, undiscovered  archaeological  heritage  is not lost, the Council 
will put in place measures to have potential areas of archaeological importance investigated and 
documented before proposals are determined. This may  be initially indicated by the  identification of  
archaeological  finds  previously  on the site, or in the surrounding  area,  or through  other  evidence 
supporting the Local P lan.  
 The Council will seek to preserve in -situ other non -designated heritage assets o f archaeological 
interest and archaeological remains that are discovered through investigation, unless it is  proven to 
the local planning authority to be neither practical, nor desirable. In such circumstances, 
appropriate  provision  for the excavation,  recording,  publication  and archiving  of the remains  must be 
ensured before planning permission is  granted.  
Policy HE4  
Scheduled Monuments and Archaeology  
 As a precautionary  approach  to ensuring  that archaeological  remains  in the Borough  are protected, 
the Council  will require  an appropriate  desk -based  archaeological  assessment  and, where  necessary, a 
field evaluation where heritage assets of archaeological interest of any significance are, or may be 
present on the site of a proposed development, or are like ly to be affected by the proposed 
development. This assessment must form part of the planning  application.  
 Scheduled  Monuments  and other  important  archaeological  sites and their settings  will be preserved 
in situ. Mitigating  measures  must  be taken  to ensure  the preservation  of all remains  of archaeological 
importance, and to avoid harm being caused to the important archaeological remains if they are to 
be preserved  in situ. Where  this is not possible  proposals  would  need  to demonstrate  that the public 
benefits of redevelopment including securing a site's optimum viable use, outweighs the harm or 
loss caused by not preserving the archaeological remains in  situ. 
 Development proposals affecting archaeological remains of less than national importance must  be 
conserved in a manner appropriate to their  significance.  
 If archaeological  remains  are to be impacted upon by development,  a programme  of excavation,  
recording,  publication and archiving of remains must be provided as part of the proposal. Evidence 
shou ld be deposited with the Essex Historic Environment Record and any archives with a local 
museum or other public depository.  
Policy HE5: Locally Identified Heritage Assets  
Policy Context  
 Not all heritage  assets  are formally  recognised  through  a legal  design ation,  but they are recognised 
through the NPPF as contributing positively to the historic environment. These are referred to as 
non-designated heritage assets which are defined by the PPG as buildings, monuments, sites,  
 
232 places, areas or landscapes identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in 
planning decisions, but which are not formally designated heritage  assets.   
 The PPG  is clear to emphasise that only a minority of buildings have enough heritage interest  for 
their sign ificance to be a material consideration in the planning  process.   
 A comprehensive  list of all non-designated  heritage  assets  would  ensure  that their significance  is 
given due consideration as part of the decision making process and the PPG recommends the 
incorporation  of a Local  List into the Local  Plan.  This allows  for the identification  of non-designated 
heritage  assets  against  consistent,  published  criteria,  so as to improve  the predictability  for achieving 
sustainable  development.   
 When determining planning applications that affect a heritage asset, including a non -designated 
asset,  the NPPF  expects  local planning  authorities  to take account  of the following:   
 the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and 
puttin g them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;  
 the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable 
communities including their economic vitality; and  
 the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and 
distinctiveness  
Evidence Base  
 In addition to the designated heritage assets, there are many non -designated assets within the 
Borough including buildings, monuments, sites, places and landscapes that have positive 
archite ctural, archaeological, or historic interest and, thus, contribute positively to the overall 
historic environment .  
 For all identified heritage assets, there should be a presumption in favour of their conservation and 
the more significant the asset, the gr eater the presumption in favour of its conservation should be. 
The loss of the asset, or harm to its significance will only be acceptable if it can be demonstrated 
that there are overriding public benefits and it is not viable, or feasible to retain the as set within the 
development .  
 In accordance with NPPF and other advice by the Government, the Council will produce a list of 
heritage assets of local significance. This ‘Local List’ will be prepared as an SPD, and will include 
buildings, structures or features of local architectural or historic interest which make a positive 
contribution to their localities and contribute to part of the character of the area in which they are 
situated. The preparation of a separate SPD will allow for the Local List to b e amended more 
frequently than the Local Plan itself, enabling newly found historic features such as significant 
archaeological finds to be included when they are discovered. In seeking to prepare the Local List, 
the Council first engaged with local commun ities and local heritage groups in 2015 to identify 
potential heritage assets of local significance to be assessed against local criteria. Those which 
meet the criteria will be added to the list. All entries on the Local List will be subject to the followi ng 
policy . 
Policy HE 5 
Locally Identified Heritage Assets  
 Proposals for development, including repairs, change of use, alterations and extensions to a locally 
identified heritage asset as identified in the Local List of Non -designated Heritage Assets SPD  will 
be supported where they are designed sensitively and sympathetically and not adversely affect the 
appearance or character of the asset.  
 Where locally identified heritage assets are affected by development proposals, their significance 
should be retained  within development wherever reasonably practicable. Development resulting in 
harm to, or loss of significance of a locally identified asset will only be acceptable where:  
a. there are demonstrable and overriding benefits associated with the development; and  
b. any identified harm or loss to the asset is minimised through mitigation.   
 
233 
 Implementation  
STRATEGIC POLICY  
Policy IMP1: Implementation Strategy  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects local planning authorities to seek opportunities to achie ve each  of the 
economic,  social  and environmental  dimensions  of sustainable  development,  and net gains  across  
all three.  A particular  requirement  of Local Plans in this regard  is to plan positively for the provision 
of development and infrastructure required in the area in accordance with the objectives, principles 
and policies of the NPPF . To ensure  that there  is a reasonable  prospect  that planned  infrastructure 
is deliverable ,  local planning authorities should assess district -wide development costs as part of 
the plan preparation stage. For this reason, infrastructure and development policies should be 
included  in the Local  Plan. 
 The NPPF  is clear that pursuing sustainable development requires careful attention to viab ility and 
costs in plan -making and decision -taking. Plans should be deliverable. Therefore, the costs  of any 
requirements  likely  to be applied  to development, such as requirements for affordable housing  
provision , standards, infrastructure contributions or  other requirements , should be set at a level that 
would not undermine the deliverability of development.  
 Local planning authorities are expected to set out what contributions would be required from 
development to make the development acceptable  within the ir plans . Such contributions would be 
sought in the form of p lanning obligations , of which Communit y Infrastructure Levy is one such 
form.  
Evidence Base  
 An Infrastructure  Delivery Plan (IDP ) (2018)  has been  prepared  to accompany  the Local P lan. This 
identifies the level of current provision of infrastructure within the Borough, and the need for 
additional infrastructure to support the level and distribution of growth set out in the Local P lan. It 
identifies the requirements for infrastructure within t he Borough as a whole, and the infrastructure  
required to support growth in particular settlements and on particular development sites. This IDP 
is likely to evolve over time, as the drivers of need change, and different infrastructure projects 
receive pri ority consideration for funding from partner organisations and the Government. It will  
therefore be maintained as a living document, updated to reflect these changes, and the progress 
made  in delivering the Local P plan and securing key pieces of  infrastructure.  
 This Local  Plan has been  developed  alongside  the Community  Infrastructure  Levy  (CIL)  Charging 
Schedule . The Whole  Plan Viability  Assessment  of this plan has also been  used  to set CIL charges  
for different  types  of development,  having  regard  to the need  to ensure  that development remains 
generally viable within the Borough. The CIL is expected to raise a proportion of the infrastructure 
costs estimated within the IDP. There is however an infrastructure funding deficit which will need to 
be addressed if the scale of growth in the Local P lan is to go ahead. This will require the Council to 
work with service providers such as Essex County Council (highways, drainage, edu cation,  adult  
social  care,  libraries  etc), NHS  England,  Essex  Police  and the Environment  Agency to secure  
additional  funding.  It is likely  that a significant  element  of this additional  funding,  particularly in  relation  
to highways  infrastructure,  will need  to be secured  through  joint bids with Essex  County Council and 
neighbouring boroughs to the SELEP , or directly to Government.  
 In order to ensure that this infrastructure investment deficit is addressed, development will be 
phased to align with delivery of  infrastructure projects, having regard to the capacity of existing 
infrastructure within a local area. If a developer seeks to accelerate this phasing it will be necessary 
for that developer  to either  fund the infrastructure  required  directly,  or to work  with the Council  to 
enhance the  bid being  made  for SELEP/Government  funding.  It will also be necessary  for the 
developer  to work with the Council to ensure that the proposals for a development site meet the 
requirements of the Local P lan, or otherwise mitigate harm to the environment, the need for a 
specific mix of development  or the need  for on-site infrastructure  provision.  Where  sites are in 
single  ownership, and have a developer/housebuilder on board this is relatively more achievable  
 
234 than on sites with multiple landowners or with more complex  requirements.  
 The HELAA  shows that there are some development sites identified within the Local P lan which 
are in multiple  ownership,  or where  more  complex  issues  do exist.  The wide distribution  of 
development across  the Borough  reduces  the risk associated  with these  sites in terms  of slow 
delivery.  However, it is necessary for these sites to be progressed in order to deliver the housing 
target set in policy SD1.  The Council  will therefore  work  with partners,  and if possible  landowners,  in 
relation to these sites in order to bring forward deliverable development  briefs or masterplans for 
these sites. It is recognised that legal constraints such as covenants can frustrate delivery, and 
therefore any development br ief/masterplan will be informed by legal advice. Additionally, it is 
recognised that viability can affect the delivery of plan requirements and consequently any 
development brief/masterplan will also be subject to an independent viability appraisal to ensu re it 
is sound economically. There will be instances where despite this approach landowners will be 
unwilling to bring forward their land for development purposes. Where the Council considers that 
this undermines the delivery of development that the Boroug h needs to meet its requirements for 
sustainable development it can make use of Compulsory Purchase Powers to acquire the land and 
progress its development. Furthermore, it may involve itself in direct delivery of development where 
it is in the Council’s c ommercial interest to do so. The Council has its own housebuilding company 
called  Sempra Homes in this regard.  
 Some of the sites in the HELAA , and indeed some of the allocations in the Local P lan, are less 
complex. The preparation of development briefs or masterplans in relation to these sites would be 
excessive in terms of bringing them forward. However, the financial risks associated with 
development may still hinder these sites in coming for ward. There is therefore the potential for the 
Council to use its authority to grant Permission in Principle to de -risk brownfield sites on the 
Brownfield Register, and less complex allocations in the Local P lan, enabling them to be delivered 
sooner.  
Polic y IMP1  
Implementation Strategy  
 The successful implementation of the Local  Plan is dependent upon the delivery of new homes and 
jobs that are accompanied by the required provision and/or improvement of infrastructure and 
services. The Council will maintain,  as a living document, an Infrastructure Delivery Plan , which will 
identify the requirements for infrastructure to support growth within the Borough as a whole, and the 
infrastructure required to support growth in particular settlements and on particular d evelopment 
sites.  
 In order to deliver growth on identified development sites, the Council will work with developers to 
bring  forward  development  proposals  that accord  with the requirements  of this plan.  Where  necessary, 
these proposals will need to identif y any measures that need to be secured on -site to ensure the 
delivery of the required mix of development (including the mix of housing), the mitigation of 
environmental  harm,  and/or  the provision  of infrastructure  as identified  in the Infrastructure  Delive ry 
Plan. Where appropriate planning conditions or planning obligations will be used to secure on -site 
measures.  
 Where an identified development site is not likely to come forward within the expected timeframe, 
the Council  will work  with partners,  and where  possible  landowners,  to prepare  a development  brief 
or masterplan for that development site. Any development brief or masterplan prepared will be the 
subject of legal scrutiny and independent viability appraisal to ensure that it is realistic. Where this 
fails to result  in the site being  brought  forward  within  a reasonable  timescale,  the Council  will consider 
using its Compulsory Purchase Powers to deliver the required  development. Additionally, where 
appropriate, the Council may engage in direct delivery.  
 For less complex sites, both allocated and within the urban area, the Council will investigate the 
potential of permitting ‘Permission in Principle’ where it has the potential to de -risk sites, and bring 
forward development.  
 In order to enable the deliver y of the wider, off -site infrastructure requirements of the Borough,  as 
set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan , the Council  will: 
a. Set a Community Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedule, and identify those elements of  
 
235 the Infrastructure Delivery  Plan which will be funded  in total,  or in part, by the receipts  of 
this levy; 
b. Work  in partnership  with service  providers,  funding  partners  and the Government  to 
secure  the infrastructure  provision,  service  provision  and infrastructure  investment  
required  to accompany growth, and address investment deficits;  and 
c. Phase  development  to ensure  that infrastructure  capacity  is created  to accommodate  
additional people  and vehicles,  alongside  new development.  Where  the private  sector  
seeks  to accelerate development, they will be expected to address any wider 
infrastructure deficits within their proposals. Accelerated proposals will not be supported 
where delivery is at the expense of other components of sustainable development, 
including but not limited to environment al mitigation  and/or  the provision  of specialist  
housing,  affordable  housing  and any accompanying provision of commercial  
development.  
 
DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
Policy IMP2: Use of Planning Obligations  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  set out the Government's policy on planning obligations  and is clear that planning  
conditions  are preferable to  planning  obligations . Local planning authorities should only seek 
planning obligations where they meet all of the following tests:  
 necessary to make the dev elopment acceptable in planning terms ; 
 directly related to the development; and  
 fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.  
 These tests are set out as statutory tests in the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 
(as amended) and as policy tests in the  NPPF . The planning  obligations  section  of the PPG  also 
provides  guidance  on the use of planning  obligations  and repeats  earlier  advice  that planning  
obligations  should  mitigate  the impact  of unacceptable  development.   
 The PPG  describes how planning obligations relate to other contributions. It states that developers 
may be asked to provide contributions for infrastructure in several ways. This may be by way of the 
CIL an d/or planning obligations in the form of Section 106 Agreements and Section 278 Highway 
Agreements. Developers will also have to comply with any conditions attached to their planning 
permission. Local planning authorities should ensure that the combined to tal impact of such 
requests do not threaten the viability of the site and scale of development identified in the 
development  plan.  
Evidence Base  
 In terms of identifying the requirements for obligations the Council will use the information and 
evidence  in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan  for 2018 and any subsequent updated version of the 
plan. This will be backed up by consultation and discussions with service providers at the time 
applications are made. Information was provided by the major  infrastructu re providers  such  as 
Essex  County  Council  for education (including early years childcare)  and highways,  the local Clinical 
Commissioning Group/Community Health Partnerships/NHS England for health, Anglian Water, the 
Environment Agency and the Lead Local Fl ood Authority for flood protection and water  
management.  
 The Whole Plan Viability Assessment  has determined that the majority of development within the 
Borough is viable, taking into account policy requirements including affordable housing, and also 
the re quirement for S ection 106 Agreements to be provided on most sites. However, it is 
recognised that planning obligation requirements, if excessive can affect the viability of 
development, and therefore some flexibility will need to be shown by the Council wh ere it is 
demonstrated that the cumulative effects of a number of planning obligations affect the viability of 
development proposals .  
 
236 
 It is recognised  that some  larger  development  schemes  may also need  flexibility  in the approach to 
planning obligations in  order to enable the provision of essential upfront infrastructure such as 
access,  servicing,  utilities  and drainage.  The Council  will not normally  consider reductions in planning 
obligations for other infrastructure, environmental or affordable housing re quirements on these 
sites in the first instance, but will instead consider proposals for the type, means, phasing and 
timing of any payments or contributions within the context of the overall scheme to be structured in 
such a way which reduces upfront cost s and enables the developer to better manage borrowing 
costs and cashflow. Where such an approach cannot make the development viable, the Council 
will engage with service providers to determine whether other solutions can be brought forward to 
render the s cheme acceptable at a lower cost to the developer. Additionally, it will also consider 
whether a deferred contributions arrangement can be put in place in relation to affordable  housing 
provision, consistent with the requirements of policy  H26. 
 Policy IMP2  focuses solely on the use of planning obligations in the form of Section 106 
Agreements and Sections 38 and 278 Highways Agreements. Planning  obligations  will not be 
secured to be used to deliver specific infrastructure projects  that are  identified  on the Community 
Infrastructure Levy Regulation 123 List as they will be paid for by the developer through the 
Community Infrastructure  Levy.  
Policy IMP2  
Use of Planning Obligations  
 New development will be expected to fully mitigate its impact on infrastructure,  services and the 
environment.  Such  mitigation  may be secured  through  a planning  obligation where it is not possible to 
secure it through the Community Infrastructure Levy or a planning condition,  subject  to an obligation 
meeting the requirements of the relevant legislation and national  policy.  
 The types  of infrastructure  that developments  may be required  to provide  such  obligations  for include, 
but are not limited  to, the following:  
a. Utilities and waste (where the provision does not fall within the utilit y providers  legislative 
obligations);  
b. Flood prevention and sustainable drainage  measures;  
c. Transport (highway, rail, bus and cycle/footpath network, and any associated  facilities);  
d. Community infrastructure (such as health, education, libraries, indoor sport  and 
recreation facilities);  
e. Green infrastructure (such as outdoor sports facilities, open space, parks, allotments, 
play areas, enhancing and conserving biodiversity and the management of 
environmentally  sensitive areas including Natura 2000 and Ramsar  Sites);  
f. Climate change and energy initiatives through allowable  solutions;  
g. Affordable housing;  and 
h. Town centre regeneration and public realm  improvements.  
 Where appropriate, the Council will permit developers to provide the necessary infrastructure 
themsel ves as part of their development proposals, rather than making financial  contributions.  
 Where an applicant feels that any planning obligation requirements will render a proposal  unviable, 
they must supply to the Council a viability appraisal which will be independently assessed. In the 
first instance,  the Council  will consider  whether  the type,  means,  phasing  and timing  of any planning 
obligation  can be altered  to improve  the viability  of the development  before  considering  any downward 
adjustment  to the identified  requirements  for planning  obligations.  Where  grounds  of viability  can be 
demonstrated to justify a downward adjustment to the planning obligation requirement, the Council 
will liaise with the relevant service providers to determine whether any a lternative, less costly, 
approach can be taken to render the proposal acceptable in planning terms. The Council will also 
give consideration to the proportion of affordable housing required, having regard to policy H2 6, 
where a deferred contribution requir ement will be applied to any reduced level of  provision.  
 Where a development proposal cannot be made acceptable in planning terms through the use  of 
planning conditions, planning obligations, or through the expenditure of available Community 
Infrastructure  Levy contributions, the Council will refuse  development.  
  
 
237 Policy IMP3: Phasing of Development  
Policy Context  
 Development phasing can be driven by the commercial interests of the developer, who may only 
wish to bring a certain proportion of any new development to the market at a time. Alternatively, it 
could be driven by planning requirements , such as conditions or agreements, if they are considered 
necessary to make development acceptable in planning terms . Such conditions or agreements may 
bring ab out the need to phase development in order to provide protection or mitigation to the 
environment, or to deliver the infrastructure needed to make development acceptable. The PPG 
states that where the circumstances of the application make this  necessary  and the six tests  will be 
met, conditions  can be imposed  to ensure  that development proceeds in a certain  sequence.  
Conditions  may also be used to  ensure that  a particular  element in a scheme is provided by/at a 
particular stage, or before the scheme is brought into  use. 
Evidence Base  
 Allocation policies set out in the earlier sections of this plan, in particular in chapters 7, 8 and 11, 
identify the need for infrastructure to be delivered alongside new development, and for various 
measures to be taken to  ensure that environmental harm is limited. These allocations, and their 
associated requirements have been informed by a substantive evidence base, as described in 
each case. It will be necessary for these allocations to be delivered in a manner which ensu res that 
environmental mitigation measures and infrastructure requirements are secured alongside new 
homes and commercial development. However, it is recognised that any new development, 
particularly on larger sites, will be delivered over a number of year s, and therefore the need for 
environmental mitigation and infrastructure may be affected by the part of the site under 
development,  and the need  for infrastructure  may also be affected  by the quantum  of development 
that has occurred. In such cases develop ment phasing will be used to ensure that the  necessary 
environmental  mitigation  and infrastructure  requirements  to support  development  are delivered  at 
the right  time.  
 There  may be proposals  outside  the allocations  identified  within  chapters  7, 8 and 11 where  larger 
scale development is permitted in accordance with the policies within this plan, and requires 
environmental  mitigation  and/or  additional  infrastructure  provision.  An example  may be a proposal for 
regeneration of previously developed land in th e existing urban area. The need for phasing  of 
development to ensure that growth is supported by appropriate environmental mitigation and 
infrastructure will be considered on a case by case basis in respect of such  proposals.  
 Most proposals for housing development will be required to provide a proportion of affordable 
housing alongside market housing in accordance with policy H2 6. On larger sites, where it is 
proposed  that new housing  will be delivered  in a number  of phases,  it is expected  that the requi red 
proportion of affordable housing will delivered as part of each phase. Any variance from this 
requirement  must  be fully justified  by the need  for infrastructure  and/or  the layout  of development 
which  may affect  such  phasing  in the early  stages  of development,  i.e. where  the access  road and 
homes lining this road are being constructed. The Council will however seek to avoid phasing 
arrangements  that leave  the delivery  of affordable  housing  requirements  until later phases,  as the 
provision of afforda ble housing is essential to the creation of sustainable  communities.  
Policy IMP 3 
Phasing of Development  
 In order  to ensure  that environmental  mitigation  measures  are secured  in a timely  manner,  and that 
growth  is supported  by appropriate  infrastructure  provision,  the Council  will, in appropriate  cases , use 
planning conditions, or if necessary planning agreements, to limit the quantum of development  that 
may be delivered on a development site before such measures have been delivered and/or set out 
the seq uencing of development.  
 Where possible, the Council will seek to negotiate any phasing requirements with the developer in 
order to ensure that the cost implications of any such phasing are taken into account. However, 
phasing arrangements which would resul t in unmitigated harm to the environment, or would see 
infrastructure capacity exceeded or community infrastructure needs unmet will not be  accepted.   
 
238 
 Affordable  housing  provision  should  normally  reflect  the requirement  of policy  H26 within  each  phase 
of development.  Variations  to this phasing  requirement  will be accepted  only where  it can be justified 
as a consequence of the need for infrastructure and/or the layout of  development.  
 
Policy IMP4: Piecemeal Development  
Policy Context  
 The NPPF  expects local planning authorities to boost significantly the supply of land  for housing.  In 
fulfilling  this responsibility  it would  be inappropriate  for local planning  authorities to permit 
development which blocks development on land which would otherwi se be suitable for 
development,  and/or  makes  inefficient  use of land.  The NPPF  is clear  that the efficient  use of land is 
expected. In an area such as Basildon Borough where a significant quantum of land is designated 
as Green Belt, the efficient use of land enables more land to be retained within the Green Belt 
whilst ensuring that the needs for sustainable development are  met. 
Evidence Base  
 The allocation policies set out in the earlier sections of this plan, in particular in chapters 7, 8 and 
11, ident ify the growth requirements of each site, and specific infrastructure required to 
accommodate that level of growth. The evidence base for these allocations, and the associated 
requirements  for infrastructure  are detailed  alongside  those  policies.  It is however recognised,  and 
evidenced through the HELAA  that most of these allocations are in multiple ownership, and 
consequently parcels of land within them may be brought forward at different stages by different 
developers.  Individually,  these  development  proposals  may not give rise to the specific  infrastructure 
requirements  identified  in the allocation  policy,  but cumulatively,  development  within  that allocation  
will generate the demand for infrastructure identified. It is therefore necessary that where an 
allocated site is brought forward in a piecemeal manner, each development  makes a proportional 
contribution towards the infrastructure requirements of that allo cation, with consideration given to 
both the need for funding and the need for land within the site to meet infrastructure requirements.  
 Piecemeal development may also affect the ability of land to be used in an efficient manner. For 
example,  the developme nt of a site without  consideration  of the development  of adjacent  land may 
result  in landlocking.  A comprehensive  approach  to development  is therefore  preferred.  However, 
where this cannot be achieved, reasonable opportunities should be provided within the  layout of 
development to provide access to the adjacent land, and for that access to be used unimpeded by 
legal complications which may prevent the delivery of  development.  
Policy IMP4  
Piecemeal Development  
The Council's preference is for allocated develo pment sites to be brought forward in a comprehensive manner.  
However,  it is recognised  that there  are circumstances  where  this will not be achieved.  Proposals for  the partial  
development  of an allocated  development  site will be accepted,  subject  to compliance  with all other relevant 
policies of this plan,  where:  
a. A proportional  contribution  towards  the infrastructure  requirements  of the allocation  has 
been  made in terms of the need for funding, and the need for any land or for any on -site 
facilities;  and 
b. Reasonable  arrangements  have  been  made  through  the layout  of the development  to 
provide  access to adjoining land identified for development purposes, and no legal 
impediments have been put in place which prevent access to the adjoining land or its  
development. 
 
239 Glossary  
 
Relevant  
Abbreviation  Term  Definition  
- Affordable Housing  Social  rented,  affordable  rented  and intermediate  housing and 
Starter Homes,  provided to eligible households whose needs are 
not met by the  market. Eli gibility  is determined  with regard  to local 
incomes  and local house prices. Affordable housing should 
include provisions to remain at an affordable price for future 
eligible households or for the  subsidy to be recycled for 
alternative affordable housing  provision.  
 
Social rented housing is owned by local authorities and private 
registered providers (as defined in section 80 of the Housing 
and Regeneration Act 2008 ), for which guideline target rents are 
determined through the national rent regime. It may a lso be 
owned by other persons and provided under equivalent rental 
arrangements to the above, as agreed with the local authority or 
with the Homes and Communities Agency.  
 
Affordable rented housing is let by local authorities or private 
registered  providers  of social  housing  to households  who are 
eligible for social rented  housing.  
 
Affordable Rent is subject to rent controls that require a rent of 
no more  than 80% of the local market  rent (including  service  
charges, where  applicable).  
 
Intermediate  housing is homes for sale and rent provided at a  
cost above social rent, but below market levels subject to the 
criteria in the  Affordable  Housing  definition  above.  These  can 
include  shared equity (shared ownership and equity loans), 
other low cost homes for sale and intermediate rent, but not 
affordable rented  housing.  
 
Starter homes are new dwellings available to first time buyers 
between the ages of 23 and 40 years of age. Starter homes are 
to be sold at a discount of at least 20% of the market value an d 
always for less than £250,000 outside of Greater London (and 
£450,000 in Greater London).  
 
The National  Planning  Policy  Framework  states  that homes  that 
do not meet the above definition of affordable housing, such as 
“low cost  market”  housing,  may not be considered  as affordable  
housing for planning  purposes.  
- Allocation  An allocation is a proposal for land for housing, industry or other 
uses within a Local Plan that identifies a specific area of land to 
be developed within the time period of the plan.  
- Ancient woodland  Ancient woodland is an area that has been wooded continuously 
since at least 1600 AD. Ancient woodlands are of prime 
ecological and landscape importance. Many rare and threatened 
species are associated with this habitat. Furthermore rel atively 
undisturbed woodland often contains features of historical, 
archaeological and landscape importance.   
 
240 AMR  Annual Monitoring 
Report/Authority's 
Monitoring Report  An Annual  Monitoring  Report  (AMR)  is a legal requirement  to 
monitor various indicators of the Local Planning Authority in 
relation to preparing the Local Plan and planning decisions in 
the Borough.  
Section  35 of the Planning  and Compulsory  Purchase  Act 2004  
(as amended)  requires every Local Planning Authority to 
prepare an annual report on t he implementation of the Local 
Development Scheme and the extent to which local planning 
policies are being achieved. This is known as an Authority's 
Monitoring Report or AMR, prior to the Localism Act 2011  it was 
known as an Annual Monitoring Report, or  AMR. 
- Areas of Special 
Reserve  The Basildon District Local Plan 1998  identified two 'Areas of 
'Special  Reserve'  on the edge  of the urban  settlements  of 
Basildon and Wickford. The purpose of these areas was to meet 
the need for housing beyond the end of th at plan's period. The 
Housing elements  of that plan only ran to 2001,  and consequently  
proposals have since come forward for these sites in the 
intervening years. There  is further  capacity  for more  homes  
within  the Area  of Special Reserve in these locations, not subject 
to planning consent which have been reconsidered as part of 
this plan.  
- Biodiversity  The variety of life on earth embracing all species, communities, 
habitats  and ecosystems  associated  with the terrestrial,  aquatic  
and marine environments. Usually the term refers to the variety 
of species within a specified  area.  
BAP Biodiversity Action

Land Register) Regulations 2017 . 
- Building 
Regulations  Building Regulations  define what qualifies as ‘building work’ and 
there fore what falls under the control of the regulations. It covers 
what types of buildings are exempt (such as temporary 
buildings) and  the notification  procedures  that must  be followed  
when  starting, carrying out, and completing building work as well 
as the requirements  for specific  aspects  of building  design  and 
construction.  
- Carbon sink  A carbon  sink is anything  that absorbs  more  carbon  that it 
releases.  
- Climate Change  Long -term changes  in temperature,  precipitation,  wind and all 
other aspects  of the Earth's  climate.  Often  regarded  as a result  of 
human activity and fossil fuel  consumption.   
 
241 CHP  Combined Heat 
and Power  Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is the simultaneous 
generation of usable heat and power (usually electricity) in a 
single process. The heat generated during this process is 
supplied to an appropriately matched heat demand that would 
otherwise be met by a conventional boiler. CHP systems are 
highly efficient, making use of the heat which would otherwise 
be wasted when generating electrical  or mechanical power. This 
allows heat requirements to be met that would otherwise require 
additional fuel to be burnt. A CHP plant can be run on fossil or 
renewable fuels.  
CIL Community

CPO  Compulsory 
Purchase Order  Allows certain bodies which need to obtain l and or property to 
do so  without  the consent  of the owner.  It may be enforced  if a

for example, when building motorways on land the owner does 
not want to sell. Most CPOs are made under powers given to 
local authorities.

Practice Guidance (PPG) requires every Local Planning 
Authority to assess the amount of land that is available for 
housing and economic development in its area. This process is 
known as the Housing  and Economic  Land  Availability  
Assessment  (HELAA).  The HELAA helps to identify future 
sources of land for housing and economic development to help  
meet the Borough's future development needs. It was previously

wildlife.  
- Low Carbon 
Energy  Low carbon  energy  more  broadly  includes  other  energy  forms  
which whilst  are not strictly  ‘renewable’,  are associated  with a 
lower  carbon output per unit than traditional fossil fuel s, e.g. 
District -heating or combined heat and power (CHP). Often this is 
because the heat generated from other processes is a by -
product which is utilised – meaning the overall carbon output per 
unit of energy is  reduced.

developed by Merton Council, which required new 
developments to generate at least 10% of their energy needs 
from on -site renewable energy equipment, in order to help 
reduce annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the built 
environment. The rule applied to all types of buildings, not just 
homes. Merton Council developed the rule and adopted it  in 
2003. Since then the Mayor of London and many councils 
implemented it, and it became part of national planning 
guidance.

development plans  and when considering planning applications  
- Natura 2000 Sites  In May 1992 European Union governments adopted legislation 
designed to protect the most seriously thre atened habitats and 
species across Europe. This legislation is called the Habitats 
Directive and complements the Birds Directive  adopted in 1979. 
At the heart of both these Directives is the creation of a network 
of sites called Natura 2000. The Birds Dire ctive requires the 
establishment of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for birds. The 
Habitats Directive  similarly requires Special Areas of 
Conservation (SACs) to be designated for other species, and for 
habitats.  
Together, SPAs and SACs make up the Natura 2 000 series.

smallholdings, buildings small shacks and dwellings they could 
visit a t weekends and for holidays to escape East  London.  
Following  the Second  World  War, many  people  moved to  these  
areas  on a permanent  basis  despite  the majority  not having 
running water, electricity or  fuel connections. The majority of 
Plotlands were cleared during the building of Basildon New 
Town in the mid -late 20th Century, however, thirteen remain and 
are home to about 2000 people.

most sustainable  strategic  areas  for future  development  and 
include  urban extensions,  town  centre  regeneration  areas,  
important  locations  for employment and an area of 
environmental  significance.  
- Pollution  Anything that affects the quality of land, air, water or soils, which 
might lead to an adverse impact on human health, the natural 
environment or general amenity. Pollution can arise from a 
range of emissions, including smoke, fumes, gases, dust, 
steam, odour, noise and light.  
- Primary Shopping

(generally comprising the primary and those secondary 
frontages which are adjoining and closely related to the primary

249 - Primary and 
Secondary 
Frontages  Primary frontages are likely  to include a high proportion of retail

goods. Secondary  frontages  provide  greater  opportunities  for a 
diversity  of uses such as restaurants, cinemas and  businesses.  
- Priority Habitats

England Biodiversity List published by the Secretary of State 
under section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities Act 2006.

- Retail Impact 
Assessment  An assessment  undertaken  for an application  for retail  use 
(normally on developments over 2,500 square metres gross 
floorspace, but  they may occasionally  be necessary  for smaller  
developments,  such as those likely to have a significant impact 
on smaller centres) on the impact of the proposal on the vitality 
and viability of existing centres within the catchment area of the 
proposed de velopment. The assessment includes the likely 
cumulative effect of recent permissions, developments under 
construction and completed developments.  
- Rural Enterprise 
Sites  Smaller rural employment sites located within the Green Belt 
already providing part of the Borough's employment land supply. 
Generally these sites are not planned for employment purposes, 
and do not offer the levels of premise quality and accessibility

can continu e to contribute towards supply, but they too may 
need to be adapted, improved or replaced over the plan  period  
to meet  occupiers'  needs,  and continue  to provide  local people 
with rural employment opportunities during the plan  period.  
- Scheduled 
Monument  'Scheduling' is shorthand for the process through which

SSSI  Site of Special 
Scientific Interest  SSSI's are the country's very best wildlife and geographical 
sites. There  are over 4,000  Sites  of Special  Scientific  Interest  in

these  sites by area are internationally important for their wildlife, 
and are also designated as Special Areas of Conservation, 
Special Protection Areas or Ramsar  sites.  
Solar PV  Solar Photovoltaics  Solar panels covered with cells to convert sunlight into electricity

Open Space Standards  
 
The Open Space Standards provide a simple transparent and robust view of the needs  of the Borough  in 
regards  to the accessibility,  quality  and quantity  of open  space.  These  standards  have been summarised below, 
however the full version of the study, which gives further detail of  the standards, is contained within the PPG17 
Open Space Assessment Part I, March 2010 and Part II (2011) is available on  www.basildon.gov.uk.  
Accessibility Standards  
People  living  and working  in Basildon  Borough  should  not have  to travel  more  than 400m  to reach  at least one 
of the following accessible  typologies:  
 Urban Parks and Gardens (including Country Parks)  
 Natural or Semi -Natural Green Space  
 Amenity Green Space  
This is approximat ely a 6 minute walk . 
In addition, people living and working in Basildon Borough should not have to travel more than 2km to reach the 
following typologies:  
 Urban Park and Gardens (including Country Parks) Natural or Semi -Natural Green Space  
 Outdoor Sports F acilities  
 Allotments and Community Gardens  
Quality Standards  
Open Spaces should be improved and enhanced to meet the Quality Vision where possible.  
With the exception of Urban Parks and Gardens and Civic Spaces, each open space should achieve a 
minimum score of 50% (a higher -reasonable rating), or at least maintain the rating as determined in the PPG17 
Open Space Assessment Part I document, whichever is the higher.  
Urban Parks and Gardens and Civic Spaces, due to their more extensive use and range of functions, should 
achieve a minimum quality score of 60% (a 'good' rating), or at least maintain the rating as determined in the 
PPG17 Open Space Assessme nt Part I document, whichever is the higher.  
New open spaces, defined as those not included in the 2007 audit, will be expected to achieve a 'good' quality  
rating  as determined  in the PPG17  Open  Space  Assessment  Part I document  and shall be maintained to this 
standard for a minimum of 20 years. Good urban design principles should be used to inform the layout of new 
open  space.  
Spaces scoring less than 50%, as determined by the PPG17 Open Space Assessment Part I document, should  
be considered  for improvemen t and enhancement  as identified  through  the Council's  quality  audit to meet the 
demands of  stakeholders.  
Quantity  Standards  
A minimum  of 5.7ha  of accessible  open  space  should  be available  per 1,000  population  of each  settlement area in 
the following  proportions:  
 2.6ha of Natural Green Space  
 3.1ha of Urban Park and Garden (including Country Parks) or Amenity Green  Space  
 An appropriate level of outdoor sports provision should be available per 1,000 population 
of each settlement area (which has been informed by the PPG17 Playing Pitch  
 
267 Assessment ) 
FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT IN URBAN AREAS  
New development  in urban  areas  should  contribute  a minimum  of 46m2 of accessible  open  space  in the following 
proportions, calculated by projected occupancy and the number of new net residential units, having considered 
the specific requirements of the settlement area and subject to the following  criteria:  
 21m2 of Natural and Semi -Natural Green Space  
 25m2 of Urban Park and Garden (including Country Parks) or Amenity Green Space, and  
a. For development  that would  achieve  the applicable  Accessibility  Standard  to open  space,  
without the  need  for new on site provision,  contribution  will be required  to enhance  the 
Quality  Standard  of open spaces in the vicinity and/or making improvements to the  links 
between them and the development  site. 
b. For development sites of 1ha or greater, that do not met the Accessibility Standard, new  
open space provision will need to be made on site and integrated in to the development's 
layout and design, so long as its size can be equal to or greater than  0.1ha.  
c. Where  new on-site open  space  provision  would  otherwise  be smaller  than 0.1ha  (and 
therefore discouraged) equivalent contributions for the enhancement of open spaces in 
the vicinity will be required.  
FOR NEW D EVELOPMENTS OUTSIDE URBAN AREAS  
New development  outside  of the urban  boundary  will contribute  to the provision  of open  space  in line with the 
expected standards, having taken account of the specific needs and priorities of the settlement  area. This will be  
based on the following  criteria:  
 26m2 of Natural and Semi -Natural and Semi -Natural Green Space  
 31m2 of Urban Park and Garden (including Country Park) or Amenity Green Space.  
Each  of these  standards  cannot be read in isolation  and must  be balanced  with the other  standards given in the 
PPG17 Open Space Assessment Part  I. 
Indoor Sports and Recreational Standards  
 
The tables below outline the projected requirements of indoor sport and recreation facilities requirements  for the 
Borough.  The assumptions  and details  of the results  displayed  below  can be found within the Basildon Borough

Outdoor Bowls  
No specific  figures  have  been  provided,  however  it is noted  that Basildon  Borough  has an ageing demographic 
and the demand for bowls facilities may  increase.

future blue and green infrastructure should be 
explored.  
Local P rinciple 9  DESIGN TO BE 
MAINTAINABLE  Consideration should be given to ease of access 
and waste generation when designing SuDS.  
Local Principle 10  USE A PRECAUTIONARY 
APPROACH  Precautions should be taken in SuDS design to 
ensure their efficient functioning  at all times.  
Local Principle 11  HAVE REGARD TO THE 
HISTORIC  ENVIRONMENT  SuDS design and construction should be sensitive 
and complementary to Essex’s heritage.  
Local Principle 12  SHOW ATTENTION TO 
DETAIL  SuDS must be carefully designed using attention 
to detail to ensure they function as intended.  
Local SuDS Design Standards  
 
Number   Title  Standard  
Local 
Standard 1  DESIGN FOR 
WATER 
QUANTITY  SuDS must be designed to ensure that development and 
occupants are protected  from flooding,  and that off-site flood  risk is 
not increased.  Where possible SuDS should aim to reduce the 
overall risk of flooding off -site and drain via infiltration as a 
preference in accordance with the drainage hierarchy  contained  in 
Approved  Document  H of the Building  Regulations.  
  
 
289 Number   Title  Standard  
Runoff Rate  
 
Unlike  developed  areas,  greenfield  sites generally  produce  no 
measurable runoff during small rainfall events (up to 5mm). 
Receiving streams and rivers are likely to be under greater stress 
during summer months, with lower available dilution le vels 
reducing their capacity to accommodate polluted  inflow.  In order  to 
mitigate  against  this, SuDS  should  be designed so  that runoff  does  
not occur  for the first 5mm  of any rainfall  event  for 80% of summer 
events and 50% of winter  events  
 
In all cases, including on brownfield sites, runoff should where 
possible be restricted to the greenfield 1 in 1 year runoff rate during 
all events up to and including the 1 in 100 year rainfall event with 
climate change. If it is deemed that this is not a chievable, evidence 
must be provided and developers  should  still seek to achieve  no 
increase  in runoff  from greenfield sites and a 50% betterment of 
existing run off rates on brownfield sites (provided this does not 
result in a runoff rate less than greenf ield). If a Surface  Water  
Management  Plan has been  produced  for the area,  it may set out 
further advice on allowable runoff  rates.  
 
Storage Volume  
 
When planning the layout of SuDS, sites should take into account 
topography  and make  best use of low points  for storage.  For rainfall  
events with a return -period up to and including the 1 in 100 year 
rainfall event with  an allowance  for climate  change  SuDS  should  be 
sized  to contain  all surface water volumes. Applications should 
demonstrate how this will  be achieved, unless otherwise planned 
and approved by the LLFA SuDs Team. However, if this is not 
possible, drainage designers must demonstrate how additional 
flows will be  managed.  
 
Unless  sufficient  pre-treatment  has been  provided,  certain  SuDS  
features may require the incorporation of a sediment forebay to 
capture  sediment to ensure the feature doesn’t silt up and that 
maintenance activities for sediment removal can be more easily 
undertaken. Sediment forebays should provide an additional 10% 
attenuation  volume to allow for a level of silting up to ensure this 
doesn’t result in a reduction to the available storage  volume.  
 
Safe conveyance routes and overflow flood storage areas must be 
established and agreed with the SuDs Team for the 1 in 100 year 
rainfa ll event with 30% allowance for climate change before 
adoption.  
 
If runoff cannot be restricted to the greenfield 1 in 1 year event for 
all events  we would  expect  Long  Term  Storage  to be provided  to 
achieve  the same  result.  The runoff  volume  should  be calculated  
from all areas  of the site,  including  those  remaining  permeable,  as 
they will be subject  to climate change which may result in 
measurable runoff. The aim of long term storage is to ensure that 
any volumes leaving the site above the greenfield ru noff volume  
290 Number   Title  Standard  
discharge at 2l/s/ha.  
Local 
Standard 2  DESIGN FOR 
WATER QUALITY  The level of pollution found within surface water runoff will depend 
on the nature of the development from which it arises, the time 
since the last rainfall event and the duration  and intensity of rainfall.  
An appropriate ‘train’ of SuDS components must be installed to 
reduce the risk of pollutants entering watercourses via runoff from 
developed sites. Following the SuDS Management Train hierarchy 
a series of drainage techniques sh ould be designed into the 
development layout. The design should achieve a system where 
pollution is incrementally reduced at each stage. Treatment options 
to address pollution issues include:  
 Infiltration  
 Filtration  
 Detention basins/ponds  
 Permanent ponds.  
These options reduce pollution by either filtering out pollutants or 
reducing flow rates to encourage deposition of any contaminants. 
Polluted surface water runoff should not run directly into permanent 
ponds in order to protect biodiversity and amenity, a nd to prevent 
maintenance problems caused by heavy silts and oil.  
The number of treatment stages required within the SuDS train will 
depend on the nature of the site.  
Source  of Runoff  Treatment  Stages  
Roofs, playing fields  1 
Residential roads, parking areas, 
commercial zones  2 
Waste and industrial sites, loadings bays 
and HGV parks  3 or more  
 
Before adopting SuDS it must be demonstrated that the proposed 
scheme has followed the SuDS Management Train hierarchy and 
includes the appropriate number of treatment stages.
