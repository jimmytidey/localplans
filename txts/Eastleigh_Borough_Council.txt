Local Plan – Foreword  
Councillor Keith House, Leader, Eastleigh Borough Council  
Eastleigh Borough’s Local Plan 2016- 36 is the fruit of years of painstaking work and extensive consultation 
with our communities and stakeholders. Its adoption means that we can confidently take forward our vision 
of meeting the Borough’s long- term housing needs in a strategic and sustainable way. Our Local Plan will 
ensure that we deliver  the right homes in the right places, while protecting green gaps between 
communities, and providing necessary transport and other infrastructure.  
Changes in the way we live mean that more homes are required to meet the needs of our existing population – and national planning policy dictates that every local authority must plan for housing growth of 
all types in their area. Our Local Plan reflects Eastleigh’s proactive and sustainable approach to anticipating 
these needs and delivering much -needed and high quality homes.  
The Local Plan is underpinned by the Council’s corporate aims and our over -arching mission of supporting 
communities and improving lives. We want to ensure that any development promotes a prosperous local 
economy; that it grows thriving and healthy communities; that the standard of living for residents increases; 
that the distinct identity of our towns and villages is protected, that congestion is minimised, and that green 
space and biodiversity are preserved.  
As well as new homes, the Local Plan also ensures that other needs are planned for -  such as land for jobs; 
community facilities, including schools, healthcare and leisure facilities; open space for sport, recreation and 
nature conservation, and support for our towns and local centres.   
The Local Plan is a vitally important document for shaping the Borough as a place. We now have up- to-date 
development plan against which future planning applications will be determined.  
I would like to thank everyone who helped shape the plan –  both the Council team and external advisers, 
whose expertise and commitment have been core to its delivery, and to the many residents and 
organisations who took part in the wide- ranging consultation process. Your contribution has been crucial to 
the final adoption of this blueprint that will guide development in Eastleigh Borough over the next decade 
and beyond.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Chapter 1: Introduction  
 
What is this about? 
1.1 This is the new Local Plan for Eastleigh Borough. This plan sets out the policies and plans 
to guide future development to 2036.  It identifies how much development is required and 
key locations for this development , the infrastructure and services needed to support new 
and existing communities and areas which will be protected from development .      
 
How does this fit with the Corporate Plan? 
1.2 The Local Plan sets out the approach to development in Eastleigh. It reflects the Council ’s 
strategy1 and the Borough Council’s corporate priorities are of particular significance in 
providing a basis for the plan. The Council has three strategic priorities, which are:  
 
A Green Borough : tackling congestion; d eveloping green 
infrastructure; an excellent environment for all; and m inimising waste and 
managing resources  
 
 
A Healthy Community : enabling healthier lifestyles/wellbeing; and 
tackling deprivation 
 
A Prosperous Place:  increased provision and more diverse mix of 
housing; ensuring appropriate infrastructure including employment land; 
enabling the right skills and employment mix; and r einvigorating town and 
local centres  
 
1.3 These priorities have been used as the basis for the vision, objectives and policies 
included in this Local Plan.   
 
1.4 The plan replaces all the saved policies of the Eastleigh Borough Local Plan Review (2001 -  
2011)  as set out in Appendix A .  It makes provision for future needs in the Borough up to 
2036.  
 
1.5 There are currently no adopted neighbourhood plans in the Borough . Any future 
neighbourhood plans will form part of the statutory development plan when they are adopted 
and will be used to assess planning applications. They can set out policies about the development and use of land in an area  and guide development  and must be in general 
conformity with the strategic policies in this Local Plan.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  How to use this document 
1.6  The rest of this document is organised as follows:  
 
Chapter 2: Eastleigh Borough –  characteristics and issues  
 
1.7 This sets out a brief portrait of the Borough , summarised from surveys and studies of the 
Borough and its communities, along with the key issues that the plan addresses  and the 
Borough’s environmental capacity .  More details on the issues are  set out in the Sustainability 
Appraisal (SA) Report and a series of background documents and studies (our evidence base) 
which are available on our website www.eastleigh.gov.uk/localplan . 
 
Chapter 3: Vision , Objectives  and Strategy for new development  
 
1.8 We have then considered what sort of Borough we would like –  our vision – and identified a 
number of objectives that will help us achieve this vision and deal with the issues we have 
found.  In order to address the issues, help to achieve the vision and mee t the objectives, and 
having looked at the options for locating new development, we have put together a strategy 
for future development in the Borough .  
 
Chapter 4: Strateg ic policies  
 
1.9 The plan sets out broad strategic policies. These provide a spatial  strategy for the Borough 
including the approach of new housing development and policies on infrastructure . The 
spatial  strategy is illustrated on a ‘key diagram’  on page 52. 
 
Chapter 5: Development Management Policies  
 
1.10 The plan also covers a range of other factors that affect how people and communities 
use land and buildings to help them get on with their lives. This C hapter sets out the 
policies the Council will use when dealing with proposals for development and other 
activities that need planning permission (development management).  
 
Chapter 6: Local Areas : Parish by parish policies and proposals  
 
1.11 The strategy needs to be put into effect by making development allocations.  This chapter 
explains where and what these are on a Local Area and parish by parish basis,  recognising also 
some detailed local issues that need to be addressed in each  of these areas.  
 
Chapter 7: Monitoring and Review  
 
 1.12 When establishing a strategy and proposals for the Borough, we have to think about how 
and when they can be brought into effect. We also need to consider how we can monitor 
what is happening and see whether the strategy is working.  Appendix C includes a 
monitoring framework to explain how the Council will check the progress and effects of the 
plan, the Council has also produced a housing trajectory and an employment land 
schedule to set out when the plan’s proposals will be implemented.

 1.13 Finally,  the policies map sets out the Council’s policies and proposals for future development 
in the Borough on an Ordnance Survey map base, so you can see exactly where development 
is proposed, and what areas are protected from development.  This update s information such 
as the urban area and revised settlement  gaps boundaries.  
 
References  
 
 1.14  Throughout  the document there are references to other strategies and plans that are related 
to the Local Plan. These are listed in Appendix B , with links to the web sites where they can 
be found  and in footnotes at the bottom of the page. A Glossary is als o included after 
Appendix C to help provide an explanation of a number of definitions and terms which are 
referenced within the plan.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Chapter 2: Eastleigh Borough – characteristics  and issues  
 
2.1 This Chapter summarises the main characteristics of the Borough , including any 
major constraints on development, and local needs.  Full details of these are set out 
in the Sustainability Appraisal Report and background papers. T his Chapter also 
confirms the main issues that the Local Plan seeks to address.   
 
2.2 Following a general introduction, the information and issues are divided into three 
broad sections that reflect the Council’s corporate priorities as set out  in Chapter  1. 
These are reordered to reflect the  role of the Local Plan in delivering these 
priorities: a prosperous place, a green Borough, and a healthy community.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  General overview 
2.3 Eastleigh Borough adjoins the eastern and northern boundaries of the city of 
Southampton, bordering Test Valley borough to the north- west, Winchester district 
and the South Downs National Park to the north, Fareham borough  to the east 
(with a shared boundary along the River Hamble and its estuary) and New Forest 
district to the south -west via a shared boundary in Southampton Water (see Figure 
1 above).  
 
2.4 The main town in the Borough is Eastleigh.  The Borough includes two other large urban 
areas – Chandler’s Ford and Hedge End –  and some sizeable settlements at Bishopstoke, 
Fair Oak, Horton Heath, West End, Bursledon, Botley, Hamble and Netley.  The Borough 
has an area of  79.8 sq. km.  It is predominantly suburban in character, reflecting many of 
the pressures that might be expected in a location bordering a major city, but it retains some 
areas of countryside that are locally significant, mainly because of the separation they 
provide between settlements, but also because of their biodiversity and landscape 
characteristics.  
 
2.5 Significant features of the Borough include internationally renowned sailing venues on the River 
Hamble, a national and international cricketing venue at the Ageas Bowl (formerly the Rose 
Bowl), Southampton Airport, dance and music venues of regional significance at The Point and 
the Concorde Club in Eastleigh, Places Leisure Eastleigh, The Berry Theatre at Hedge End, 
and an important maritime, rail and air heritage.  
 
2.6 For administrative purposes, the Borough is divided into five Local Areas , each with its own 
particular characteristics and issues.  Each area has a Local Area Committee that has been given devolved powers on many issues and which determines planning appli cations.  There 
are 12  civil parishes  including the recently created parishes of Boyatt Wood and Eastleigh.  
 
2.7 The Borough Council has joined with neighbouring authorities to form the Partnership for South 
Hampshire (P fSH)2, which is focused on the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth and their 
hinterlands, and seeks to encourage the economic growth of the sub -region. In 2016 PfSH  
compl eted a Spatial Position  Statement.  This is a non- statutory document which provides 
evidenc e of meeting the statutory duty to co -operate.  A variety of other strategies have also 
been produced.  The P fSH strategies have informed new plans across the sub- region including 
Eastleigh and are referenced as necessary in this Local Plan.  
 
 
A prosperous place – housing, skills and employment mix, 
infrastructure and town and local centres  
2.8 Most of the existing housing stock in the Borough  is located in the parishes of Chandler ’s Ford 
and Hedge End and in Eastleigh. Across the Borough the most common dwelling type i s 
detached houses and bungalows (over one third of all properties according to the 2011 
census) with three bedroom houses the most prevalent type in the Borough . This is reflected 
in an average population density of 15.7 people per hectare (2011 census), in comparison 
with 47.5 in Southampton and 15 in Far eham.  
 
2.9 The 2011 census reported that only 35% of the housing stock was made up of one and two 
 
2 PfSH is a par tnership of the unitar y authorities of Por tsmouth and Southampton, Hampshire County Council (HCC) and district/Borough authorities 
of Eastleigh, East Hampshire, Fareham, Gospor t, Havant, New Forest district, New Forest National Park Authority, Test Valley and W inchester .    
9 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  bedroom dwellings. Since 2011 however , 47% of market dwellings and 69% of affordable 
dwellings built were either two bedroom s or less.   
 
2.10 A major challenge for the Borough is accommodating a significant increase in new housing to 
meet housing needs. New housing is needed to serve the Borough’s population and also to 
assist in meeting the wider needs of the sub -region of which the Borough  forms a part. A total 
of 14,580 dwellings are required to meet needs in Eastleigh Borough in the period 2016 -36. 
This level of housing, in combination with planned supply in the other local authorities that 
form the Southampton Housing Market Area, is in accordance with the existing P fSH South 
Hampshire Spatial Position Statement  (2016) , a non -statutory document providing evidence of 
meeting the statutory duty  to co -operate . 
 
2.11 Again in common with many other places, there is a significant need for affordable 
dwellings in the Borough .  In 2016, house prices in Eastleigh were 9.3 times the annual 
earnings, up from 8.0 times in 20113.  The Council ’s Housing Register is managed through 
Hampshire Homechoice. In 2016 there were 1,890 households registered  who could not 
afford to buy or rent a property in the private sector , of which 1,690 households (90%) were 
in the ‘reasonable preference’ category as they fall into a specific category of housing need. 
This figure has remained consistent in recent years (see 2017 ORS Affordable Housing 
Assessment).  
 
2.12 The Borough’s economy is linked inextricably to that of south Hampshire, and it is influenced 
by a variety of sub -regional factors including the proximity of the port of Southampton, the 
motorway and rail network and the airport. The Borough lies wholly within the area covered by 
the Partnership for South Hampshire (P fSH), and the Borough Council is fully committed to 
the P fSH Economic  Development Strategy which seeks to promote economic growth in the 
sub-region.  The Borough is also si ted within the Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) 
area. The Solent LEP measur es economic performance against other Councils within their 
boundary. The Council  maintains contact with this body in terms of major infrastructure 
projects, skills and gov ernment grants.  
 
2.13 The Borough is relatively prosperous,  the third most prosperous economy in the Solent 
LEP with over 6,200 business unit s4 employing approximately 62,200 people (source: ONS 
business register and employment survey).  It has around 1,100,000 sq.m of employment 
floorspace .  Of this, the majority of floorspace is in the form of factories and warehousing 
reflecting the Borough’s industrial heritage, although relatively large amounts of office, factory and warehousing floorspace have been developed in modern times (since 1990).  
The most extensive industrial areas are at Eastleigh, Chandler’s Ford, Hedge End and Hamble . In 2014 Eastleigh generated over £3.5 billion of goods and services (GVA)
5. 
 
2.14 When compared to the national picture, there is an above- average number of construction, 
professional, scientific  and technical and transport  and storage companies operating within 
the Borough .  The Borough continues to have a ‘ high value hi gh growth’  engineering sector 
and has been ac tive in supporting environmental technology businesses through the Future 
Solent partnership. In the past, there has been a relatively high rate of business formation 
and although this slowed, in line with national trends, with the financial crisis of 2007/8, 
established businesses have proved to be quite resilient compared to those in other areas.  
The Borough Council is active in supporting and promoting the creation of new businesses,

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  e.g. through its operation at Wesse x House in Eastleigh providing business space  for over 
80 companies and a TEC HUB for emerging creative and high tech start ups . 
 
2.15 The Borough retains its historic association with the marine, aviation and rail industries. 
However, the Borough also includes a wide variety of other industries, including high- tech 
computer enterprises and office headquarters.  Eastleigh has four sectors that have a 
higher local share than the national average –  distribution , construction, information and 
communication,  and manufacturing6.  Over half of the business units in Eastleigh are in the 
distribution or construction sectors . 
 
2.16 Economic activity rates are high, with 82% employment compared to 76.1% in the Solent 
LEP and 73.7 % nationally7.  However, the levels of in - (32,500)  and out- (34,000)  
commuting suggest a possible mismatch between the jobs available in the Borough 
(tending towards lower skill and pay levels) and those of the resident population.  The 
Borough is a net exporter of professional and technical (Level 4 qualified) residents.  
 
2.17 Development pressures have led to the loss of significant areas of employment land, 
particularly in Eastleigh.  It is estimated that some 192,000 sq.m of employment floorspac e was 
lost to other uses (such as residential development) between 2001 and 2014.  While this does not seem to have resulted in an equivalent loss of jobs, it will be important for the future 
prosperity of the Borough  and the sub -region to ensure that ther e are development 
opportunities for new employers and existing enterprises wishing to expand.  
 
2.18 The Borough has one main town centre ( Eastleigh) which  is identified in the non-statutory PfSH 
South Hampshire Spatial Position Statement as a ‘large town centre’ equivalent in size to 
Fareham.  Over recent years the Borough Council, now based in Eastleigh town centre, has 
worked closely with partners to improve the visitor experience in the town w ith improved 
cleanliness, a comprehensive programme of public realm improvements, e.g. Market Place, 
Station Forecourt, street furniture and way -finding and a co- ordinated programme of cultural 
events.  The Borough  also has large district centres at Hedge End and Chandler’s Ford, and a 
variety of local centres and neighbourhood parades serving local communities.  In addition, the Borough has significant out -of-centre retail development, e.g. at Hedge End, and there is on -
going pressure for more.

A green Borough  – environment and transport  
2.19 The Borough’s countryside varies in character, from the relatively flat and open countryside 
bordering the coast to the gently rolling wooded areas to the north. It includes the valleys of 
the River Itchen and the R iver Hamble, and a coastline that borders  Southampton Water 
from Netley to the Hamble peninsula, including the estuary and west bank of the River 
Hamble which is tidal as far north as Botley. The coast and rivers are important areas of 
biodiversity interes t, which are subject to international and national designations . However 
the Borough  is also locally important for its ancient woodland, wet  woodland and hedgerow 
network that extend through much of the countryside and the interlacing stream and gully 
netw ork associated with the main rivers . 
 
2.20 With Southampton in close proximity, and the Borough’s own network of settlements, the 
Borough’s countryside has a particularly important role in separating settlements and ensuring that they retain their individual identity distinct from each other and from the city.  
Some areas of the countryside are suffering from poor management and pressures  from 
development and public access . These activities, along with emissions for transport and 
industry, are impac ting on the biodiversity value of the natural habitats and species 
populations within the Borough. Of  particular concern is  air quality, due to emissions from 
the motorways and transport networks and the water quality of the important river systems due to agricultural runoff and pollution from the urban area.  
 
2.21 Quite a lot of the land in the countryside is of high agricultural quality, particularly in the 
southern parts of the Borough where there are areas of grades 1 and 2 agricultural land.  With 
the rising costs of food imports and the costs and environmental impacts of transportation, the 
retention of opportunities for local food production is likely to be of increasing importance.  
 
2.22 The green infrastructure network provides recreational space for the existing and future 
population, habitats for the Borough’s wildlife and connects natural habitats and settlements within the wider network  including across Borough  boundaries . Eastleigh Borough contains a 
wide variety of green infrastructure with country parks , wildlife reserves, sport s facilities, 
recreation grounds and allotments.  
 
2.23 Eastleigh Borough contains four C ountry Parks; the Royal Victoria Country Park and the 
Manor Farm Country Park in the south , Lakeside Country Park at Eastleigh and the Itchen 
Valley  Country Park at West End. Westwood Woodland Park at Netley is a local nature   
12 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  reserve and there is a wide network of i nternational, national and local designated sites 
throughout the Borough.  
 
2.24 Fleming Park contains a large area of formal and open space which acts as a green lung 
through the centre of Eastleigh and significant formal sports provision is available at the 
Bishopstoke Hub and within the new sports grounds associated with the development at 
Stoneham Park.  
 
2.25 Footpaths, cycleways , bridleways , woodlands and river corridors  link these spaces to 
adjoining areas with existing and proposed green recreation areas such as the Forest Park in 
Test Valley Borough , green linkages between Southampton and Eastleigh  and the South 
Downs National Park to the north.  
 
2.26 The Borough’s built heritage is varied in quality, ranging from older settlements of great charm 
and antiquity to more recent large residential suburbs, industrial areas and urban centres, some 
of which are now in need of regeneration. While it is important to make the best use of urban 
land, pressures to build within the urban areas can impact on their environmental quality and it 
will be important to retain and encourage the provision of green infrastructure to help alleviate 
water and air quality impacts and the effects of climate change.  
 
2.27 The majority of the Borough ’s buildings date from the twentieth and late nineteenth centuries. 
With greenhouse gas emissions from the construction and running of buildings accounting 
for approximately half of the total nationally, there is a need to encourage greater energy 
efficiency of existing buildings and to build new developments that have the highest feasible standards of sustainability.  
 
2.28 In terms of heritage interest, the Borough’s settlements and other heritage assets reflect 
variously its links with the development of the marine, rail and aviation industries, as well as 
more ancient history. These contribute to the Borough’s varied settlement and community 
character and identity . The oldest settlements in the Borough are on the coast and along the 
rivers, at Hamble, Netley, Bursledon, Botley and Bishopstoke.  The centres of all these 
settlements are conservation areas and they contain the majority of the Borough’s listed 
buildings. Most of the Borough’s scheduled monuments are in these areas. The Borough  has 
a strong transport heritage through its longstanding connections with the marine industry, still 
in evidence on the River Hamble, the rail industry, in particular at Eastleigh, and the aviation 
industry, including the  development of the Spitfire fighter aircraft and early helicopters at 
Hamble and Eastleigh. There are also numerous historic parks and gardens and elements of 
historic landscapes, including remnants of the Forest of Bere. Through their contribution to the 
character and quality  of the Borough, these heritage assets have the potential to contribute to 
its economic well- being, but are also affected by on- going development pressures.  
 
2.29 Although the Borough  includes rivers and their tributaries and borders the coast, flooding and 
coastal erosion are not likely to be major issues in the plan period.  However, there are 
localised instances of flooding, particularly surface water flooding, which are likely to wor sen 
in the longer term with climate change.  Water supply may be a longer term concern across 
the sub -region and the south- east in general.  In terms of waste water treatment and 
disposal, the Borough  includes a large treatment works at Chickenhall Lane, E astleigh, but 
also relies on treatment works beyond its boundaries including Peel Common in Fareham 
Borough.  The PfSH Integrated Water Management Strategy (IWMS)  will help to assess the 
potential impact of development and measures required to address this .   
 
2.30 The Borough suffers pollution of various types.  There are significant areas of air pollution   
13 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  caused by road traffic, and the motorways, airport and rai lways give rise to noise pollution. 
There is some land contamination from past waste tipping and industrial activity, and potential 
for water pollution arising from this and from the waste water treatment works at Chickenhall Lane, Eastleigh. The latter is  managed by Southern Water in line with environmental permits 
and abstraction licences put in place by the Environment Agency.  There are also concerns 
regarding the impacts of agricultural run off on the water quality within the Itchen and Hamble water cat chments and there are risks that pollution from surface water runoff from existing 
development could also be having an impact.  
 2.31 The Borough’s environment is affected by transport issues including peak hour traffic 
congestion on the motorways and many of the Borough’s roads  and associated pollution. It is 
traversed by two major motorways, the M3 and the M27, and a network of strategic and other roads.  Bus services run on many of these roads. It includes a main- line railway (L ondon-
Weymouth line) with stations at Eastleigh and Southampton Airport Parkway and other 
railway lines linking the Borough to the Fareham/Portsmouth area to the east and Romsey 
and Salisbury to the north- west. The long distance transport corridors however  are also 
known to provide long distances corridors for commuting wildlife. The Borough also includes 
Southampton Airport, which is identified as one of three key ‘gateways’ for the sub -region 
(the other two are the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth). Wh ile the Borough has a good 
range of public transport facilities, it can be difficult to access them. Although the airport is 
served by the M27 and the mainline railway, it lacks direct rail connections to the Portsmouth conurbation and other areas to the east.

A healthy community  
2.32 According to the 2011 Census, the Borough had a population of approximately 125,200 which 
is anticipated to rise to about 162, 0008 by the end of the plan period.  The increase will arise 
both from natural growth and new residential development.  In common with many other 
communities, the population is ageing –  the proportion of people over 65 is currently around 
17% and this is predicte d to rise to about 24% by the end of the plan period. This has obvious 
implications for the range of services, facilities and accommodation likely to be needed in the Borough.  
 
2.33 In terms of the build quality of existing and new residential development,  statistics show that 
6.4% of households in the Borough were fuel poor in 2011 compared with 7.6% across 
Hampshire and 8.2% in the South East. In parts of Eastleigh town this figure rises to 12.7% 
(DECC
9). Although the Borough average compares well with t he national average (10.9%), 
the prolonged period of austerity since 2008 together with the rise in household fuel costs 
(which is projected to continue) is likely to have exacerbated this situation further.  There is 
a need to both improve the energy effi ciency of the existing housing stock and ensure that 
new developments are designed to be as sustainable as possible, to help tackle the 
problem of increasing fuel bills, particularly for the most financially vulnerable households 
and the contribution of fu el poverty to excess winter deaths.  
 
2.34 The health of people in the Borough is generally better than the regional and England 
average but varies across the Borough  and there is an increasing ageing population.  The 
latest Health profile10 identified that Eastleigh Borough had a higher proportion of adults 
who are overweight and obese and a lower proportion of physically active adults than the regional and national a verages.  The Council is actively working with the health authorities 
and others to encourage healthy lifestyles, including maintaining substantial sport and 
recreation facilities. Most settlements have good access to medical facilities but there are 
some concerns about the need to travel outside the Borough to more specialised facilities. 
The future use of a partially redundant facility at Moorgreen Hospital, part of which has 
been redeveloped for housing, needs to be agreed with the health authorities.  
 
2.35 Most settlements have access to at least one good quality community hall, with the exception of Allbrook which shares a community hall with a neighbouring parish outside the 
Borough.  Most of these halls serve a variety of needs. There are seven libraries, of which 
all but one are considered too small to meet the needs of their communities.  Hampshire 
County Council is seeking opportunities to improve access to its services by partnering 
libraries with other services  in larger buildings ; recent ex amples include the opening of a

2.36 The Borough has a variety of education facilities including further education colleges that 
are well -regarded in the wider sub- region. Demographic change and new development is 
leading to increasing primary and secondary school rolls in many part s of the Borough . With 
some of these schools already at capacity, there is a need to increase the  number of places 
available either through extensions to existing schools or the building of new schools . A 
number of the secondary schools in the Borough are also at or nearing capacity.  
Hampshire County Council Children’s Services has advised of the need for additional 
primary and secondary school provision and new schools are being planned as part of 
recent large developments permitted or proposed in the B orough.  
 2.37 The Arts Survey carried out in 2011 demonstrated a considerable improvement in arts and 
leisure provision in the Borough in recent years. Particular highlights are the extension of 
The Point and the development of the Vue Cinema in Eastleigh and The Berry Theatre at 
Hedge End. There has also been a general improvement in provision for performance arts 
and other forms of cul tural and leisure activity in community halls throughout the Borough.  
The survey indicated reasonably high levels of participation in arts and leisure activities 
within the Borough, and less need to travel outside the Borough  to enjoy such experiences. 
The new Places Leisure Eastleigh opened in November 2017. This is one of the biggest 
leisure developments in the south and provides larger and better sports and recreation 
facilities than the previous Fleming Park Leisure Centre. The southern part of the Bor ough  
remains less well -served by such facilities than the north, and has poor public transport 
connections to Eastleigh and other centres to the north of the M27. The survey also 
demonstrated the increasing contribution being made by the arts to the local economy, 
including job and training opportunities.

Environmental capacity and development issues  
2.38 In looking for locations for development the Council has reviewed all the main constraints on 
development in the Borough including:  
 
• Heritage  – the Borough’s heritage assets including designated conservation areas, listed 
buildings, scheduled monuments, historic parks and gardens and archaeological sites;  
• Country Parks  – the Borough contains  a number of country parks that serve both the   
16 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Borough and the wider area of south Hampshire;  
• Biodiversity  – the sites designated as being of international, national and local 
importance for nature conservation both within and around the Borough , areas of 
priority/BAP habitat and the preservation and enhancement of Local Biodiversity Action 
Plan Priority Biodiversity Area and Priority Biodiversity Links both within and around the 
Borough;  
• Flood risk – there are a few areas at risk of flooding along the river valleys and the coast, 
and within some urban areas where inadequate surface water drainage can lead to ‘flash floods’;  
• Transport constraints, incl uding traffic congestion, and conversely which parts of the 
Borough have good access to roads, railways, buses, cycleways and footpaths, or 
where there is potential to improve  these. Some existing transport infrastructure also 
imposes constraints on development – for example:  
- Southampton Airport’s public safety zone, height limits on development and aircraft 
noise, which affect Eastleigh River Side and other areas to the north;  
- the air quality management zones alongside the M3 motorway,  the A335 Leigh 
Road/Southampton Road in Eastleigh, Windhover  Roundabout and Hamble Lane at 
Bursledon and through Botley;  and 
- noise from the motorways and other busy roads and railways.  
• Utilities infrastructure  – the Borough  is crossed by major oil pipelines  leading from 
the oil storage depot at Hamble, by a substantial gas pipeline,  by sewers and water 
supply pipelines and by some large electricity lines.  
 
2.39 All such constraints have been taken into account in detailed work on the strategic land 
availability assessment , in sustainability appraisal of proposals  and in work on the Local Plan.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
17 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Chapter 3: Vision , Objectives  and Strategy  for new 
development  
  
 
3.1 From the Corporate Plan, the issues set out in Chapter 2 and the principles of sustainability set 
out in the National Planning Policy Framework and in  strategic policy S1, the Council has 
derived a vision of what the Local Plan should achieve for the Borough , and a set of object ives 
for making this happen.  
 
Vision  
‘To ensure development in Eastleigh Borough  and its communities  delivers a strong and 
sustainable economy with an adequate supply of housing and infrastructure that support s 
improved standards of living for residents  while protecting the distinct identity of towns and 
villages and preventing urban sprawl ; promoting thriving and healthy communities; and 
maintaining an attractive and sustainable environment that residents value.’  
 
Objectives  
 
i. Tacking congestion –  Tackle local traffic congestion and associated pollution by 
reducing car usage and improving transport infrastructure;  
ii. Developing green infrastructure – Provide green links to and between local facilities 
and open space and a linked habitat network to safeguard wildlife and natural resources ; 
iii. Encouraging a sustainable community -  Ensure future development contributes to the 
Borough’s sustainability and resilience through effective low carbon and water efficient 
planning and design;  
iv. Maintaining the identity of towns and villages  – Protec t settlement  gaps necessary to 
maintain the separation of distinct settlements  and ensure major new development is 
designed to create new communities and neighbourhoods  supported by high quality 
infrastructure including education facilities ; 
v. Excellent environment for all -  Create a clean and attractive environment that provides 
for people’s social, occupation and recreational needs, conserves and enhances the 
historic env ironment and is desirable for all, including residents, employees, visitors and 
investors ; 
vi. Minimising waste and managing resources -  Use resources more efficiently and 
consume fewer of them, while ensuring maximum value is generated from any waste 
produced;  
vii. Protecting and enhancing biodiversity -  Ensure protection and enhancement of 
designated and priority habitats within the Borough and endeavour to create a cross 
boundary landscape scale habitat network;  
viii. Enabling healthier lifestyles/wellbeing  - Facilitate better physical and mental health 
and wellbeing by improving the places people live , work,  learn and play,  meeting the 
challenge of the ageing population, and promoting cultural and physical activity ; 
ix. Tackling deprivation - Reduce health inequalities by engaging with and prioritising 
groups and communities in most need;  
x. Increased provision and more diverse mix  of housing - Ensure a sufficient supply of 
well-designed homes  to deliver the target of at least 14,580 homes  between 2016 -2036 
and meet the diverse needs , and abilities to afford housing,  of residents both now and in   
18 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  the future;  
xi. Ensuring appropriate infrastructure including employment land - Secure an 
ongoing provision of employment land and infrastructure that can support current and 
future business needs, and stimulate sufficient economic growth to sustain a rising 
population;  
xii. Enabling t he right skills and employment mix - Developing an appropriately skilled 
workforce in the Borough and a varied mix of employment opportunities, ensuring the 
Borough is seen as desirable location to set up a new business or to relocate a growing 
business, s o as to sustain economic demand and increase job security and satisfaction;  
xiii. Reinvigorating town and local centres  - Creating vibrant, active places where people 
want to spend time.  
 
Strategy for new development  
3.2 The Council’s preferred strategy for the Borough  over the period 2016  to 2036 is illustrated on 
the Key Diagram and the strategic policies set out in C hapter 4. The  strategy is based on the 
principles of sustainable development set out in strategic policy S1 and in the context of:  
 
i. the issues and environmental capacity  identified in Chapter 2;  
ii. the vision and objectives set out above;  
iii. the outcomes of the Council’s Strategic Land Availability Assessment (SLAA);  
iv. the outcomes of studies including the transport assessment, sustainability appraisal 
and Habitats Regulations assessment of options ; and 
v. consultation on previous versions of the Local Plan including the Key Strategic 
Issues ‘Issues and options’ document . 
 
3.3 The strategy sets out how much and what type of new development should be provided over 
the plan period and development principles guiding where it should be located, along with 
related st rategic transport proposals. It also sets out the Council’s strategy for the Borough’s 
countryside and coast , including its settlement gaps . An assessment of development viability 
has been undertaken in relation to the Local Plan.  
 
3.4 The most significant element of the new strategy for the Borough is the location of new 
housing development.  In preparing the Local Plan, the Council has identified a need to find land for a minimum of 14,580 dwellings  2016- 2036.  
 
3.5       In addition, land is required for other uses, in particular employment, in order to ensure that 
there will be local jobs for new residents, and to support the non- statutory  PfSH Spatial 
Position Statement (2016). The Council has estimated a requirement for  103,500 sq.m (net) of 
new employment floorspace (2016 -2036) . Alongside residential and employment 
development, there will be a need for new transport and utilities infrastructure, and for new 
green infrastructure and community infrastructure including schools and sport and recreation 
facilities.  
 
3.6    The Council wishes to ensure that as much development as possible is accommodated within 
existing urban areas (on ‘brownfield’ sites), in order to ensure the sustainability of 
development, make best use of urban land and to support and utilise existing fac ilities and 
services. The Borough’s settlement hierarchy set out in paragraph s 4.6-4.9 is the main 
consideration in the spatial distribution of new development and development focused first on suitable brownfield sites within defined settlement boundaries  of the Borough’s most   
19 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  sustainable settlements.  
 
3.7         Given the relatively compact settlement pattern of the Borough, i n considering the  need for a 
significant scale of new greenfield development in  the Borough  the Council’s decisions  were  
informed by the following development principles11: 
 
a. The Local Plan will seek to deliver an increase in housing provision compared to previous 
plans in order to provide a more diverse mix of housing (including affordable and specialised housing) to meet the Borough’s objectively assessed housing need and 
contributing (where feasible) to meeting the needs of the wider Southampton housing 
market area;  
b. The borough’s settlement hierarchy should be the main consideration in making decisions 
about the spatial distribution of new development to ensure that development is located in 
areas which provide the widest range of employment opportunities, community facilities and 
transport infrastructure and in order to support, enhance and reinvigorate those areas;   
c. Development wi ll be focused first on suitable brownfield sites within the defined settlement 
boundaries of the Borough’s most sustainable settlements;  
d. However, given the tightly drawn boundaries of those settlements and the scale of 
development likely to be required ove r the plan period, the plan will need to make provision 
for a significant scale of new greenfield development;  
e.   In accordance with the provisions of the NPPF, the opportunity to deliver a substantial 
proportion of this new greenfield development on a new Strategic Growth Option will be 
explored;  
i. based on good practice and experience elsewhere, if there is to be a single Strategic 
Growth Option, it should be at least 1,500 dwellings in size in order to achieve a degree 
of self-containment and to achieve a critical mass sufficient to deliver new infrastructure 
provision, for instance in the form of new road links to the strategic highway network;  
ii. the option of identifying a Strategic Growth Option will be derived from sites  and areas 
identified in the SLAA, assessed through the S ustainability Apprais al and sites actively 
promoted for such development.  
 
f.   Any strategic development must result in the creation of a new, sustainable, mixed use community and should demonstrate it will enable the provision of new and improved 
infrastructure and employment and other opportunities such as could not be provided by a 
series of smaller extensions to existing settlements alone;  
 
g.    Even if a Strategic Growth Option is pursued, smaller greenfield extensions to existing settlements will still be required in order to ensure a continuity of housing supply throughout the plan period, to provide choice and variety in the housing market in terms of the size, 
type, tenure, mix and location of new development and to help ensure the Council 
maintains a 5- year supply of housing land;  
 
h.   All new development should result in the creation of high quality, well -designed sustainable 
communities providing for a range of housing and other needs and should seek to protect 
the environment, in particular avoiding harm to protected environments and landscapes;  
 
 
11 Development Distribution Strategy and Principles endorsed at Cabinet on 15/12/2016   
20 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  i.   The separate identity of settlements and local communities should be safeguarded by 
ensuring the retention of undeveloped countryside gaps between them and avoiding 
decisions which would result in their coalescence;  
 
j.     Development should seek to maxi mise opportunities to improve the availability and access 
to community and recreation facilities and enhance the network of green infrastructure provision across the Borough;  
 
k.    New development should capitalise on opportunities to address existing deficiencies in the transport network, should not materially exacerbate problems in existing areas and where 
feasible should seek to encourage a modal shift away from reliance primarily on the private 
car;  
 
l.   There should be no significant additional development in the Hamble peninsula because of transport  constraints, minerals safeguarding and the vulnerability of the open and 
undeveloped countryside gaps between settlements in this area and Southampton, the 
outer borders of which are clear ly visible from many parts of the peninsula.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Chapter 4: Strateg ic policies  
 
 
Overview of strategic policies  
4.1 This Chapter sets out the strategy for the Local Plan starting with the underlying principles of 
sustainable development (strategic policy S1), the hierarchy of settlements  and development 
targets ( strategic policy  S2). It then sets out the spatial strategy for:  
 
- location of new housing, strategic policy S3 ; 
- employment provision , strategic  policy  S4; 
- countryside and settlement gaps , strategic policies S 5 and S 6;   
- the coast , strategic policy S 7; and  
-  the historic environment, strategic policy S8.  
4.2 The strategy then explains the Council’s related strategic policies for infrastructure : 
- green infrastructure , strategic policy S9; 
- community facilities , strategic policy S 10;  
- transport , strategic policy S 11;  
- strategic links, strategic policy S12.   
4.3 Apart from strategic policy  S1, sustainable development, each strategic policy  is accompanied  
by a note of the r elevant issues and objectives  identified in C hapters 2 and 3 and related local 
and national strategies which together provide the context and justification for the policy.  The 
spatial strategy is illustrated on a Key Diagram at the end of this C hapter.  
 
Sustainable Development  
 
Strategic policy S1, Delivering s ustainable development  
 
1.  To be sustainable, new development in the Borough should:  
 
a.  meet community needs without compromising the identity of the Borough or its 
individual settlements, or the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs;  
b.  enhance social equality by ensuring equal and easy access to a range of 
community facilities and services and by promoting the development of 
employment, education and skills training opportunities;  
c. maintain and help to grow a high -performing local economy that benefits the 
Borough, south Hampshire and the wider economy, without adverse impact on south Hampshire’s city , town and other  centres, the quality of the local 
environment or local transport networks;  
d.  have regard to the potential impacts of climate change, and the need to limit   
22 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  greenhouse gas emissions including through carbon sequestration and by 
promoting measures to design buildings and spaces which are adaptable to 
predicted climate change, and restrict development in areas at risk from 
flooding, minimise energy use and encourage the generation of renewable 
energy, and by minimising emissions from motorised transport, industrial 
activity and domestic uses;  
e.  minimise the need to travel longer  distances and, where travel is necessary, 
prioritise more  sustainable forms of transport , such  as active travel, other 
alternatives to car use, or a combination of active travel  and other alternatives  
to car use;  
f.  avoid impacts on the Hamble and Itchen catchments and associated flora and 
fauna species by preserving water quality and flows from development and 
safeguarding potential yield of local water resources used for public water 
supplies having regard to the impacts of abstraction;  
g.  seek opportunities to optimise  density of new development and  
redevelopments;  
h.  use resources wisely and minimise the generation of waste in the construction, 
occupation and use of buildings;  
i. maintain local environmental quality, including avoiding damage to,  and where 
possible enhancing, the existing valued urban and rural environmen ts in the 
Borough and heritage assets;  
j.  have regard to the  purposes12 of the South Downs National Park, including 
regarding its status as an International Dark Night Skies reserve ; and  
k.  maintain, enhance, extend and connect the natural habitats within and 
landscape value of the Borough, extending natural habitats into new and 
existing development  to achieve an environmental net gain . 
 
2. Applicants are encouraged to undertake  pre-application consultation  with the 
relevant statutor y and non- statutory consultees.  
 
3. When considering development proposals the Council will take a positive approach 
that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development contained in the 
National Planning Policy Framework. It will always work proactively with applicants 
jointly to find solutions which mean that proposals can be approved wherever 
possible, and to secure development that improves the economic, social and 
environmental conditions in the area.  
 
4.  Planning applications that accord with the policies in the Local Plan will be 
approved without delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Where there are no policies relevant to the application or r elevant policies are out of date 
at the time of making the decision then the Council will grant permission unless material considerations indicate otherwise, taking into account whether:  
 
a.  any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the 
National Planning Policy Framework taken as a whole; or  
 
b.  where specific policies in that Framework or other international or national 
legislation indicate that development should be restricted.  
 
12 The National Park purposes are to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area; and to promote 
opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Park by the public.    
23 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
4.4 The principles of ‘sustainable development’ are central to national planning policies, and they 
underpin the Council’s approach to planning in the Borough. An accepted definition of sustainable development is that: “Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs and 
aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future” 
(Brundtland). The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) identifies three dimensions to sustainable development –  economic, social and environmental –  and derives from these a 
number of roles for the planning system (NPPF pa ragraph 8). 
 4.5 It is necessary to define what sustainability means for Eastleigh Borough. From a review of the 
character of this Borough  and the issues that need to be addressed as set out in Chapter 2, the 
Council has arrived at a definition as set out in the policy  above.  
 
Settlement hierarchy  
4.6 The Borough’s settlement hierarchy  as set out in Table 1 is  the main consideration when 
considering the overall spatial distribution of new development  and the appropriate scale of 
development . The settlement hierarchy is based on the facilities that already exist in local 
communities. It identifies both the most sustainable locations i.e. those which have the most 
employment, local services and amenities and where the need to travel is therefore reduced; and highlights areas where such facilities are needed, and could be provided through allowing sufficient development.    
 
4.7 Most towns and la rger villages in the Borough  have a reasonable range of facilities, but 
obviously some have more than others.  They have been classified into a settlement hierarchy 
based on whether the following services are available in the settlement or nearby:  
 
• shops (convenience goods) and post office;  
• leisure and community facilities;  
• education facilities;  
• health care facilities (doctors, dentists, pharmacies);  
• local employment (proximity of employment areas);  
• public transport.  
4.8 The settlement hierarchy reflects the existing services and facilities within settlements. This will 
change over time and it is recognised that developments planned and under construction will 
have an effect on the future hierarchy of settlements. Major development under way at Boorley 
Green and planned at Horton Heath will lead to the significant expansion of these settlements. 
This will change their position in the settlement hierarchy as they are currently identified as level 
4 settlements with a more limited range of s ervices and facilities. The settlement hierarchy will 
be updated in future Local Plans when development which has an impact on the hierarchy is 
largely complete.  
 
4.9 The settlement hierarchy in Table 1 has  four levels;  
 
1. Main town and service centre;    
24 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  2. Other lar ge towns with significantly more extensive retail offers and community and public 
transport infrastructure than in other settlements in the Borough and therefore serving a 
wider catchment;  
3. Larger villages, principally serving the day to day needs of their local catchment, and 
employment centres;  
4. Other settlements with a more limited range of services and facilities

New development 
4.10 Chapter 2 sets out the issues connected to housing, employment and other forms of 
development in the Borough.  The requirements for new development have been established 
are based on a variety of evidence at a local and sub- regional level . The Borough Council 
considers that the strategy for new development proposed in the following policies will meet the 
needs of the Borough  and will help to support the strategy for econo mic growth in south 
Hampshire.

1. The Council will promote the delivery , over the plan  period 2016 -2036,  of a 
minimum of:  
a.  14,580  new dwellings;  
i.   The pattern of delivery is expected to involve : 
• 2,572 dwellings completed 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2019 ; 
• 7,187 dwellings with planning permission or resolut ion to grant 
permission at 1st April 2019;  
• 1,475 allowance for windfall development  
• 732 dwellings on new sites allocated in this plan  
 ii.  The Council will ensure a minimum 5 year supply (plus 
appropriate buffer) of deliverable sites across Eastleigh 
Borough.  
iii.  The Council will support the provision of an average of 200 
(net) new affordable homes per annum as part of the 
overall net additional homes provided each year (from 2016 
to 2036).  
iv.  The Council will monitor the delivery of all types and 
tenures of homes to ensure housing needs are being met.   
 
b. 103,500 sq.m (net)  of new employment development  (of which 56,800 sq.m to be 
E(g)(i)/(ii)  development) ; 
 
c.  and related transport infrastructure, open space,   sports facilities and other 
community facilities.  
 
2. The urban edge as set out on the policies map defines the main built -up areas within 
which there is a presumption in favour of new development, subject to the policies 
of this plan.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
4.11 The development quantum quoted in Strategic Policy S2 are net additions to the existing stock 
of development and so take account of losses.  In terms of housing, the requirement figure 
includes a 5% buffer for the period 2019 -2024 in accordance with paragraph 47 of the NPPF. 
No other discounts are applied. The pattern of delivery set out in Strategic Policy S2 results i n a 
shortfall of 2,614 dwellings against the target of 14,580. This is primarily due to the deletion, as recommended by the Local Plan Examination Inspector, of the Strategic Growth Option which 
had been proposed in the submitted version of the plan. Due t o the scale of development 
currently committed and under construction this shortfall occurs in the latter years of the plan 
period. The Inspector recommended that this shortfall be addressed in an early review of the 
local plan.   See also Strategic Policy  S3 below.

Strategic policy S3, Location of new housing  
 
1.  The Borough Council will focus as much new housing development as possible 
within the existing urban areas, with the remainder on greenfield sites in the form of  
a number of larger strategic sites,  urban extensions and a number of smaller sites 
to meet more local needs.  The Council proposes:  
 
 
a.   The development of approximately 5,960 dwellings on strategic sites with 
planning permission at:  
 
i.  South of Chestnut Avenue, Eastleigh at Stoneham Park  (1,150 
dwellings) ; 
 
ii.  West of Horton Heath ( 1,500 dwellings) (HH1) ;    
27 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
iii.  West of Woodhouse Lane, Hedge End (605  dwellings)  (HE1) ; 
 
iv.  Land north and east of Boorley Green and Botley (1,400  
dwellings ); 
 
v.   Land to the north -west  of Boorley Green (680 dwellings ); 
 
vi.  Land at Pembers Hill Farm (250 dwellings) ; and 
 vii.  Land north east of Winchester Street (Uplands Farm) (375  
dwellings) (BO2) . 
 
b.  The development of approximately 2, 702 dwellings on other large sites 
which already have planning permission or a Council resolution to grant 
permission, or will come forward as unidentified windfalls ; 
 
c.  Provision for approximately 732 dwellings on new smaller greenfield and 
urban sites within and adjoining the settlements of Allbrook, Bishopstoke, 
Botley, Bursledon, Chandler’s Ford, Eastleigh, Fair Oak & Horton Heath, 
Hedge End, Netley and West End.  
 
2.  The Council anticipates that the new housing development identified in  this policy will 
be deli vered in accordance with the housing trajectory.  
 
 
4.12 The development proposed, including development within the existing urban areas and the new 
greenfield allocations  split into  parishes and Eastleigh, is shown on the key diagram .  A housing 
trajectory has been produced to i llustrate the anticipated delivery of housing over the plan 
period. The total supply identified in Strategic Policy S3 (9,394 dwellings ) falls short of  the 
required 14,580 dwellings 2016- 2036 by a considerable margin  (5,186 dwellings) . However, 
2,572 of these dwellings were completed in the years 2016 -2019 leaving an actual shortfall of 
2,614. This shortfall has arisen primarily as a result of the local plan examination Inspector’s 
recommended deletion of the Strategi c Growth Option which was proposed in the submitted 
version of the local plan. The Inspector recommended that this shortfall, which will occur in the 
later years of the plan period, should be addressed through an early review of the local plan.  
Accordingly , the Council will commence an update of this Local Plan within 1 year of its 
adoption.   
 
4.13 The site policies in chapter 6 provide an indicative number of dwellings for each site, based on 
planning permissions, discussions with developers and landowners and development capacity 
assessments. When determining planning applications, the Council will consider  developments 
with higher dwelling numbers if this can be justified following more detailed work and where the proposed development is in acco rdance with other policies in the Plan.

4.15 Policy S3 1.b sets out the new housing to be delivered from strategic sites with planning 
permission.  The principle of development on these sites is established by the permission.   The 
sites which have planning permission but on which work had not started at 1st April 2019 are 
subject to their own individual policy allocations in the Local Plan (identified in brackets in Policy 
S3). Those on which work is currently underway ar e not individually allocated in the Local 
Plan.  Table 2 below  summarises  the strategic  developments  without allocations in the Local

Strategic policy S4, Employment provision 
 
1. To contribute towards sustainable economic growth, provision will be made for 
additional floorspace for uses in the B2, B8 and E(g) use classes  and other 
employment -generating uses through:  
 
a.  mixed -use regeneration and greenfield  development at and adjoining Eastleigh 
River  Side  and at Southampton Airport , supported by the delivery of the 
Chickenhall Lane link road (see policies E6, E7 and E9 and paragraphs 6.4.3 1 to 
6.4.43  and 6.4.53  to 6.4. 58, Chapter  6, section  6.4); 
b.  further  employment development adjoining Chalcroft Business Park, subject to 
the provision of a new road link between the distribution park and Bubb Lane 
(see policies WE1 and WE2, and paragraphs 6.5. 48 to 6.5.5 0, Chapter  6, section 
6.5); 
c.  small -scale employment allocations at Chandler’s Ford  (Policy CF 4), 
Eastleigh  (Policy E1) , Horton Heath (Policy HH1) , Hedge End (Policies HE4 
and HE5)  and West End  (Policy WE3) ; 
d.  new employment development within the urban edge and by the re- use 
and/or redevelopment of buildings in the countryside (policies DM18  and 
DM19 , Chapter 5);  
e.  retaining existing (and allocated) employment sites which have the potential 
to contribute towards future employment needs, and intensifying their use 
(see policy  DM15 , Chapter 5);  
f.  regeneration of Eastleigh town centre in accordance with the Council’s 
‘Eastleigh Town Centre Vision ’ (see policies E3 and E4, Chapter 6, section 6. 4) 
and of district and local centres, to include retail, office, leisure, cultural and 
residential development ( polic y DM21 ). This will include the restriction of out -of-
centre retail and office development.    
30 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
2.  Unless no suitable sites are available and, in accordance with the ‘sequential 
approach’, office development will be focused  firstly  in Eastleigh town centre, the 
wider Eastleigh urban renaissance quarter, at Eastleigh River Side, (Southampton 
Airport) and in district and local centres.  Retail development will be focused firstly  in 
Eastleigh town centre, and in district, local and neighbourhood centres according to 
the role of each centre within the local retail hierarchy. Out of centre office and retail 
development must be in accordance with national policy.   
 
3.  In implementi ng this policy the Council will have regard to the non- statutory PfSH 
South Hampshire Spatial Position Statement  vision that south Hampshire will 
become a major centre in creativity, innovation and technology, and will encourage : 
 
a. a greater presence of high- value growth industries, building on the Borough’s 
existing economic strengths in the marine, aviation, rail, creative industries, 
financial and business sectors, whilst also being open to support new growth 
industries including low carbon and high technology businesses, and 
businesses that support the development of a low carbon economy13; 
b. the creation of jobs in forms of employment other than industry and commerce, 
for example in retail, leisure and cultural activities, education and health 
services, provided they do not compromise the contribution that existing businesses and sites make to the economy;  
c. the provision of starter and ‘move -on’ units for small firms;  
d. the provision of facilities for skills t raining that support the local economy, and 
secure training opportunities and new jobs in conjunction with new 
development (see policy DM16 , Chapter 5); and 
e. the provision of high- speed telecommunication facilities to serve Eastleigh and 
the rest of the Borough ’s settlements (see policy DM9 , Chapter 5).  
 
 
4.16 It is anticipated that the employment development floorspace targets set out in Strategic 
Policy S2  criterion 1b be met as follows:

4.17 Eastleigh River Side is one of  the largest employment areas in the Borough .  Many of the 
buildings on the northern part of the site are of some age and combined with the large area 
of railway sidings adjoining this area, create a poor environment on the east side of the 
town centre and the important southern approach to the town. There is potential to 
regenerate the area known as Barton Park/Deacon’s Industrial Estate for a variety of uses 
including employment, in order to improve this part of the Borough and enhance the quality 
of employment provision. A number of other greenfield and brownfield sites have been 
identified within the Eastleigh River Side area, all of which have potential to contribute to 
meeting the Borough’s requirements for additional or replacement employment floorspace.  
 
4.18 A number of other employment sites have scope to be used more intensively. In particular, 
although it is presently constrained by poor road connections, land at Chalcroft Business Park 
is under -used and could be developed for industrial, storage, distribution and ancillary office 
use, as part of a wider development t hat would include measures to improve accessibility to the 
strategic road networ k.  
 
4.19  In order to meet the total employment floorspace requirement it will also be necessary to 
allocate some additional sites. A number of small -scale allocations are the refore proposed at 
Chandler’s Ford, Eastleigh, Hedge End,  Horton Heath and West End (see Chapter 6).  
 
4.20 In accordance with the P fSH Economic Development Strategy, the Council will seek to focus 
office development in town and district centres that are readily accessible by alternative modes 
of transport, and where such developments can contribute to maintaining the vitality and 
viability of the centre. Proposals for substantial new office development outside of town and 
district centres will be considered in accordance with the sequential test of the NPPF 
paragraph 24 and will include consideration of the availability of suitable sites within the centre 
and the potential impact  on other centres outside the Borough  including the city of 
Southampton.  In addition to the more traditional forms of employment, the Council recognises 
the contribution that is made to the local economy by other non- industrial/commercial sectors, 
for example retail, leisure and cultural activities, tourism, education and health services.  
 
4.21 The Council’s strategy for employment provision and the consequences for retail development 
are underpinned by a range of health checks and other background information on the town, district and local centres within the Borough. Eastleigh town centre provi des the main focus for 
shopping,  leisure and cultural facilities in the Borough. Parts of it are of some age, having 
evolved from the original railway town, and some retail premises are not of a size or quality commensurate with modern requirements.   There is considered to be capacity within the town 
centre to accommodate additional retail floor  space, particularly in northern areas.  
Redevelopment and/or enhancement of these areas would help to improve the quality of 
shopping provision i n the town, and increase its attractiveness to its catchment population.  
 
4.22 The Borough is well- provided with other smaller shopping centres. Chandler’s Ford and Hedge 
End both have centres of sufficient size to provide a range of services and facilities.  However, 
at Chandler’s Ford the shopping centres are fragmented, and parts of them (such as the 
Fryern Centre and Central Precinct) are in need of improvement.  Hedge End town centre 
provides an important focus for Hedge End but is similarly in need of  improvement. Other local 
centres also provide useful shopping and other community facilities, although many of them 
could benefit from environmental improvements. Once again,  there are opportunities for 
expanding the current quantity of retail floorspace in many of these centres.    
32 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
4.23 The Council’s strategy also takes account of the results and conclusions from the Eastleigh 
Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment  (Carter Jonas  2017). The Borough  has substantial 
out-of-town retail floorspace at Hedge End, and other out -of-town retail facilities including 
the Channon Retail Park at Eastleigh, the Chestnut Avenue retail park at Chandler’s Ford 
and large supermarkets at Chandler’s Ford and Bursledon.   The Council will therefore seek 
to limit these forms of development outside the identified centres in line with national policy . 
 
Employment and housing  
4.24 The Council is aware of the need to balance the supply of new jobs and the growth in the 
economically active population likely to arise from the new residential development proposed in 
the Local Plan.  Overall the Council believes that the provisions made for employment 
development in the form of new site allocations and policies enabling the development of new 
enterprises within the urban edge (including non- industrial employment) will provide sufficient 
employment opportunities to meet the needs of the new economically active population’.

Countryside and Settlement  gaps  
4.25 The issues set out in Chapter 2 suggest that the Borough’s countryside is under pressure from 
development and non -agricultural uses, with some areas in need of improved management, in 
particular those adjoining the urban edges of settlements. Quite a large proportion of the 
Borough’s countryside is in use for r ecreational horse- grazing, with related development 
pressures for stabling and other built facilities.  
 
 
Strategic policy  S5, New development in the c ountryside  
 
 
1.  Planning permission will be granted for new development in the countryside 
provided it i s related to:  
 
a.    the provision of employment through agricultural development (policy DM17), 
the extension and replacement of existing employment uses (policy DM18) and 
the re -use of existing buildings (policy DM19);  
b.   residential extensions and replacement buildings (policies DM18 and 2 6), 
limited residential conversions (policy DM19), rural workers’ dwellings (policy 
DM27) and accommodation for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople (policy DM 31); 
c.  community,  tourist, or visitor uses through the re- use of buildings including 
facilities for the interpretation of heritage assets (policies DM12);  
d.  outdoor recreation and open space (policies DM 32 and DM 33); 
e.  allotments and community farms (policy DM 32); 
f.  cemeteries (policy DM 37); and  
g.  essential public utilities (policy DM9).  
 
2.  In permitting new development in the countryside the Borough Council will seek 
to: 
 
a.    avoid adverse impacts on the rural, woodland, riparian or coastal character, 
the intrinsi c character of the landscape including the avoidance of adverse 
landscape impacts on areas adjoining national parks and their sett ings, the 
significance of heritage assets and on the biodiversity of the area;  
b.    secure  long -term beneficial management practices that will enhance the 
landscape and biodiversity of the countryside and coast;  
c.    avoid sterilisation of mineral resources, in accordance with the  Hampshire  
Minerals and Waste Plan;  
d.    safeguard the best and most versatile agricultural land unless the benefit of the 
development clearly outweighs the loss; and  
e.    protect soils during construction wherever possible in line with the ‘Defra code 
of practice for the sustainable use of soils on construction sites’.  
 
[Note: DM ( development management) policies are in Chapter 5.]  
 
 
4.26 The Borough’s countryside  (as defined in the glossary)  is an important and diminishing 
resource. It is valued for many reasons, including agriculture and community food production, 
its landscape qualities and biodiversity value. Habitats of value include the special characteristics of the valleys of the rivers Itchen and Hamble and the networks of ancient 
woodlands, streams and wetlands throughout the Borough. The countryside is also important 
for the setting it provides for towns and villages, and the opportunities it provides for recreation.   
34 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  The Council is keen to protect  and enhance the countryside with in the Borough and maximise 
its opportunities for people and wildlife, from the urbanising impacts of development.  
 
4.27 However, there are particular needs arising from rural activities  and the rural communities 
require housing and services , the strategy allows for limited development to ensure these 
needs are met . In permitting such developments, the Council will seek to promote the beneficial 
management of the countryside.  This will i nclude encouragement of proposals that enhance 
the woodlands in the Forest of Bere16 area and recreational links to and within this area.  
 
4.28 Parts of the countryside are underlain with mineral deposits. As the minerals planning authority 
for this Borough Hampshire County Council seeks to avoid the sterilisation of such resources by 
permanent non minerals development. Areas safeguarded because they contain important minerals are identified by the County Council in the Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan 
(2013), and they are also shown on the Local Plan policies map.  The Hampshire Minerals and 
Waste Plan identifies the former Hamble Airfield as an area for the extraction of sand and gravel.  
 
4.29 The countryside within Eastleigh Borough is not regarded as being a rural area for the 
purposes of applying the provisions of the NPPF in relation to supporting a prosperous rural 
economy.  Much of it has the characteristics of urban- fringe where careful management is 
required to avoid urbanisation and the coalescence of settlements, and the Local Plan’s 
policies are framed accordingly.  
 
4.30 Policies S5 and S 6 restrict  development in the countryside principally in order to maintain its  
rural character and to limit urbanisation. In accordance with the Ha mpshire Minerals and 
Waste Plan it also seeks to limit the sterilisation of mineral resources by new development.  
 
4.31 Residential development includes houseboats, of which a number exist on the River Hamble 
estuary - any proposals to moor additional houseboats along the coast will be treated in the 
same way as proposals for new residential development in the countryside.  
 
4.32 Please note that a number of sites in the countryside are covered by special policies in the 
Local Plan including policies for recreation facilities at the Ageas Bowl (policy WE4), the 
employment and T ravelling Showpeople site at Netley Firs (policy HE5) a nd boatyards (policy 
DM20).  
 
 
Strategic policy S 6, Protection of settlement gaps  
 1. Development within a Settlement Gap as set out in the policies map will be permitted 
provided that:  
 
a. it would not undermine  the physical extent and/or visual separation of 
settlements; and  
 b. it would not have an urbanising effect detrimental to:  
i. The character of the countryside; or  
ii. The separate identity of the adjoining settlements.  
 
Settlement gaps are defined between:

35 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  a.  Eastleigh and Southampton;  
b.  Eastleigh  and Bishopstoke;  
c.  Fair Oak and Horton Heath;      
d.  Hedge End,  Botley and Boorley Green;  
e.  Hedge End, West End and Southampton;  
f.   Hedge End, Horton Heath and Boorley Green;  
g.  Hedge End and Bursledon;  
h.  Bursledon, Netley and Southampton;  
i.  Hamble, Netley and Bursledon.  
     
 
4.33 The Borough’s countryside performs an important role in separating and providing a setting for 
the Borough’s settlements.  Maintaining the individual identities of the Borough’s communities 
is an important priority for the Borough Council. The most obvious way of achieving this is 
keeping them physically separate from each other and from Southampton.  Developm ent over 
recent years has tended to cause some merging of settlements –  for example West End has 
now merged with Southampton.  The Council considers that designating areas between 
settlements as settlement  gaps to be kept free of urbanising development is the best way of 
preventing further loss of local identity . Following a review of the boundaries of settlement gaps 
and consideration of the extent of land required to prevent coalescence of settlements, the Council has defined a number of such gaps , see Figure 2. 
 
4.34 Any new development within a settlement gap should not physically and/or visually undermine the gap between settlements. Any new development including the intensification or 
redevelopment of existing activities within gaps should seek opportunities to enhance the 
function of the gap. Consideration will be given to how the proposed siting, design,  colours, 
materials and any storage of materials, lighting, boundary treatment, landscape features, 
landscape improvements and/or appropriate long term management arrangements serves to 
ensure the proposed development meets the criteria in policy S 6.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  The coast  
 
Strategic policy S 7, The coast  
 
1. The coast is defined as including:  
 
a.  the Hamble river estuary between Hamble Point Marina and Botley, extending 
to the Borough boundary in the centre of the river and around the Marina; 
and 
b.    the coast of Southampton Water extending to mean low water.  
On-shore areas relating to the coast are defined as areas adjoining coastal 
waters, or related to the coast in visual, landscape, biodiversity, heritage or 
functional terms . 
 
2.  On the Borough’s coast, the Borough Council will protect the Natura 2000 and 
Ramsar designations and recognises the national and international importance of 
the River Hamble and Southampton Water for recr eational sailing and marine- related 
enterprises that contr ibute to the local and sub- regional economy and recreational 
activi ties.  The Council therefore seeks to:  
 
a.  protect and enhance the landscape, biodiversity and heritage interest of the 
coast including views from coastal waters (see also strategic  policies S 7,  S9 
and S10 , and policies DM1, DM11 and DM12, Chapter 5);  
b.  retain  existing boatyards and marinas on the River Hamble in marine - 
related uses (see policy DM3 5, Chapter 5);  
c. enable the provision of infrastructure related to sailing within the developed 
frontages of the river, subject to the River Hamble Harbour Authorit y Strategic 
Plan and Strategic Vision, whilst protecting more sensitive locations (see policy DM20, Chapter 5);  
d.  maintain and enhance other coast -related recreational activities, including 
enhancing coastal access where this can be achieved without detriment to 
biodiversity, landscape, heritage or economic interests, and/or can help to 
manage recreational impacts; and  
e.  achieve coast protection and flood management measures where necessary in 
accordance with the adopted North Solent Shoreli ne Management Plan
17 (see 
policy DM7, Chapter 5).  
 
4.35 The Borough’s coastline includes a frontage to Southampton Water between Netley and 
Hamble Point, and the western bank of the Hamble estuary up to Botley. Much of the Southampton Water frontage is accessible, with the Royal Victoria Country Park and Hamble Common extending to the shoreline. At Hamble and in the estuary of the Hamble river more 
of the coast is in private ownership, including the oil storage facility and other industries a t 
Hamble, the commercial boatyards and marinas at Hamble and Bursledon, and private 
dwellings.  
 
4.36 The character of the coastline ranges from low, crumbling cliffs at Netley to the open mudflats 
and marshes of the estuary and the more enclosed upper tidal reaches of the R iver Hamble, 
which is tidal as far north as Botley. There is some slow erosion of t he cliffs at Netley which 
provides opportunities for the sandstone cliffs to be colonised by rare mining bee and wasp colonies. There is some risk of coastal inundation at Hamble, but the risks are relatively low 
and the areas affected are not of sufficient scale to warrant the identification of a Coastal

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Change Management Area18. There is a slow but progressive erosion of saltmarsh habitat 
along the tidal reaches of the Hamble and the Hamble Harbour Authority have undertaken 
initial studies to assess the f easibility o f saltmarsh recharge. The Council would be keen to 
work in  partnership with the Harbour Authority on a project if the project if the opportunity 
arises. The North Solent Shoreline Management Plan19 proposes no active intervention for 
the coastline or the Hamble estuary within this Borough, apart from in two areas; a small part 
of the frontage in Hamble village and some stabilisation of the cliffs at Netley with proposals 
to ‘hold the line’ along these frontages.  
 
4.37 The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) operates within the terms of the Marine and Coastal Access Act (2009) and the Marine Policy Statement. It is responsible for the 
preparation of Marine Plans and Marine Licensing.  The MMO is  finalisin g a new marine plan 
for the Southern Inshore area of the coast which includes the coastline of Eastleigh Bor ough. 
Marine plan area boundaries extend up to the level of mean high water. The Marine 
Management Organisation require marine licences for activities involving a deposit or removal of a substance or object below the mean high water springs mark or in any tidal river to the 
extent of the tidal influence. As a result of the spatial overlap between the plans, regard will 
need to be given to this Local Plan as the marine plan is finalised . 
 
4.38 The whole of the Borough’s coast is of national and international importance for nature 
conservation, and is included in the Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation and the 
Solent and Southampton Water Special Protection Area and Ramsar site nature conservation 
designations.  In response to concerns of increased recreational pressure on birds within 
protected areas of the Solent as a result of the proposed development in south Hampshire, the  
Solent Recreation Mitigation Partnership (SRMP) was established. A mitigation strategy  for 
PfSH local authorities is in place.  The Solent Waders and Brent Goose Strategy will be 
applicable to developments affecting SPA functional land (high tide roosts used by birds for 
which the SPA is designated).  
 4.39 The River Hamble also has a long heritage of boatbuilding and other marine activity and is of considerable local and national significance for recreational sailing.  Related to this are 
supporting commercial activities including boatyards and other marine- related enterprises. 
These make an important contribution to the economy of the Borough and of south Hampshire. 
Recreational sailing contributes significantly to the local economy as well as providing an 
important local amenity. The boatyards are also part  of the Borough’s marine heritage.  The 
Council therefore considers it important in principle to retain the existing boatyard sites in 
marine- related business uses.  
 4.40 Other forms of water -related recreation include coastal and riverside walks, fishing and other 
water sports. The coast and River Hamble are attractive in landscape terms and highly valued 
locally. Efforts are in progress to extend the proposed national coastal path along the River 
Hamble up to Bursledon Bridge.  
 
4.41 On the River Hamble there is potential for conflict between protection of the international 
designation and the commercial and recreational activities on the river . Careful management is 
needed to achieve a balance between them.  The River Hamble Harbour A uthority (Hampshire 
County Council) manages the river, and has produced a Strategic Plan, Strategic Vision and a Business Plan
20.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
4.42 The harbour authority for Southampton Water is Associated British Ports, which has 
responsibility for the provision and maintenance of harbour facilities (quays, wharves, piers 
etc.); navigational safety in the harbour, including maintenance dredging; the movement and 
berthing of ships; licensing construction of works in the harbour; and nature conservation and 
the preventi on of pollution.  
 
 
4.43 The policy recognises the unique characteristics of the River Hamble and the Southampton 
Water whilst enabling the continuation of recreational and commercial uses traditionally 
associated with the river and that contribute to the local and sub -regional economy. The 
Council will seek to protect the coast and its inshore areas from development detrimental to 
their character.  
 
4.44 The influence of the coast extends inland, although the extent of it can be difficult to define by 
means of a boundary.  For the purposes of the Local Plan, on- shore areas relating to the 
coast are defined as areas adjoining the water, or related to the coast in visual, (including 
views of the coast from the water), landscape, biodiversity,  heritage or functional terms.

• Historic parks, gardens and landscapes;  
 
• Scheduled monuments, nationally important ancient monuments and archaeological sites, and their settings;  
 
• protected wreck sites; and 
 
• Marine, rail and aviation heritage assets.  
 
 
Strategic policy S 8, Historic Environment  
 
1. The Borough Council will continue to conserve and/or enhance the Boroughs heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their significance. This includes all heritage assets 
including listed buildings and structures, Conservation Areas  as designated on the 
policies map, landscapes and archaeology. This will be through the preparation of Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans and other strategies and in the 
determination of planning applications for new development (see policy DM12). This will involve:  
 
a. identifying the assets by means of an on -going programme of survey and review;  
b. identifying their key features and measures to manage and enhance these, e.g. 
through Conservation Area Appraisals;  
c. restricting development likely to harm them or their settings through 
management of development proposals; and  
d. encouraging development that enhances them, ensures their l ong- term 
management and maintenance and where possible, enables public enjoyment 
and the interpretation of the asset.  
 
4.46 In accordance with the NPPF, policy S8  sets out the strategic approach to conserving and 
enhancing the Borough’s historic environment. This strategic approach does not affect the 
principle of development at the other site allocations in the Lo cal Plan but may affect their layout 
and detailed design. Development proposals will be assessed against the detailed development 
management policy DM12. In addition, Chapter 6 includes site- specific requirements for 
heritage assets and their settings for development allocations. Policy BO7 sets out criteria for any future development at the Grade II listed Botley Mill and includes retaining the character 
and setting of the Mill.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
Strategic policy S 9, Green infrastructure  
 
1.  Through new development and other initiatives the Borough Council will seek to 
achieve the provision, retention and/or enhancement of the follo wing forms of multi -
functional green infrastructure, includ ing provision of : 
 
a.  landscape scale strategic links across the Borough boundary, to and between the Borough’s settlements, the countryside, the coast, and the major areas of 
open space including the country parks (see strategic policy  S12); 
b. interlinked publicly accessible open space through new and existing 
development including for example formal sports facilities and informal amenity 
spaces and cemeteries (see policies DM3 2-DM3 4, Chapter 5 and detailed 
proposals in Chapter 6);  
c.  green inf rastructure incorporated into all new development with 
multifunctional spaces connected by primary, secondary and tertiary green 
links;  
d.  interconnected urban green infrastructure within the fine grain of existing and 
new development including green, cycle ways, paths and linkages between 
community facilities and open spaces to link community facilities;  
e.  green stepping stones such as street trees, green roofs and walls, pocket 
parks and urban copses (see policy DM1, Chapter 5);  
f.  connected habitats linking the network of designated sites and existing 
priority habitats, taking account of the Hampshire ecological network map (see policy DM11, Chapter 5);  
g.  incorporation of historic buildings and landscapes, including historic 
parks and gardens within the wider Green Infrastructure to protect their 
setting (see policy DM12, Chapter 5); and  
h. opportunities  for local food growing including allotments, community orchards 
and farms (see policies DM32  to DM3 4, Chapter 5 and detailed proposals in 
Chapter 6).  
 
 
4.48 Green infrastructure incorporates spaces and habitat with varying functions which are 
connected by  green and blue links that can be accessed by people and wildlife.  Green 
infrastructure can include accessible countryside and coast, publicly  owned land, cemeteries, 
community allotments and orchards, nature reserves, sustainable urban drainage etc. The aim 
of green infrastructure is to link these areas for people and wildlife by using linear corridors 
such as rivers, paths, cycle ways roads, r ailway, green verges and green links and stepping 
stones such as green roofs, street trees, pocket parks and village greens.  
  
4.49 The term ‘multi -functional’ refers to the variety of functions that the network can satisfy. These 
could include providing s afe green links between community facilities such as GPs, schools, 
places of work and local shopping centres, encouraging active lifestyles by providing leisure 
spaces within walking distance of people’s homes, improving physical and mental wellbeing 
through exercise  and physical activity. As well as complying with the Council’s policies and 
strategies, this would also help to meet the vision, strategic aims and objectives of the 
Hampshire County Council Physical Activity Strategy 2018- 21. These could also help with 
providing opportunities for local food production, flood alleviation, mitigating climate change, 
safeguarding and linking valued habitats and providing safe routes through the urban 
environment for biodiversity . The framework of green spaces and other natural features will 
support the sustainable development of settlements and increase the environmental capacity of the locality and region as a whole.    
43 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
4.50 The plan aims to protect, enhance, expand and connect green infrastructure and 
biodiversity networks. Given the wide- ranging nature of green infrastructure, its provision is 
addressed through a range of development management policies  which also set out the 
requirement for a Green Infrastructure Checklist to be completed by developers  to 
demonstrate how their new development delivers improvements  to green infrastructure .

include privately owned facilities such as public houses.  
 
 
Strategic polic y S10, Community  facilities  
 
1.  The Borough Council will work with Hampshire County Council, the health 
authorities, emergency  services, town and parish Council s, faith groups and 
voluntary groups to ensure the adequate provision of facilities to serve the 
Borough’s communities. In association with new residential development the Borough Council will seek the provision of:  
 
a.  new schools and enhancements to existing schools as advised by the education authority, including  
i.  new primary schools as required for the larger development sites (Chapter 
6); 
ii.   new secondary school s for the east of the Borough;  
b.  new and enhanced medical facilities as advised through engagement with 
all relevant healthcare service commissioners and providers in the area 
including an extension to the Stokewood surgery;  
c.  cemeteries to meet local needs (see policy DM3 7, Chapter 5 and detailed 
proposals in Chapter 6); and  
d.  other new and enhanced community infrastructure necessary to ensure the 
sustainability of the development.  This coul d include new multi -purpose 
commun ity halls, improvements t o existing halls, and, where feasible, local   
44 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  shops.  
 
4.52 The new housing proposed will give rise to a need for new community facilities, including 
schools, medical facilities and other community infrastructure such as cemeteries.  
 
4.53 With regard to schools, the new development proposed will require the provision of additional 
school places at both primary and secondary levels. The large strategic sites (at Boorley 
Green ; south of Chestnut Avenue, Eastleigh;  and west of Horton Heath) ar e required to include 
a new primary school.  For secondary education , the education authority (Hampshire County 
Council) is developing a new secondary school  at west of Woodhouse Lane, Hedge End to 
serve the new developments in the east of the Borough.  In addition to new schools, there is a 
programme of expansion to existing s chools  to increase the number of places available per 
year group.   
 
4.54 With regard to medical services, the Council  is working closely with the Clinical 
Commissioning Group to identify health care facilities required to serve existing and new 
development. This may include the expansion of existing surgeries and new facilities.  No 
new hospital provision is required.  Pl anning policies will need to be sufficiently flexible to 
enable on- going changes in patterns of provision of medical services and care.  
 
4.55 Also in association with the new developments the Borough Council will seek to secure the 
provision of new multi -purpose community halls and/or improvements to existing halls and 
where feasible, local shops. The intention is that these should be grouped with the new 
schools to form new local centres within each new community.  
 
4.56 A number of town and parish council s in the Borough have also identified a need for new 
cemetery provision.  This is addressed through general policy DM37, Chapter 5 and through 
site-specific allocations in Chapter 6. The community facilities being sought for each new 
strategic site and to resolve local deficiencies are set out in the site- specific policies in 
Chapter 6.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Strategic policy S 11, Transport infrastructure  
 
1.  The Council will work with the highway authorities, Solent Transport, transport 
operators, funding bodies and developers to minim ise transport emissions, 
pollution and congestion by:  
 
a.  ensuring new developments:  
 
i. encourage walking, cycling and the use of public transport;  and 
ii. minimise congestion and support safety on the highway network;  
 
as informed by appropriate transport assessments;  and  
 
b. safeguarding the routes and securing the funding to deliver new and 
improved transport infrastructure.  
 
2. The key proposals for new and improved transport infrastructure in the Borough 
are as follows:  
 
a. the Eastleigh Cycle Route Network and improved pedestrian routes as set out in the Solent Transport Delivery Plan, the Hampshire County Council/Eastleigh Borough Transport Statement, the Eastleigh Cycling Strategy, the Eastleigh 
Walking Strategy and strategic policy S1 2 below;  
b.  the Transforming Cities Fund public transport, cycling and walking upgrades on 
the following corridors:  
i. Southampton – Chandler’s Ford –  Winchester;  
ii. Southampton – Portswood – Eastleigh – Fair Oak;  
iii. Southampton – Bitterne – Hedge End –  Bursledon – Hamble;  
 
c. enhancements to the railway system to improve access to Southampton Airport 
Parkway from the east; and  
d.  local improvements to railway stations and bus services and  infrastructure to 
enhance their accessibility and use .  
e.    new or improved road accesses into Eastleigh River Side associated sites, 
including the new Chickenhall Lane link road  (see E6, E7, E9,  and 
paragraphs 6.4.31  – 6.4.40); 
f.  the Botley bypass, comprising a new road bypassing Botley to the north of the 
village and improvements to Woodhouse Lane (see BO5,  Chapter 6, section 6.5  
and paragraphs 6.5.78  – 6.5.8 2); 
g.  a new road linking Burnetts Lane and Bubb Lane, serving the Chalcroft 
Business Park and new development west of Horton Heath (see WE1  and WE2, 
Chapter 6, section 6.5, HH1, Chapter 6, section 6.1  and paragraphs 6.5.53  – 
6.5.55 ); 
h.  a new road to the south of Hedge End bypassing the Sundays Hill junction 
between Heath House Lane and Bursledon Road ( the Sundays Hill bypass see 
paragraphs 6.2.23 –  6.2.25 , Chapter  6, section 6.2); 
i.  a new road to the south of Hedge End linking the western end of the Sundays Hill bypass with St John’s Road (see HE4  Chapter 6, section 6.5 paragraphs 6.5. 31); 
j.  road corridor improvements (walking, cycling, bus and/or junction upgrades):  
i. Eastleigh to Fair Oak ( see policy E8  and paragraphs  6.1.30 – 6.1.35; 6.4.4 4 
– 6.4.4 9) 
ii. Hamble Lane  (see paragraphs 6.2.26 –  6.2.2 7) 
   
47 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  k.  additional junction improvements at  
i.   Botley (as set out  in policy BO6 and paragraphs 6.5.84  – 6.5.85); 
ii.   Eastleigh (as set out  in policy E8 and paragraphs 6.4.44  and 6.4.46  – 6.4.52 );  
iii.  Fair Oak and Horton Heath (as set out in paragraphs 6.1.36 –  6.1.37 );  
iv.  Hedge End (as set out  in paragr aphs 6.5. 28 – 6.5.34 ) 
v.   West End (as set out in paragraphs 6.5.53  – 6.5.55) 
 
l.  improvements to junctions 5, 7 and 8 of the M27 motorway and to other 
junctions identified as being in need of improvement in the Highways England Roads Investment Strategy, Hampshire County Council Local Transport P lan, 
the Solent Transport Delivery Plan,  the Hampshire County Council/Eastleigh 
Borough Transport Statement , the transport assessment of the Pre- submission 
Local Plan and other st rategy documents, including improvements to the 
Windhover roundabout  and A27 in Bursledon and the creation of smart 
motorways;  
   
4.58 The Borough Council has undertaken a transport assessment to identify where 
improvements to transport infrastructure are likely to be needed.  
 
4.59 HCC and Solent Transport documents including the Local Transport Plan, the Transport Delivery Plan, the Public Transport Delivery Plan and the Eastleigh Borough Transport 
Statement have identified key road junctions and routes in the Borough  where improvements 
are likely to  be required to resolve existing transport issues. These include routes where there 
is already significant peak hour congestion, such as the Eastleigh - Fair Oak  corridor , Hamble 
Lane and the Windhover roundabout and Junction 8 on the M27 motorway.  
 
4.60 In connection with new or re development proposals, the development strategy also includes 
some new road proposals. These include the Chickenhall Lane l ink road to open up existing 
and new employment sites at Eastleigh River  Side and in the vicinity of the airport,  a new road 
link between Burnetts Lane and Bubb Lane to facilitate development at Horton Heath and 
resolve existing issues of access to the Chalcroft B usiness Park  (this scheme is now 
committed) , the Botley bypass  and a link from the south -eastern part of Hedge End to M27 
junction 8 to facilitate  new development at Boorley Green, Botley and east and south of Hedge 
End and to help resolve existing transport issues  (this scheme is now under construction) . The 
Transport Assessment with this plan identifies the implications of the proposed developments 
and identified proposed improvements to junctions and routes to mitigate adverse effects.  All 
schemes will be designed to avoid adverse impacts on any European site in accordance with 
policy DM11.  
 
4.61 The Council is also proposing improvements that are needed for other reasons, in particular the 
provision of the Botley bypass, which is needed to relieve the village of significant flows of 
through traffic that are affecting air qualit y, its historic environment, the quality of life for 
residents and visitors and its economic viability as a local centre and heritage asset (see BO5 
and related text, Chapter 6, section 6. 5). 
 
4.62 In terms of public transport, the Borough Council (in conjunction with other local partners) will 
continue to work with and/or lobby train operators, Network Rail, the Department for Transport and the Three Rivers Rail Partnership regarding improvements to the rail network in the 
Borough and wider sub -region. The Council has sought (and will continue to seek) the following 
improvements in particular:  
 
• Regular direct services to Southampton Airport Parkway from the east ( i.e. Portsmouth   
48 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  area);  
 
• A minimum half -hourly  service at all stations serving the Borough (as most local 
stations currently only receive an hourly service that is often viewed as an inadequate 
alternative to driving even on routes where rail offers a direct alternative to the car);  
 
• Direct rail services that better replicate journey opportunities provided by the M27 and 
M3 and provide a better alternative to driving e.g. Hedge End to Southampton Airport 
Parkway and Southampton Central, Bursledon to Eastleigh and Winchester;  
 
• Suffici ent space on all services, including at peak hours, for commuters in trips within 
the Borough /South Hampshire to have a seat.  
 
4.63 Some of these improvements may be deliverable utilising the existing infrastructure and hence 
could be delivered via the rai l franchising process.  However it is likely that some of these 
improvements would not be feasible without investment in infrastructure. Potential 
improvements could include redoubling current single track areas on the Botley line, and 
improvements in the Eastleigh station area to support more reversing trains ( e.g. a fourth 
platform).  One proposed infrastructure intervention which the Council is less supportive of is 
the Eastleigh Chord proposal, as it is felt that this would result in improved train services 
bypassing Eastleigh town centre. It could also complicat e delivery of the Chickenhall Lane Link 
Road. This is a high priority road scheme that the Council strongly supports . It could also 
impact on current employment land and could complicate development at Southampton Airport. 
At present, it is unlikely that any of these rail infrastructure improvements could occur until 
towards the end of the Local Plan period.  
 
4.64 In addition the Council will continue to work with Network Rail, the train operators and local stakeholders (including the Three Rivers Rail Part nership) on more localised improvements to 
railway stations and related facilities in the Borough .  
 4.65 The Council also works closely with bus operators to improve their services in and through the Borough.  This includes discretionary provision of financial support for a range of commercially 
unviable but socially necessary bus services (especially in the evenings and at weekends) and 
Council funding and delivery of improvements to bus stops, shelters and other minor schemes. 
The Council will also work with Hampshire County Council  to deliver bus priority to address the 
issue of congestion on key bus routes.   
 
4.66 Southampton Airport is a major ‘gateway’ to south Hampshire and is located almost entirely in 
Eastleigh Borough.  The Council works with Southampton Airport Ltd through a local Airport 
Consultative Committee on development of the airport and surface access to it.  The Local Plan policy for development at Southampton Airport is at E9 , Chapter 6 section 6. 4. 
 
4.67 There are opportunities for park and ride northwards  from Stoneham Lane playing fields to 
serve the Chandler’s Ford business parks and potential other areas including Eastleigh town 
centre and Southampton city centre.  
 
4.68 Details of, and justification for, each of these proposals are set out within  the site specific 
policies in Chapter 6 and/or in the Solent Transport Delivery Plan and the Hampshire 
County Council /Eastleigh Borough Transport Statement. In addition,  information regarding  
the costs and timing of these proposals are included in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan (IDP) and will be kept under review in future updates of the IDP.  Detailed transport

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  assessment required in support of proposals to develop the Local Plan site allocations may 
also reveal a need for off -site works additional to those identified in strategic policy  S11 
and in Chapter 6 of the Local Plan.  Schemes will be designed without adv erse effect on 
any European site in accordance with policy  DM11 .   
 
4.69 Implementation of the proposals listed under policies S11 and S12 and detailed in Chapter 6 as 
well as any other off -site works that are required will take place through related development 
and/or be fully or partly funded through developer contributions (community infrastructure levy or other planning obligations –  see Chapter 7).  It is recognised that such contributions may not 
cover the full costs of all the schemes and that other funding sources may need to be found.  
These could include funding from the Solent LEP or secured through Solent Transport (the 
Local Transport Body), Borough Council funds, government grants and other sources.  
 
4.70 In the collection and apportionment of developer contributions, priority will be given to 
securing an appropriate proportion of this funding towards mitigating the impact of 
development proposals on the highway network , in liaison with Hampshire County Council 
as highway authority.    Proposed mitigation measures are set out in strategic policy  S11 
above and the detailed transport proposals in Chapter 6.  They reflect those set  out in the 
Transport Assessment and are also included in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan.   Further 
guidance will be provided in an update to the Council’s Planning Obligations 
Supplementary Planning Document.  
 
 
 
Footpaths, cycleways and bridleways  
 
Strategic policy S 12, Strategic footpath, cycleway and bridleway links  
 
1. The Borough Council in partnership with the highway authority will seek to create 
new, and improve existing, footpath, cycle and bridleway links throughout the 
Borough, connecting key destinations including the country parks, increasing access 
along the coast and to the South Downs National Park and improving connections between the parishes and Eastleigh Town Centre. The Council  will seek the provision 
of the following new and strategi c footpath/cycleway/bridleway routes as shown on 
the key diagram and the policies map:  
 
a. Forest Park to Otterbourne via Chandler’s Ford;  
b. Chandler’s Ford to Chilworth;  
c. Lakeside Country Park to Forest Park;  
d. Eastleigh to Botley via Bishopstoke, Horton Heath and Hedge End;  
e. Eastleigh to Hedge End parallel to the railway line;  
f. Eastleigh to Southampton via Stoneham Lane;  
g. Itchen Navigation to Stoke Park Woods;  
h.  Eastleigh/Bishopstoke to Itchen Valley Country Park and  Mansbridge via the 
Itchen valley;  
i. Bishopstoke to Fair Oak via Stoke Park Woods and on to the South  
       Downs National Park;  
j. Itchen Valley Country Park to Manor Farm Country Park;  
k. Manor Farm Country Park to Forest of Bere via Botley and on to the  South Downs 
National Park including the Botley to Bishop’s Waltham  Rail Trail;  
l. Boorley Green to Hedge End railway station;  
m. Botley to Fair Oak and on to the South Downs National Park;  
n. Botley to Hamble via Manor Farm Country Park;  
o. Botley to Southampton;    
50 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  p. Southampton to Hamble via the Royal Victoria Country Park and  Netley.  
 
2.  All of these routes will avoid conflict with established nature conservation 
interests and where possible be coupled with  green links for biodiversity.  
Working in partnership with the highway authority to agree and create highway 
including footpaths, cycle routes and bridleways will ensure that all new 
highway accords with appropriate design and construction standards to enable 
its adoption by the highway authority and so secure it s long- term maintenance.  
 
3.  New development should integrate with existing routes and public rights of way and 
wherever possible maintain, protect and enhance their function. Development  that 
would sever, obstruct or otherwise have a detrimental impact on the existing or 
proposed network of green routes as shown on the policies map will not be 
permitted.  
 
4.71 As part of its cycling and walking strategies  (subject to future update) , the related work to 
encourage use of alternative transport modes as part of the climate change strategy, and 
its contribution to the P fSH Green Infrastructure Strategy, the Borough  Council wishes to 
improve the network of multifunctional non- vehicular routes in the Borough, including 
footpaths and cycleways.  Given the importance of recreational horse -riding in the Borough , 
bridleways also form an important part of recreational provision, as well as contributing to 
road safety. (Note, however, that it wil l not always be possible to upgrade existing footpaths 
for use as cycleways or bridleways).  The P fSH Green Infrastructure Strategy includes 
proposals for a network of green routes through south Hampshire that serve both recreational and alternative transport purposes. In addition, the Borough Council has had regard to the Hampshire Countryside Access  Plan proposals for the Forest of Bere, the 
Solent and the Test and Itchen areas. The Borough Council will be preparing new walking 
and cycling strategies  in future to provide further detail on the Council’s priorities for 
infrastructure for these modes . Within the Borough , the Council has identified priority routes 
that: 
 
• link the main urban areas;  
 
• link the Borough’s country parks, to enable longer -distance circular routes;  
 
• link to strategic areas of green space beyond the Borough’s boundaries, in 
particular the Forest Park in southern Test Valley and the South Downs National 
Park; and  
 
• take advantage of the Borough’s coastline , including working with partners  to ensure 
that the England Coastal Path follows the most suitable route in the Borough.  
 
4.72 The Borough Council will seek to secure these routes by ensuring the provision of new spaces 
and routes in association with new development, improvements to existing routes and 
countryside access agreements.   The approach will follow a ‘link and place’ approach, 
recognising the dual functions of streets and routes  as both part of the transport network and as 
places in their own right  and how these roles may vary along a route.  Hampshire County 
Council in its role as highways authority also has a role implementing these footpath and 
cycleway improvements.  In securing these  routes, the Council will ensure that they do not have 
adverse impacts on nature conservation interests, including those on the coast, and wherever 
possible will ensure that they help to manage recreational pressures on such areas whilst the 
routes themselv es may act as corridors for biodiversity. The Council also wishes to protect this   
51 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  network of routes from development that would harm or disrupt it.  
 
4.73 Details of the costs and timing of these proposals will be included in updates to the Council’s 
Infras tructure Delivery Plan.  The precise line of a route can be altered as an integral part of the 
design of development provided its function is still served.

Policy DM1, General criteria for new development  
 
1. All new development should (as relevant):  
 
a.  not have an unacceptable impact on, and where possible should enhance:  
i.  residential amenities  of both new and existing residents ; the character and 
appearance of urban areas, the countryside and the coast;  
ii.  biodiversity  (avoiding significant adverse impacts) ; and  
iii.  the significance of heritage assets;  
 
b.  make efficient use of the site, maximise opportunities to increase density  and 
have regard to potential development opportunities on adjoining land;  
c.  take full and proper account of the context of the site including the character, 
appearance and land uses of the locality or neighbourhood, and be compatible 
with adjoining uses and be well integrated with t hese in terms of mass, scale, 
materials, layout, density, design and siting, both in itself and in relati on to 
adjoining buildings, spaces and views . Where adjoining development is poor in 
urban design terms, new development should contribute to improving the 
character of the area ; 
d.  not involve the loss of or damage to trees, woodlands, hedgerows, ponds, 
priority  habitats  or other landscape features of value to the character of the 
area, for appearance  or biodiversity unless they can be replaced with features 
of equivalent or enhanced value , (recognising that some species and habitats 
may be irreplaceable) ; 
e.  include a landscape scheme covering the design and layout of external

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  space;  
f.  protect and enhance public rights of way and National Trails and provide 
fully connected green infrastructure that inter laces the development and 
connects into the wider network ; 
g. provide satisfactory management arrangements for all landscape, green  
infrastructure  and biodiversity enhancement ; 
h. incorporate provision for people  with disabilities and create accessible 
communities that cater for all ; 
i.   incorporate design measures to inhibit criminal and anti -social behaviour;  
j.  incorporate provision for on- site waste management; and  
k.  include provision for public art associated with new large scale development in 
accordance with the Council’s adopted Public Art Strategy.  
 
5.3 Other policies of this Local Plan address the principles of sustainable construction and layout 
and impacts on local communities (DM2), internal space standards for residential 
development ( DM32 ), pollution (DM 8), and access and parking ( DM13  and DM14 ). 
 
5.4 The Borough Council is strongly committed to promoting good design in all new 
developments and to improving the quality of public spaces. As well as making sure that so far as possible new developments fit in with their  surroundings, good design includes 
meeting the needs of occ upiers and users of the spaces and buildings including those with 
disabilities, and must make provision for adequate living spac e (DM30).  It also includes 
creating places where people feel safe, opportunities for anti -social and criminal behaviour 
are limited and there is access to green space to encourage play and exercise.  Green 
infras tructure and other building design measures can also help to limit the heating effects 
that can arise through the concentration  of buildings and vehicular activities in  urban areas 
(known as the ‘heat island effect’) –  such measures are referred to as ‘urb an cooling’. The 
Borough Council’s S upplementary Planning Documents ‘Quality Places’
30 and ‘Character 
Area Appraisals’31 provides more detailed information on the principles of  design and 
layout.  
 
5.5 New development will be assessed to consider its impact on residential amenity. This covers the amenity of existing residents living at or near the development and also the amenity of new residents. Resi dential amenity covers a vari ety of issues including 
overlooking, loss of daylight , loss of outlook, noise, fumes and dust  and the impact of 
floodlighting and security lighting. It includes the design of garden space and parking 
arrangements  in addition to  building design.  
 
5.6 All major development proposals should be accompanied by a Planning Statement which 
should explain the basis for the design of the scheme, including how  it accords with this 
Local Plan, the supplementary planning documents and other documents as referenced in 
these, and with the National Planning Policy Framework.  
 
5.7 The Planning Statement should also explain and justify the removal of site assets such as 
landscape features and propose suitable mitigation for their loss . In the case of trees, a new 
Trees SPD will set out the detailed requirements for trees within development sites, which 
should be retained wherever possible. Where this is not possible, it will provide guidance on the 
suitable mitigation required.  Where trees may  be adversely affected by the proposed 
development, the Council will require the applicant to submit a tree survey in accordance  with 
the methodology set out in BS5837:2012 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and 
construction – recommendations’ and an Arboricultural Impact Assessment and method 
 
30http://www.eastleigh.gov.uk/supplementaryplanningdocuments  
31http://www.eastleigh.gov.uk/supplementaryplanningdocuments    
56 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  statement.  The Council may make a Tree Preservation Order covering trees on the site to 
prevent the loss of trees during the planning process. Trees having a high arboricultural or 
landscape value should not be removed unless:  
• the benefits of the development clearly outweigh the value of the tree;  
• the loss of the tree is unavoidable; and  
• suitable new trees can be planted to replace any tree removed.  
 
5.8 All developments that will lead to the loss of any green space or habitat should be 
accompanied by a Biodiversity Mitigation and Enhancement Plan (BMEP), informed by a Phase 1 Extended Habitat Survey and any other up to date species specific survey as agreed 
with the Local Planning Authority. The BMEP must include details of the biodiversity features 
affected as well as details of proposed mitigation and enhancement measures.  Pre-
application engagement with the Council and Natural England is encouraged.  
 
5.9 Green infrastructure should be integrated into the design of new development as part of the 
overall design of the landscape and external environment, and the developer should submit a 
Green Infrastructure Checklist to demonstrate that a net overall increase will be achieved 
which can be attributed to the development scheme (strategic policy S9). Native planting 
should be used to form the structural landscape of new development schemes connecting with adj oining green infrastructure.  Where public rights of way ru n through a development 
site, they should be retained within an attractive setting, and contributions sought to enhance 
the local public right of way network.  
 5.10 The Borough Council achieves very high rates of recycling of domestic refuse, and wishes to ensure that this success is continued. Developers should make provision for the storage of 
waste and recyclable materials as part of the design of external space  in accordance with the 
Council’s Quality Places SPD.  
 
5.11 In addition, the Borough Council is pursuing measures relating to:  
 
• Community safety, through working with other organisations and authorities on the Community Safety Partnership Plan
32. This takes as its  starting point the Crime and 
Disorder Act 1998, which requires local authorities to do all they can to prevent crime 
and disorder in their area.  
• Provision for disabled people, through its Equality and Diversity Strategy33 and 
Accessible Homes Strategy34. Most provisions for disabled people are dealt with under 
the Building Regulations, which are separate from planning legislation. However, developers should be aware of these requirements throughout the design process.  
• The provision of public ar t through its Public Art Strategy
35. This aims to support 
PfSH cultural initiatives by promoting the highest standards of design for new 
development with integrated public art which in turn provides opportunities for 
community engagement and creative industries to participate in the economic 
growth of the area.  
 The Council’s strategies for these matters should be taken into account when preparing development proposals.

5.12 Climate change is likely to affect the Borough  in a number of ways. This section looks at 
means of managing development in order to help to address some of the causes of 
climate change such as carbon- dioxide emissions, and its effects including both flooding 
and water shortage. It also looks at  how development might adapt to the unavoidable 
effects of climate change. Eastleigh Borough Council Climate Change Strategy provides 
more information about the implications  of climate change for the Borough.  
 
5.13 Since the publication of the 2011- 2029 Local Plan, t he Code for Sustainable Homes was 
withdrawn and policy DM2 sets out the Council ’s approach to securing environmentally 
sustainable residential development in the Borough.  As Eastleigh borough is in an area of   
58 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  serious water stress as justified in the backgr ound paper36, this  includes a requirement to 
apply higher water standards. Reduced water consumption c an contribute to achieving 
nutrient neutrality  or similar . 
 
 
Policy DM2, Environmentally sustainable development  
1. The Borough Council requires that:  
 
a.    all new build residential development (C3 Use Class only) must achieve at the 
time a Reserved Matters or Full Planning Application is submitted:  
 
i.  a 19% improvement in predicted carbon emissions, compared with the 
building regulations standard current at the time, through increased 
energy efficiency of the building fabric, unless this is superseded by an 
updated building regulations requirement equivalent to ‘zero carbon 
homes’ ; and   
ii. a predicted mains water consumption of no more than 110 
litres/ person/ day. 
 
b. all other development that is above  500 sq.m of floorspace  measured externally 
(including extensions and conversions to existing buildings) must  achieve 
BREEAM ‘excellent’ (or equivalent) or BREEAM ‘very good’ plus ‘passivhaus’ 
certification including a 15% improvement in predicted carbon emissions, compared with the building regulations current at the time, through low or zero 
carbon energy generation on site or in a Borough location agreed by the Council.  
 
c. all other larger developments above 10,000 sq.m of floorspace should also seek 
to fund post occupancy evaluation (POE)  in addition to the above . 
 
2.  In addition to the above, all  development above 500 sq.m of floorspace measured 
externally (including extensions and conversions to existing buildings) and external 
spaces within the curtilage serving developments of this size should where practical 
and viable:  
 
a.  incorporate energy- efficient passive design principles, the best use of  natural 
daylight and natural ventilation systems wherever possible;  
b.  connect to any existing near or adjacent low carbon local energy network  
      unless this is proved unviable;  
c. use recycled, low embodied carbon, low environmental impact and locally 
sourced materials in construction where possible;  
d.   be designed with sufficient flexibility to enable the life of the building to be 
extended by re- use for other purposes where feasible;  
e.  aim to deliver at least 1% of all residential units within the whole scheme which 
achieve full ‘ passivha us’ certification . 
 
5.14 Environmentally sustainable development should also include sustainable urban drainage 
systems (SuDS)  as set out in  policy DM6  below.  
 
5.15 This policy reflects the  national housing standards,  PfSH climate change strategy, and is 
supported by the Council’s own Climate Change Strategy. It is designed to maximise energy 
and water -saving measures in new development, and to encourage the introduction of such 
measures in existing development. Fuel povert y is a significant and increasing problem in the 
Borough, a problem  which increased energy efficiency for new and existing homes can help to 
 
36 Water  Efficiency Background Paper 2018   
59 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  combat. The Council recognises that these measures may involve the use of innovative building 
styles and techniques .  The Borough Council will also promote improvements in efficiency of 
energy and water use in existing developments through a programme of publicity and grant aid.  
 
5.16 BREEAM37 is a nationally applied method for assessing the environmental sustainability 
credentials of new development across a wide range of issues. Developments must be 
assessed independently by assessors funded by the developer and licensed by the Building 
Research Es tablishment. Since January 2012 all non C3 use class residential and non-
residential development (above 500  sq.m of floorspace) has been required to meet the 
BREEAM ‘excellent’ standard.. The Code for Sustainable Homes standards previously requested by the  Council have been withdrawn by the Government and policy DM2 above 
replaces these standards.   
 
5.17 The ‘passivhaus
38’ or ‘passive house’ standard uses an internationally applied performance 
method focusing on very high fabric efficiency which results in homes and non-residential 
buildings with no or insignificant space heating or cooling demand and a very low overall primary 
energy requirement.  For the purpose of 1% of all residential units achieving full ‘passivhaus’ 
certification, the whole  scheme will relate to a development allocation or site as a whole and not 
to individual plots and development parcels that obtain planning permission.  
 
5.18 Passive design seeks to maximise building efficiency through exploiting natural processes for 
daylight,  ventilation and winter sunlight. The relevant design principles are explained in the 
Environmentally Sustainable Development SPD.   
 5.19 Since January 2012 all residential development and all non C3 use class residential and non-
residential development (above 500  sq.m .) in the Borough has been required to reduce its CO
2 
emissions by 15% via on site low or zero carbon energy production.  The policy continues this requirement  with regards to  criteri on 1. b. above , either by means of on -site provision or through 
connecting to a nearby energy network. The details of  how this might be quantified will be set 
out in a future update of the Environmentally Sustainable Development SPD.  
 
5.20 The true level of success in terms of environmentally, socially and economically sustainable 
development can only be known after the development’s performance has been assessed.  
Post occupancy evaluation ( POE) is designed to measure how well developments perform. A 
further explanation of this process is set out in the glossary. Details  of what the POE should 
cover will be set out in a future update of the Environmentally Sustainable Development SPD.  
 
5.21 Larger developments have commensurate impact on their neighbouring communities but also 
often offer greater opportunities for sustainable development. Early assessment (at masterplan 
stage) of the economic, environmental and social sustainability opportunities of such developments can ensure that these opportunities are taken and that these developments are 
well integrated with existing communities.   
 
5.22 The embodied CO
2 and other greenhouse gases of construction is significant as a proportion of 
the total lifecycle CO2 emissions of new buildings. Developers will be encouraged to use the 
highest rated building products in the BRE ‘Green Guide’ and to re -use buildings and materials 
where possible.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Policy DM 3, Adaptation  to climate change  
 
1.  All development should be designed to adapt to the predicted climate change impacts 
for th e Borough . 
 
a. To reduce the potential impacts of surface w ater flooding, sustainable drainage 
systems need to be implemented as part of an integrated SuDS strategy f or the 
site in accordance with policy DM6 (Sustainable surface water management and 
watercourse management) and as part of the landscape framework for the site 
including green open space and green roofs where appropriate . 
 
b. New development should have a cooling strategy which can include:  
i. cooling through generous green infrastructure and trees  
ii. areas of shade  
iii. water cooling  
iv. building design and orientation to reduce overheating  
v. ‘cool roofs’ or green roofs and green walls  
vi. porous cool pavements 
 
c.   To adapt to water stress, new development should be designed to reduce 
demand.  
 
Measures can include:  
i.  reduced residential mains water consumption (as per policy DM2 ) 
ii.  water efficient appliances, fittings and leak detection devices for non -
residential and non C3 use class residential development  
iii.  rainwater harvesting and grey water recycling 
iv.  drought resistant landscape design  and planting 
 
 
5.23 In terms of adaptation to climate change, the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09)39 provide 
information designed to help those needing to plan how to design buildings and spaces to 
adapt to a changing climate. Key findings that may affect Eastleigh Borough include:  
 
• an increase in air temperatures, with greater increases in summer than in winter across the whole UK but greatest in southern England;  
 • decreases in summer precipitation of around 40% in the far south of  England;  
 
• more precipitation is expected to fall in intense episode especially in the winter, and 
more severe and frequent winter storms are also predicted;  
 
• sea levels predicted to rise by between 12 and 72 cm by the end of the century.  
 Developers therefore need to s how how their proposals are adapted to heat waves and 
droughts as well as more severe winter precipitation. Typically such measures will include 
retention of trees and other urban green infrastructure  and water features (see strategic 
policy S9, Chapter 4 and  policy DM 1), and landscapes designed to cope with drought and 
provide sustainable drainage systems (policy DM 3 and DM6) .  More detailed advice on how 
developm ent can adapt to climate change is provided by the Environment Agency.

5.24 Buildings and spaces that are able to adapt to changing circumstances or that can serve a 
variety of user are inherently sustainable and help future proof development . The use of

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  trees, shading, landscaping and building design as part of a cooling strategy  will also have 
a range of positive impacts including on air quality and quality of life. The Council will 
encourage the provision of non -residential buildings that can be extended  or rearranged 
internally and homes that can be extended or adapted.  
 
 
Polic y DM 4, Zero or low carbon energy  
 
1. The Borough Council will permit the development of infrastructure to:  
 
a.   generate zero or low carbon energy; and/or  
b.  make more efficient use of energy sources e.g. installations deploying combined heat and power (CHP technology);  
 
2.  Subject to general development criteria and provided that the development:  
 
a. has no significant adverse impact on the landscape or landscape 
features, biodiversity or the significance of heritage assets;  
b.  does not involve the loss of land in public recreational use (see  policy 
DM32); 
c.  does not involve the permanent loss of the best and most versatile 
agricultural land (BMV)  
 
5.25 There are many ways in which low or zero carbon energy can be generated, ranging from 
photovoltaic panels installed on house roofs to larger -scale power generating installations such 
as solar farms. The policy is intended to enable such installations in line with current 
government initiatives, subject to other policies protect ing local amenities, recreational, 
landscape, biodiversity and heritage interests and the best and most valuable agricultural land 
(Agricultural Land Classification grades 1, 2 and 3A). (Note, facilities for micro- generation are 
not always appropriate on l isted buildings or in conservation areas).  
 5.26 The Borough Council will give priority to the generation of electricity from renewable sources. 
An environmental impact assessment is likely to be required for any power s tation proposals in 
the Borough . 
 5.27 The Borough Council actively encourages the development of combined  heat and power 
sources, and the sharing of such sources over a local area,  including in Eastleigh town 
centre.  
 
 
Policy DM 5, Managing flood risk 
 
1. Development will only be permitted within the areas at risk of flooding, now and in the 
future, as identified on the Environment Agency most recent flood maps and the 
Council’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment provided that:  
a. it me ets the sequential and exception test (where required) as outlined in 
Government guidance;  
b. a site– specific flood risk assessment demonstrates that the development, 
including the access, will be safe without increasing flooding elsewhere, and 
where possible, will reduce flood r isk overall;  
c. the scheme incorporates flood protection, flood resilience and resistance measures appropriate to the character and biodiversity of the area and the 
specific requirements of the site  and where appropriate takes  advantage of 
opportunities to utilise natural flood management techniques ; 
d. appropriate flood warning and evacuation plans are in place; and    
62 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  e. new site drainage systems are designed taking account of events which exceed 
the normal design standard.  
 
2. Development should not increase flooding elsewhere.  
 
3.  Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) must be designed in accordance with policy 
DM6. 
 
5.28 Parts of the Borough are at risk from tidal, fluvial or other forms of flood risk.  Development will 
only be permitted in these areas if it meets all of the criteria set out in policy DM5, which also 
reflect Government policy.  Natural flood management techniques are those which use natural 
processes to reduce the risk of flooding, for ex ample: restoring the bends in rivers, changing the 
way land is managed so that the soil can absorb more water, or creating coastal salt marshes.  
Policy DM6, Sustainable surface water management and watercourse management  
 
1. New development (excluding extensions to dwellings and changes of use), will only be 
permitted if it incorporates Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS).  Wherever feasible, 
naturalised filtration should be included within the treatment train as follows:  
 
a. On sites of 1 hectare or more, or within 100m of the River Itchen SAC or Solent 
Maritime SAC, SuDS schemes should include at least three forms of naturalised 
filtration . On sites within 100m of headwaters and tributaries draining into a SAC, 
SuDS schemes should include at least three forms of naturalised filtration unless 
hydrological studies and project -level Habitats Regulations Assessment 
demonstrate this to be unnecessary to protect the integrity of the SAC and its 
qualifying features;  
b. On other sites of be tween 0.5 hectares and 1 hectare, SuDS schemes should 
include at least two forms of naturalised filtration; and  
c. On other sites of less than 0.5 hectares non -naturalised SuDS e.g. permeable 
paving will be considered where justified.  
 
 
2. In order to reduce flooding and maintain water quality (in accordance with DM8)  
SuDS schemes should:  
 
a.  be designed and monitored in accordance with the CIRIA C753 SuDs Manual or 
equivalent national or local guidance, noting that all receiving waters in the 
Borough should be classified as protected waters;    
b.  manage surface water runoff as close to its source as possible;  
c.  ensure that discharge rates are reduced as far as possible and that on greenfield 
sites these should at least mirror greenfield rates before development ;  
d. be provided as part of any application for outline or full planning permission;  
e.  where discharge is to a wetland or wet woodland habitat, flows off site must 
mirror the natural hydrological pathways ; 
f. include clear arrangements for their whole life management and maintenance.   
 
3.  Where a watercourse is present on a development site, it should be retained or 
restored into a natural state and enhanced where possible.   The culverting of any 
watercourse will not generally be permitted, and development should wherever 
possible remove any existing culverts and increase on- site flood 
storage.    Development should be laid out to enable maintenance of the watercourse.  
 4. Where development drains into a waterway connected to the Natura 2000 or Ramsar 
network a site specific Construction Env ironment Management P lan must be prepared 
before  permission . 
   
63 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
5.29 Eastleigh Borough is characterised by its internationally renowned rivers Itchen and Hamble 
and the associated coastal habitats along the upper reaches of the Hamble and Itchen 
Estuaries and Southampton Water. The River Itchen is designated as a Special Area of 
Conservation for its aquatic flora and associated fauna species under the E. U Habitats 
Directive and much of the River Hamble is designated as a Special Area of Conservation 
for its coastal habitats, and a Special Protection Area for its migratory and breeding bird 
populations under the E. U, Habitats Directive and the E. U. Birds Directive respectively. The 
Hamble is also designated under the Ramsar convention for its wetland habitats and 
associated species. Because of  these International and European designations East leigh 
Borough Council has a duty to ensure that there are no significant impacts on the Natura 2000 and Ramsar network as a result of any plans or projects including those determined within planning under the Article 6 (3) of the Habitats Directive as trans muted into British law 
within the Conservation of Habitat and Species Regulations 2010.  
 
5.30 Due to the extent of the rivers Eastleigh Borough is interlaced with a number of major 
tributaries and associated streams with the eastern part of the Borough  flowing into the 
Hamble and the central and western areas flowing into the Itchen. Some of the creeks and 
gullies run directly into the designated coastal Solent Complex. T he complexity of the 
network means that almost all of the major developments propos ed are adjacent , or within 
close proximity , to a waterway within the network with surface water from the developments 
draining into either the Itchen or Hamble catchments. The Habitats Regulations 
Assessment (HRA) prepared for the Local Plan has identified that there will be an in-
combination impact on the water quality and flows within the Natura 2000 and Ramsar 
network in the Borough  as a result of the proposed development and has recommended 
that this be mitigated at source within the site.   
 5.31 To ens ure no pollution of the waterways during construction a Construction Environment 
Management Plan (CEMP) should be provided detailing the safeguards in place to ensure 
the safe storage and use of fuels and chemicals and the design, management and maintenanc e of a separate construction drainage system with three forms of temporary 
filtration. For schemes subject to HRA the CEMP should be submitted with the planning 
application.  
 
5.32 Temporary filtration could include straw bales, silt curtains and intercepto rs, bunds ditches, 
swales and filter drains, attenuation areas and settlement ponds and tanks and oil 
interceptors .  
 
5.33 To ensure no adverse effect on the integrity of designated sites  within the operational phase 
the HRA recommends that a Sustainable Drainage System be provided which either 
infiltrates directly into the ground at source or contains forms of naturalised filtration to 
ensure water quality is treated before discharge ; and that flows from the site should be  
reduced as far as possible, as specified by the policy . Naturalised filtration requires much 
less maintenance than mechanised filtration.   
 
5.34 Naturalised forms of filtration include, green roofs, vegetated swales, att enuation areas and 
basins, ponds, rain gardens and wetlands. Other more mechanised forms can be used to 
drain the urban area on the larger sites provided  the three naturalised forms are present at 
the end of the treatment train. In sites where sites are draining to natural wetland habitats or 
wet woodland before entering the river , the flows off site will need to mirror the natural 
hydrological pathways.  
   
64 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  5.35 The policy is also designed to limit the impact of surface water flooding from new 
development.  On previously developed (brownfield) sites the aim should be to reduce runoff 
rates and volumes.  On greenfield sites the aim should be to ensure that there is no increase 
in the rate and volume of surface water runoff.   Well-designed naturalised SuDS  will have 
wider benefits for flood risk management, water quality protection,  biodiversity, health, 
recreation and water resource management.  
 
5.36 Surface water run -off should be managed as close to its source as possible, and as high 
up in the following hierarchy as reasonably practicable:  
 
1. Into the ground (infiltration)  
 2. Into a surface water body  (provided this is not a designated site)  
 
3. Into a surface water sewer, highway drain or other drainage system  
 
4. Into a co mbined sewer  
 
5.37 Development proposals should include an indicative drainage strategy to demonstrate 
how sustainable drainage will be incorporated into the development . This strategy should 
be proportionate to the site and the proposed development .  The strategy should include 
sustainable drainage elements with attenuation, storage and treatment capacities 
incorporated as set out in the  CIRIA SuDS Manual C753,  or equivalent an d updated local 
or national design guidance where available.  If SuDS are proposed as part of the open 
space prov ision on a site, gradients should not exceed 1:4.  
 
5.38 From April 2015, Local Planning Authorities have had the final decision about the suitability of SuDS provision on new development , while Hampshire County Council is a 
statutory consultee for major developments which have surface water implications. Proposals for sustainable drainage systems should include provisions for long term future maintenance of these systems, and developers should consult the Borough Council, 
Hampshire County Council and the Environment Agency as appropriate about such 
proposals . The expectation is that SuDS will be adopted by a public body.  
 
5.39 The policy also addresses the situation where a watercourse is present on a development 
site.  Such watercourses should not  generally  be culverted, as this can impede water 
flows and worsen flooding.  In exceptional cases, where is no practicable alternative or the 
negative impacts are minor, applications to culvert a watercourse may be approved.  
Hampshire County Council, as  Lead Local Flood Authority, consents works on ordinary 
watercourses and has  adopted the principle that crossings of watercourses should be 
made using  clear -span bridges in preference to culver ts. 
 5.40 To avoid disputes over the maintenance of watercourses, to protect them from future 
interference and to ensure access is available for maintenance, the layout of major sites 
should be designed so that no gardens back on to the watercourse and there is no 
development within a  distance of at least 8 metres from the top of the bank.  Wider buffer 
strips may be appropriate for larger watercourses  and where needed to protect 
biodiversity interests .  Such buffer strips should form part of the landscape framework  for 
the site, and arrangements should be made for their long- term management and 
maintenance . 
 
   
65 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Policy DM7, Flood defences, land reclamation and coast protection 
 
1. Development proposals on the coast of Southampton Water, the River Hamble 
estuary and in other areas at risk of fluvial or surface water flooding should:  
 
a. not give rise to the need for additional flood risk management or coast 
protection works beyond those proposed in the approved management 
plans*; and/or  
b.   provide or contribute to the costs of works needed to protect the site as set out 
in the management plans*; and  
c.  have regard to watercourse ownership and long -term management.  
Flood defence and coast protection works  will be permitted provided that they 
accord with the approved management plans*.  
 
2. Land reclamation will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that it will not:  
 
a. impede the movement of craft or otherwise compromise navigational safety 
on the  coast or river; or  
b. disrupt existing recreational uses or areas where there is existing or 
proposed public access; or  
c. adversely affect the nature conservation, landscape or heritage value of the 
coast or river.  
 
*The approved management plans are:  
 
• the North Solent Shoreline Management Plan41; 
• the Environment Agency’s Catchment Flood Management Plan42 and;  
• the Local Flood Risk Management Strategy43 and the Eastleigh Borough Surface 
Water  Management Plan44 
 
 
5.41 Parts of the Borough’s coastline are subject to slow erosion, particularly along the shores of 
Southampton Water.  For example, the low cliffs fronting Netley are retreating gradually.  
Lower lying areas around Hamble are also susceptible to inundation from the sea, which is 
likely to worsen with sea- level rise. The North Solent Shoreline Management Plan identifies 
the areas likely to be affected by both erosion and flooding over the years 2005- 2105. The 
policy seeks to prevent development that would worsen these conditions, or give rise to a need for new flood defence or coast protection measures.  This is due to the need to preserve 
the rare invertebrate communities that colonise the Netley cliffs.  
 
Notes:  
 
i. Applications for dredging will be determined by the Marine Management Organisation 
and lie outside of the planning jurisdiction of the Borough Council . 
ii.   Water supply and waste water infrastructure are addressed in a general policy 
relating to public utilities – see policy DM 9.

5.42 The Borough is subject to various types of pollution, in particular air pollution from traffic, 
noise from major roads and the airport , and land contamination from industrial activity and 
the tipping of waste.  
 
 
Policy DM8, Pollution  
 
1. Development will not be permitted if it is likely to cause loss of amenity or impact on 
public health or other unacceptable environm ental impacts through:  
 
a. air pollution (including odours or particulate emissions);  
b.   pollution of surface, underground, coastal waters or other watercourses;  
c.  noise or vibration;  
d.  light intrusion,  both generally and with respect to the South Downs National 
Park’s status as an International Dark Night Skies reserve; or  
e.   land contamination.  
 
2. Development susceptible to particular forms of pollution will not be permitted:  
 
a. where it will be adversely affected by such pollution, unless measures can be 
taken that adequately mitigate the polluting effects; or  
b. where it would inhibit existing economic or other activities giving rise to 
acceptable polluting effects.  
 
3. Where a development site is known or suspected to be contaminated, before the 
site is  developed the Borough Council will require the contamination to be 
remediated to a standard where as a minimum it cannot be defined as  
‘contaminated land’ under Part IIA of the E nvironmental Protection Act 1990.  
 
5.43 Government advice in the NPPF makes it clear that the prevention of pollution is a planning 
concern.  The Borough Council will give considerable weight to ensuring that new 
development does not give rise to new pollution, suffer from existing sources of pollution, or 
inhibit legitimate economic activities giving rise to otherwise acceptable polluting effects  
(e.g. noise). Development proposals that may adversely impact upon European designated 
sites must comply w ith Habitats Regulations. The Council will prepare a Supplementary 
Planning Document providing guidance on assessing pollution, criteria that will be used in   
67 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  assessing the likely pollution impacts of development proposals, and preferred measures to 
prevent , minimise or mitigate impacts.  
 
5.44 Developers will be required to undertake the necessary surveys and provide information about 
how pollution impacts will be managed with their proposals. This includes providing a 
Construction Environmental Management P lan (CEMP) to address any impacts during 
construction phases. For development that is likely to give rise to pollution, or be susceptible to existing pollution, and sites that are known or suspected to be polluted, developers are advised 
to undertake early  consultation with the Environment Agency and the Council’s Environmental 
Health Service. Pollution includes effects likely to arise from demolition or construction 
activities on the site. Where permission is only given on the basis that polluting effects will be  
mitigated or remediated, the Council may remove permitted development rights from the site.  
 
5.45 Where development sensitive to or likely to generate pollution is proposed, adequate 
information in the form of site reports and assessments carried out by a competent person must 
be supplied with the planning application to allow the potential or actual impacts to be 
assessed.  Details of any mitigation required should be supplied to the Council for approval 
prior to commencement of the scheme. Further  assessments and reports will also be required 
to show that  the polluting effects have been controlled to the agreed standard, and that the  
mitigation or remediation measures taken will remain effective for the lifetime of the pollution risk identified. Wh ere the risk of pollution is severe, the Council may restrict occupation of the 
development until satisfied that the pollution has been addressed.  
 5.46 The standard of investigations, assessments, including risk assessments, remedial schemes, and verification reporting must be that of current UK good practice. The intended SPD will 
provide further guidance and advice on the investigation and assessment of pollution effects.  
 
5.47 Air quality: The Council has an on -going duty to review and assess ai r quality, and has 
declared a number of air quality management areas (AQMAs) associated with traffic. Air quality will be a material consideration:  
 
• within and adjacent to such areas, or  
 • where the development could give rise to the need for such an area to be designated, or  
 
• where the development would prevent an air quality action plan being implemented.  
 
The Borough Council will require developers to address means of mitigating air pollution, in 
particular measures to reduce traffic congestion (including the implementation of Travel Plans 
by businesses and developers) . While the provision of green infrastructure such as trees has 
been shown to have some beneficial effects on ambient air quality  (and the Council will seek 
the replacement of at leas t two trees for each one lost in Eastleigh) , this cannot be regarded 
as a measure that will be effective on its own in addressing air pollution in the designated 
AQMAs.  Planning Practice Guidance states that measures should be specific to the location 
and development and proportionate to the likely impact. It provides a list of examples of 
mitigation that could be used to address air pollution.   
 
5.48 Water: the legal requirements of the Water Framework Directive require full consideration to 
the quality and quantity of ground and surface water bodies in order to meet at least ‘good’ 
status or ‘good ecological potential’ in all water bodies by 2027. The Counci l has a role in 
supporting the delivery of these objectives. It is essential that development does not cause deterioration in the status of water bodies. Where possible, schemes to enhance the status of   
68 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  the water bodies should be undertaken.  
 
5.49 Noise:  The adverse effects of exposure to excessive noise and vibration on health and quality 
of life are well documented and recognised as a material planning consideration. The Council 
supports the approach of the Noise Policy Statement for England in r elation to the effective 
control of noise within the context of sustainable development. Any proposals likely to 
generate  noise (including demolition and construction noise) will be expected to take account 
of the impact of this on any noise sensitive population, including those using recreational areas. Similarly, in assessing proposals for noise sensitive development, the Council will expect the developer to take into account existing noise levels and foreseeable changes to 
these. In doing so, developers must avoid significant adverse noise impacts to residential 
amenities. Development proposals should ensure that they mitigate and minimise adverse 
noise impacts and, where possible, contribute to the improvement of health and quality of life. 
Where necessa ry, the Council will require a noise assessment which will be expected to:  
 
• identify all significant sources of noise;  
 
• assess the likely short and long term impacts of noise generated or exposure to 
noise; and  
 • propose noise protection measures.  
 
Wherever possible, developments should use site and building layout and design to 
manage levels of noise on development sites. Where acceptable internal noise levels 
cannot be met with open windows, alternative ventilation will be required.  Whe re the 
development site is affected by air pollution in addition to noise, early consideration of the location of air ventilation inlets is recommended.  The following standards will be used to 
assess the acceptability of development proposals affected by steady external noise sources:  
 
In respect of the Solent and Southampton Water SPA and Ramsar sites  and supporting 
habitat , construction noise should be kept below 69dBA max either alone or in combination 
with other developments  (measured at the sensitive receptor which is the nearest point of 
the SPA/Ramsar or supporting habitat) during the bird overwintering period , or works timed  
so that they do not coincide with the wintering bird season. Natural England will provide 
advice on a case by case basis where construction noise exceeds 69dBA max .

5.50 Light: Lighting can have a significant impact on people’s perception of their 
environment  and t he South Downs to the north east of the Borough is specifically  
designated as a Dark Sky reserve due to its  low levels of light pollution (the areas of 
the National Park closest to the Borough are designated as Dark Sky Zone E1(b) 
Transition Zone in the South Downs Local Plan dark night skies policy) . At night, the 
main distinction between urban and rural areas  is that the former are lit and the latter 
are not.  Light spillage is a material consideration because it can cause discomfort 
and loss of privacy and obscure the night sky.  However, well designed lighting can 
improve people’ s perception of public safety and the environment.  Lighting to the 
sky, onto hedgerows and directly into waterways  can cause impacts on bats, 
nocturnal species and migratory fish. The Council will seek to ensure that  lighting 
from development does not cause unacceptable environmental or amenity impacts, 
whilst also providing appropriate illumination (for example in respect of highway and community safety or sporting facilities).   
 5.51 Land contamination: Where a proposed development site is known or suspected to 
be contaminated, or where sensitive development is proposed, the responsibility lies 
with the developer to demonstrate that it can and will be made suitable for the 
proposed use with a satisfactory standard of residential amenity provided.  This 
means that the developer must  be able to assure the Council that there is no 
unacceptable short or long term risk of harm to human health, the environment, property and/or pollution of controlled and designated waters.    
 
5.52 Assessments of land contamination are expected to follow the advice contained in 
CLR11 Model procedures for the management of contaminated land, and British 
Standard BS 10175:2011 +A1:2013 ‘Investigation of potentially contaminated sites –  
Code of Practice’, and BS 8576:2013 Guidance  on investigations for  ground gas, 
permanent gases and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)  or as subsequently 
updated.  A typical site assessment would be carried out by a competent person and 
would include:    
70 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
• Site Characterisation – desk study and/or site investigations that allow for the previous 
use, contaminant, pathway and receptor linkages to be identified and develop a 
conceptual model of the site;  
 • Risk Assessment  – characterisation and assessment of the impacts of the risks posed to 
proposed and existing receptors from the hazards identified; and  
 
• Remediation Scheme – identification of appropriate risk management measures (remedial 
works or protective measures) to mitigate unacceptable risks. This will include appropriate 
verification, validation and certification to ensure compliance with the scheme.

Policy DM 9, Public utilities and communications  
 
1. The development of new and improvement of existing utilities infrastructure essential 
to meet the needs of  new and existing communities will be encouraged and permit ted 
subject to the other policies of this plan.  In the event of conflict with other policies of 
this plan the Borough Council will require a full justification including an assessment 
of alternati ve means of provision.  
 
2. New development will only be permitted if the essential utilities infrastructure including communications infrastructure required to serve it is available. Where of f-  
71 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  site utilities infrastructure is not adequate to serve a development site, developers 
will be required to contribute to the costs of new off -site provision in consultation 
with the utilities providers.  
 
3. The development of new telecommunications infrastructure will be permitted 
where:  
  
a. it will enhance broadband speeds and the quality of telecommunications services; and  
b.    all possible steps are taken to minimise the environmental impact of the 
development, and it can be demonstrated that alternative sites and means of 
provision including mast -sharing have been examined and there are no feasible 
alternatives to the proposal.  
 
4. The Council will encourage developers to make provision for the installation and 
maintenance of  telecommunications infrastructure within new developments . 
 
 
 
5.53 It is essential that new development can be provided with utilities infrastructure such as water 
supply, waste water disposal, energy ( electricity  and gas), and telecommunications.   In 
addition, development sites can be crossed by existing utilities infrastructure such as power 
lines, gas pipelines, sewers, water pipelines etc.  In such cases, developers should agree with 
the utilities providers arr angements for connection to and/or diversion of such infrastructure 
and any additional provision required to serve the development prior to the submission of a 
planning application.  
 
5.54 Communications refers to modern telecommunications technology such as high-  speed 
broadband, 4G and other similar systems.  Telecommunications play  a vital role in supporting 
economic development.  Good telecommunications provision can also enable flexible working 
practices which limit the need to travel. For these reasons the Borough Council is keen to 
encourage the installation of telecommunications equipment and facilities to serve new 
development sites , in accordance with national guidance in the NPPF.  
 
 
Water and Waste Water  
 
Policy DM 10, Water and Waste Water  
 
1. Where new water supply or waste water infrastructure is required or proposed in 
support of new development the development will be phased alongside the provision of the infrastructure to ensure:  
 
a. compliance with the Habitats Regulations;  
b. that there is no deterioration of the status of water bodies which might impact 
adversely on Water Framework Directive requirements;  and  
c. the avoidance or mitigation of any other adverse impacts.  
 
2. Wherever possible measures should be implemented which would improve the water 
environment . 
 
5.55 Planning Practice Guidance notes that adequate water and wastewater infrastructure is 
needed to support sustainable development and that a healthy water environment can deliver 
multiple benefits such as helping to enhance the natural environment generally and adapting to 
climate change.

5.56 PfSH and its constituent local authorities, including Eastleigh Borough Council  have  produced 
an Integrated Water Management Strategy (IWMS)  which was endorsed by Pf SH in June 2018 
as part of the collective evidence base to inform the preparation of future local plans .  The 
IWMS identifies  at a strategic level any measures associated with water abstraction/supply and 
waste water treatment works and other appropriate measures such as nutri ent neutral 
development to ensure no adverse impact on internationally important ecology designations 
protected by the Habitat Regulations (e.g. the River Itchen Special Area of Conservation [SAC] 
and the Solent maritime SAC and Solent and Southampton Water SPA and Ramsar) ; and to 
ensure compliance with the Water Framework Directive.   PfSH and its constituent authorities 
have committed to continue to work together with key stakeholders including the Environment 
Agency, Natural England and the water companies to deliver the IWMS action plan and to 
ensure t hat it meets the requirements for the Local Plan (‘programme level’) habitats 
regulations assessment . 
 
5.57 The Council has also committed to work with Southern Water to ensure that any  
constraints at waste water treatment works can be addressed, there is  sufficient capacity 
to ensure water supply and to improve utilities infrastructure to meet the needs of existing communities.  Developers should contact utilities providers to establish requirements in 
respect of all the proposed site allocations.  Development should include SuDS  to reduce 
surface water entering the sewage system  (see policy  DM6 Sustainable surface water 
management and watercourse management) .

Overview of nature conservation issues in the Borough  
 
5.58 The Borough contains areas of international, European and national conservation interest, 
focused mainly on the rivers and coast . A network of locally designated sites contains ancient  
and wet  woodlands, wetland, species -rich meadows and remaining or former heathland. 
Development in the Borough could have effects on these and other sites beyond its boundaries, 
for example through recreational pressures, surface water run- off and traffic emissions . Areas of 
particular sensitivity outside but within reach of the Borough include other parts of the Solent 
coastline and the New Forest. In relation to development proposals in south Hampshire, there 
are concerns about the impact on migrating and over -winte ring birds on the Solent shores and 
the New Forest due to increases in recreational pressure from new development. P fSH has 
worked with Natural England and others as part of the ‘Solent Recreation Mitigation Partnership’ which has developed a definitive st rategy to implement mitigation measures to address this 
impact jointly across south Hampshire. The Council will contribute as required to the 
implementation of the SRMP’s proposals, and will also implement any measures identified as 
part of its own interim  project proposals which are not incorporated into the wider SRMP 
scheme . Where development may impact on high tide roosts used by birds for which the Solent 
and Southampton Water SPA is designated, mitigation may be required taking account of  the 
Solent W aders and Brent Goose Strategy.
 
 
5.59  The Council has produced a Biodiversity Supplementary Planning Document which explains 
the nature conservation interest and site designations in the Borough  and the ways in which 
the Council will protect and enhance them. The Council has also produced a Biodi versity 
Action Plan (BAP), revised in 2012, which defines Priority Biodiversity Areas and Priority 
Biodiversity Links. Priority biodiversity areas include the Biodiversity Opportunity Areas in the 
Borough identified by the South East Biodiversity Forum and other areas, including some that 
are subject to various forms of nature conservation designation. They cover areas which hold 
the greatest concentrations of priority habitats, species and land where there is potential to 
enhance or restore priority habita ts. Priority biodiversity links include land where there is an 
opportunity to enhance, restore or create areas, corridors or stepping stones of habitat to 
facilitate the movement of priority species. They can join or link priority biodiversity areas.  The 
importance of connecting sites is also recognised in the Local Nature Partnership’s work on a 
strategic approach to the delivery and enhancement of a Local Ecological Network (LEN)  for 
the county .  
 
5.60 All the sites subject to nature conservation designations are identified in policy DM11  and 
shown on the policies maps. The priority biodiversity areas and links are shown in the 
Biodiversity Action Plan.  
 
   
74 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Policy DM11, Nature conservation  
 
 
General Approach  
 
1. The Council will work with statutory and voluntary agencies and developers, and 
will determine planning applications, to:  
 
a. protect, conserve and enhance all:  
i.  international, national and local nature conservation designations; 
and 
ii. networks of natural habitats and features, including the Local 
Ecological Network, Priority Biodiversity Areas and Priority 
Biodiversity Links, watercourses, wetland complexes, woodland 
trees, and trees and hedgerows important to biodiversity and local 
character;  
and facilitate their adaptation to climate change wherever possible;  
 
b.  assist in achieving national, county and local biodiversity targets as set out in 
Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs);   
c. seek a net gain of biodiversity on all development s ites (including sites for 
redevelopment) through the protection, enhancement and connection of 
existing and provision of new habitats and features of nature 
conservation interest compatible with the native biodiversity characteristics of the Borough, having regard to local geodiversity and 
soils; and  
d. contribute to major elements of the PfSH Green Infrastructure Strategy 
and other strategies for the provision and enhancement of multifunctional green infrastructure including green routes, ecological networks and 
biodiversity enhancements (see strategic policy S 9).  
 
International Designations 
 
2. Development which is likely (either individually or in combination with other 
developments) to adversely affect the integrity of an international or European nature 
conservation site will not be permitted subject only to imperative reasons of 
overriding public interest and securing any necessary compensatory measures in the 
absence of alternative solutions.  A ‘project level’ Habitat Regulations Assessment will be required where there are likely significant effects or uncertainty. Any 
mitigation measures re quired to ensure no adverse impact must be implemented at 
the appropriate time.  
 
 
3. The Council will work with PfSH, Natural England, the Environment Agency and 
other wildlife organisations to develop and implement with developers a strategic 
approach to  the protection and enhancement of international and European sites 
from the direct and indirect effects of development.  Within Eastleigh Borough this 
will include:  
 
a. implementing:  
i. the Solent Recreation Mitigation Strategy (requiring contributions from 
residential developments within 5.6 kilometres of the Solent Special 
Protection Area to the Strategy); and  
ii. the interim and any future New Forest Recreation Mitigation Strategy if   
75 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  required;  
or alternative agreed site specific measures to address recreational 
disturbance;   
b. preserving the water quality and flows within the Itchen and Hamble, 
Southampton Water and Solent;  
c. protecting the River Itchen SAC, in particular the maintenance and where 
appropriate restoration of habitats and qualifyi ng species to favourable 
conservation status (as defined by article 1 of the Habitats Directive); and  
d. seek contributions towards measures set out in the Southern Damselfly Conservation Strategy (or other strategy) specifically to deliver biodiversity 
net gain.  
 
National and Local Designations  
 
4. Development will not be permitted if it is likely (either individually or in combination with other developments) to have a direct or indirect adverse effect on a Site of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC)  
or Local Nature Reserve (LNR) as shown on the policies map (or on a more recent 
plan provided by the Hampshire Biodiversity Information Centre) u nless it can be 
demonstrated that:  
 
a. there are no alternative solutions;  
b. the adverse effects are unavoidable;  
c. measures are taken to mitigate or, as a last resort, compensate for the adverse 
effects;   
d. there is an overall biodiversity net gain; and  
e. if there are any residual adverse effects  which cannot be avoided, mitigated or 
compensated , the benefits of the development must clearly outweigh the 
adverse effects on the nature conservation value of the site and any broader 
impacts on national and local designations.  
 
Priority habitats, protected and priority species and the local ecological network  
 
5. Development will not be permitted if it is likely (either individually or in combination 
with other developments) to have a direct or indirect adverse effect on priority habitats, protected or priority species, or on the local ecological network unless it 
can be demonstrat ed that:  
 
a. there are no alternative solutions;  
b. the adverse effects are unavoidable;  
c. measures are taken to mitigate or, as a last resort, compensate for the adverse 
effects;  
d. there is an overall biodiversity net gain; and  
e. if there are any residual adverse effects, the benefits of the development clearly outweigh the adverse effects on prio rity habitats, priority and protected 
species, and the local ecological network.  
 
Irreplaceable habitats  
 
6. Development will not be permitted if it results in the loss or deterioration of 
irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient woodland and ancient or veteran trees), unless there are wholly exceptional reasons and a suitable compensation strategy   
76 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  exists.  
 
Buffer s 
 
7. Buffers free from development will be provided to designated sites to avoid/mitigate 
impacts, including recreational impact and impacts on edge habitats, and to maintain dark skies.  
 
Surveys 
 
8. Development will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that:  
 
a. there have been thorough habitat and species surveys;  
b. the great crested newt strategic survey and strategy have been considered in all 
developments within 500m of a great crested newt pond; and  
c. the strategic bat trapping survey has been  considered in all developments within 
the locality of a woodland or connected habitat networks.  
 
 
International  Nature Conservation Designations  
 
 
 5.61 The Borough contains parts of four European/international nature conservation sites as 
follows:  
 
• River Itchen Special Area of Conservation (SAC) ; 
 
• Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation (SAC);  
 
• Solent and Southampton Water Special Protection Area (SP A); and    
 
• Solent and Southampton Water Ramsar site.  
 
(The Solent Maritime SAC and the Solent and Southampton Water SPA and  
Ramsar site together comprise the Solent European marine sites ). 
 
5.62 In respect of the New Forest, the Council will continue to work together with partners to assess 
the impact of development proposals on protected areas and measures to mitigate any impacts 
as necessary. Eastleigh will also continue to work in partnership with New Forest District Council to help to deliver the Green Hal o. 
 
5.63 Under the E. U. Habitats Directive and the E. U. Birds Directive (as transposed into national law 
as the Habitat Regulations) and the Ramsar C onvention the Council  has a duty to give these 
areas the strongest protection against damaging development.  If a development proposal is 
likely to have a significant effect on one of these  sites, either alone or in combination with other 
projects, the Council will carry out an appropriate assessment to establish the implications of the 
scheme for the identified nature conservation interests of the site. The Council will seek to avoid 
any dam age to the integrity of these areas and the species they support. This may entail the 
negotiation of mitigation measures or contributions to such measures from new development.  
 
5.64 The Local Plan’s habitat regulations assessment has identified circumstan ces in which 
mitigation measures will be required to ensure there is no adverse effect on international 
designations.  Such measures must be implemented with the development.  Developments   
77 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  may also require project level HRAs to address their specific impac ts. 
 
5.65 Where mitigatory provision is needed, the over -riding principle is that as a minimum, no net loss 
should occur to biodiversity and a net gain should be secured where possible. This should factor 
in the uncertainty around achieving the requisite h abitat quality and the loss of biodiversity value 
for the period before the requisite value has been attained for European sites. Compensatory 
provision can only be considered where there are no alternative solutions and if ‘imperative 
reasons of overriding public interest’ (IROPI) for the project to proceed can be demonstrated.  
 
5.66 Through its Annual Monitoring Report the Council will monitor the effectiveness of the joint 
strategic approach to avoidance and mitigation of effects on European sites. It will respond to 
the findings of new evidence where necessary in order to preserve the integrity of European 
sites.  
 
 National  and Local Nature Conservation Designations   
 
5.67 There are five Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) in the Borough at: 
 
• Moorgreen Meadows ; 
 • Lincegrove and Hacketts Marshes ; 
 
• Upper Hamble Estuary and Woods ; 
 
• Lee-on-the-Solent to Itchen Estuary ; and  
 • River Itchen  
 
These sites are of national importance and protected fro m damaging activities by the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.   
 
5.68 In addition to the statutorily designated nature conservation sites there are others that are of 
local nature conservation value.  Sites of Importance for Nature Cons ervation (SINC) are 
identified on the policies maps during the Local Plan process, and are monitored and reviewed 
frequently.  On- going surveys can reveal new areas that warrant such protection.  Policy  DM11 
will be applied to any new  sites or extensions to existing sites until the policies maps can be 
updated in the next revie w of the Local Plan.  Up -to-date information about SINCs within the 
Borough should be sought from Hampshire Biodiversity Information Centre.  The appropriate 
size of buffers free from development will be considered on a site by site basis and informed 
by the results of surveys undertaken for each proposed development.  
 
5.69 Local Nature Reserves protect habitats of local significance. There are currently six Local 
Nature Reserves (LNR) in the Borough : 
 
- Hocombe Mead Local Nature Reserve  (Chandler’s Ford) ; 
- Mercury Marshes L ocal Nature Reserve  (Bursledon) ; 
- Hackett’s Marsh Local Nature Reserve  (Bursledon) ; 
- Netley Common Local Nature Reserve  (near Thornhill , Southampton ); 
- Westwood Woodland Park Local Nature Reserve (Netley Abbey) ; and  
- Manor Farm Local Nature Reserve  (Botley/Bursledon)  
 5.70 The Council will consider the designation of further Local Nature  Reserves on sites in the   
78 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Borough in the Council’s ownership or legal  control if the land is already being managed 
as a nature reserve, and is of  sufficient nature conservation interest to provide beneficial 
opportunities for  environmental education/research and/or enjoyment by the public. Local  
Nature Reserves can also be designated by the County Council - also by town/parish 
Council s if powers are delegated to them for this purpose.  
 
Other species and habitats  
 
5.71 The protection of certain species , and often the  habitat and other features that sustain them, 
is a legal obligation under the Habitats Regulations, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, 
the Countryside and Rights of Way Act  2000 and The Protection of Badgers Act 1992. The 
presence of such species is a material consideration in dealing with planning applications, 
and the Council will follow all Natural England guidance and standing advice or recognised 
best practice guidance.  Where protected species could be present applicants will be 
required to undertake survey work, assessment and propose mitigat ion before their 
proposals can be considered.  
 
5.72 Threatened habitats and species, known as Habitats and Species of Principal Importance 
(and also as priority habitats and species) have been identified within s41 lists within the 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act  2006. S40 states that Local Authorities 
and a number of other public bodies have a duty to conserve biodiversity and must have 
regard to these lists . 
 
5.73 Habitats and features that are important for wildlife but outs ide designated nature 
conservation sites are also necessary to maintain the biodiversity of the Borough. The revised Eastleigh Borough Biodiversity Action Plan (July 2012
45) sets out ways in which the Borough’s 
biodiversity can be conserved and enhanced, and defines Priority Biodiversity Areas and 
Priority Biodiversity Links . These are areas with the greatest concentrations of priority habitats 
and species  or potential to enhance or restore priority habitats and links where there is 
opportunity t o enhance, restore or create areas, corridors or stepping stones of habitat to 
facilitate the movement of priority species.  
 
5.74 There are ten priority biodiversity areas in the Borough at: Flexford and Hocombe, Chilworth, 
Allbrook, Lakeside and Fleming Park, Itchen Valley, Wyvern, Stoke Park, Moorgreen, Netley and Bursledon Commons, Solent Coast, Hamble Estuary and Ford Lake.  Priority biodiversity 
links have been defined at the Hampshire Corporate Business Park (Chandler’s Ford), Monks 
Brook, the M3 and M27 corridors, all the rail corridors, Bowlake (Bishopstoke), Knowle Park (Fair Oak), Chalcroft (Horton Heath), Moorgreen Stream (West End), Cricket Ground (adjoining 
the Ageas Bowl), Wildern (Hedge End), Marks Farm (Botley), Old Netley, Ticklefor d Gully 
(Netley), and Hamble Airfield.  
 
5.75 The local ecological network comprises the international, national and locally designated sites of 
importance for biodiversity, land functionally linked to these designations, local nature reserves, 
ancient woodland and veteran trees, protected and notable species and their habitats, sites identified for habitat restoration and/or the creation of compensatory measures for the adverse 
effects on biodiversity, appropriate buffer zones, and wildlife corridors that c onnect the above 
features (for example important hedgerows and watercourses).  Planning applications should be 
supported by an adequate and proportionate assessment of their effect on the network, and by 
mitigation or compensation and biodiversity net gain proposals as required.  
 
 
45 The revised Eastle igh Biodiversity Action Plan updated in July 2012 can be seen at: www .eastleigh.go v.uk/biodiversity     
79 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  5.76 In accordance with the Biodiversity Action Plan 2012- 2022 and the NPPF, the Council  will 
through the planning process  (including financial contributions through CIL or other 
mechanisms) secure the  enhancement of existing and the creation of new areas of nature 
conservation value-  for example as part of landscape schemes, environmental improvements  
and countryside management schemes associated with new development.  Such enhancement 
and creation of biodiversity inte rest will be sought  particularly within the Eastleigh Biodiversity 
Priority Areas and Priority Links.  The Council will also have  regard to opportunities to manage 
wetland habitats in ways that assist delivery  of the Environment Agency’s River Basin 
Management Plan46.  
 
5.77 All applications affecting greenfield sites or known biodiversity interests should be accompanied 
by a Biodiversity Mitigation and Enhancement Plan (BMEP) , agreed by the Council Ecologist at 
an early stage in the planning process . This will demonstrate  how the proposal delivers a net 
gain in biodiversity.  
 
5.78 Other policies in this Local Plan, for example those seeking to limit the use of the private car , 
and those relating to climate change and sustainable drainage will also assist with the mitigation of impacts on biodiversity interests.   
 
  
Policy DM12, Heritage Assets  
 
1. Development of a heritage asset or within its setting will be permitted provided  it 
does not harm or detract from the significance or special interest of  the asset, and 
sustains and enhances its special  character and qualities. The more important the 
asset, the greater the weight that should be accorded to this criterion. Perm ission 
for development which results in substantial harm to,  or loss of , designated assets 
of the highest significance w ill be wholly exceptional. Development which involves 
the demolition or destruction of any part of  other heritage assets will not be 
permitted  unless its removal or replacement would enhance or better r eveal the 
significance of the asset. In these circumstances, the developer will be required to record and advance understanding of the significance of any heritage assets to be 
lost, in a  manner appropriate to their importance and the impact, and to make t his 
evidence publicly accessible.   
 
a.   Development that affects an archaeological  site either above or below ground 
that is already identified or discovered through development proposals wil l 
only be permitted provided:  
i.   if the remains cannot be preserved in situ, the clear and convincing 
overriding public benefits of the development that cannot be achieved by 
any other means is sufficient to outweigh the value of the remains;  
 and 
ii. prior to the commencement of the development , provision has been 
made for a programme of archaeological investigation and recording and for this evidence to be made publicly accessible;  
b. It achieves a high standard of design which respects and complements the 
character and qualities of the heritage asset(s);  
c.    Where necessary, it secures the long -term future maintenance and 
management of the asset;  
d.    Where possible, it enables public enjoyment and interpretation of the

80 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  asset;  and 
e. A heritage statement is submitted with the application explaining the 
significance of the assets affected including the contribution made by their 
setting, at a level of detail proportionate to the asset’s significance ; the impact 
of the proposal on the significance of the asset; and how proposals have been 
developed to avoid harm or, if this is not possible, minimise the harm ; with 
mitigation measures proposed.  
 
2. In permitting development involving a heritage asset the Borough Council may seek a legal agreement to secure the long -term management and enhancement of the 
asset.  
 3. The Council will monitor buildings or other heritage assets at risk through neglect, 
decay or other threats, proactively seeking solutions for assets at risk through 
discussions with owners and willingness to consider positively development 
schemes that would ensure the repair and maintenance of the asset, and, as a last 
resort, using its statutory powers.  
 
 
5.79 Local authorities are required by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) 
Act 1990 to give specific protection to buildings and areas of special architectural or historic 
interest.  This includes identification of those parts of the Borough  that should be included in 
conservation areas. All the conservation areas have conservation area appraisals and most 
have been updated in recent years including reviews of their boundaries as S upplementary 
Planning Documents. Designation of conservation areas means that the Borough Council 
values and is committed to protecting the character of the areas, and is also looking for 
ways in which they might be improved.  It seeks to ensure development makes a positive 
contribution to local character and distinc tiveness, not to prevent development.  When 
dealing with proposals for development in these areas, particular attention will be paid to the 
details of design, to ensure that the character of these  areas  is as a minimum sustained, 
and where possible enhanced.  In the case of commercial premises in conservation areas, 
the Counci l will seek to achieve a high standard of shopfront design and signage related 
sympathetically to the character of the building and the s urrounding areas, avoiding 
proliferation of signs.  
 
5.80 For development in conservation areas outline applications will not normally be acceptable. 
The Council will normally require detailed plans showing elevations, materials and relationship 
to the neighbouring buildings and spaces including trees and other landscape features.  Those 
seeking to develop within conservation areas should have regard to the Council’s Conservation 
Area Appraisals Supplementary Planning Documents’47 
 
5.81 The Borough contains 184 buildings nationally listed as being of special architectural or historic 
interest, of which 9 are Grade II* listed and the rest  are Grade II (there are no Grade I listed 
buildings).  The Council has a statutory duty to protect these from the adverse impacts of development and from demolition and will continue to work with owners and agencies to seek 
to find viable uses for heritage assets that may be at risk. Many of these buildings also contribute to local character and identity.  The policy is designed to avoid damage to or loss of 
such buildings and their immediate surroundings.  
 
5.82 The Council has also identified buildings suitable for inclusion on a local list of buildings 
important for local heritage reasons.  The Council maintains records of listed building quality 
 
47 http://www.eastleigh.gov.uk/supplementaryplanningdocuments    
81 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  and condition, and is identifying and listing buildings of local heritage value. They are buildings 
that contr ibute to local identity and reflect locally significant parts of the Borough’s history.  
Although they have no statutory protection, the Council is keen to conserve these buildings for 
these reasons.  
 
5.83 In addition to buildings, there are parts of the Borough’s countryside that are of historic value, in 
particular parks and gardens. These again represent the history of the Borough and contribute 
to its character and identity, and wherever possible, they are to be protected from the adverse impacts of development. The Council works with other bodies including Hampshire County 
Council, the Hampshire Gardens Trust, H istoric England and local interest groups in the 
identification and conservation of these and other heritage assets.  In cases where the character 
of a local historic landscape has already been eroded to a significant extent, development  may 
be permitted that affects the landscape providing it is sympathetic to the remaining character of 
the area and the development includes a legal  agreement to secure the long term management 
and enhancement of the remaining his toric landscape asset.  In this context, ‘eroded to a 
significan t extent’ means that features that were characteristic of the historic landscape have 
been lost.  
 
5.84 Scheduled Monuments are protected by The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas 
Act 1979.  These are only one type of archaeological site. The Borough  contains a variety of 
archaeological sites including some of more recent origins such as the Itchen Navigation, 
remains of the old water meadows in the Itchen valley, and old green lanes. All thes e 
archaeological remains are by their nature finite resources, and vulnerable to damage and 
destruction.  The policy seeks to protect them so far as possible from the adverse effects of development.  
 
5.85 It is obviously preferable that heritage assets are used for the purpose for which they were 
originally intended.  However, given the age of some of them this may not always be possible, 
and the policy allows for alternative uses that  do not damage their character and would 
contribute to maintaining their heritage value.  
 
5.86 In some cases, development that would not normally be allowed may be justified as an 
exception to policy on the grounds that it provides the resources to secure the future of the 
heritage asset (‘enabling development’). The Council wi ll wish to be sure that applicants have 
explored all possible uses for the asset that are allowable under policy before making an exception, where necessary via a marketing exercise.  The optimum use will be assessed in 
the context  of the conservation of t he asset rather than maximising financial gain. The applicant 
may be required to enter into a legal agreement securing the future of the asset and its historic features.  
 
5.87 The value of heritage assets is enhanced if they can be enjoyed and understood by visitors.  
Such activity can also contribute to the local economy.  Policy  DM12  therefore enables the 
provision of facilities for interpretation provided these do not have advers e impacts on the 
heritage asset or other interests.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
5.89 The Borough includes two motorways and other main roads, several  main line railway s with 
eight  stations serving the Borough, a reasonably comprehensive bus network and an 
airport. It therefore has a wide range of access opportunities, but also suffers problems of 
peak hour congestion on the motorways and many of its roads.   
 
5.90 The Borough Council seeks to support Hampshire County Council’s Local Transport Plan 
and address local issues of road congestion and related air quality issues by:  
 
• Seeking to manage and reduce car use by  maximising density,  locating new 
development  close to the facilities it needs  (or by providing critical community 
infrastructure such as schools within major new developments in order to contain some trips within sites), improvement of public transport  services, infrastructure and 
associated factors such as multi -operator ticketing to help drive up usage, 
development of high quality cycling and walking networks , and encouraging the roll -
out of communications technology to enable more flexible working (see also policy 
DM9 Public utilities and communications);  
 • Continuing to pursue its strategies to improve public transport and pedestrian and 
cycle routes in the Borough, in particular improved pedestrian and cycle  links to the 
town centre, district centres, local centres and other key destinations  such as rail 
stations and schools .  See also strategic policy  S12, Strategic  footpath, cycleway 
and bridleway links;  
 
• Seeking investment in improvements to transport systems, including road and 
junction improvements, public transport and footpaths, cycl eways and bridleways  
from a variety of sources and partners including developers, central government, 
Solent LEP and other funders as opportunities arise. This includes activities such  as 
lobbying funders/decision makers and participating in and financiall y supporting 
external funding bids where appropriate ; 
 
• Safeguarding routes for potential transport improvements, including road, rail, bus, 
cycleway, footpath and bridleway infrastructure;  
 
• Having regard to the requirements of rail and bus operators;  
 
• Ensuring the provision of parking including opportunities for park and ride to meet 
the needs of the Borough’s residents and employers, and to facilitate access to the 
Borough’s public transport facilities;  
 
• Providing encouragement and support to enable individuals and organisations to plan 
their travel requirements  through measures such as Travel Plans, provision of travel 
information, and implementation of ‘soft measures’ intended to promote modal shift and 
manage travel demand ; and 
 
• Ensuring t hat comprehensive and up -to-date information is provided regarding 
prevailing conditions on the transport network using all available technologies.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Policy DM13 , General development criteria - transport  
 
1. All new development must have safe and convenient access to the highway 
network and make provision for access to, and by, other transport modes 
including public transport and cycle and pedestrian routes as appropriate . 
Access a rrangements to the highway ne twork must:  
 
a. meet national and local guidance and standards with all highway improvements 
meeting the standard required to be adopted  by the Highway Authority;  
b. not cause or increase danger to road users or have a significant detrimental 
impact on the  operation or safety of the highway network; and  
c. be provided without unacceptable environmental impact.  
 
2. All new development will be assessed to establish whether it should contribute to 
off-site improvements to tr ansport infrastructure in accordance with Hampshire 
County C ouncil’s Transport Contributions Policy, to the extent that these are 
necessitated by the development and proportionate to the scale of development.  
 
3. Development  proposals that will generate vehicle movements likely to have an adverse 
impact on traffic conditions beyond the immediate vicinity of the development site 
must be subject to Transport Assessment and will be required to incorporate and 
implement mitigation measures such as:   
 
a. provision of/contribution towards on and off -site highway improvements such as 
junction improvements and potentially new road links  
b. on-site pedestrian, cycle and public transport infrastructure  
c. contributions towards relevant off -site sustainable tr ansport infrastructure, 
public rights of way  and service improvements where approp riate 
d. on-site measures aimed at increasing uptake of non- car travel  options ( e.g. 
Travel Plans49)  to reduce car use . 
 
4. New development intended to serve or accommodate large numbers of people will 
only be permitted in locations that as well as having adequate road access, or will 
have as a result of the development,  are or can be served by means of transport other 
than the private car, including bus, train, cycle and pedestrian access.  
 
5.91 It is important  that new development can be accessed safely and that , to help manage car 
use, development is wherever possible accessible by means of transport other than the 
private car.  The layout of larger scale sites should provide for access by public transport vehicles , preferably through extending existing services to better serve the site .  The related 
requirements of the Local Transport Plan and the Eastleigh Borough Transport Statement are set out in Appendix B, paragraphs A11 to A13.  Transport assessments should be 
undertaken for development proposals as require d by site- specific policies in Chapter 6 and 
as advised by the highway authority.  Unless otherwise agreed with the highway authority, Solent Transport ’s Sub-Regional Transport Model
50 should be used wherever possible in 
order to ensure compatibility with other local transport assessment work.  In accordance with 
strategic  policy S12, new  development should integrate with existing footpath, cycleway and 
bridleway links.  Permeable walking and cycling routes should also be provided within the 
development.  
 
5.92 Strategic  policy  S11, Chapter 4 identifies the major new transport infrastructure that will be

85 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  required to serve new development.  These schemes are reflected in site- specific proposals 
in Chapter 6.  Hampshire County Council and the Borough Council also maintain a list of 
local transport improvements as set out in HCC’s  Eastleigh Borough Transport Statement  
and Eastleigh Borough Council ’s Transport Schemes Inventory , which include the footpath, 
cycleway and bridleway routes identified in strategic policy  S12, Chapter 4.  This provides a 
robust framework of local transport policy to justify the list of local transport schemes which are used as the basis for securing S106/S278/CIL funds collected by E astleigh Borough 
Council  and HCC.  Implementation of these proposals and any other off -site works that are 
required will take place through related development and/or be funded through developer contributions (community infrastructure levy or other planning obligations –  see Chapter 7).  
It is recogni sed that such contributions may not cover the full costs of all the schemes and 
that other funding sources may need to be found.  
 
Policy DM14 , Parking  
 
1. New residential development will be required to provide off -highway parking which 
is adequate in terms of highway safety/traffic management. Provision will take 
account of  the adopted  Eastleigh Borough Council’s Residential Parking Standards 
SPD which set s out minimum requirements for parking provision.  Over provision 
relative to car ownership levels or which would create an ineffective use of space 
will be avoided. Applications with parking levels which deviate away f rom the 
expected standard should be substantiated by robust evidence contained within the 
transport statement/assessment/travel plan.   
 2. For out -of-centre development proposals, parking needs will be assessed based on 
the impacts of the development on neighbouring town, district or local centre or a neighbourhood parade.  
 
3. Within town, district and local centres and in neighbourhood parades, parking 
needs will be assessed in relation to wider needs within the centre/parade.  Where 
existing provisi on is inadequate, the provision of additional parking may be  
permitted subject to a financial contr ibution towards measures to assist on- street 
parking management , public transport, cycling and walking.  
 
4. Proposals to provide new car parks, extend existing car parks or provide workplace park  and ride facilities w ill be permitted if:  
 
a. it can be demonstrated that this is the only way the transport requirements 
driving the proposals for car parking provision can be met;  
b. the proposals form part of a strategy aimed at managing use of the private car, 
such as a workplace travel plan; and  
c. transport and other environmental assessments demonstrate that the 
benefits of the proposal (e.g. reduction of on -street parking pressures, 
reduction of traffic congestion) outweigh any adverse effects; and  
d. the design, layout, planting and landscaping and lighting provision 
addresses visual  and landscape impacts, noise, lighting and impact s on 
residential amenity; and 
e. the developer pays for any off -site highway improvements necessary from 
traffic generated by the proposal, and any additional works necessitated by an 
inability to meet workplace travel plan targets; and  
f. for sites outside the urban edge and in accordance with other policies in the 
Plan , they are subject to a sequential approach prioritising sites within the 
urban edge. Proposals in settlement gaps will only be acceptable in   
86 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  exceptional cases  (see strategic policy S 6). 
 
5.93 Although the Borough Council generally seeks to manage car use and encourage the use of 
other ways of travelling, it has to be recognised that motor vehicles provide mobility and 
support the economic life of the area. The Council also recognises that provision of 
inadequate parking at new developments can create ‘overspill’ parking issues on the 
existing highway network which can have a variety of negative effects on existing residents 
and on the efficient and safe operation of the highway network. Off-  street parki ng is 
therefore required in accordance with the standards for residential and commercial 
occupiers with an uplift for visitor parking provision in the Borough Council in the Residential  
Parking Standards Supplementary Planning Document. This outlines how t he parking 
standards for residential sites can be reduced through the use of unallocated shared 
parking, when compared to minimum allocated parking requirements.  It also provides 
information about the appropriate design of car parking and requirements for electric 
vehicles charging points.   
 
5.94 In Eastleigh town centre and the surrounding areas which have  the best levels of local 
facility provision and public transport in the Borough, parking provision to a lower level than 
specified by the revised Parking Standards SPD can be appropriate if circumstances permit 
and measures such as car clubs are provided as part of a development. Flexibility within the town will allow imaginative schemes to come forward as part of any future regeneration.  
Parking in excess of the ‘ specified standard may be accepted if supported by a transport 
assessment.  
  
A prosperous place  
 
Economy  
5.95 Economic development includes:  
• Industrial and commercial development in use classes B2 , B8 and E(g)  
• Retail and other town centre development in use class E  
•   Certain sui generis uses such as pubs and hot food takeaways  
• Other forms of development that provide jobs, e.g. leisure, cultural activities, 
tourism and public services such as education and health.  
While all employment opportunities contribute to prosperity, some forms of employment 
also contribute particularly to increasing GVA51, which is a main objective of the PfSH  
Economic Development Strategy.

5.96 The Borough has a reasonably prosperous economy.  There is a need to maintain this 
prosperity and make provision for future growth. Strategic policies S2 and S4 (Chapter 4) set 
out the Council’s strategy for new employment development by means of allocating new sites , 
encouraging the regeneration of existing sites at Eastleigh River Side and in Eastleigh town centre, and by enabling a more intensive use of the Borough’s employment  land and other land 
that would be suitable for employment -related development.  
 
 
Policy DM15 , Safeguarding existing employment sites  
 
1. The major existing employment sites as identified on the policies map shall be 
retained predominantly in employment use classes B2,  B8 and E(g) . Within these sites 
the Borough Council  will permit:  
 
a.  the redevelopment and intensification of use of sites for Use Class B2,  B8 
and E(g)(ii)/(iii) employment uses;  
b.  changes of use between use classes B2 , B8 and E(g)(ii)/(iii) ; and  
c. workforce training opportunities as defined in  policy DM16  below;  
 subject to the general development criteria and transport policies of this 
Local Plan  including the impact on residential areas.  
 
2. Exceptionally, employment uses other than those in use classes B2 , B8 or 
E(g)(ii)/(iii) (but not E(a)/(b)/(c) uses or pubs,  drinking establishments or hot food 
takeaways) may be permitted on these sites provided that:  
 
a. they would not have a significant impact on the continued primary use of 
the site  
b. the existing site is causing, or could cause, significant  harm to highway safety 
or to the amenities of the area or to local residents  
 
3. The redevelopment or change of use of other existing employment sites not 
identified on the policies map  currently in class B2 , B8 or E(g)(ii)/(iii) uses to non-
employment uses,  where this is not permitted development , will be permitted 
provided that it can be demonstrated that the site is no long er in demand for 
employment use and that criteria a . and b. above are satisfied.    
88 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022    
5.97 The Borough Council considers that it is important to retain employment sites in employment 
use in order to retain a diverse choice of employment opportunities, to enable industries already established on these sites to grow, and to minimise the need to allocate further 
greenfield  sites for employment use. All the major existing employment sites were reviewed 
and found to be viable and valuable employment sites.  
 
5.98 There is a special policy for the Eastleigh River Side regeneration area - see E 6, Eastleigh 
River Side (Chapter 6, section 6. 4). 
 
 
Policy DM16 , Workforce training requirements and new jobs  
 
1. The provision of workforce training activities will normally be permitted on 
employment sites where they:  
 
a.  are related to employment uses on that site; and/or  
b. contribute to improving workforce skills for the Borough.  
 
2. Opportunities will be sought for the provision of workforce training opportunities and jobs for local unemployed people:  
 
a. on major construction sites; and  
b. within the companies occupying new employment developments.  
 
 
5.99 The PfSH Economic Development Strategy, the Solent LEP strategy and the Borough 
Council’s Prosperity Delivery Plan have identified a need for more skills training in the sub -
region and the Borough.  PfSH have adopted a policy framework on ‘The use of developer 
contributions to provide workforce training’ which will be used in implementing this policy (see Appendix B). This seeks to raise skills and enable local people to compete for the jobs 
generated. Examples of  measures include training, apprenticeships, employment advice, 
interview guarantees, work placements, transport arrangements and childcare.   
 
 
Rural economy  
 
5.100  Much of the agricultural land in the Borough  is of high quality, as reflected in its  history of 
strawberry -growing and other horticultural enterprise. There are also pressures for the use of 
buildings in the countryside for employment and other  uses .  
 
5.101  In the countryside the following forms of employment development will be permitted:  
i. Agricultural development and farm diversification in accordance with policy  
DM17 ; 
ii.   Extension and replacement of buildings in existing non- residential use, in 
accordance with policy  DM18 ; and  
iii.  Change of use and redevelopment of existing buildings in accordance with policy  
DM19 . 
 
Policy DM17 , Agricultural development  
 
1. New buildings for agricultural purposes and farm diversification will be permitted in 
the countryside, to enable the efficient working and long- term commercial viability 
of the agricultural enterprise, provided that the proposed use cannot be 
accommodated in existing buildings.  
   
89 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  2. All such proposals must:  
 
a. ensure that new buildings are proportionate to the scale and nature of the use 
and located and designed so as not to be visually intrusive, or have an 
unacceptable impact on the local road network;  and 
b. include measures for the long -term management of the agricultural unit, 
including enhancement of the landscape and biodiversity.  
 
3.  Agricultural development and farm diversification uses do not include residential uses.  
 
Note: Rural workers’ dwellings are addressed in policy DM27. 
 
5.102  Agriculture is arguably one of the most important activities that shape the character of the 
wider countryside.  It is obviously also central to local food production. It is therefore impo rtant 
that agricultural enterprises are able to function and be self -sustaining.  Levels of agricultural 
activity in the Borough  have declined in recent decades, with parts of the countryside showing 
signs of neglect and poor management.  The policy is designed to assist agricultural  
enterprise and to achieve better management of the Borough’s countryside, while avoiding 
significan t unplanned development that would increase urbanisation and threaten the rural 
quality of these areas . In accordance with guidance in the National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF), decisions about development affecting agricultural land should also take 
account of the impacts on soils  and the protection of the best and most versatile (BMV) 
agricultural land.  
 
Policy DM18 , Extension and replacement of non-  residential buildings in the countryside  
 
1. The extension or replacement of non- residential buildings in the countryside will be 
permitted, subject to the general development criteria and transport policies of this Local Plan  and provided that:  
 
a. the existing building is in lawful use and is not subject to a temporary permission;  
b. the extension or replacement building is for a non- residential use ; 
c. the extension or replacement building would not have an urbanising effect on 
the countryside in terms of its density, scale, massing, layout and height;  
d. access, car parking, landscaping and services can be provided without 
having a detrimental  impact  on the character of the countryside;  
e. so far as possible the property is sustainably located in terms of accessibility by 
means of transport other than the private car;  
f. the extended building or its replacement would be located within the existing 
curtilage unless its relocation or extension would contribute to improving the 
character and quality of the local area;  
g. in the case of a replacement building, the proposal also includes the 
demolition of the building to be replaced;  and 
h. the development would not by itself or cumulatively with other recently permitted 
schemes undermine the Council’s stra tegy for the development of employment -
related floorspace  (see strategic policy  S4). 
 
2. Where the proposal also involves a change of use of the building, criteria ( a), (b) and 
(c) of policy DM19  will apply. Notwithstanding this, where the proposal is for the 
development of town centre uses  as defined in the National Planning Policy 
Framework (NPPF) , criterion ( b) of policy  DM19  will apply.  
   
90 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
5.103  The Borough contains many agricultural, commercial and recreational  enterprises in the 
countryside.  It is inevitable that these will have development needs.  These must be 
balanced against the overall strategy to  limit the urbanising effect of development on the 
countryside, and the need for such activities to be in accessible locations.  
 
 
Policy DM19 , Change of use of buildings in the countryside  
 
1. The change of use of existing buildings in the countryside that are demonstrably 
unsuitable for continued use for their existing purpose will be permitted subject to the 
general development criteria and transport policies of the Local Plan and provided 
that:  
 
a.    the proposed use is compatible with neighbouring uses and does not have an 
urbanising effect on the countryside in terms of external layout, lighting, noise or traffic; 
b.   any proposals for developments over 500  sq.m or that would lead to, or 
consolidate more than, a 30% increase in the floorspace of an established use 
(measured against floorspace at April 2011), in use classes E(b), E(c), E(d), 
E(g)(i) , C1, F.2(c)/(d), or in use as a cinema, concert hall, bingo hall or dance hall  
are subject to a sequential test to demonstrate that they cannot  be 
accommodated in more sustainable locations in the town, district or local 
centres or failing this in edge of centre or out of centre locations within the 
urban edge. E(a) uses will not be supported ; 
c. the building is of permanent construction and can be re- used without 
works detrimental to its character or that of its surroundings. For the 
purposes of this policy ‘buildings’ do not include open- sided barns or 
glasshouses;  
d.    access, car parking and services can be provided without having a detrimental  
impact  on the character of the countryside; and  
e.   the property is sustainably located in terms of accessibility by modes of 
transport other than the private car.  
 
2. Change of use  to residential , where this is not permitted development,  will only be 
permitted if:  
 
a. the building is demonstrably unsuitable for other uses allowed under this policy; 
or 
b. the proposal is for an agricultural worker’s dwelling and the terms of policy  DM27 
are met; or  
c. the building is of architectural or historic interest and there are  no other means 
of securing its preservation (see also policy DM12 ); or 
d. it would achieve amenity, environmental or traffic benefits.  
 
3. Where the proposal also involves extension or replacement of the building,  policy 
DM18  will apply.   In boatyards outside the urban edge,  policy DM20  applies.  
 
 
5.104  Existing buildings in the countryside that are of good quality are a re -usable resource. Enabling 
a change of use of such buildings can help to limit the need for new buildings in the 
countryside.  The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) ( England) 
Order 2015 (GDPO) enables the change of use  of agricultural buildings to a range of ‘flexible’ 
uses . The policy therefore applies to proposals  outside the scope of permitted development 
rights . Please note that policy  DM19  would also apply to proposals for retail development.  
   
91 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  5.105  This plan directs most employment development to urban areas, and to sites in use or 
allocated for these purposes, as these are regarded as the most sustainable locations for such 
uses in terms of accessibility and public  services. However, the re -use and adaptation of rural 
buildings for employment purposes can contribute to the diversification of the rural economy, 
help to support agricultural businesses and therefore help to make economic use of the   
existing building stock. The replacement of existing buildings can also enable the devel opment 
of new buildings that are more suitable for modern business requirements, without leading to significant impacts on local landscape character.  
 
5.106  It is important to limit residential re -use in the countryside because the high value of this use 
could preclude other forms of development that are generally more beneficial to the local 
economy and to the management of the countryside. Residential re- use can also lead to 
changes in the character and appearance of the building and its surroundings that  can have an 
urbanising effect. Where residential re -use is permitted, it is on the basis that it is making best 
use of the existing buildings (including their architectural enhancement) and no more –  it is not 
the purpose of the policy to encourage new residential development in the countryside.  
Notwithstanding this, the GDPO allows the conversion of agricultural buildings to residential  
use without planning permission, in particular circumstances. The replacement of a building 
converted to residential use in accordance with this policy with a new residential building will 
not be permitted and policy DM26 will not apply. For sake of clarity, where planning permission 
is required for the change of an agricultural building into residential use, policy  DM19  will apply.   
 
 
Policy DM20 , Boatyard and marina sites on the River Hamble 
 
1. At boatyard and marina sites on the River Hamble (as shown on the policies map) 
the Borough Council will permit development associated with boat building, and 
the fitting out, maintenance and repair of boats and ancillary uses, provided that it 
does not:  
 
a. jeopardise the safety and ease of navigation on the river or have a detrimental impact on the regime of the river;  
b.   adversely affect nature conservation, landscape or heritage interests;  
   or 
c.  cause a reduction in water quality.  
 
2. Exceptionally, development or redevelopment may be permitted incorporating a modest amount of floorspace not restricted to boat -related uses, where the Council is 
convinced that such a use is needed to secure the future of a boatyard or marina and 
it is demonstrated that the development will complement the use of the site and/or the 
enjoyment  of the River Hamble.  
 
[Note:  Policy  DM3 5 refers to recreational sailing on the River Hamble.]  
 
 
5.107  The boatyards on the River Hamble lie outside the defined urban edge. They make an 
important contribution to the economy of the Borough and the sub - region, and are important 
for tourism and recreation. It is important that  they are retained in this use, and that they are 
able to evolve and change to accommodate and develop new technology, provided they do 
not have an adverse impact on the sensitive environment of the river.  The Council  will also 
consider whether proposals cause an unacceptable hazard to the movement of craft on the 
river, including smaller vessels .  
 
5.108  However, the Council accepts that exceptionally, it may be necessary to use a small part of a 
boatyard for non -boat-related us es in order to secure the viability of the remainder of the   
92 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  boatyard or marina.  The Council should be convinced that there is no demand for boat -related 
uses following concerted marketing efforts, however t he exact proportion of non-boat uses 
permitted will depend on design, environmental and highway considerations .  
 
Retail development  
5.109  The Borough contains one main town centre at Eastleigh, two district centres at Chandler’s 
Ford and Hedge End and a number of smaller local centres and shopping parades.  The 
distribution of these centres across the Borough  provides reasonably easy access to 
shopping facilities for the majority of residents thus providing a valued local amenity which 
helps to limit the need  to travel. Strategic policy  S4, Employment provision (Chapter 4), and 
E3 – E5 (Chapter 6 section 6. 4) refer to Eastleigh town centre.   
 
5.110  The following centres are defined as set out on the policies map : 
 
Town centre  
>Eastleigh town centre  
 
District centres  
>Fryern Centre, Chandler’s Ford  
>Hedge End centre  
 
Local centres  
>Botley village centre  
>Lowford village centre, Bursledon 
>Central Precinct and surrounds (consolidating Hursley Road, Bournemouth Road 
and the Central Precinct) , Chandler’s Ford  
>Boyatt Wood and Shakespeare Road shopping centre, Eastleigh 
>Fair Oak village centre  
>Hamble village centre  
>Victoria Road and Station Road, Netley Abbey  
>West End village centre  
 
Neighbourhood parades   
>Riverside, Bishopstoke 
>Whalesmead, Bishopstoke  
>Pilands Wood, Bursledon 
>Hiltingbury Road West, Chandler’s Ford  
>Hiltingbury Road East, Chandler’s Ford  
>Ashdown Road, Chandler’s Ford  
>Falkland Road, Chandler’s Ford  
>Nightingale Avenue, Eastleigh 
>Sandy Lane, Fair Oak  
>Coronation Parade, Hamble  
>St Luke’s Close, Hedge End  
>Townhill Way, West End 
  
5.111  The above list  identifies the defined centres for the purposes of retail development.  It 
establishes a retail hierarchy based on the existing provision in each centre with Eastleigh town centre at the top of the local hierarchy by virtue of offering the w idest range and greatest 
number of shopping, leisure, cultural, financial and professional services and facilities. At the   
93 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  bottom of the hierarc hy, neighbourhood parades generally contain a few shops to s erve the 
local neighbourhood. New local centres are to be  established within the larger development 
sites as set out in the site- specific policies in Chapter 6.  
 
Policy DM21 , New retail development  
 
1. Retail development will be permitted in the defined centres provided that it:  
 
a.  is compatible with the role and retail character of the centre; and  
b. it accords with policies for Eastleigh town centre set out in Chapter 6 
(policies E 3 – E4, Section 6. 4). 
 
2. Retail development will only be permitted outside these centres subject to a sequential test demonstrating that, having shown flexibility on sto re format and the 
scope for disaggregation, there are no sui table, viable and available sites  or premises 
for the proposed use within, or failing that adjoining, an existing centre.  In addition, 
the proposed development must:  
 
a. be within the urban edge (as defined on the policies map); 
b. not by itself or cumulatively with other proposals have a significant adverse impact 
on any existing or proposed centre.  A  retail impact assessment  will be required for 
proposals equal to or greater than 350 sq.m of net additional retail floorspace; and  
c. be sustainably located in terms of accessibility by modes of transport other than the private car.  
 
3. Conditions restricting the range of goods sold, the sub -division of units or internal 
alterations that would i ncrease floorspace  may be applied.   The relief of conditions 
that restrict out -of-centre stores to the sale of specific goods will not be permitted 
where this would conflict with criteria (b) and (c) above.  
 
 
5.112  The Borough Council seeks to focus retail activity within the defined town, district and local 
centres in the Borough. The Eastleigh Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (Carter 
Jonas) identifies  a limited need for additional convenience goods in the two district centres, 
local centres and the rest of the Borough. It also identifies a limited need across the 
Borough for comparison goods in the short term, increasing in the longer term. There is 
believed to be capacity within Eastleigh town centre , Chandler ’s Ford  and Hedge End 
centres  to accommodate the level of development required  in the short term  and therefore 
no new allocations for main town centre uses are made adjoining the town centre or any 
other existing centres.  Any such provision coming forward at an early stage should be 
confined to existing centres and local centres with planning permission on strategic sites across the Borough.  Table 4 below  sets out the  Borough wide need in approximately 5 y ear 
periods and split s this between convenience and compar ison floorspace:

Retail Floorspace Provision Background Paper (Eastleigh Borough Council June 2018)  
 
5.113  Nevertheless, retail development within the defined centres should be compatible with their 
current role and policy  DM21  therefore supports proposals that are compatible with the centres’ 
positions in the retail hierarchy as set out in Chapter 4 . Development in an existing centre   
94 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  should not be on such a scale that it undermines the role of another centre or increases 
distanc es travelled.  
 
5.114  The Borough Council seeks to avoid developments outside the defined centres that would 
compromise their viability and vitality by drawing trade away  from them, or that would be 
located in unsustainable locations. Any edge of centre ret ail development should be 
integrated with centres in the existing retail hierarchy by a range of sustainable transport connections. These developments should also be highly accessible by sustainable modes  of 
transport from the existing centres and other parts of the anticipated retail catchment area.  
 
5.115  In applying the sequential test, consideration will be given to the impact on other retail 
centres outside of the Borough’s boundary including the city of Southampton.  Retail impact assessment may be required in accordance with the NPPF.   The policy is not intended to 
preclude the development of small shops or convenience stores that serve local needs.  
 
 
Policy DM22 , Changes of use in retail frontages in Eastleigh town centre,  district  centres , local  
centres  and neighbourhood parades  
 
1. Within the ground floor of the core shopping zone, primary and secondary shopping 
frontages of Eastleigh town centre  and the district centres  and frontages of the local 
centres and neighbourhood parades, as defined on the policies map, a change of use 
or redevelopment involving the loss of  a Class E use, community or leisure/cultural 
uses under Classes E and F; or sui generis uses including pubs, drinking 
establishments and hot food takeaways;  must demonstrate that:  
 
a. the new use retains an active ground floor frontage;  
b. it does not adversely affect amenity of an area or the  appearance of the 
frontage; and 
c. it does not have a negative impact on the provision of services or on the 
sustainability of a key shopping area .  
 
2. In Eastleigh town centre criterion c above will be met by proposals which meet policy E3.  In all other centres,  to demonstrate the lack of a negative impact  under criterion 
c above, proposals should provide:  
 
a. proof that there is no demand for the Class E  use, including evidence that the 
site has been marketed effectively for such  a use; or  
b. over -riding community benefits from the proposed use; or  
c. evidence that the proposal will enhance the vitality and viability of the 
centre.  
Note: Policies for shopping frontages in Eastleigh town centre are in Chapter 6, 
section 6. 4. 
 
3. Changes of use or redevelopment to residential will not be permitted within the 
defined shopping frontages/centres other than in upper floors.  
 
 
5.116  The Borough Council has a long- standing commitment to maintaining a strong core of retail 
uses in Eastlei gh town centre, the district centres, local centres and neighbourhood parades. 
This approach accords with the NPPF.  However, the contribution that other uses can make to 
the vitality and viability of these centres is recognised, and the polic y explains where these 
might be developed  in the primary and secondary frontages in Eastleigh, Chandler’s Ford and 
Hedge End.  
   
95 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  5.117  For purposes of interpreting policy  DM22 , property frontages are considered to be the public 
facades of buildings, primarily comprising windows that could be used for the display or 
advertisement of goods or services, together with  customer entrances and exits. The primary 
and secondary frontages of Eastleigh town centre and the district  centres are defined on the 
policies map, whilst the relevant property frontages  in local centres and neighbourhood parades 
are indicated within the Borough Council’s Annual Shopping Frontages Survey.  
 
5.118  Permitted development rights contained in the GPDO 2015  allow more flexibility for units to 
change between uses including shopping and food and drink uses.  Permitted development 
rights also currently allow small shops and professional service uses to change to housing 
subject to restrictions. Developers must demonstrate that they will not harm retail services 
(unless there is no reasonable prospect of the unit staying in retail use) or threaten the sustainability of a key shopping area. The marketing period the Council requires for ensuring no 
negative impact upon the provision of services or on the sustainability of a key shopping area 
will be between 6 and 12 months. The length of the marketing period will be dependent on a 
number of factors such as the size of the unit and the quality of the marketing  evidence 
submitted with development proposals . Ground floor residential uses will not be acceptable 
except where there are permitted development rights  and developers can meet these criteria.

5.119  The Borough contains a range of types, size and tenure of housing stock.  New homes will 
be required to meet the needs of the growing population and particularly the anticipated  
growth in households over the plan period.  The Strategy in Chapter 4 sets out broadly 
where these are to be built, identifying the main site allocations (see strategic policy  S3, 
Chapter 4), which are described in detail in Chapter 6. Estimates include provision for on -
going development in the urban areas, and the following policies set out c riteria for such 
development. They also describe how affordable housing and housing for special needs are 
to be provided.  
 
Residential development in urban areas  
 
Policy DM23 , Residential development in urban areas  
 
1. Within the urban edge as defined on the policies map , residential development 
through new bui ld, conversion, sub- division or extension will normally be permitted 
subject to the general development criteria and transport policies of this Local Plan.  
 
2. New dwellings will be permitted provided that:  
 
a. where feasible the scheme provides a mix of dwelling types and sizes to meet 
local needs, including dwellings capable of adaptation to meet changing needs over  time and housing for older people in accordance with policies DM24 and 
DM25; 
b. affordable housing is provided in accordance with policy  DM28; 
c. a minimum  density of 40 dwellings per hectare (net) should be achieved unless 
site constraints or local character justify a lower density. In areas with good 
access to public transport and other services and amenities, higher densities will 
be sought.  
 
3. Where possible residential development sites, including those proposed to be 
allocated in Chapter 6, should include provision for self  and custom build  
development.  
 
 
5.120  This policy enables residential development within urban areas in a way that meets 
identified local needs and helps to create mixed and balanced communities.  Research by ORS identified  the housing mix required by 2036 , split between affordable housing and 
general market housing
53. The Council will encourage the delivery of market rental housing 
in the Borough. The largest need for affordable housing is for 2 and 3 bedroom  houses, for 
market housing it is primarily 3 bedroom houses. Policy DM24 provides  more detail on 
housing mix. In addition the National Planning Policy Framework identifies that planning for 
 
53 ORS Affordable Housing Assessment 2017    
97 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  a mix of housing should include consider ing the needs of people wishing to build their own 
homes. The Self -build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and the Housing and Planning 
Act 2016 place a duty on the Borough Council to keep a register of individuals and 
associations of individuals, who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land for self -build 
and custom housebuilding in the area as w ell as to have regard to the register when 
carrying out its planning functions. This policy represents a proportional and flexible response to the level of demand identified in the Register. The Borough Council 
recognises the need to make more land available at a range of sites to encourage growth 
in the self -build sector and is committed to actively raising awareness of this route to home 
ownership.   
 
5.121  In terms of density, the Borough Council wishes to ensure the most efficient use of urban 
land whilst ensuring that developments are in character with the surrounding area and 
provide a high standard of residential amenity.   
   
Type of r eside ntial development  
 
Policy DM24, Creating  a mix of housing  
 
1. Applicants for market residential and mixed -use schemes will be required to:  
 
a. demonstrate how the proposal contributes to the overall mix of housing in the 
Housing Market Area, informed by the current need, current demand and existing 
housi ng stock (includi ng approved developments)  considering the context and 
character of the site;  
b. where appropriate, demonstrate how the scheme contributes to the provision of 
properties suitable  for entry- level homes suitable for first time buyer s (or 
equivalent, for those looking to rent) , or for ex ample downsizers, unless the need 
for such homes is already being met locally;  
c. demonstrate that where a mix of different house sizes and types is provided on 
site, the development is designed to avoid excessive concentrations of the same 
size or type of home.    
 
 
5.122  The Council has an aim of delivering a more diverse mix of housing and encouraging a mix of 
housing types, tenure and sizes through planning policies and partnership working. This will help 
meet the needs of people living in the Borough now and in the futu re. The provision of affordable 
housing as part of development proposals is addressed in policy DM 28 and should be 
considered alongside policies DM24  and DM25 . 
 
5.123  The PfSH Strategic Housing Market Assessment  (SHMA 2014) examines the future housing 
needs in the Borough . Due to  an ageing population and falling household sizes, it identifies a 
need for more two and three bedroom dwellings. These can be attractive to both older people 
looking to downsize and families. A n estimated 75% of all market sector , and 65% of all 
affordable sector , dwellings should be two or three bedroom properties. In accordance with 
DM24, new development should reflect the identified needs as set out in a Housing Market 
Assessment or in the Council’s Housing Strategy.    
 
 
 
   
98 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Policy DM25 , Delivering Older peoples housing  
 
1. New development should seek to respond to the requirements of an ageing 
population by increasing the supply of specialist housing and accessible housing in 
accordance with policy DM 29.  
 
2. The Council will support the provision of accommodation suitable for the needs of 
older people. Proposals should be:  
a. located in sustainable locations with good access to the public transport 
network;  
b. close to local facilities that residents can use, ideally Extra Care housing should be in or close to local centre; and  
c. well integrated into the local community.    
 
  
5.124  In the next twenty years the population of Eastleigh Borough will change with an estimated 
increase of 24% in the number of people aged 65 and over living in the Borough and an 
increase of 5% of people over 85 or ov er
54. This will le ad to an increasing number of older 
people requiring accommodation, estimated to increase by 24% . Policy DM29 seeks to meet the 
needs for accessible housing including properties suitable for wheelchair users. In addition, the 
Council  will support the provision of s pecialist acc ommodation m eeting the criteria set out in 
policy DM25.    
 
5.125  The provision of specialist accommodation, especially for older people, will be required as part 
of the housing mix on larger allocations where they meet an identified need, unless it can be demonstrated that this would have an unacceptable impact on the economic viability of the 
proposed scheme.   
  
5.126  While support and care can be provided to people in their own homes, in some cases it is better for people to move to more appropriate housing, for example a bungalow or apartment providing 
level access or to specialist accommodation. Vulnerable and older people have a range of 
individual housing needs. These can sometimes be met with general needs market housing 
alongsi de additional support at home  (and policy DM29 requires the provision of accessible 
homes  in accordance with Building Regulations Part M4  which can provide the facilities and 
space required to address current and future needs) , however in other cases  it requires 
specialist housing. Therefore it is necessary to provide for a range of housing for older people, 
and other vulnerable groups where there is an identified need, both in the general housing mix and through the provision of specialist accommodat ion.       
 
 
Residential development in the countryside  
5.127  In order to limit the urbanising impact of development on the rural character of the countryside, 
and for reasons of sustainability, the Borough Council seeks to limit residential development in 
the countryside to the following:  
i. Residential extensions and replacement dwellings (see policy  DM26); 
ii.   Limited residential conversions (see policy  DM19 ); 
iii.  Rural workers dwellings (see policy  DM27); and  
iv.  Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople’s accommodation (see policy  DM31). 
 
 
54 Demography Background paper 2017   
99 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  5.128  The development of residential institutions in the countryside will only be permitted by 
conversion of existing buildings in accordance with policy  DM19  ‘Change of use of 
buildings in the countryside’.  Extensions to or the replacement of residential institutions 
already located in the countryside will treated in the same way as extensions or 
replacement of dwellings (see policy  DM26). 
  
 
 
Policy DM26, Residential extensions and replacement dwellings in the countryside  
 
1. The extension or replacement of a permanent dwelling in the countryside will be 
permitted subject to the general development criteria and transport policies of the 
Local Plan  and provided:  
 
a. the extension or replacement dwelling will not be disproportionate in size  
 to the existing dwelling, neighbouring properties or in relation to its plot, or 
involve any extension to its curtilage; and  
b. in the case of a replacement dwelling, the proposal includes  the replacement of 
the dwelling within the curtilage, and on the same footprint as the existing 
building, unless environmental and/or  access benefits arise from an alternative 
location within the curtilage;  and 
c.  no additi onal dwellings are created.  
 
2. Permission will not be given for  the replacement of mobile homes with permanent 
dwellings.  
 
3. Residential institutions will be treated for the purposes of this policy in the sam e way 
as dwellings.  
 4. Proposals to extend or to replace rural workers dwellings will be considered under 
Policy DM27 . 
 
 
5.129  The development of new housing in the countryside will not be permitted except in very limited 
circumstances.  However, there are many existing dwellings in the countryside, and it is 
inevitable that there will be proposals to extend or replace them.  This policy enables such 
development but seeks also to limit their impact on the countryside and any urbanising effects.  
 
5.130  Rural workers dwellings are modest dw ellings meeting the essential need identified in the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) for rural workers to live at or near their place of 
work in the countryside. They are permitted only in very particular and exceptional 
circumstances as set out in policy  DM27 below.  
 
 
Policy DM27, Rural workers’  dwellings  
 
1. The provision of dwellings for rural workers in the countryside will only be permitted where:  
 
a. it is essential for the worker to live at their place of work;  
b. the work is an activity that can only be carried out in a rural area and supports management of the countryside;
 
c. the enterprise can be demonstrated to be economically viable in the long 
term, and the dwelling is essential to its continued viability;  
d. there are no suitable alternative dwellings or buildings available for use or 
conversion in the immediate locality;  
e. no dwellings connected with the enterprise have been sold off in the past 5 years;  
f. the dwelling is sited and designed so as to limit its impact on the 
countryside; and    
100 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  g. the internal floor area of the dwelling does not exceed 120 sq.m  unless special 
justification is provided in terms of the operation of the agricultural enterprise.  
 
2. Conditions will be imposed on any permission for a rural worker s dwelling limiting 
the occupancy of the dwelling to workers engaged in the enterprise for which the 
dwelling was sought.  These conditions will not be removed unless the Borough 
Council is sat isfied that:  
 
a. there is no longer -term need for a rural workers dwelling in the locality;  
b. reasonable efforts have been made to sell or lease the property with the 
occupancy restrictions; and  
c. the property is not suitable or needed as a rural affordable dwelling.  
 
3. Permission will not normally be given for extensions to or  replacement of rural 
workers dwellings which result in the internal floor area exceeding 120  sq.m , unless 
special justif ication is provided.  
 
5.131  In order to limit the urbanising effect of development in the countryside, the development of 
new housing is not permitted except in very limited circumstances.  Permission for rural 
workers dwellings is granted exceptionally, on the basis of identified needs relating to an 
enterprise that can only take place in a rural area, and that supports or is related to 
management of the countryside. It is essential that these dwellings are and remain modest in 
scale to limit their impact on the countryside, and that so far as possible, they remain available 
for ru ral workers.  The minimum size of a rural worker’s dwelling  is larger than that indicated for 
a normal 4- bed dwelling as set out in policy  DM30 because the needs of rural workers can 
include office accommodation and storage for specialised equipment and cl othing.  
 
Affordable housing  
 
Policy DM28, Delivering aff ordable housing  
 
 
1. The Council  will seek the maximum reasona ble amount of affordab le housing when 
negotiating on individual market residential and mixed- use schemes, in line with the 
following:  
 
a. 35% affordable housing will be required as part of new housing developments, 
where the proposal comprises:  
i. sites of 0.5 ha or more and on sites with, or capable of accommodating, 10 
dwellings or more; or   
ii. a maximum combined gross floorspace  of more than 1,000 sq .m; unless 
iii. it can be demonstrated that this proportion would have an unacceptable 
impact on the economic viability of the proposed scheme , and a 
reasonable lower proportion is justified by evidence and that the lower 
proportion proposed is not below that which would be viable .  
 
b.  Provision on qualifying sites will be on -site unless it can be demonstrated that an 
off-site contribution would be more appropriate and more deliverable ; 
 c.  The tenure split, size and type of affordable housing will be informed by the latest 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment, the housing register, and the level and 
type of existing affordable housing in the locality;   
 d.  Where affordable housing is provided as part of a mixed tenure site it should be 
integrated into the development in terms of its design and layout;  
 e. The Council will also support acceptable schemes where developers choose to 
offer more affordable housing than is required by the policy, where this i s in   
101 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  accordance with other policies in the Plan ; 
 
f.  Inclusion of an element of specialist residential accommodation and facilities for 
older people within the affordable housing requirement may be appropriate 
depending on the proposal.  
 
 
5.132  There is a considerable need for affordable housing in the Boro ugh, as demonstrated in the 
Affordable Housing Market Assessment s (ORS 2017 & 2020) .  This policy seeks to ensure that 
new residential development includes provision for affordable housing and this provision meets 
the identified needs in the Borough.   
 
5.133  Affordable dwellings should normally be provided on the development site, and be 
integrated with the rest of the development.  A mixture of tenures should include rented and 
shared ownership.  The number of dwellings required will be rounded up to the nearest 
whole number for fractions of half or more and rounded down for less than hal f. When 
considering the impact of viability on the provision  of affordable housing, the Council  will 
consider whether there is potential for a larger viable development (meeting the policies 
elsewhere in this plan) to be developed on the site. In exceptional circumstances, 
contributions in the form of finance or serviced land may be acceptable  for provision off -site.   
 
5.134  The development of residential institutions can involve the provision of dwelling units capable of 
being occupied as normal independent dwellings. In such cases the developer will be expected to provide affordable dwellings in accordance with the above policy and revised Supplementary 
Planning Documents.  
 
Residential standards  
 
Policy DM29, Dwellings with higher access standards  
 
1. The Borough Council requires that development should meet higher national access 
standards as set out in Part M of the building regulati ons for new build residential 
development  (or future equivalent ): 
 
a. 100% of dwellings meet at least Part M4(1) standard (Visitable dwellings); 
including  
b. a target of 80% of dwellings on each site meet Part M4(2) standard (Accessible 
and adaptable dw ellings)  
 
 For major new -build development of 40 residential units and above , b. should 
include : 
 
i. at least 2 dwellings or 7% (if higher number) of all market housing  meeting 
the Part M4(3)(2)(a) standard for wheelchair adaptable dwellings;  
ii. at least 1 dwelling or 8% (if higher number) of all affordable housing  
meeting Part M4(3)(2)(b) standard for wheelchair accessible dwellings; and  
 
2. 100% of all specialist housing for older people and adults with disabilities meet the 
Part M4(3) standard (Wheelchair user dwellings).  
 
 
5.135  There is a lack of housing suitable for people with mobility issues and for wheelchair users 
across the country i ncluding in Eastleigh Borough. In order to deliver more suitable housing in   
102 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  the Borough , the Council is  applying higher Building Regulations access standards  as justified in 
the background paper . This will require a proportion of new development to be designed to allow 
adaptation of dwellings to meet changing needs of occupants over time, Part M4(2 ), or to be 
either easily adaptable or suitable on completion for disabled people including wheelchair users, 
Part M4(3). The proposed approach sets a target of  80% of properties to meet the Part M4(2) 
standards. For developments of 40 dwellings or more, part of this provision should be at  the 
higher Part M4(3) access standard.  This requirement applies to all tenures. In accordance with 
the Planning Practice Guidance, for affordable and social housing where the local authority is 
responsible for allocating or nominating a person to live in the dwelling, homes are required to 
meet the wheelchair accessible dwelling standard M4(3)(2)(b). Homes meeting this standard are 
suitable for wheelchair users on completion. Other new homes are required to meet the 
wheelchair adaptable standard M4(3)(2)(a). These homes can be easily adapted so they are 
suitable for a wheelchair user to live in in the future.  Policy DM 29 sets a target for 80% of 
dwellings on each site to meet higher access standards. Part M4(2) and M4(3) standards both 
require step free access. For some schemes with flats above the gr ound floor, the inclusion of a 
lift to provide suitable access may make the scheme unviable. There may also be site specific reasons why a scheme cannot achieve step free access across the whole site. Where this can 
be demonstrated to the satisfaction of t he Borough Council, the lower access standards in Part 
M4(1) would apply to these units and parts of the site.  
 
Policy DM30, Internal space standards for new residential  development  
 
1. The Borough Council requires that all new dwellings meet as a minimum the 
Nationally Described Space Standards (or future equivalent).  
 
2. Development proposals should be accompanied by a table setting out  for every 
dwelling:  
a. the gross internal floorspace;   
b. extent of built -in storage (sq .m); 
c. number of twin/double bedrooms with their minimum room widths; and  
d. minimum floor to ceiling height for at least 75% of the Gross Internal Area.  
 
 
5.136  The Government’s Housing Standards Review 2015 published internal space standards which 
local authorities could apply to new build residential development using planning policy. The 
council requires the use of these standards for new build development as s et out in DM3 0 and 
supports these standards for all new residential development.  
 
5.137  UK research has concluded that internal space in new homes is often too small to make 
those dwellings fit for purpose. The RIBA research paper (The Case for Space: The Size of 
England’s New Homes, September 2011)  found that the average new home in England is 
only 92% of the recommended minimum size.  
 
5.138  The national space standards for new build development according to the number of 
bedrooms in a property, the number of bed  spaces and the number of storeys. As a guide 
the current  minimum internal floor areas and storage requirements (sq.m) for selected types 
of properties are shown below :

Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople  
 
Policy DM31, Gypsies, Travellers  and Travelling Showpeople  
 
1. The Council  will meet the need for additional Gypsy and Travellers pitches and plots  
for Travelling Showpeople as identified in the Gypsy and  Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople Accommodation Assessment  (GTTSAA) . Sites are allocated for 
additional pitches and plots in policies  BU4 and BU5 to meet this need.    
  
2. In accordance with the assessment, t he Council  will work with neighbouring 
authorities to determine whether there is a need for a transit site in a wider area and 
to address any need identified in a suitable location.    
 
3. Development for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople , including transit 
sites, will be permitted where : 
 
a. there is an identified need for the pitch or plot  provision  which the proposal 
helps to meet ;  
b. the site is able to accommodate both residential use and where necessary the 
range of economic activities and vehicles associated with residents’ mobile 
lifestyles without unacceptable impact on local amenities, road safety, 
heritage, landscape or biodiversity interests;  
c. the site has  safe and convenient access to existing and proposed services and 
facilities to serve the residents, including education, health facilities and shops;  
d. the site has  or can be viably provided with utility services; and  
e. the site has  vehicular access to and from the strategic road network 
adequate to accommodate mobile residential units and any 
vehicles/machinery associated with residents’ working activities.   
 
4. Existing Gypsy and Travellers sites and Travelling Showpeople sites permitted in the Borough , and any new sites granted permission and implemented, will be   
104 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  safeguarded for these purposes as long as the need exists for accommodation 
within the Borough.     
 
5.139  Part of meeting the housing needs in Eastleigh Borough is addressing the needs of 
travelling communities.  The Council  is required to assess needs and then identify suitable 
sites for permanent and transit site accommodation to meet these  needs.  
 
5.140  The Council  produced a Gypsy , Travellers  and Travelling Showpeople Accommodation 
Assessment (G TTSAA) for Eastleigh in 201755. This applied the updated national Planning 
Policy for Travellers sites (PPTS 2015)56 definition of Gypsies and Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople to consider the existing provision in the Borough and the future needs.  
 
5.141  The GTTS AA identifies the current provision in Eastleigh Borough. There are 29 pitches on 
17 Gypsy and Traveller sites and an additional four plots on two Travelling Showpeople 
yards. By 2036 there is a confirmed need for four  permanent  Gypsy and Traveller  pitches 
and three permanent plots (from Travelling Showpeople h ouseholds living elsewhere in 
Hampshire but with a connection to Eastleigh) . The GTTS AA estimated one  additional 
Gypsy and Traveller pitch and two further  Travelling Showpeople plots are likely to be 
needed to address  unconfirmed need.  This need is unconf irmed at this stage as  sites were 
surveyed but interviews were not  able to be completed.   
 
5.142  The criteria in policy DM 31 helps ensure Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites 
have access to services, facilities and utilities, suitabl e vehicular access and do not have 
an unacceptable impact. Policies BU4  and BU5 allocate sites for pitches. Applic ations 
received for additional sites will be assess ed against the criteria in policy DM31. These 
include whether there is an identified need  which the proposal helps to meet . This may 
reflect newly arising need and those needs  which are currently unconfirmed.   
               
 
A healthy community  
Community facilities  
5.143  Community facilities include a wide range of services and facilities which are divided broadly 
into: 
 
• Recreation and open space 
• Community, leisure and cultural facilities

5.144  An important part of the Borough Council’s health strategy is to promote  healthy living, including 
engagement in physical  activity. The Council therefore  considers the provision and protection of 
recreation and open space facilities  to be an essential part of its vision and strategy for the 
communities of the Borough.  This will also accord with the vision, strategic aims and objectives 
of the Hampshire County Council Physical Activity Strategy 2018- 21.  
 
5.145  The definition of recreation facilities and open space is very wide- ranging, including indoor and 
outdoor facilities, and ranging from informal play areas,  amenity spaces, natural habitats/wildlife 
sites and country parks to more formal sports pitches, courts,  greens, athletics tracks etc.  It can 
also include rivers, canals, lakes and reservoirs.  With the exception of indoor facilities, many of 
these also fall within the broad definition of green infrastructure.  The Open Space Needs 
Assessment 2017 has not included a review of cemetery provision,  as in the Local Plan 
cemeteries are addressed under the heading of community facilities.  
 
5.146  The Council has carried out studies  of recreational needs and provision in the Borough , the 
Open Space Needs Assessment 2017 and the Sports Facility Needs Assessment and Playing 
Pitch Strategy Update 2017 established standards of provision for certain types of recreation and open space, specifically:  
 
• Formal outdoor sports facilities such as playing fields, pitches, greens and courts;  
 
• Indoor sports facilities such as swimming pools, gymnasia and squash courts;  
 
• Amenity open space including play space, wildlife sites and country parks;  
 
• Allotments.  
   
106 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  The Council seeks to protect those forms of sports and recreation facilities set out above 
(policy DM32), and to secure additional provision in association with residential schemes 
(policy DM33) and through the development of new facilities (policy DM34). 
 
 
Policy DM32, Protection of recreation and open space facilities  
 
1. The loss of existing or allocated recreation and open space facilities, including 
those identified on the policies map, are only likely to be permitted in exceptional 
circumstances, where:  
 
a. the Council’s Sports Facility Needs Assessment and Playing Pitch Str ategy 
Update and/or Open Space Needs Assess ment  clearly identifies the open space, 
buildings or land to be surplus to requirements; or  
b. any loss would be replaced by equivalent or better provision in terms of quantity 
and quality in a suitable location; or  
c. the development is for alternative recreation or open space facilities, the need for 
which clearly outweighs the loss.  
Any replacement provision should be made available for use prior to commencement 
of development.  
 
2. Development  ancillary to the recreational use may be permitted on recreation sites 
provided that it does not adversely affect land forming part of, or capable of forming 
part of, a playing pitch/court/green.  
 
5.147  Sports pitches, sports facilities, parks and amenity open space contribute substantially to the 
quality of life in and around urban areas.  As well as visual amenity and setting for/separation 
between areas of development, they also provide opportunities for outdoor recreation, and for 
biodiversity. Wildlife sites are often accessible to the public, but public access may not be 
provided to areas or sites where this would be likely to harm the wildlife interest. Associated 
vegetation may also have benefits in terms of helpi ng to improve ambient air quality. The 
Council therefore seeks to protect all existing recreation facilities and open  spaces unless they 
are demonstrated to be surplus to requirements through the open spaces needs assessment or 
the sports facility needs as sessment update and playing pitch strategy , or an equivalent 
alternative assessment.  In the case of school playing fields, Section 77 of the Schools Standards and Frameworks Act 1998 sets out  strict criteria to control their release for 
development, including requirements that the proceeds are used to enhance sports and/or 
education provision. There is also a requirement to consult with Sport England. Hampshire 
County Council may seek the development of school playing fields to rationalise its land holdings as a means of financing recreational and educational improvements. Where proposals 
come forward to offset loss of playing fields, the Borough Council expects any new or enhanced 
sports or recreational facilities to be made available for public use provided this does not prejudice the educational efficiency of the school. Note: the development of education facilities 
is covered by  policy DM36. 
 
 
Policy DM33, Provision  of recreation and open space facilities with new development  
 
1. All n ew residential development shall  contribute to the achievement of the 
quantitative, qualitative and accessibility standards for recreation and open space 
facilities  in the Open Space Needs Assessment 2017 . The level of provision and 
contribution will vary depending on the existing areas  of open space located within 
the distance set by the accessibility standard  and the size of the proposed 
development .    
   
107 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  2. Contributions may take the form of the provision of land laid out for recreation 
and/or open space;  and/or funding for improvements to the quality and capacity of 
existing recreation;  and/or open space facilities, including indoor and outdoor sports 
facilities.  Sports and open space requirements for strategic development is set out in 
strategic policy S 9. 
 
3. Development proposals should include provision for the long- term management and 
maintenance of any recreation or open space facilities provided. Private open space 
that is not available for public use will not be accepted in lieu of requi rements for 
public  open space provision or contributions.  
 
4. Proposals shoul d help to create and enhance mul tifunctional green infrastructure in 
accordance with strategic  policy S 9.

5.148  It is important to ensure that the stock and range of open space facilities is adequate to 
serve the needs of both the existing and the future population of the Borough.  The Open 
Space Needs Assessment  has defined new standards for provision in the Borough as set 
out in policy DM33 above based on an assessment of the adequacy of existing provision,   
108 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  the Council’s aspirations for future sport and recreation development, and to help meet 
the aspirations for south Hampshire in the PfSH Green Infrastructure Strategy.  
 
5.149  On the basis of the new development proposed, calculations based on the new standards 
show that some additional open space allocations are now needed. These are identified on a 
parish basis in Chapter 6.  In order to secure these, and to make sure that new residential 
development has adequate standards of amenity in terms of open space provision, the Council 
needs contributions from new development.  
 
5.150  Contributions may take the form of on- site open space and/or contributions  to new provision and 
extensions to existing provision, off -site, including the implementation of new proposals as set  
out in the Local Plan.  Alternatively, contributions may be sought towards the improvement of 
existing public open space and recreation facilities that will  serve the new development.  
Requirements for sports facilities will be subject  to the capacity of existing facilities  within the 
defined accessibility standard distance of the development.  Details of the facilities required  are 
set out in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan.  Further details on the open space 
requirements expected from new development will also be set out in a future update to the 
Planning Obligations SPD.  
 
 
New and enhanced recreation facilities  
5.151  Recreation facilities include those identified in  policy DM32 above i.e. formal outdoor sports 
facilities, indoor sports facilities, amenit y open space and allotments. They also include other 
recreational facilities available in the Borough , such as golf, horse riding and water -based 
recreation (sailing is addressed separately at  policy DM35), commercial indoor gymnasia and 
uses such as hotel spa facilities.  Although these other recreational facilities have been 
considered in the Sports Facility Needs Assessment and Playing Pitch Strategy Update and 
the Open Space N eeds Assessment , it has not proved possible to derive standards of 
provision for them, and they are not considered to fall within the category of facilities that 
need to be accorded special protection, or that are required to be provided through 
development.  
 
5.152  It is considered important to make provision for the enhancement of existing, and provision of 
additional recreation facilities, provided they do not cause or increase urbanisation of the 
countryside, and accord with other policies of t he Local Plan regarding residential amenities, 
heritage and biodiversity.  
 
Policy DM34, New and enhanced recreation and open space facilities  
 
1. The provision, extension or enhancement of public and private recreation and open space facilities or uses including those identified in policy DM32 above will be 
permitted provided that:  
 
a. they accord with the general development criteria and the biodiversity, and heritage policies of this Local Plan ; 
b. in the countryside:  
i.  new buildings will be limited to those ancillary to and essential for the 
use of the land for outdoor sport and recreation; and  
ii. development should not involve structures, floodlighting or activities that cause urbanisation or detract from rural character;  
c. they contribute to the management of, and where possible enhance the 
countryside and urban ope n spaces.  The Council may require a legal 
agreement to ensure that land is managed to maintain or enhance its   
109 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  agricultural and/or landscape value and/or biodiversity interest;  and;  
d. they are readily accessible to those they are intended to serve by means of 
transport other than  the private car, and accord with the transport and 
parking policies of this Local Plan .  
 
9 
5.153  It is important to add to the range and quality of recreation and open space facilities in the 
Borough, but new development may not be able to provide all that is needed.  To ensure that 
the range of recreation facilities is adequate to accommodate the fut ure needs of the Borough , 
including those identified in the  Sports Facility Needs Assessment and Playing Pitch Strategy 
Update and the Open Space Needs Assessment , this policy makes provision for the 
development of private and public facilities within urban areas and in the countryside, but 
seeks to limit built development in the countryside to avoid urbanisation. The policy is not intended to enable the creation or extension of domestic recreational facilities  such as private 
gardens or tennis courts in the countryside, as these would have an urbanising impact contrary to the strategy of retaining the rural character of the countryside.  
 
5.154  There is a considerable local interest in allotments . There are also advantages to local  food 
production by this means in terms of health, community interaction and  sustainability. The 
Council’s ambition as stated in the adopted Climate Change Strategy57 is to increase 
local/regional food production. The Council’s study of open space and recreation provision in the 
Borough (Eastleigh Borough Open Space Needs Assessment 2017) has identified a need for 
new allotment provision within the Bishopstoke, Fair Oak & Horton Heath local area and a need 
for amenity open space and allotments in the Chandler’s Ford local area . The policy provides  for 
the creation of new allotments.  Note: community farms and community  growing spaces are 
emerging concepts gaining some favour. Community  farms are agricultural uses and as such 
are unlikely to need planning permission, other than for related structures. The policy would 
enable the development of community growing spaces in urban areas. There is potential  for 
local sales of food from such sites.  
 
5.155  Horse riding is a popular activity in the Borough , and considerable areas of  the countryside 
are given over to horse grazing and riding activities. Equine related development can fall 
under agricultural, equestrian and recreation uses.  
 
5.156  While equine uses may be acceptable in the countryside, they can have substantial visual impacts, e.g. from buildings and other infrastructure such as floodlighting. This policy and the 
other policies of this plan are designed to limit and mitigate these impacts.  In terms of access, it will be important to ensure that riding enterprises have or can provide access to the 
existing or planned bridleway network. Applications for residential development in association with equine enterprises may be considered under  policy DM27, Rural workers dwellings  
depending on the nature of t he use and the need for rural workers to remain on- site.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Policy DM35, Recreational  activity on the River Hamble 
 
1. On the River Hamble:  
 
a. new moorings and replacement or relocation of existing moorings will only 
be permitted outside the M ooring Restriction Areas shown on the policies 
map, and subject to the advice of the River Hamble Harbour Authority and 
in accordance with policy DM11 ; 
b.   new jetties, slipways, pontoons, landing stages, steps, walkways, bridges or 
catwalks, or extensions to such structures, will only be permitted in existing 
boatyards or within frontages of the river in the urban edge as defined on the 
policies map;  
c.  within the Mooring Restriction Areas the replacement or relocation of existing 
moorings will be permitted where there are no alternative locations outside 
these areas and the proposal will improve navigation and the overall 
appearance of the area provided  that they do not:  
i. impede the movement of craft or otherwise compromise navigational safety on the river; or  
ii. disrupt existing recreational uses or areas where there is existing or 
proposed public access; or  
iii. adversely affect the nature conservat ion, landscape or heritage value of 
the River Hamble.  
 
[Note: Policy DM20  refers to boatyards on the River Hamble.]  
 
5.157  The River Hamble is a feature of considerable landscape, biodiversity, heritage,  recreational 
and economic value in the Borough. It is also a location of considerable local, regional and 
national importance for recreational sailing.  
 
5.158  For the purpose of the Local Plan, the term “mooring” includes all facilities for securing yachts 
and other vessels, including berths at marinas. The River Hamble Harbour Authority 
(Hampshire County Council) manages moorings in the river, and has produced a Strategic 
Plan, Strategic Vision and a Business Plan58. Previously t he Authority imposed a limit of 3,261 
moorings on the areas of the river within their area of control.  Because boat sizes have 
increased, the number of moorings is currently some 200 below that total.  
 
5.159  The Borough Council’s  planning jurisdiction extends to the administrative boundary which 
runs down the centre of the river. Planning permission is required for the construction of 
jetties, pontoons and related boardwalks, and the driving of piles. Planning permission is 
usually required for the laying down of ground tackle for swing moorings.  There are areas 
where the Borough Council  has concluded that moorings should not be permitted in order 
to retain the landscape character of t he river, enable views across it and retain access to it 
for other water -related recreation.  In considering development proposals  that affect the 
River Hamble the Borough Council will have regard to the River Hamble Harbour 
Authority’s Strategic Vision, P lan and Business Plan for the river, and will consult the 
Harbour Authority accordingly.  
 
5.160  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of 
how new moorings, and replacement and relocation of existing moorings will be delivered 
without adverse effect on any European site, with particular reference to the Solent European Sites .

5.162  Community facilities include parish halls, church facilities, cemeteries, community centres, 
public houses, schools and colleges, health facilities, libraries, and leisure, arts and 
cultural facilities including youth and social clubs.  
 
Policy DM36, Community, leisure and cultural facilities  
 
1. The development of new community, cultural and leisure facilities and extensions to 
exist ing facilities  will be permitted within Eastleigh town centre, district and local 
centres, neighbourhood parades and in the new local centres to be provided as part 
of the strategic housing sites.  Proposals must be of a scale appropriate to the 
centre.   
 
2. Proposals for  such facilities within the urban edge but outside these centres will 
need to demonstrate that:  
 
a. they are readily accessible to the communities they are intended to serve by a 
variety of modes of transport;  
b. there is no adverse impact on existing and proposed centres; and  
c. there are no suitable, viable and available sites within an existing centre or 
edge of centre location.  
   
112 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  3. In the provision of facilities for general community use such as community halls, the 
Council will seek  to ensure that their form and design provides for a range of uses to 
be accommodated.  
 
4. In the countryside the development of new community, leisure or cultural 
facilities (other than cemeteries addressed at DM37) will not be permitted other 
than by re- use of existing buildings in accordance with DM19 . Extensions to 
existing facilities may be permi tted subject to DM18 . 
 
5. The loss of existing community, leisure or cultural facilities to other forms of development will not be permitted unless:  
 
a. alterna tive provision is made which is more appropriate to the needs of the 
community, or is more accessible; or  
b. the existing facility can be shown to be surplus to local needs.  
Any facilities surplus t o requirements should where possible be re -developed/re -
used in a way that maximises benefits to the local community.  
 
6. The developers  of new housing that is likely to increase use of local community, 
leisure or cultural facilities will be required to contribute to or provide any 
enhancement of existing facilities or new facilities necessitated by their schemes in accordance with policy DM38. 
 
 
5.163  The Borough Council’s strategy focuses on:  
 
• Addressing the shortage of pre- school places and ensuring that there are 
enough school places to meet the needs of the existing and future population;  
 
• Whilst continuing the strategy to promote healthier lifestyles, recognising the ongoing 
need for medical facilities and ensuring accessible local provision of these, preferably focused on local centres, and also accommodating changes in the way services are delivered;  
 
• Making sure all pa rts of the Borough have access to a range of leisure and 
cultural facilities, and making Eastleigh a centre for contemporary culture.  
 
5.164  The Borough includes a wide range of high- quality education facilities.   However, it is likely that 
more will be needed to meet the needs arising from  the increase in population over the plan 
period.  New primary schools are likely  to be needed for the larger new dev elopment sites, and 
extension may  also be needed to existing schools. One new secondary school  is required for 
the east of the Borough.  The Borough Council will continue to work closely with the Education 
Authority  (Hampshire County Council) on reviewing future  needs and the School Places  Plan. In 
addition, the policy enables the Borough Council to address proposals  that may arise from the 
government’s Free Schools initiative and the creation of academies.  Note: development 
proposals affecting school playing fields  are subject to the provisions of Section 77 of the 
Schools Standards and  Framework Act 1998 –  see policy DM32 and related text above.  
 
5.165  The policy is designed to enable the provision of medical facilities to serve local  communities.  
For reasons of sustainability, in particular limiting vehicular journeys, the Council seeks to ensure that these are in accessible locations for the communities they are intended to serve, 
such as town, district and local centres. The Counci l also recognises that the way medical care 
and assistance is delivered will continue to evolve, and any medical facilities provided should 
be designed with sufficient flexibility to enable adaptation to changes in the way services are   
113 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  delivered.  
 
5.166  The policy also protects and enables the development of cultural and leisure facilities within the 
urban areas, seeking to focus these within town, district and local centres where they would be 
most accessible.  
 
5.167  The Council seeks to limit the development of community facilities in rural areas for reasons of 
sustainability, in particular accessibility, and to limit development that urbanises the countryside.  
 
5.168  It is desirable that all members of the community have easy access to community, leisure and cultural facilities, and that existing facilities are not lost to other forms of development.  It will 
also be necessary to increase provision to meet the needs of the increased population of the Borough over the plan period.  Some halls can serve a variety of uses, and in providing new 
communal facilities the Council will encourage the provision of multi -functional buildings.  
 
Cemeteries  
 
Policy DM 37, Cemeter y provision 
 
1. The development of cemeteries including green burial sites will be permitted 
provided that they:  
a. meet the identified needs of local communities; and  
b.  accord with the other policies of this Local Plan relating to the countryside, residential amenities and access;  
c. demonstrate through a risk assessment and site specific data that the base of 
graves will not be below the water table  
d.  do not impact negatively on the biodiversity value of the site and provide 
enhancement where possible  
 
2. Where there is an identified local need, developers may be required to contribute to the costs of cemetery provision or enhancement.  
 
5.169  Responsibility for the provision of cemeteries lies with the parish Council s. However, the 
Borough Council is responsible for cemetery provision in Eastleigh, Allbrook and North Boyatt 
and Chandler’s  Ford. Some site allocations have been made to meet paris h requirements 
where these are known (see Chapter 6).  This policy enables further p rovision  to be made as 
needs arise over the plan period.  It also enables enhancement  of existing facilities.  It is 
important to consult the Environment Agency about  new cemetery proposals in order to ensure 
that ground conditions are suitable for this purpose and there is no danger of pollution of 
watercourses or  groundwater.  
 
 
 
 
   
114 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Implementation  
Policy DM38, Funding infrastructure  
 
1. Development will be permitted provided that the developer has made 
arrangem ents for the provision of, or for contributions to the improv ement of, any 
infrastructure, services, facilities or amenities necessitated by the development 
proposed, by means of either:  
 
a. a planning obligations agreement under section 106 of the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990, and/or  
b. should it be introduced in the Borough in the future, the Community 
Infrastructure Levy under the Planning Act 2008.  
 
 
5.170  Increasing restrictions on public sector expenditure mean that public funds for development and 
related infrastructure  are unlikely to be available to  implement  all of  this plan.  Many of the plan’s 
proposals will be implemented by developers through development proposals and contributions 
to related infrastructure.  Currently most such contributions are secured as planning obligations 
through the provisions of section 106 of the Town and Country  Planning Act 1990.  However, 
more recent  legislation introduced the Community  Infrastructure Levy which has  imposed  strict 
limits on the use of the section 106 process.  
 
5.171  The Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations came into force in April 2010 and have since 
been amended a number of times . The Regulations allow local authorities to impose a charge  
(known as the Community Infrastructure Levy; hereafter referred to as the  “levy”) on 
development in their area to provide funds to contribute to the cost of  providing infrastructure. 
The levy provides for a strategic view of infrastructure  needs rather than the site- specific 
requirements of the section 106 planning obligations r egime. Revenue from the levy can be 
used to fund a wide range of infrastructure needed to support development, including new road 
schemes,  transport improvements, flood defences, schools, health and social care facilities, park 
improvements, green spaces and leisure centres.  
 
5.172  The levy is  charged in pounds per square metre on the net increase in floorspace of any 
given development. The charging rate is  defined in a charging schedule prepared by the 
local authority . The schedule is  subject to public consultation and to public examination by 
an independent examiner whose recommendations will be binding.  
 
5.173  The Borough Council is aware of the restrictions on the future use of section 106 planning 
obligations to secure financial contributions towards the cost of providing infrastructure to 
support development. The Government has introduced a number of other proposed changes 
to the operation of CIL since its introduction in 2010 with the prospect of further changes in the 
pipeline. I n view of this changing regulatory climate and other uncertainties the Borough 
Council is not proposing to implement CIL alongside this local plan. This situation may be reviewed in the future.  
 
5.174  In the meantime, the Council will maintain its current approach to securing developer 
contributions through the section 106 process. The Borough Council recognises that whilst development brings benefits and prosperity to the Borough it also frequently imposes costs 
on existing residents and businesses. It brings pressures on existing infrastructure, including roads,  services and community facilities, and on the environment generally. In 
the past, the community at large has had to bear those pressures or meet the cost of 
necessary improvements, but as noted above, public funds are now increasingly limited.    
115 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
5.175  This plan proposes a variety of new developments and in addition, it is recognised that further 
development will continue to take place within exis ting built up areas.  The Council will seek to 
secure funding from development  for the provision of new or improved infrastructure, services, 
facilities and amenities made necessary by the proposed development. The policy set out 
below will therefore apply  to all proposals for development within the Borough.  
 
 
5.176  Prospective developers are advised to seek the Council’s advice on the nature and scale of the 
contributions that are likely to be sought before purchasing land or property for development. 
The Council intends to revise its Planning Obligations Supplementa ry Planning Document as 
soon as possible.  This will provide guidance on the contributions that the Council will seek to 
negotiate to support new development.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Chapter 6:  Local areas  – parish by parish policies and 
proposals  
 
i. This Chapter sets out detailed site allocations for new development, following on from the 
strategy set out earlier in the Local Plan.  For administrative purposes, t he Borough of Eastleigh 
is split into five areas , each with their own Local Area Committee. For ease of reference, the 
policies in this C hapter are based on these area committee boundaries as follows:  
 
1. Bishopstoke, Fair Oak and Horton Heath  
2. Bursledon, Hamble- le-Rice and Hound  
3. Chandler’s Ford and Hiltingbury  
4. Eastleigh  
5. Hedge End, West End and Botley  
 
ii. The main characteristics of each parish with the Local Area Committee boundary are reviewed, 
and issues identified that are to be addressed either through the strategic and general policies 
of the plan, or through local policies.     
 
iii. The Plan’s land use allocations are then set out as they appear in each parish, along with any other  policies specific to that parish.  
 
iv. Figure 6 opposite shows the Local Areas and Parish boundaries.  
 
Note: the policies in Chapters 4 and 5 apply as relevant to all development within the Borough.

120 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.1  Bishopstoke, Fair Oak and Horton Heath  
 
Bishopstoke Parish  
 
Context and key issues  
6.1.1  The parish of Bishopstoke lies immediately to the east of Eastleigh bordering the Itchen valley .  
To the east it borders the parish of Fair Oak  and Horton Heath.  To the south it borders West 
End parish, and to the nor th Winchester district.  In 2011 the population was 9,974 and there 
were 4,199 dwellings (2011 Census). In 2015 the population was 9,88059. 
 
6.1.2  The Itchen valley fo rms the undeveloped settlement  gap, albeit narrow , between Bishopstoke 
and Eastleigh.  T o the east, howeve r, the separation from Fair Oak has become ver y indistinct 
with the development of closely adjoining residential estates over recent decades.  
 
6.1.3  The valley provides an attractive landscape setting for Bishopstoke village as well as a 
valuable amenity and biodiversity resource.  The Itchen Navigation is of historical interest as it 
was used as a trading route between W inchester and Southampton in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. The route now fo rms pa rt of the Itchen W ay, a popular footpath for 
walkers.  To the nor th of Bishopstoke, Stoke Park W oods also provide a significant  amenity 
area and local nature conser vation interest.  
 
6.1.4  Bishopstoke is an ancient settlement, mentioned in the Domesday Book which started to grow 
in the 19th century with the development of larger houses for those involved with enterprises 
such as the railway industry in Eastleigh.   It boasts some heritage interest with a conservation 
area based on the historic core of the village and its gardens. An important recent issue has 
been the future of the site of The Mount, a large Victorian dwelling in extensive grounds 
formerly used as a hospital. The Borough Council has prepared a development brief for this 
site which  is currently being developed.  
 6.1.5  There are reasonable local sport and recreation facilities including some associated with the 
local schools including the neighbouring Wyvern College. Some facilities are shared with 
neighbouring Fair Oak  and Horton Heath parish including YZone at Blackberry Drive and The 
Hub which lies just in Eastleigh but adjoins Bishopstoke.  There is an identified need for more 
allotment s. 
 
6.1.6  There is very little employment in the parish apart from local shops and small enterprises located in converted farm buildings to the south of the village. However, the employment areas 
of Eastleigh are close by and the new development will include employment land. There are 
two small neighbourhood shopping parades and a few other scattered shops.  
 
6.1.7  The main access route through Bishopstoke is the B3037 Eastleigh to Fair Oak road.  There is a 
good bus se rvice along this route connecting t he village to Eastleigh and Fair Oak.  Howeve r, it 
is a ve ry busy road and there are problems accessing it from the residential side roads, 
especially at peak times. The new link road will provide an alternative access to the M3 in 
addition to serving the new development . There is no railway through the area but the village is 
not far from the main- line station at Eastleigh.   
 
6.1.8  Bishopstoke has a strong sense of community identity and a range of community facilities 
including community halls.  It is generally a prosperous area although there is some 
evidence of deprivation in Bishopstoke on the Stoke Park estate.  
 
6.1.9  Infant and junior schools are located at the Stoke Park site on Unde rwood Road and 
 
59 Small  Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council    
121 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Abbotsbury Road and are understood to be operating at capacit y.  Secondar y school education 
is provided at the Wyve rn College in Fair Oak.  There is a small GP practice at Riverside, along 
with a large r, shared GP surger y on Fair Oak Road.  There is a need for more cemete ry space.  
 
6.1.10  Bishops toke Parish Council is investigating the option for a N eighbourhood Plan. 
 
Development proposals and special policies  
 
6.1.11  The following polic y applies in Bishopstoke:  
 
Bi1 South of Stokewood Surgery  
  
 
Healthcare provision  
 
South of Stokewood Surgery, Bishopstoke  
 
Policy Bi1, South of Stokewood Surgery, Bishopstoke 
 
1. This site is a llocated for healthcare uses to support the provision of heal thcare 
facilities in the Bishopst oke Parish.     
 
 
 
6.1.12  Stokewood surgery serves the residents of Bishopstoke and Fair Oak and Horton Heath.   The 
Plan allocates sites for further housing development in this area, including the land to the West 
of Horton Heath for approximately 1,500 dwellings.  The land to the south of Stokewood Surgery 
allows for its expansion to support the changing and growing needs for primary health care in the area.   This land should be safeguarded for health care use unless it can be demonstrated 
that these needs have already been met elsewhere in the area.  
  
122 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Transpo rt improvements  
 
6.1.13  The Council has previously proposed improvements to junctions on the Bishopstoke Road 
corridor to help relieve peak -hour traffic  congestion.  These include the junctions of Bishopstoke 
Road with Station Hill at the Twyford Road roundabout in Eastleigh and at  Chickenhall Lane.  
Further improvements may be needed through Bishopstoke (particularly at the Riverside 
junction of Church Road and Bishopstoke Road) and Fair Oak .  
  
Church Road/Bishopstoke Road junction at Riverside 
 
6.1.14  This is currently a three -arm priority junction which may not be adequate to accommodate 
anticipated future traffic  flows - this is currently a subject of investigation via the Sub- Regional 
Traffic Model (SRTM).  If a Bishopstoke Road corridor capacity scheme (also seeking to 
improve junctions at Chickenhall Lane and/or Station Hill/Romsey Road ) was to come forward, 
there is potential that this junction could also be included as part of such a scheme.  There 
have been some investigations regarding the potential to signalise this junction.     
  
6.1.15  Should improvement schemes along the Bishops toke Road corridor come forward in the life of 
this Plan, the Borough Council will work with the highways authority to secure funding for this 
proposal from developers’ contributions, including s.106 and community infrastructure levy 
funding, along with ot her sources of funding if necessary, in accordance with the principles set 
out in strategic policy S11.   
 
 
Other transpo rt improvements  
 
6.1.16  A number of schemes are also needed in Bishopstoke to improve road safety and pedestrian 
and cycle facilities.  Proposals to address these needs and issues are set out in the Eastleigh 
Borough Transpo rt Statement and are included in the Council ’s Infrastructure Deliver y Plan.  
 
 
Fair Oak and Horton Heath Parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.1.17  The parish of Fair Oak  and Horton Heath is located in the no rth east co rner of the Borough. To 
the west it adjoins Bishopstoke and West End parishes, and to the south Botley parish.  T o the 
north and east it adjoins Winchester district. The population in 2011 was 10,212 and there 
were 4,080 dwellings (2011 Census). In 2015 the population was 10, 19660. 
 
6.1.18  The settlement gap between the built -up area of Fair Oak and Bishopstoke has become 
increasingly indistinct in recent decades with the development of adjoining housing estat es.  
Within the parish, the settlements of Fair Oak and Hor ton Heath retain distinct identities 
through the retention of a narrow settlement gap between them.  A larger settlement gap 
separates Ho rton Heath from Hedge End and Botley to the south. There will be significant new 
development as part of the strategic al location to the west of Horton Heath (policy HH1) . This  
development  will provide new local facilities for Horton Heath.    
 
6.1.19  To the no rth, Stoke Park Woods provides a significant  amenity area as well as local nature 
conser vation interest.  
 
6.1.20  There are good local spo rt and recreation facilities including some associated with local 
schools such as Wyve rn School, which are available to the general public. Some of the 
parish’ s facilities, such as the recreation ground are accessible by Bishopstoke residents.  
 
61 Small  Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council    
123 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
6.1.21  There is ver y little indust ry in the parish apar t from at Knowle Lane Industrial Estate (Deer 
Park Fa rm) and a few scattered small enterprises, for example in Hor ton Heath.  There is a 
relatively larg e local centre in Fair Oak which although well -used is in need of refurbishment.  
Horton Heath has no local centre as such, although there is a shop in the local petrol station.  
 6.1.22  The main east -west access route through Fair Oak is the B3037 Bishopstoke/Fair Oak Road.  
There is a good bus se rvice along this route connecting these two settlements to Eastleigh.  
Howeve r, it is a ve ry busy road, and there are problems of joining it from the residential side 
roads, especially at peak times. The no rth-south access route is the B3354 W inchester 
Road/Botley Road, which connects Fair Oak and Hor ton Heath and links to Colden Common 
and Winchester to the no rth and Botley to the south. There is no railway station in the area;  the 
nearest stations are west of Bishopstoke at Eastleigh, or at Hedge End.  There are however 
rural bus links to Hedge End, Southampton and Bishop’ s Waltham.  
 
6.1.23  Fair Oak and Hor ton Heath both have a strong sense of community identit y. Fair Oak has a 
range of community facilities including community halls.  Infant, junior and secondar y schools 
are located at the Wyve rn College site, and are understood to be operating at capacit y.  A 
youth facility has been built at Blackber ry Drive, on a site that is accessible to residents of both 
Fair Oak and Hor ton Heath parish and Bishopstoke parish.  There is a shared GP surge ry. 
 
6.1.24  Whilst Ho rton Heath has a community centre, pub and local shop, it has relatively few 
facilities compared to other settlements in the Borough.  
 
6.1.25  At present there is no parish plan for Fair Oak.

Transpo rt improvements  
6.1.30  Limitations on the road network are identified as an issue in Fair Oak and Hor ton Heath. 
The Bishopstoke -Fair Oak Road corridor is recognised as a par ticularly congested route 
at peak hours.  A number of junction improvements are currently committed by 
develo pers as described below .   
 
6.1.31  Details of the estimated cost and timing of any further highway improvements required 
will be included in an updated Infrastructure Deliver y Plan.   
 
 
Policy FO4, Junction imp rovements, Fair Oak and Horton Heath  
 
1. The Borough Council will suppor t the Highway Authority in developing and 
delivering road capacity improvements at locations in the Fair Oak area (in 
addition to cur rent commitments) as  identified in the Local Plan Transport 
Assessment.  
 
Allington Lane/Fair Oak Road and Sandy Lane/Fair Oak Road  
6.1.32  The Allington Lane/Fair Oak Road junction operates as a three -arm priority junction.  It is ve ry 
close to the Sandy Lane junction (see below)  and both junctions have been identified as 
requiring improvement to cope with traffic flows generated by existing committed development.  
 
6.1.33  The West Horton Heath/Fir  Tree Lane development sites have committed to deliver the 
following capacity upgrades at this location:  
 
a. Signalisation of the Allington Lane junction;  
 
b. Provision of an additional lane on Allington Lane on the northbound approach to the 
junction (giving dedicated left hand and right hand turn lanes);  
 c.  Widening between Allington lane and Sandy Lane to give two lanes in each direction 
(consisting of an ahead lane and a right turn filter lane);  
 
d.   A right hand turn filter lane on Sandy Lane southbound arm; and  
 e. Addition of two lanes on Fair Oak Road eastbound to enable dedicated lanes for   each 
traffic movement (left and right turns and ahead).  
    
Botley Road/Eastleigh Road 
6.1.34  The Botley Road/Eastleigh Road junction currently operates as a four -arm signalised junction 
which as well as the B3354 Botley Road and the B3037 Eastleigh Road also se rves a   
130 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  residential area off Stubbington W ay.  
 
6.1.35  There is a commitment by the West Horton Heath development to improve capacity at this 
junction by widening the northern (Winchester Road) arm to provide two southbound lanes.  
 
   
Botley Road/Bu rnett’s Lane, Ho rton Heath  
6.1.36  This junction se rves as a key node in transferring traffic  from Ho rton Heath and Fair Oak to 
Botley and Hedge End and vice versa.  It is also a key component of the network connecting 
Eastleigh to Ho rton Heath via Fair Oak and will ser ve as a gateway to the new development 
west of Ho rton Heath.   
 
6.1.37  Although this junction is perceived as a substantial pinch- point for traffic, the Transport 
Assessment does not identify this junction as a ‘hotspot’ (i.e. traffic exceeding 80% of junction 
capacity), even with the Local Plan development.   
 
 
Strategic development site   
Land west of Horton Heath  
Policy  HH1, Land west of Horton Heath  
 
1.  An area of approximately 125 hectares of land to the west of Horton Heath, east of 
Allington Lane and north of the railway line as defined on the policies map  is allocated 
as a strategic location for development to include approximately 1,500 dwellings, 6ha 
of employment land, open space, retail and community facilities including a primary school and a new link road to Bubb Lane. Development will be subject to the approval 
by the Borough Council of a set design principles and a high- level design code 
includ ing a masterplan which addresses the following requirements:  
 
a. the provision of a new road link between Bubb Lane and the Chalcroft Business 
Park entrance on Burnetts Lane, as indicated on the policies map, built to a standard capable of taking the HGV traffic generated by the Chalcroft Business 
Park and the proposed new employment site, and incorporating roundabout 
junctions on Burnett’s Lane and Bubb Lane.  The link road will continue north 
from Burnetts Lane through the development to Allington Lane . The first phase 
from Bubb Lane to Burnetts Lane will be built prior to the occupation of the first 
dwelling ; 
 
b. the provision of approximately 1,500 dwellings of a variety of sizes and tenures including provision to meet affordable and specific housing needs  of groups 
within the local community in the form of a defined new neighbourhood or 
neighbourhoods to the west of Horton Heath;  
 
c. the provision of approximately 6ha (24,000 sq.m) of employment land, to 
accommodate employment in use classes B2, B8 and/or E( g)(ii)/(iii) , having 
regard also to the possibility of a shared access with the Chalcroft Business 
Park . In accordance with the sequential approach, major office development 
(greater than 1,000 sq.m gross) will only be supported if there are no suitable, 
available or viable alternative sites available in either Eastleigh town centre, the   
131 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  wider Eastleigh urban renaissance quarter, at Eastleigh River Side, 
(Southampton Airport) or in district and local centres;  
 
d. the provision of a new three- form -entry primar y school and associated facilities;  
 e. the provision of community facilities to serve the new development and the 
existing settlement of Horton Heath, to include a new local centre, a new 
community building/hall, early years provision and local health facilities;  
 
f. a layout of residential devel opment designed to maximise opportunities to create 
links to, and to integrate with the existing settlement  of Horton Heath;  
 
g. a layout of development within and around the Chalcroft Farm complex and 
Firtree Farmhouse that retains and enhances the heritage and architectural value of buildings and landscape features and does not prejudice the delivery of a 
transport link through to Allington Lane;   
h.    the provision of vehicular access to the residential parts of the site from 
Burnetts Lane, Allington Lane, Fir Tree Lane and Anson Road;  
i.   the provision of footpath, cycle and bridle routes through the site and that link 
the new developments with the wider existing and proposed footpath and cycleway networks, including those within Horton Heath, and a con tribution 
towards the implementation of the proposed strategic footpath/cycleway route alongside the railway linking Hedge End to Eastleigh (see strategic policy 
S12(1)(e ));  
 
j.   the provision of public open space, sports pitch provision and green 
infrastructure on site to provide a setting for the development and to meet the 
needs of the new and existing communities and related facilities with long term 
maintenance arrangements. O pen space north of Fir Tree Lane shall be managed 
primarily for nature conservation interest and shall not be used for playing fields;  
 k.   ensuring no adverse impacts on adjacent Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation, with the provision of appropr iate buffers in the region of 50m for 
ancient woodland and 20m for other SINC designations;   
 
l.    the provision of a comprehensive landscape framework for the site that includes 
measures to ensure that there is no damage to, and enhancement of the Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation, and that retains as many as possible of the 
existing mature trees and hedgerows within the site, enhances biodiversity interest including that of the watercourses running through the site and provides a linked network of open spaces and green routes;   
 
m.  to preserve water quality and flows details of Sustainable Urban Drainage shall 
be provided in accordance with policy DM6 as part of any application for outline 
or full planning permission;  and  
  
n.   occupation of the development shall be phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service 
provider .    
132 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
 
6.1.38  A 100 hectare site to the west of Horton Heath was allocated in Policy WE1 of the non- adopted 
2011- 2029 Eastleigh Borough Local Plan as a strategic location for development to include up 
to 950 dwellings, 6ha of new employment provision, open space and ass ociated facilities 
including a new village centre, community building, 8FE primary school, 3FE primary school and 
provision of a new road linking Bubb Lane to Allington Lane.  
 
6.1.39  The development would provide the community facilities, including a new primary school, that 
were acknowledged to be lacking in the area, particularly in Horton Heath village.  The purpose 
of the new road link was to enable the intensification of the existing employment uses at 
Chalcroft Business Park and the development of mor e employment uses in this location.  
Government funding towards the cost of delivering the link road has been secured. Accordingly 
it should be provided at an early stage in the implementation of the development.  
 
6.1.40  Outline planning permission for the development was granted in December 2017. However, a 
new proposed secondary school is currently being brought forward by Hampshire County Council as part of the delivery of its site West of Woodhouse Lane allocated at p olicy HE1 of the 
local plan and is no  longer required West of Horton Heath.  
 6.1.41  Outline planning permission was also granted in November 2017 for 450 dwellings on a 28 hectare site adjacent to the west of the WE1 site at Fir Tree Farm. The combination of the two 
  
133 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  developments now forms a s ingle site of c125ha and provides the opportunity for the creation of 
a new road link between Bubb Lane and Allington Lane.  
 
6.1.42  The site now also includes the Foxholes Farm site which was previously allocated for the 
development of 45 dwellings in the draft version of the 2016 -2036 Eastleigh Borough Local 
Plan.  
 6.1.43  The Borough Council has purchased all three of these sites and is working with a ‘master -
developer’ partner to bring forward a comprehensive development of the whole area identified on the policies map. The areas shown in white are excluded from the allocation and are to remain in private ownership and use. The central area shown as countryside is currently in use as a solar farm which has a temporary planning permission un til 31
st December 2037.  
 6.1.44  Previously, approximately half of the site lay within each of the administrative areas of Fair Oak 
& Horton Heath Parish in the north and West End Parish in the south. A boundary review has 
now put the whole site within Fai r Oak & Horton Heath parish.  
 
6.1.45  Given the unique history to the evolution of this site and the Council’s involvement in its delivery 
it is considered necessary to include a policy in the local plan to guide the future comprehensive 
development of this  area which is likely to result in amendments to the individual currently 
consented schemes and a combined single development site west of Horton Heath.  
 
6.1.46 Policy HH1 aims to provide that guidance. It is based on the previous Local Plan policy updated 
to reflect the permitted schemes and emerging master -planning of the whole area. The policy 
establishes the key principles and requirements for the development although the precise detail 
is likely to change as master -planning continues to evolve over the coming months.  The 
dwelling figure of approximately 1,500 dwellings is consistent with the Local Plan’s b orough 
wide transport and environmental evidence.  Any  increase in dwellings will need to be justified 
on its merits.  
 
6.1.47  In combination with other developments proposed, development on this site is likely to have 
significant impacts on a number of local roads (local plan Transport Assessment) and the 
developers will be required to contribute towards measures to address these. The development 
is contingent on the provision of a new road link between Allington Lane and Bubb Lane.  
 
6.1.48  There are few existing links betw een the development site and Horton Heath village, and it will 
be important to take steps to integrate the new and existing developed areas, in particular 
through footpath and cycleway routes, and the careful location of new community facilities so 
that these are also accessible to the existing community. The new primary school should be 
designed and located to meet the needs of the existing as well as the new community.  
 
6.1.49  Footpath and cycle routes should be designed to link with existing routes and to assist with the implementa tion of proposed routes as set out in this Local Plan. It will be important to ensure 
that these provide strong links across the area of open space between the Chalcroft Farm 
complex and the remainder of Horton Heath, and that they also link to public transport facilities, 
in particular Hedge End station.   
 
6.1.50  The proposals include more public open space than the minimum required under policy DM 33, 
because of measures to enhance biodiversity particularly along the watercourses and adjoining 
the Quobleigh Ponds and Wyvern Copse SINCs. The policy proposes appropriate buffers to   
134 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  protect ancient woodland and the SINCs and specifies that these should be in the region of 50m 
for ancient woodland and 20m for the SINCs. These are based on the Council’s initial 
assessment and early advice from Natural England. The precise form and extent of buffers will 
be determined through more detailed site assessments and discussions with Natural England 
and others through the planning application process.  
 
6.1.51 The plan- level Habitats Regulations Assessment has determined that this site is capable of 
being delivered without adverse effect on any European site. To ensure this, a site level 
Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate how this site  will be delivered 
without adverse effect on any European site, with particular reference to the River Itchen SAC 
through impact on water quality, otters, disturbance and the introduction of invasive non- native 
species. Through impacts on the hydrological regime there may also be potential for an impact 
on the Solent and Southampton Water SPA. It is likely to be possible to mitigate these effects by 
means of sustainable drainage systems integrated with the landscape framework and the 
measures to enhance biodiversity. Advice on the provision of water supply and foul drainage should be sought from Southern Water. The site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will 
also need to address any effects on the Solent and New Forest designations.  
 
6.1.52  Any planning application should also include an assessment of the potential for previously 
unidentified archaeological sites and the impact of the proposed development upon these in accordance with policy DM12.  
 
 
Open space and recreation  
 
6.1.53  The Council’s study of open space and recreation provision in the Borough  (Eastleigh Borough 
Open Space Needs Assessment 2017) has identified a need for new allotment provision within 
the Bishopstoke, Fair Oak & Horton Heath local area.  Policy DM34 Chapter  5 enables the 
development of allotments subject to a number of criteria.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.2 Bursledon, Hamble- le-Rice and Hound  
 
Bursledon Parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.2.1  Bursledon is one of the older settlements in the Borough.  In the 1970s and 80s it 
accommodated quite considerable development.  The parish straddles the M27 moto rway, 
extending to the southe rn boundaries of Hedge End to the no rth, and adjoining Hound parish to 
the west and south.  To the east the settlement fronts the River Hamble, which is tidal at this 
point.  There is a relatively narr ow settlement gap between the weste rn edge of Bursledon and 
the city of  Southampton to the west.  
 
6.2.2  Bursledon had its origins in ship- building and repair activities focused on the river .  The River 
Hamble remains of great significance to Bursledon for its ongoing marine- related economic 
activity  – boat repai r, chandler y and moorings – as well as its heritage, landscape, nature 
conser vation and recreational value.  There are tensions between recreational and economic 
activities and maintaining the landscape and biodiversity interest of the river . 
 
6.2.3  The nor thern part of the pari sh includes pa rt of the Manor Fa rm Count ry Park, which includes 
some playing fields  and provision for children and young people.  To the south of the 
moto rway lies the more suburban pa rt of the parish.  The southe rnmost po rtion of the parish 
includes the oldest area at Old Bursledon.  This has a spacious, well -treed character 
interspersed with narrow count ry lanes and retains a semi -rural character that is highly valued 
by its residents.  It is excluded from the urban area of the settlement and included within the 
Old Bursledon Conser vation Area, which is one of the largest in the Borough.  
 6.2.4  The parish includes the Bursledon W indmill.  This is of historical impo rtance and 
designated as a conser vation area . 
 
6.2.5  The principal sources of employment in Bursledon are the marine- related activities on the 
River Hamble and the substantial out -of-centre Tesco supe rmarket at the W indhover 
roundabout.  In te rms of shops and ser vices, there is a local centre at Lowford and another 
small parade of shops at Pilands W ood. 
 6.2.6  Road access to the parish from the moto rway is via a link from junction 8 to the W indhover 
roundabout.  The A27 W est End Road and the A3024 Bursledon Road and Hamble Lane to the 
south also converge at this roundabout, where there are problems of congestion at peak times.  
To the south, the A3025 Por tsmouth Road also links to Hamble Lane.  Hamble Lane is the 
main access to the Hamble peninsula and suffers serious congestion.  The nor thern portion 
leading to the W indhover Roundabout is within an air quality management area because of 
transpo rt-related air pollution.  
 6.2.7  There is a railway station at Old Bursledon, offering links to Southampton and Por tsmouth. A 
regular bus se rvice operates between Fareham and Southampton along the A27, and other 
Southampton se rvices operate via A3025 Po rtsmouth Road.  Public transpor t connections to 
other par ts of Eastleigh Borough, including Eastleigh T own Centre, have historically been 
difficult  to maintain.  
 
6.2.8  There is little in ter ms of a visitor econom y, but there is some local visitor accommodation in 
the for m of bed and breakfast accommodation.  There is a general need for a hotel in the 
Hamble peninsula especially for river and marine visitors.  
 6.2.9  The population of the parish in 2011 was 6,188, and there were 2,652 dwellings (2011   
136 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Census).  In 2015 the population was 6, 21461. There i s an increasing propor tion of older 
people, and an increasing need for specialised accommodation for elderly people and for 
affordable housing.  
 6.2.10  The Lowford Centre was completed in 2015, collocating a GP surgery, a parish run library, 
parish Council  offices and c ommunity facilities run by the Bursledon and District Community 
Association, as well as increased parking to support the local centre. Education facilities are adequate to meet local needs and the prima ry schools are understood to be operating at 
capacit y.  The settlement has village halls and other meeting places.   
 
6.2.11  There is evidence of deprivation at the Pilands Wood estate at Bursledon, where 
unemployment levels are higher than in other pa rts of the Borough . 
 
 
Development proposals and special policies  
 
6.2.12  The following policies apply in the parish of Bursledon:  
 
BU1  Land north of Providence Hill  
 
BU2 Heath House Farm  
 BU3 Land lying south east of Windmill Lane 
 
BU4 Land at Tansfield Stud, Tanhouse Lane, Hedge End 
 
BU5  Land at Heath Green, Heath House Lane, Hedge End 
   
BU6 Riverside Boatyard, Blundell Lane, Bursledon  
  
BU7 Residential extensions and replacement dwellings, Old Bursledon Special Policy Area
  
 
 
Housing  
 6.2.13  New allocations for residential development are proposed around the no rthern boundaries of 
the settlement extending towards the M27 motor way, and in the area south of Hedge End.  A 
new link road is proposed extending from Heath House Lane to Dodwell Lane, south of Hedge 
End, to ease the movement of traffic  from the new development areas at Boorley Green and 
east of Hedge End to junction 8 of the M27.

137 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Land north of  Providence Hill  
 
Policy BU1, Land north of  Providence Hill  
 
1. An area of 1.1 hectare on the north side of Providence Hill is allocated for 
residential development of approximately 19 dwellings. Planning permission will 
be granted provided that detailed proposals accord with the development plan 
and meet the following specific development requirements:  
 
 a. noise and air quality assessments are undertaken to confirm that the site can be developed satisfactorily for residential purposes given the proximity 
to the A27;  
 
 b.  hydrological surveys are undertaken to identify the extent of the headwater 
system on s ite and the hydrological routes that feed the headwater and 
provide chemical and water quality testing to act as a baseline to monitor 
impact;  
 
c.  the development incorporates measures to safeguard the adjoining stream 
and Windmill Woods Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) with 
20m undeveloped buffers;  
 
d.  to preserve water quality and flows into the unnamed watercourse to the 
north of the site details of Sustainable Urban Drainage shall be provided in 
accordance with policy DM6 as part of any application for  outline or full 
planning permission;   
 
e.   ensur e avoidance or mitigation of direct and indirect adverse impacts on 
habitats or species protected by legislation or identified as of principal 
importance within the NERC Act 2006 S41 lists and that there is a net gain in 
biodiversity ;  
 
f.   the development provides a high quality landscaped setting which preserves 
or enhances the special interest, character and appearance of the adjoining 
Bursledon Windmill Conservation Area and safeguards the setting of the 
listed windmill ; 
 
g.   a new vehicular and pedestrian access is provided from Providence Hill ; and  
 h.  occupation of the development is phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service 
provider.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
138 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.2.14  This triangular shaped site on the north side of Providence Hill (A27) slopes significantly 
away from the road and has mature trees to the site boundaries. There is an existing vehicular access at the north -western end of the site, but this would not be adequat e to 
service a new development of this site. A new vehicular access would be needed from 
Providence Hill, which could be challenging given the topography of the land. There are 
protected trees on the adjoining land. The site adjoins the listed Bursledon Wi ndmill and 
Conservation Area. A watercourse runs along the northern boundary. Headwaters of the 
stream are within the site and will need to be buffered. Windmill Woods Site of Importance 
for Nature Conservation adjoins and suitable safeguards will be requi red. 
 
6.2.15   Adjoining sites have planning permission for residential development. To the north, land to the rear of Orchard Lodge has planning permission for up to 29 houses with associated 
parking, open space and improvements to the existing vehicular access off Windmill Lane 
(reference: C/14/74932). To the north -west, planning permission was granted in December 
2016 for 3 dwellings (ref: F/16/79496). Land at Providence Hill and Oakhill has outline permission for up to 62 dwellings ref: R/16/77966.  
 
6.2.16  The topog raphy of the land and the shape of the site are constraints on the nature and 
amount of development. This is likely to result in a relatively low density of development with 
detached properties following contour lines. An outline planning application has been 
received for this site.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
139 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Heath House Farm  
 
Policy BU2, Heath House Farm  
 
1. An area of approximately 3.4ha of land on the eastern side of Heath House Lane, as 
defined by the policies map, is all ocated for development to include approximately 38 
dwellings. Planning permission will be granted provided that the detailed proposals 
comply with the development plan, and comply with an approved masterpl an for the 
whole site which addresses the following specific requirements: - 
a. a range of housing types, sizes and tenure;  
 
b. the provision of on- site public open space and play areas, to serve the 
development;  
 
c. the provision of vehicular access from Heath House Lane;  
 
d. the provision of contributions to, or delivery of, off -site highway 
improvement s considered necessary to serve the development;  
 
e. the provision of pedestrian and cycle links both within the site and to 
connect the site with the surrounding area, including the adjacent Rodaway 
Pavilion and Football Ground and Manor Farm Country Park and 
development to the south;  
 
f. the maintenance and improvement of the P ublic Rights of Way to the north 
of the site;  
 g. a trapping and tracking survey within Piland’s Copse SINC to assess 
Bechstein bat presence/absence and how they are using the area. A 
mitigation plan will be prepared if Bechsteins are present, including 
extensive dark corridors adjacent to the woodland and along any flight lines 
being accessed by the bats, a lighting strategy to ensure the food species of 
the bats are not attracted by the development lighting  and adequate habitat 
that will support the Bechstein’s food source (e.g. grassland habitats) . 
Further mitigation maybe required;  
 
h. ensure avoidance or mitigation of direct and indirect adverse impacts on 
habitats or species protected by legislation or identified as of principal 
importance within the NERC Act 2006 S41 lists, that routes remain o pen 
through the Hamble Estuary Priority Biodiversit y Area for species dispersal  
and that there is a net gain i n biodiversity;  
 
i. to preserve water quality and flows into the Hoe Moor stream details of 
Sustainable Urban Drainage shall be provided in accordance with policy 
DM6 as part of any application for outline or full planning permission;   
 j. the provision of good quality landscape setting for the development 
(including buffer planting on Heath House Lane frontage), and maintaining 
and reinforcing existing boundary hedgerows, tree belts and woodland;  
 
k. a thorough  examination of the potential for the relocation of the overhead 
power line which crosses the site, in order to maximise the site's 
development potential;  
 
l. ensuring an acceptable noise environment for new homes through 
appropriate siting of development and the provision of suitable noise and air 
mitigation measures, in light of the increased road traffic noise impact fr om   
140 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Kings Copse Avenue, due to the opening of Pylands bypass/Link Road and 
Botley bypass and the proposed school;  
 m. provision of a contamination assessment, in  light of the former use of the 
adjacent land as a landfill; and  
 n.  occupation of the development is phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service provider.  
 
 
 
6.2.17  The site comprises 3.4ha of land on the eastern side of Heath House Lane and the south of 
Rodaway Pavilion and Football Ground. The site currently accommodates a number of 
buildings and structures including a children's residential car e home (Heath House Farm). 
These are all located linear to the northern boundary, adjacent to the P ublic Rights of Way 
and Rodaway Pavilion and Football Ground. The undeveloped areas of the site are located 
to the south of the existing buildings and structures. The topography of the site falls sharply 
from north to south. This area of the site experiences a sharply fall i n gradient until reaching 
the southern boundary.  
 
6.2.18  The site is suitably enclosed by mature vegetation on all boundaries including P ilands Copse 
Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) which is ancient in origin and is likely to 
support rar e Bechstein bats which are extremely light sensitive. Overhead powerlines cross 
diagonally through the centre of the site. Sporadic gaps in the mature hedgerow on the north 
west boundary enable views into the site from Heath House Lane. The majority of the site is 
visible from Heath House Lane to the north west. The site as a whole is likely to be able to 
accommodate approximately 38 dwellings, alongside the new school provision.

iv. details of protection for the headwaters within Windmill Woods SINC;  
 
d. the development shall not have an adverse impact on the nature conservation interest of the adjoining Windmill Woods (SINC) , or the 
adjoining reptile translocation site with suitable undeveloped buffers provided. Windmill Woods should be buffered by 20m ;  
 
e. the development provides a high quality landscaped setting which preserves 
or enhances the special interest, character and appearance of the adjoining 
Bursledon Windmill Conservation Area and safeguards the setting of the 
listed windmill ; 
 
f. a new vehicular and pedestrian access is provided from Providence Hill;  
 
g. evidence is provided that the site is not contaminated and;

142 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.2.19  This land, south- east of Windmill Lane and extending up to the boundary of the M27, 
currently comprises grassland and wooded areas, including the Windmill Wood Site of Importance for Nature Conservation, a small wet woodland.  In May 2016, an outline 
planning application was submitted for this site and adjoining land, for up to 200 dwellings 
with associated open space and access from P rovidence Hill (Council reference 
O/16/78514). The application was withdrawn by the applicant in December 2016. The Council is currently considering a further application for 130 dwellings on this larger site. The 
site is currently 'land -locked' so access would be required across adjoining land. The site 
adjoining to the south has planning permission for up to 62 dwellings and provision of public 
open space with a new vehicular access from Providence Hill (Council reference 
O/14/74322). The site adjoins the listed Bursledon Windmill and Conservation Area.  
 6.2.20  The topography of the land, the amount of tree cover, Badnum Creek and a tributary which run 
through the site, separation of the site from the road network, and proximity to the M27, all 
impose constraints on the development. Noise and air quality assessments will be required to 
determine to what extent the site can be developed for residential use. The site is also partially 
on a former landfill site.

6.2.22  Heath Green is located on the southern side of Heath House Lane, south of Hedge End.  It is 
currently in unauthorised G ypsy and T ravellers use. The site is currently arranged in an L shape 
with a further small area of open ground to the south. The boundari es of the site are well defined 
by mature planting which significantly limits views into and out of the site. Piland’s Copse, to the 
west and south of the site is an area of ancient woodland which has also been identified as a 
site of importance for nature conservation. The site is located within the defined settlement ‘ gap’ 
between Hedge End and Bursledon.  
 
 
 
Transpo rt 
 
Sundays Hill Bypass  
 
6.2.23  Sundays Hill (Dodwell Lane) is currently of sub- standard width and alignment which, at peak 
times, presents some constraints on traffic  and highway safet y. The junction of Bursledon 
Road and Heath House Lane is also restrictive in te rms of traffic  movements, with limited 
scope for improvements due to the proximity of residential prope rties and relatively poor 
visibility splays.  
 
6.2.24  The development proposed to the east and nor th-east of Hedge End (including Boorley Green 
and Botley) is likely to generate traffic  that will place a considerable stress on the existing road 
network in this locati on.  
 
6.2.25   To help mitigate this impact, a new bypass has been constructed at Sundays Hill,  which will 
mitigate traffic impacts from current developments in this area and may also act to serve 
traffic from future development.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Hamble Lane Junction Improvements  
 
6.2.26  The Local Highway Authority is currently considering potential improvements to the section of 
Hamble Lane between and including the Portsmouth Road and Tesco junctions. This section 
of road is frequently congested at present and part of it has been designated as an Air Quality 
Management Area.  Proposed improvements here may involve signalising the three junctions 
(Tesco, Jurd Way and Portsmouth Road) with associated layout improvements, as well as 
some potential carriageway widening on Hamble Lane between the junctions. Other 
alterations to local highway layouts are also being considered.  
 
6.2.27  The “do minimum modelling” of the Council’s preferred Local Plan strategy does not indicate that any significant further congestion impacts will occur in this area - HCC’s proposals are 
primarily aimed at addressing issues whi ch exist at present or which may arise in future as a 
result of committed developments.  
 
Strategic Network Improvements   
6.2.28  Several improvements to the strategic road network affecting the Bursledon Parish area are 
currently under development by Highways England, HCC and SCC as part of the M27 
Southampton Junctions project with implementation planned in the early 2020s after 
completion of the M27 Smart Motorway project.  These include:  
 
a. Improvements to M27 junction 8 including additional lanes on t he off -slip roads, 
signalisation, and provision of cycle and pedestrian access across Junction 8;  
 b. Improvements to capacity at Windhover Roundabout including additional lanes and signalisation of currently unsignalised parts of the junction; and  
 
c. Improvements at various junctions on A3024 Bursledon Road towards 
Southampton city centre.  
 
 
Other transpo rt improvements  
 
6.2.29  There are pa rts of the road network in Bursledon that suffer traffic  congestion, and 
improvements are required to ease traffic  movement and improve road safet y. Improvements 
are also required to pedestrian and cycle facilities. These are set out in the Eastleigh Borough Transpo rt Statement and will be included in the Council ’s Infrastructure Deliver y 
Plan.

e. a full breeding and wintering bird survey of the site, SINC and SAC focusing on 
the species designated as part of the Solent Complex;  
 f. an otter survey of the headwater ecosystem and any other likely foraging and 
commuting routes;  
 
g.   any further protected species surveys thought to be relevant . 
 
 
  
148 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
6.2.30  The site adjoining the Riverside Boatyard to the north of Blundell Lane may have potential to 
accommodate hotel use. The site is also suitable for other holiday accommodation occupied 
for holiday purposes only, excluding permanent caravans occupied as a sole or main 
residence and second homes.  
 
6.2.31  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site. Par ticular reference 
should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with 
regards to the River Itchen SAC and the avoidance and mitigation measures identified. These 
include:  
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to risk introducing invasive non- native species  
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of watercourses to 
preserve the otter movement network.    
 
6.2.32  There is also potenti al for previously unidentified archaeology of prehistoric  and Roman date. 
Any planning application should include an assessment of the potential for previously 
unidentified archaeological sites and the impact of the proposed development upon these in 
accordance with policy DM12 . 
 
Open space and re creation  
 6.2.33  The Sports Facility Needs Assessment and Playing Pitch Strategy Update and the Open 
Space Needs Assessment  has identified that although the supply of allotments in Bursledon 
parish is currently sufficient, by 2036 it is likely that the supply will be under pressure to meet 
the required quantity standard.  The Needs Assessment has also identified that there are some 
parts of Bursledon Parish that are not well located for access to play spaces  for children and 
young people. The new housing allocations will meet some of this requirement.  Policy DM 34, 
Chapter 5 enables the development of allotments subjec t to a number of criteria.  
 
Heritage  
 
Residential extensions and replacement buildings in the Old Bursledon Special  Policy Area  
 Policy BU7, Residential extensions and replacement dwellings, Old Bursledon Special Policy 
Area  
 
1. Residential extensions and replacement dwellings in the Old Bursledon Special Policy 
Area as defined  on the policies map will be pe rmitted provided they:  
 
a. do not increase the volume of the original dwelling (as existing when the 
conser vation area was first  designated in 1982) by more than 25%. Fu rther 
extension beyond this limit will not be per mitted;  
b. have regard to the impact of the development on the space between 
buildings and the openness of the area, ensuring that the character of the 
undeveloped landscape between buildings is conser ved and enhanced;  
c. do not create a dwelling dispropo rtionally larger than the one that is being 
extended or replaced;  
d. are subser vient to and in propo rtion to the existing building in fo rm, scale and 
design;  
e. do not contribute to the cumulative urbanisation of the area; and  
f.   are not othe rwise detrimental to the character of the area as viewed from the 
River Hamble.  
   
149 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
 
6.2.34  The Old Bursledon Conser vation Area consists of low density housing, woodland, open 
fields  and salt marshes adjacent to the River Hamble. There is a distinctive character to the 
area – scattered dwellings, some of historic interest and many of great cha rm and characte r, 
served by narrow count ry lanes with well- established hedgerows, banks, walls and trees.  
 
6.2.35  The area is excluded from the urban area of Bursledon because of its semi -rural characte r, 
poor accessibility and concer n that the construction of even a single new dwelling would be 
harmful to the character and appearance of the area. However , it is not possible to prevent all 
development and extensions to and replacements of existing buildings are per mitted where 
these do not detract from the character of the area.  
 
6.2.36  There have been a num ber of instances in recent years where extensions and replacements 
have been built that increase the floor area of the original dwelling ver y substantiall y.  While the 
normal policies controlling development in the count ryside and in conse rvation areas would 
obviously be used to assess any such proposals, there are fears amongst the local community that these are insufficient,  and that fu rther development will seriously erode the valued character 
of the area.  The Borough Council therefore proposes  the introduction of a stricter policy to 
control the size of extensions.  
 
6.2.37  The boundaries of the conser vation area were reviewed through the preparation of the Old 
Bursledon Conser vation Area Appraisal SPD.  The conclusion of public consultation was that 
an area at Hunger ford Bottom should be excluded from the conse rvation area, but that the 
policy controlling the size of extensions should continue to apply to it.  The Council has 
therefore identified an Old Bursledon Special Policy A rea that includes the whole of the 
conser vation area and Hunger ford Bottom.  
 
6.2.38  The Old Bursledon Conser vation Area lies in the count ryside and is pa rticularly vulnerable to 
  
150 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  the visual impacts of large- scale extensions and replacement dwellings.  It is therefore subject 
to a special policy to manage these fo rms of development, suppo rted by the Council ’s 
Supplementar y Planning Document; ‘Old Bursledon Conser vation Area Appraisal’.  When 
assessing any proposal to extend a dwelling, account  will be taken of any previous extensions 
and their cumulative effect on the size and character of the prope rty and the appearance of the 
area.  
 
 
Hamble -le-Rice parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.2.39  The parish of Hamble- le-Rice is situated in the southern part of the Hamble Peninsula, fronting 
the estuary of the River Hamble and the coast of Southampton Water to the east and south.  It 
adjoins Hound parish to the north and west. It is one of the older  settlements in the Borough, 
and has grown considerably in recent decades.  The population of the parish in 2011 was 4,695 and there were 2,207 dwellings (2011 Census). In 2015 the population was 4, 722
62. 
 
6.2.40  The village had its origins in marine- related activities and its connections to the River 
Hamble remain very strong, with boat -building and repair and considerable sailing activity 
remaining major influences in the local economy and a valued part of local heritage.  The attractive villa ge centre lies on the shore of the Hamble estuary and is included in the 
Hamble Conservation Area.  Other features of archaeological interest include iron- age 
remains on Hamble Common and the foundations of St Andrew’s Castle (a former Henry VIII castle) on the coast.  The village also has an aviation heritage as the former Hamble 
Airfield played a significant role in both World Wars.  More could be made of the village’s heritage both for the benefit of residents and to encourage visitors.  
 
6.2.41  The river is central to the identity of the village and is of considerable value for its landscape, for 
nature conservation and for recreation as well as heritage. There are tensions between 
recreational and economic activities and maintaining the landscape and biodiversity interest of 
the river and the coast, including its accessibility for other recreational uses.  
 
6.2.42  The former airfield is a substantial area to the immediate north of the village. It has been 
disused for many years and its future is one of the main concerns of the local community.  The 
Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan adopted in October 2013 identifies the whole site as an 
area for mineral extraction.  
 
6.2.43  Residents have access to a good range of recreational activities. Facilities include Hamble 
Common and extensive access to the coast and the river estuary. There is also a secondary 
school  on the outskirts of the village which offers indoor and outdoor fac ilities.  
 
6.2.44  Hamble has quite considerable areas of employment with a major aviation business, a large 
industrial estate and an oil storage depot fronting Southampton Water. Boatyards and 
marinas front the River Hamble estuary.  
 
6.2.45  Retail facilitie s in the village are limited.  The village centre struggles to retain shops, of 
which there are now very few.  There is another small frontage at Coronation Parade but 
here too there are pressures for non- retail uses. However, there is a reasonable array of 
public houses and restaurants.  
 
6.2.46  The main route into the parish is Hamble Lane, which is one of the most congested roads in 
the Borough  (see commentary on Bursledon). Access to the water frontage is from Satchell 
Lane, but this is a narrow road als o linked to Hamble Lane.  
 
 
62 Small  Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council    
151 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.2.47  There is a railway station serving Hamble, but it is some way out of the village to the north.  
Public transport is good to Southampton but is poor to the north  of the Borough, particularly with 
regard to links to Eastleigh. The majority of people use cars.  There is a small ferry between Hamble and Warsash.  
 
6.2.48  The village is popular with tourists and the sailing community, but suffers from inadequate 
parking particularly for regattas or other events. This limi ts the economic benefits that could 
arise from its river frontage, marine activity and heritage interest. There is some local visitor accommodation in the form of B&Bs and camp sites, but there is a general need for a hotel, 
particularly for marine visitor s. 
 
6.2.49  There is an increasing proportion of older people and a related increased need for specialised 
accommodation for elderly people.  Local medical facilities are available in the form of a GP 
surgery, the Blackthorn surgery, which is located in the countryside between Hamble and 
Netley and serves both communities. Education facilities are adequate to meet local needs and the primary schools are understood to be operating at capacity.  The settlement has village 
halls and other meeting places. The re is a strong sense of community and local identity in 
Hamble, and a good range of local activities.  
 
6.2.50  The most pressing issues in Hamble include:  
 
• The future of the Hamble Airfield;  
• Traffic and parking, including the provision of parking facilities at Hamble railway station;  
• Accommodation for older people;  
• Protection of the River Hamble and its environs;  
• Potential to exploit the marine and aviation heritage of the area.  
 
 
6.2.51  The following policies apply in the parish of Hamble:  
 
HA1 Railway station parking, Hamble  
HA2 Mercury Marina and Riverside camping and caravan park  
HA3 Hamble Airfield  
 
 
Transport improvements  
 
Hamble Railway Station  
 
Policy HA1, Railway station parking, Hamble  
 
1. The Borough Council will work with the Highway Authority and other stakeholders to 
provide a new car park to the south of Hamble railway station, as shown on the 
policies map, to serve the station.  
   
152 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.2.52  Access to the railway station has been identified as an issue in Hamble  because of the lack of 
car parking.  The Council has undertaken some feasibility studies into provision of parking on 
land to the south of the station however estimated cost and use of the Police training facility 
access road to ac cess a station car park require further consideration at this time.  
 
Mercury Marina and Riverside Camping and Caravan Park  
  
Policy HA2, Mercury Marina and Riverside Camping and Caravan Park  
 
1. Approximately 4.7 hectares of land at the Mercury Marina and the Mercury Yacht 
Harbour and Holiday Park, Satchell Lane, Hamble/Hound ( in addition to the 
boatyard identifi ed on the policies map ) is allocated for a marina, a range of holiday 
accommodation and car parking/boat storage.  
 
a. Development will be subject to the approval by the Borough Council of a 
development brief including a masterplan which addresses the following 
requirements:  
 
i. the site retains and enhances the marina and related uses 
including marine employment, sail and canoe training, facilities 
for other water -sports and visitor facilities;  
ii. a public slipway to the River Hamble will be provided within the site for 
the use of the general public;  
iii. the site retains and, where feasible, enhances the existing amount and 
mix of holiday accommodation within the site;  
iv. the northernmost shores of the site are restored for nature 
conservation purposes, commensurate with the proximity of national 
and international nature conservation designations;  
  
153 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  v. the Mound (the Mercury Marina Saltmarsh Site of Importance for 
Nature Conservation) adjoining the site is retained and managed to 
maintain and enhance its nature conservation interest, including the 
provision if possible of public access connecting the s ite to Mercury 
Gardens to the south subject to there being no adverse impact on 
nature conservation interests;  
vi. the development includes measures to protect the amenities of 
existing residential properties within the site and adjoining dwellings 
to the sout h at The Halyards, Fry Close and Kingfisher Close; and  
vii. a flood risk sequential approach to allocating land uses is taken within 
the site, with the most vulnerable parts of the development located in 
the areas of lowest risk.  
 
b. A site level Habitats Regulati on Assessment is required to demonstrate how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site.  
 
c. Development or redevelopment may be permitted incorporating a modest 
amount of floorspace not restricted to boat -related uses, where the Council is 
convinced that such a use is needed to secure the future of a boatyard or 
marina and it is demonstrated that  the development will complement the use of 
the site and/or the enjoyment of the River Hamble.  
 
 
 
 
6.2.53  It is considered important to retain and enhance the training facilities for sailing and canoeing 
and other water sports which are in use on  the site.  These are used and valued by the local 
community including the Itchen South District Scouts and the Sea Scouts. It is also 
considered important that the site provides for a range of holiday needs.  It is also important 
that the comprehensive scheme delivers enhanced workshops for the ma rine economy and 
an enhanced marina restaurant/bar/café facility for visitors, including opening up the 
  
154 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  pedestrian route through the Mound, and managing this route consistent with criterion (vii).  
 
6.2.54  The site is in a very ecologically sensitive location adjacent to 3 international designations (1 
Special Area of Conservation and 2 Special Protection Areas); 2 national designations (Sites 
of Special Scientific Interest); 3 local designations (2 Sites of  Importance for Nature 
Conservation and 1 Local Nature Reserve); and an area of ancient woodland. There must be 
no adverse impact on these designations in accordance with policy DM11 (Nature 
Conservation). In the site level Habitats  Regulation Assessment, p articular reference should 
be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with regards to the Solent Maritime SAC and the Solent and Southampton Water SPA and 
Ramsar site and the avoidance and mitigation measures identified. These include:  
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents of, and a 
commitment to monitoring,  with regard to the risks associated with introducing 
invasive non- native species ; and  
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of 
standard pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of 
watercourses to preserve the otter movement network.    
 
 If the s ite is not developed in accordance with the policy , it should remain in its current boatyard 
and marina use, as it remains important for the local marine economy.  
 
Open space and recreation  
 
Hamble Airfield  
 
Policy HA3, Hamble Airfield  
 
1. If permission is granted for the extraction of sand and gravel at Hamble Airfield and 
the extraction takes place, the site shall be restored in accordance with the 
Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan and it shall be retained as an area of accessible 
countryside and open space with grazing, public access and outdoor recreat ion 
facilities laid out to the satisfaction o f the Borough Council.  
 
   
155 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.2.55  As is the case for Bursledon Parish, the Open Space Needs Assessment has identified 
that although the supply of allotments in the Parish of Hamble is currently sufficient; by 
2036 it is likely that the supply will be under pressure to meet the required quantity 
standard. Policy DM3 4, Chapter 5 enables  the development of allotments subject to a 
number of criteria.  
 
6.2.56  After a distinguished wartime history, the former Hamble Airfield ceased to be used as an 
airfield during the 1960s and was sold to developers in the 1980s. The Hampshire Minerals 
and Waste Plan 2013 (HMWP) has now identified the whole site as an area for sand and 
gravel extraction (HMWP Policy 20(3) iii). Following the completion of the extraction 
process, Appendix A of the HMWP indic ates that the site should be restored to a 
combination of grazing, nature conservation, open space, public access and woodland. In accordance with paragraph 4.74 of the HMWP, the public rights of way network adjoining 
the site should be retained and where necessary improved as part of any restoration work.  
 6.2.57  The restored site would be used appropriately as an area for public recreation and countryside 
uses as well as for general grazing of agricultural and domestic animals including horses.  The 
Borough Council will be prepared to consider the use of parts of the site for outdoor sports as 
well as for general public amenity space.  
  
Hound parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 6.2.58  The parish of Hound adjoins Southampton to the nor th-west, and fronts Southampton W ater 
to the southwest and Hamble to the east.  It extends no rth almost as far as the M27, adjoining 
Bursledon parish to the east and W est End parish to the no rth.  It includes Netley Abbey , 
  
156 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  which is one of the older settlements in the Borough, and the small outlying settlements of 
Butlocks Heath and Old Netley (which borders Bursledon).  In 2011 the population of the 
parish was 7,105 and there were 3,255 dwellings (2011 Census). In 2015 the population was 
7,31663.  
 
6.2.59  Large areas of the parish are undeveloped, fo rming the majority of the settlement gap 
between Southampton and the settlements of Netley and Bursledon.  The parish includes the 
Royal Victoria Count ry Park managed by Hampshire County Council, which is of hist oric, 
landscape and recreational value and extends along the coast of Southampton W ater.  It also 
includes the West Wood Count ry Park, another area of recreational green space managed by 
Hampshire County Council.  Access to the coast is good in locations, with pedestrian and cycle routes providing links through to Southampton.  There is considerable biodiversity 
interest, with the coastline included in sites of national, European and inte rnational interest, 
and local nature conser vation designations at West Wood, woodlands in and near Netley 
(some of which extend nor th to Bursledon) and other areas of local interest to the no rth of the 
parish including Netley Common.  
 
6.2.60 Parts of the coast are eroding and in time will be affected fu rther by sea level rise.  Areas at 
risk include the Royal Victoria Count ry Park.  Netley itself is protected by low cliffs which are 
subject to slow erosion. The Nor th Solent Shoreline Management Plan identifies  a narrow area 
at risk of erosion along the cliff top, and has a ‘hold the line’ policy for this stretch of the 
coastline (although this is subject to the availability of resources).  
 6.2.61 There is considerable heritage interest in this parish, with the ruins of Netley Abbey and Netley 
Castle ( Scheduled Monuments), numerous listed buildings and historic landscapes (including 
the Royal Victoria Count ry Park). The centre of Netley is included in a conser vation area.  
Some listed buildings are not in a good state of repai r.  There are other  areas of heritage 
interest at Butlock s Heath and Old Netley . 
 
6.2.62 There are few employment premises in the parish.  There is one small industrial estate at the 
Sidings, and a minor industrial development at the fo rmer Abbey Fruit Fa rm; there are also 
some conve rted fa rm buildings within the parish, including at Hound Far m.  In addition, there is 
a Police T raining Headquar ters in the count ryside to the east of Netley .  There are some shops 
in the settlement with minor parades at Victoria Road and Station Road –  however , retaining 
retail uses is proving difficult,  and the frontage at Victoria Road in pa rticular is showing signs of 
decline.  
 
6.2.63 The parish is se rved by Hamble Lane and some other road links to Southampton, including the 
A3025 Por tsmouth Road, the A3024 Bursledon Road and the A27 W est End Road. Hamble 
Lane, the A27 and the A3024 converge at W indhover roundabout, where there is congestion at 
peak hours. An air quality management area has been defined in this area including the 
northern end of Hamble Lane because of vehicle emissions arising from congestion. 0 
 
6.2.64 There is an increasing propor tion of older people, and recent developments have included 
Netley Court, a residential care development for older people.  Local medical facilities are 
limited to the Blacktho rn surger y which lies in the count ryside between Hamble and Netley 
and ser ves both communities – there are conce rns about its relative inaccessibilit y.  
Education facilities are adequate to meet local needs and the prima ry schools are 
understood to be operating at capacit y. The settlement has village halls and other meeting 
places.  There is some local concer n about the provision of public utilities, in par ticular the 
state of sewers and water supply infrastructure. There is evidence of deprivation in pa rts of 
Netle y, with relatively poor incomes and some unemployment.  
 
6.2.65 Netley has a railway station and is well se rved by bus to Southampton and Hamble. Links to the 
north of the Borough , including Eastleigh are poor , howeve r.

6.2.66 Hound has a  parish plan.  
 6.2.67 The main issues in Hound parish include:  
 
• The future of the local centre at Netley;  
• Maintaining and enhancing heritage interest;  
• Access, which is affected by congestion on Hamble Lane;  
• Lack of local employment oppo rtunities;  
• Coastal erosion along the Netley village and Royal Victoria Count ry Park frontages.  
 
 
Economy and tourism  
 
Holiday Accommodation, Mercu ry Marina  
 
6.2.68  The sites of Mercu ry Marina and the adjoining Riverside Camping and caravan site are 
allocated for marina and holiday accommodation use.  The southe rn part of the site lies  in 
Hamble parish, and the proposal is at policy HA2, section 6. 2 above.  
 
 
Transpo rt improvements  
 
6.2.69 Access issues have been identified in Hound Parish.  Many of these relate to traffic  using the 
main routes to and from Southampton and Bursledon, e.g. Hamble Lane, Por tsmouth Road 
and Woolston Road, and junctions on these roads with Grange Road.  There are a number of 
proposals to remedy these. These are set out in the Eastleigh Borough Local T ranspo rt 
Statement and will be included in the Council ’s Infrastructure Deliver y Plan.  
 
6.2.70 The M27 Southampton Junctions scheme and potential Hamble Lane junction improvements 
also fall along the boundaries of Hound Parish.  
 
Open space  
 
6.2.71  The Council ’s Open Space Needs Assessment has not identified any needs in the parish 
of Hound.  However, the Sports Facility Needs Assessment and Playing Pitch Strategy  
Update has identified a need for additional community use sports pitches within the parish 
of Hound.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.3 Chandler ’s Ford and Hiltingbury  
 
Chandler’s Ford Parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.3.1  The parish of Chandler ’s Ford is located to the no rth-west of Eastleigh west of and bounded by 
the M3, and merges with the V alley Park development in T est Valley Borough to the west.  It 
includes Hiltingbur y to the no rth and the Velmore area to the south where there has been 
substantial recent redevelopment of the housing stock.  Originally a collection of fa rms, 
Chandler ’s Ford was located on an impor tant route between Southampton and W incheste r, and 
started to grow when brick works became established in the area.  Development has included 
subs tantial areas of employment, some based on the for mer brickworks site.  In 2011 the 
population of the area was 23,916 and there were 10,270 dwellings (2011 Census). In 2015 the 
population had increased to 24,421 people64. 
 
6.3.2  Although ve ry substantially developed, Chandler ’s Ford and Hiltingbur y retain some impo rtant 
green spaces and amenity areas, some of local biodiversity interest, including the Flexford and 
Hocombe Mead Nature Reser ves, the Lakes off Lakewood Road, Cuckoo Bushes and 
Rama lley Copse.  Parts of the area, in pa rticular at Hiltingbu ry, have been developed with 
larger houses set in mature grounds that create a valued local characte r.  Howeve r, access to 
larger areas of open space such as the count ry parks is limited and there is some evidence that 
Chandler ’s Ford and Hiltingbur y lack open space and spo rts facilities. V elmore has a significant  
green corridor running east to west on either side of Falkland Road and directly parallel to the 
north of Cambridge Drive and Nurser y Gardens. This connects through to Fleming Park which 
provides a significant  resource for the Velmore area.  
 
6.3.3  The Borough Council has defined a number of Character Areas within Chandler ’s Ford and 
Hiltingbu ry with a view to prese rving and encouraging enhancement of their special qualities.  
There are no conse rvation areas and only three listed buildings within the area.  
 
6.3.4  The Chandler ’s Ford Industrial Estate west of Bour nemouth Road is one of the largest in the 
Borough, while the Hampshire Corporate Park and the major new offices  off Chestnut 
Avenue (west of the M3) are some of the most moder n. Drapers T ools currently has its 
headquar ters on Hursley Road but has recently been granted planning pe rmission to 
redevelop its site for residential development and a care home. Drapers Tools will relocate to 
their site at No rth Baddesley . 
 6.3.5  There is a district centre of some size at Chandler ’s Ford centred on the F ryern Arcade, with 
other shopping areas in close proximity such as Central Precinct. Some of these are in need 
of refurbishment or redevelopment, in pa rticular the Fr yern Arcade and Central Precinct.  
Frontages to Bour nemouth Road and Hursley Road could also benefit  from environmental 
improvements. The parade at Falkland Road is generally well used and occupied. On the souther n edge of the parish is an Asda supe rmarket which attracts a significant  number of 
shoppers and provides competition for the smaller retail businesses within the parish and beyond.  
 
6.3.6  The parish’ s easter n boundar y adjoins the M3. The M3 is designated as an air quality 
management area along the entire length that adjoins the parish bounda ry, reflecting the 
potential health impacts that the moto rway can have on residents who live in close proximit y. 
 
6.3.7  Roads within the parish are well used as through -routes, pa rticularly the links to junctions 12 
and 13 of the M3 and junction 5 of the M27. There are conce rns about the impact of 
development in T est Valley Borough  and the implications this could have for traffic  movements, 
 
64 Small  Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council    
159 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  particularly through Hiltingbu ry. There is a local railway station in Chandler ’s Ford, 
successfully re -opened in recent years.  There are frequent high quality bus se rvices to 
Winchester and Southampton, but links to Eastleigh T own Centre have proven more difficult  to 
maintain, especially from the Hiltingbur y area.  
 
6.3.8  Parts of Chandler ’s Ford contain some of the more expensive dwellings in the Borough , 
particularly at Hiltingbu ry, and there is a lack of affordable housing within the area.  The 
population of these parishes is ageing and there is a higher propo rtion of older people than in 
the rest of the Borough . Howeve r, there remains a reasonable propo rtion of younger people, 
and an associated need for facilities to meet their needs –  there is some evidence of 
behavioural issues that could be addressed by provision of diversionar y activities.  
 
6.3.9  Elsewhere within the parish, there has been significant  regeneration within the Velmore estate 
(an area with evidence of deprivation) where existing housing stock has been redeveloped 
and refurbished, along with the provision of enhanced community facilities.  
 
6.3.10  The parish is well -supplied with schools and Tho rnden and T oynbee Schools are amongst the 
most popular in the Borough.  
 
6.3.11  Chandler ’s Ford and Hiltingbur y’s 20- 20 Vision sets out health priorities for the area.  These 
include issues relating to young people including alcohol abuse, family and peer pressure, 
poor diet, lack of exercise and the need for diversionar y activities.  The Vision also refers to 
air pollution, public transpor t, promoting healthy activities in and around schools, and 
deterring the use of cars par ticularly for the school run.  It also includes proposals for suppo rt 
for older people such as the Good Neighbours Scheme.  
 6.3.12  There may also be a need for additional cemeter y provision, although there is capacity to 
serve this area in the cemeter y at Brookwood in Eastleigh.  
 
 
Development proposals and special policies  
 
6.3.13  The following policies apply in Chandler ’s Ford:  
 
CF1  Land at Common Road Industrial Estate , Chandler’s Ford  
CF2     Land to the rear of 75 -99 Hiltingbury Road 
CF3 Central Precinct, Chandler’s Ford  
CF4 Land at Steele Close, Chandler’s Ford  
 
 
Housing  
 
Land at Common Road Industrial Estate , Chandlers Ford  
Policy CF 1, Land at Common Road Industrial Estate, Chandler’s Ford  
 
1. An area of approximately 0.8 hectares of land at Common Road Industrial Estate, 
Chandler’s Ford, as defined on the policies map is allocated for 30 dwellings. Planning 
permission will be granted provided that the detailed proposals comply with the 
development plan and they address the following specific requirements:  
a.    development should take account of the topography and identified flood risk 
within the site in terms of the layout of dwellings, open space and access roads;  
b.    the main vehicular access to be provided from Hursley Road with additional 
access (if required to achieve an acceptable layout) from Common Road;    
160 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  c.    a connection to the sewerage system shall be provided at the nearest point of 
adequate capacity as advised by Southern Water, and access to the existing 
sewerage infrastructure shall be secured for future maintenance and upsizing 
purposes;   
d.    the opening up of the culverted watercourse crossing the site ; 
e.    to preser ve water quality and flows details of Sustainable Urban Drainage shall 
be provided in accordance with policy DM6 as part of any application for outline 
or full planning permission; and  
f.      o ccupation of the development shall be phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service 
provider.   
 
 
 
6.3.14  An area of approximately 0.8 hectares of land at the Common Road Industrial Estate 
accommodates a variety of employment uses, some associated with the Draper Tools factory 
opposite. The site does not perform particularly well as an employment site due to its uncomfortable proximity to residential properties, its lack of prominence on road frontages to attract passing trade, and the limited potential for expanding or re -designing the site arising from 
its close relationship to surrounding development. Vehicular access to parts of the site is also less than ideal.  
 
6.3.15  The main Draper Tools sit e has planning permission for redevelopment for residential and care 
home uses. Once the Draper Tools factory relocates, the redevelopment of this site for 
residential purposes would provide a useful contribution towards the housing needs of the 
community and would provide a more acceptable level of amenity for neighbouring occupiers. 
  
161 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  The site is partly in flood zone 3 and as such the development proposals would need to address 
this constraint to the satisfaction of the Environment Agency.  
6.3.16  The updated  Habitats Regulations Assessment of this plan has determined that this site is 
capable of being delivered without adverse effect on any European site. To ensure this, a site 
level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate how this si te will be 
delivered without adverse effect on any European site, with particular reference to the River 
Itchen SAC, the Solent Maritime SAC and the Solent and Southampton Water SPA and Ramsar 
site and impacts on water quality, impacts on otters and the introduction of invasive non- native 
species.  
Land to the rear of 75 -99 Hiltingbury Road  
Policy CF2, Land to the rear of 75 -99 Hiltingbury Road 
 
1. An area of approximately 0.5ha to the rear of the parade of shops on Hiltingbury Road 
as defined on the policies map is allocated for residential development of approximately 16 dwellings. Planning permission will be granted provided that the 
detailed proposals comply with the development plan and they address the following 
specific requirements:  
a. vehicular access is provided from Hiltingbury Road;  
b. retention of trees protected by tree preservation orders and other important 
mature trees;  
c. development should not exceed two- storeys in height;  
d. access to existing garages serving Nichol Court and service/delivery access to 
the rear of the shops must be maintained;  
e. the opportunity should be taken to relocate the existing telecom mast where 
practical and viable;  
f.    to preserve water quality and flows details of Sustainable Urban Drainage shall 
be provided in accordance with policy DM6 as part of any application for outline 
or full planning permission; and  
g.   occupation of the development shall be phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service provider  
   
162 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.3.17  An area of approximately 0.5ha to the rear of the shopping parade and no’s 75- 99 Hiltingbury 
Road comprises vacant land, garages, a disused builders yard and a disused youth club 
building. The under -used site is well located within the built up area of Hiltingbury close to 
existing facilities and amenities.  The former youth club building is owned by the Borough 
Council.  
 
6.3.18  The buildings are approaching the end of their natural life and redevelopment for residential 
development would improve the appearance of the site and provide an opportunity for new 
residential development in a sustainable location.  
 
6.3.19  If practical and viable the opportunity of removing the existing mobile phone mast in the western 
part of the site should be considered as part of any redevelopment.  
 
Central Precinct , Chandler’s Ford  
 
Policy CF3, Central Precinct, Chandle r’s Ford  
 
1. An area of approximately 1.2 hectares of land at Central Precinct, Chandler ’s Ford, 
as defined on the policies map  is allocated for redevelopment to accommodate 
approximately 85 dwel lings and Class E uses, drinking establishments, hot food 
takeaways, leisure/cultural and community uses subject to the following 
conditions:  
 
  
163 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  a.  ground floor town centre uses shall be retained on the frontage of the site 
onto Bour nemouth Road ; 
b.   the policy requirements and criteria in policy DM22 are applied where 
appropriate;  
c.  the existing social club and snooker club shall be relocated within the site, or 
to an alter native o ff-site location of equivalent or better quality and siz e; 
d.  the existing bus-stop facility adjacent  to the site shall be retained;  
e.    occupation of the development is phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service 
provider , and layout is planned to ensure future access to the existing 
wastewater infrastructure for future maintenance and upsizing purposes; 
and 
f.   a site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate 
how this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site.  
 
 
 6.3.20  An area of approximately 1.2 hectares at the Central Precinct, Chandler ’s Ford currently 
accommodates a mixture of retail, residential and community uses. The buildings are of poor 
quality and some age and considered to be suitable for replacement.  The site provides an 
oppor tunity for a more intensive and attractive development to be achieved.  
 6.3.21  Any redevelopment should ensure that the main road frontage at ground floor level is retained 
for retail use with the remainder of the site in residential uses. The need to ensure continued 
access and unhindered operation of the commercial business to the immediate south -east of 
the site is recognised.   
 
6.3.22  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site. Par ticular reference 
should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with 
  
164 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  regards to the River Itchen SAC, Solent Maritime SAC, Solent and Southampton Water S PA 
and Ramsar site and the avoidance and mitigation measures identified. These include:  
 
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to risk introducing invasive non- native species  
 
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
 
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of wat ercourses 
to preserve the otter movement network.

Land at Steele Close, Chandler ’s Ford  
 
Policy CF 4, Land at Steele Close, Chandler ’s Ford  
 
1. An area of approximately 1.0 hectare of land at Steele Close, Chandler ’s Ford, as 
defined on the policies map is allocated for approximately 4,000 sq.m of B2, B8, 
E(g)(ii)/(iii) , car showroom or other similar sui generis uses subject to the following 
conditions:  
 
a. it is demonstrated that the site is no longer required by Hampshire Fire & Rescue Service;  
b. proposals are suppo rted by a flood risk assessment and flood mitigation 
proposals;  
c. the proposals do not include noise- sensitive uses;  
d.    there is no significant  impact on the amenities of surrounding occupiers;  
e. it can be demonstrated that development would not have a detrimental impact 
on the air quality at the junction of Leigh Road and the no rthbound slip road at 
junction 13 of the M3  and;  
f. in accordance with the sequential approach, major office  development  (use 
class E(g)(i) ) (greater than 1,000 sq.m gross) will only be supported if there are 
no suitable, available or viable alternative sites available in either Eastleigh town centre, the wider Eastleigh urban renaissance quarter, at Eastleigh R iver 
Side, (Southampton Airport) or in district and local centres.  
 
   
165 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.3.23 An area of 1.0  hectare of land at Steele Close, Chandler ’s Ford is presently used as an 
operational fire station  but has been declared surplus to requirem ents by the Hampshire Fire 
& Rescue Service.  A significant  area of the south -weste rn part of the site is identified by the 
Environment Agency as being within a functional floodplain (flood zone 3b). Monks Brook runs 
up the western boundary of the site. However, the site has benefitted from recent flood 
defence works.  The site is immediately adjacent to junction 13 of the M3 which generat es 
significant  noise and air quali ty issues. In view of these constraints, the Council considers that 
if the site were to come for ward for red evelopment, it should be re- used for commercial 
purposes rather than residential development.  
 
6.3.24  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site. Par ticular reference 
should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with 
regards to the River Itchen SAC, Solent Maritime SAC, Solent and Southampton Water S PA 
and Ramsar site and the avoidance and mitigation measures identified. These include:  
 
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to risk introducing invasive non- native species  
 
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
 
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of watercourses to 
preserve the otter movement network.    
 6.3.25  A definition of ‘noise- sensitive’ uses is provided in the glossary.  
 
 
  
166 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Transpo rt improvements  
 
6.3.26  The impact of existing traffic  movements through the parish has been identified as an issue, 
and a number of transpo rt improvements are proposed to remedy these. These are set out in 
the Eastleigh Borough T ranspor t Strategy and will be included in the Coun cil’s Infrastructure 
Delive ry Plan.  
 6.3.27  The Council’s Local Plan development proposals are not however forecast to have significant 
impacts (above existing  levels of traffic/delays) in the Chandler’s Ford area . 
 
6.3.28  The South of Chestnut Avenue development site will deliver some highway impro vements in 
the Chandler’s Ford parish, most notably widening and an additional lane on the Chestnut 
Avenue westbound arms of the Chestnut Avenue/Tollgate roundabout, and at the Asda 
roundabout.    
 
 
Open space and recreation  
 
6.3.29  The Council’s study of open space and recreation provision in the Borough  (Eastleigh 
Borough Open Space Needs Assessment 2017 ) has identified a need for amenity open 
space and allotments in the Chandler’s Ford local area.  Policy DM34 , Chapter 5 sets out the 
policy for open space.    
167 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.4 Eastleigh 
Context and key issues  
 
6.4.1  Eastleigh town includes the urban area of Eastleigh as far west as the M3, including the 
town centre, the older employment area to the east of the mainline railway (Eastleigh River Side), Southampton Airport and Boyatt Wood to the north of the Eastleigh- Romsey 
railway line.  Its population in 2011 was 24,011 and there were 10,125 dwellings (2011 
Census). In 2015 the population was 25,014
65. This area is the only part of the Borough  
not to have a town or parish Council . 
 
6.4.2  As Eastleigh is the Borough ’s main town, it is unsurprising that it is substantially developed. 
However, the area includes some green areas in particular at Fleming Park, and, south of the 
town at the Lakeside Country Park. These areas, along with the univ ersity playing fields to the 
south of the town, help to maintain the separation between Eastleigh and Southampton, which 
lies a short distance to the south of the M27.  
 
6.4.3  Although geographically close to the Itchen river valley, links between the town and the 
valley are poor, with the main London- Bournemouth railway, the industrial area to the east 
(Eastleigh River Side) and Southampton Airport intervening. The Itchen valley forms the settlement gap that separates Eastleigh from Bishopstoke.  
 
6.4.4  In the town cent re the Leigh Road Recreation Ground provides a vital green space. There are 
no conservation areas in Eastleigh, and only 7 listed buildings. The town was historically a railway town focused on the former railway works to the east of the centre (Eastleigh R iver 
Side), and this has shaped its character, with a grid pattern of streets and older buildings predominantly from the Victorian and Edwardian eras. The town has a strong railway heritage, and also a considerable aviation heritage given the proximity of the airport and the history of 
aircraft developed in this area.  
 
6.4.5  The town has an extensive range of indoor and outdoor sport and recreation facilities at 
Fleming Park to the west of the town centre.  A new leisure centre has recently opened and 
includes a full-size indoor swimming pool and improved facilities compared to the current 
leisure centre. It is set in parkland with bowling greens, floodlit all weather pitches and play 
facilities, and an extensive area of informal open space that was formerly a golf course. It 
serves the whole Borough and areas beyond.  
 
6.4.6  South of the town, there are further playing fields at Wide Lane, where a partnership 
arrangement between Eastleigh Borough Council, Southampton University and the Football Federation has enabled the construction of a new sports pavilion and greatly enhanced the 
provision of sports pitches on both grass and artificial surfaces.  To the west at Stoneham 
Lane and around junction 5 of the M27 there are further privately -owned sports pitches. 
Also south of the town and west of Wide Lane is the Lakeside Country Park with pleasant 
walks, fishing, canoeing and sailing facilities, and a popular miniature steam railway.  
 
6.4.7  To the east of the town, ‘The Hub’ on Bishopstoke Road is a sports pavilion within an area 
of sports pitches which offers a range of sports activities including a thriving Rugby Club.  
 
6.4.8  Eastleigh provides significant employment areas at the industrial estates at Boyatt Wood and 
at Eastleigh River Side.  It also provides the main shopping centre for the Borough.  
 
65 Small  Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council    
168 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
6.4.9  The town centre has a dual focus, with the majority of the newer shops  in the Swan Centre to 
the south, and a major supermarket along with the recreation ground, cultural facilities and 
offices to the north off Leigh Road, linked by two main streets (High Street and Market Street).  
Studies have been undertaken on the town c entre retail offer and how to regenerate the centre 
as set out in the Eastleigh Town Centre Strategy , however there is a challenge due to the 
number of separate ownerships.  
 
6.4.10  The Eastleigh River Side area to the east is a source of employment close to the town centre 
but includes ageing industrial buildings such as the former railways works and other 
infrastructure. Combined with extensive railway sidings these create a poor environment on 
the eastern side of the town. It is in need of extensive regeneration, but also includes or adjoins several greenfield development opportunities that could come forward if new or 
improved access arrangements were provided.  
 
6.4.11  The town has strong road, rail, bus and air transport links. The A335 Leigh 
Road/Southampton Road/Wi de Lane links the town centre to both the M3 and M27 
motorways and Southampton.  There are two railway stations, one serving the town centre, 
and another at the airport (Southampton Airport Parkway). In the northern part of the town 
there is a bus station adjoining the supermarket.  However, road traffic through the town is 
very heavy and includes many heavy goods vehicles.  This gives rise to air quality issues 
and the main road links to the motorways (Leigh Road and Southampton Road) are in an air 
quality  management area.  
 
6.4.12  Southampton Airport is seen as one of the three major ‘gateways’ into South Hampshire (the 
other two being the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth).  It provides links to destinations 
within the UK, the Channel Islands and Europe.  It provides considerable economic benefits to the town. It needs better public transport access from the eastern parts of south Hampshire as 
rail travellers from these areas currently have to change trains at Southampton or Eastleigh.  
 
6.4.13  Eastleigh is well- provided with education facilities, some with spare capacity, for example at 
Nightingale School  and Crestwood College .  There are first class further education facilities at 
Eastleigh College and Barton Peveril College providing vocational and non- vocational courses 
for a wide catchment that extends beyond the Borough.  
 
6.4.14  Health facilities in the town include a number of GP practices located in a central GP surgery building.  There is some evidence of deprivation in the Aviary estate, the Pirelli estate,  
Eastleigh town centre, south Eastleigh and at Eastleigh River Side.  
 
6.4.15  Eastleigh provides a variety of leisure and cultural venues including The Point –  an arts 
and dance centre with an auditorium which can seat 300. As well as an arts centre it is a popular focal point for community events and is establishing a reputation as a conference 
centre. The Concorde Club is a nationally recognised centre for jazz.  At the Swan 
Centre, a recently completed leisure complex provides a cinema, bowling and restaurant 
facilities.

Offices.  To the immediate east of the site is a listed building which is currently in use as 
offices. To the west, the former Magistrates Court si te has been redeveloped as a car 
dealership. The site contains some important mature trees to the north and has a prominent 
road frontage to Leigh Road to the north which is also in an air quality management area. The 
site is also affected by the noise of the M3 motorway.  
 
6.4.18  It is considered that this site could accommodate a range of uses, preferably as part of a mixed 
use scheme. The southern part of the site, fronting onto Fleming Park, is considered to be 
suitable for residential uses.  It is however important that the site retains its employment 
potential, and as well as the potential for office uses (to replace existing office floorspace), the site could prove attractive for other commercial and employment uses which t ake advantage of 
the site’s prom inent roadside location as well as educational uses, emergency and health 
services and training and meeting facilities. Planning permission has been granted  for a 
replacement office development.   
 6.4.19 A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site. Particular reference should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with regards to the River Itchen SAC, the Solent Maritime SAC and the Solent and Southampton 
Water SPA and Ramsar site and the avoidance and mitigation measures identified. These 
include:  
 
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to risk introducing invasive non- native species  
 
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
  
171 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of watercourses to 
preserve the otter movement network.   
 
Land at Toynbee Road, Eastleigh 
Policy E 2, Land at Toynbee Road, Eastleigh 
 
1. An area of approximately 1.9 hectares of land at Toynbee Road, Eastleigh as defined 
on the policies map is allocated for residential redevelopment for approximately 64 
dwellings. Planning permission will be granted provided that the detailed proposals 
comply with the Development Plan and they address the following specific 
requirements:  
a.   a replacement footbridge is provi ded over the railway line to the immediate north 
of the site ; 
b.   vehicular access to the site is provided from Toynbee Road;  
c.   development should be laid out and designed to provide a buffer to the railway 
line to the north of the site and a further buffer to the cemetery to the west of the 
site; 
d.    to preserve water quality and flows details of Sustainable Urban Drainage shall 
be provided in accordance with policy DM6 as part of any application for outline 
or full planning permission; and  
e. occupation of the development shall be phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service 
provider.  
 
  
  
172 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.4.20  An area of 1.9 hectares of land at the northern end of Toynbee Road is occupied by a  vacant 
Jewsons store and a number of vehicle rental, repair and storage business premises. Recent 
residential development has been built to the south and east of the site on former employment 
land. Employment activities on this land began when the site was on the edge of town. By 
modern standards these uses are poorly located because whilst some of them generate 
significant vehicle movements , vehicular access is only possible through adjoining residential 
streets and past a primary school. It would be preferable to direct these employment uses to 
more accessible and appropriate locations.  
6.4.21  The site is close to the town centre and to a range of services and facilities. Taking these 
considerations into account, it is considered that the site could be more suitably used for 
housing. The existing footbridge over the railway into Archers Road does not meet current 
standards and is in need of improvement.  
Eastleigh Town Centre  
 
Policy E3, Eastleigh town centre  
 
1. The Borough Council will support the regeneration of Eastleigh town centre as 
defined on the policies  map. This will include:  
 
a. strengthen ing the retail circuit through seeking:  
i. development that strengthens the function of the town centre retail 
anchor to the north of Leigh Road; and  
ii. the redevelopment of the block east of Upper Market Street, where a 
range of town centre uses will be acceptable includi ng retail, financial 
and professional services, public sector services, cafes/restaur ants, 
public houses, hotels, leisure uses, non- residential inst itutions such as 
galleries and exhibition halls on the ground and lower floors, with 
residential uses, including student accommodation, acceptable on 
upper floors.  
 
b. promot ing well designed, high density mixed- use development that delivers  
schemes suitable for modern retailing and other town centre uses . 
 c. within the core, leisure, primary and secondary shopping zones as defined on 
the policies map, a change of use or development  will also need to meet policy 
DM22.  
   
173 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.4.22         Policy E3 sets out the Borough Council’s overall strategy for Eastleigh town centre.  
 6.4.23 The Borough Council wishes to continue the existing initiatives to regenerate the town centre 
as originally set out in its ‘Town Centre Vision’.  Development proposals in the town centre 
should have regard for the ‘Guiding Regeneration Principles –  Together we make Eastleigh’ 
document and any guidance, policy or strategy documents that stem from this through public 
consultation and dialogue with stakeholders.  
 
6.4.24 The policies map  identifies a number of zones which have different characteristics and 
development management policies associated with them. This approach is taken to protect 
the key functions of the town centre whilst also promoting v itality, viability and variety.  
 6.4.25 The active use of upper floors is encouraged in all shopping zones, to contribute to the vitality 
and viability of the town centre.  
 6.4.26 Development proposals in the town centre that are likely to cause significant traffic increases 
have been identified as having the potential to have significant effects on the River Itchen SAC 
through increased emissions and their effects on air quality. Habitats Regulations Assessment 
is therefore required to support pl anning applications for significant development in the town 
centre.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Urban Renaissance  
 
Policy E 4, Urban Renaissance Quarter, Eastleigh  
 
1. Within the urban renaissance quarter as shown on the policies map, the Borough 
Council will encourage well -designed, people- intensive development that raises the 
quality of the main approaches to Eastleigh town centre , subject to the site specific 
policies and criteria set out below. Retail development will not  be permitted  except in 
the leisure and cultural zone on Leigh Road (see part d  below).  
 
a. Residential, office and community areas  
  
Within the areas define d on the policies map, development of predominantly 3 
storeys will be permitted and development higher than 3 storeys will be 
appropriate in certain circumstances where development reflects local 
distinctiveness and would contribute towards a positive relationship with the 
surrounding area . 
 
b. Health and education area 
 
Within the area currently occupied by the health centre and specialised 
education uses north of Romsey Road, as defined on the policies map, 
redevelopm ent will be permitted for health and education uses only unless it can 
be demonstrated that provision is no longer required to meet the nee ds of the 
local community.  
 
c.  Romsey Road frontage  
  
On the Romsey Road frontage as defined on the policies map, redevelopment or 
change of use to accommodate offices, hous ing or a hotel will be permitted 
provided that  exceptional design is delivered.  
 
d. Leisure and cultural zone, Leigh Road  
 
The Borough Council will seek to strengthen t he relationship between the 
Recreation Ground, The Point and the southern side of Leigh Road as defined on 
the policies map, by permitting the redevelopment and change of use of 
premises in this a rea for restaurants, cafes, community uses, cultural uses and 
retailing, provided that:  
i. the design of any new buildings or external alterations is of high quality; and  
ii. the new use is complementary to the cultural or recreational activities 
that are established at The Point or Recreation Ground.  
 
e. All redevelopment proposals must retain the Grade II listed Church of the 
Resurrecti on and provide it with an appropriate setting . 
  
 
   
175 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.4.27 An Urban Renaissance Quarter has been defined adjoining Eastleigh town centre to the north 
and west and including the main approaches to the town from Leigh Road, Romsey Road and 
Twyford Road. The area accommodates a number of uses including higher density housing, 
community facilities, cultural activities, health and office uses. These uses complement and 
support the function of the town centre and provide variety and choice, encouraging linked trips 
in a location accessible by public transport. In addition, taller buildings on the approaches to the 
town centre enhance legibility by indicating that an area of importance is being approached.  
 
6.4.28  Redevelopment within the Urban Renaissance Quarter provides the opportunity to enhance the 
quality and design of the building stock and associated public realm  and build on the success 
of recent redevelopments in the area . Developers will be required to improve areas that can be 
viewed by the public such as boundaries, frontages and facades, and to contribute to identified 
projects that will enable the renaissance of central Eastleigh.  Planning permission for 10 -20 
Romsey Road, allocated in E4 (1)(c) above , was approved subject to S106 (F/16/77785).  
 
6.4.29 Development proposals in the Urban Renaissance Quarter that are likely to cause significant traffic increases and have been identified as having the potential to have significant effects on 
the River Itchen SAC through increased emissions and their effects on air quality. Habitats 
Regulations Assessment is therefore required to support planning applications for signif icant 
development in the Urban Renaissance Quarter.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
176 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Policy E 5, Public realm improvements in and adjoining Eastleigh town centre  
 
1. Contributions will be sought from all town centre developments to provide 
impro vements to public spaces, arrival points and str eet frontages at:  
 
a. Leigh Road Recreation Ground;  
b.   the Leigh Road axis from the Point, through the Precinct to the railway station 
forecourt. Provision should be made for a link to a shared foot/cycle  facility 
between the town centre and Barton Par k in the longer term (see policy E6);  
c.  Upper Market Street (including the bus station);  
d.  Twyford Road, to link the town centre with programmed road corridor 
improvements;  
e.   Bishopstoke Bridge gateway ; 
f.   High Street, Market Street and Wells Place; and  
g.   Leigh Road/Romsey Road junction in proximity to the Point.  
 
2. All highway improvements must be carried out to a standard such that they are 
adoptable by the Highway Authority.  
 
 
6.4.30  An important element of the Town Centre Vision and Town Centre Strategy is that the overall 
environment of  the town centre is improved and made more attractive. The Local Area 
Committee has committed to replace every tree lost through planning control with at least two trees throughout the local area. A number of priority areas for improvement have been 
defined and are set out in the policy above . 
 
 
 
Employment an d transport  
 Eastleigh River Side  
 Policy E 6, Eastleigh River Side
 
 
1. The Borough Council will promote the regeneration of Eastleigh River Side through 
the redevelopment of existing industrial premises and new development off 
Chickenhall Lane as follows, and subject to the development criteria identified 
below:  
 
a. Barton Park/Deacon’s Industrial Estate and adjoining land to the west (Network R ail sidings) and to the east adjoining Chickenhall Lane, as 
defined on the policies map, should be redeveloped with a mixed -use 
scheme including:  
i. a Technology  and Innovation Centre and associated facilities;  
ii.  uses complementary to Eastleigh town centre such as offices (use class 
E(g)(i) ); bulky goods retail; hotel/conference centre, restaurants and other 
leisure uses; some residential development and related community uses 
possibly including student accommodation; and car parking t o serve 
Eastleigh Station and the town centre;  
iii. other employment uses in use classes B2 , B8 or E(g) ; and 
iv. a new access from Bishopstoke Road, or an improved access  
       from Chickenhall Lane;  
b. provided that:  
i. a pedestrian/cycle link is provided across the railway between the site 
and Eastleigh Station and the town centre, and linked to a green route 
across the site to the Itchen valley; and  
ii. Barton Road is retained in residential use.    
177 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  c.    provision should be made for the retention or relocation to an appropriate site 
within the wider policy area, or elsewhere in the Borough, of the existing bus 
depot facility.  
  
2. Development will be subject to the approval by the Borough Council of a development 
brief including a masterplan which addresses the foregoing requirements and the 
development criteria below.  
 
a. Tower Lane area, as defined on the policies map, should be redeveloped for 
business and industrial uses including B2 (general industrial) , B8 (storage and 
distribution)  and E(g)(ii)/(iii) (research and development/industrial process) uses . 
b. land south of the sewage works as defined on the policies map should be 
developed for B2 and/or B8 uses, including waste management uses such as:  
i. Sorting and recycling of waste materials including rail aggregates;  
ii. Generation of renewable energy from waste materials (other than by 
incinerati on), e.g.  by anaerobic digestion.  The possibility of a combined 
heat and power plant serving other parts of Eastleigh River Side should 
be explored . 
c. an area of approximately 19.0 ha at the railway works, as defined on the 
policies map, should be developed or redeveloped for business and/or 
industrial uses in use classes B2 , B8 and E(g) (ii)/(iii)  (approximately 19,900 
sq.m net additional floorspace), provided that it can be demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Borough Council that the land is not required, either now or in the longer term, for rail -related uses.  Access to the site could be provided 
from Southampton Road via an improved Campbell Road bridge and a road link into the site.  Improvements to the Campbell Road bridge should include 
pedestrian facilities.  
 
3. Development Criteria:  
 
a. Mixed -use schemes should include high quality employm ent opportunities 
sufficient to replace and where possible enhance any employment lost through redevelopment;  
 
b. The aggregates depots (crushed rock and rail ballast) shall be retained on the 
site in a  location where they can continue to be served by rail;  
 c. A route shall be reserved clear of development to enable the provision of a new link road (the Chickenhall Lane link road) in the longer term between 
Bishopstoke Road and Wide Lane, broadly as indicated on the policies map although the precise route will need to be determined as the site is developed.  
Where there is a reasonabl e prospect of a full link road being viable and  
deliverable, development proposals should make a contribution towar ds the ful l 
link road proportionate to the traffic impact of that proposal and of any 
contributions/funding the applicant had already made to the road. Parts of this 
road should be constructed as part of the new access arrangements. In the 
meantime vehicular access to the various parts of the site shall be provided to 
the satisfaction of the Highway Authority, and contributions shall be made to the planned improvements to junction 5 of the M27, and improvements to other 
parts of the local road networ k including the Twyford Road roundabout in 
Eastleigh town centre, the junction of Chickenhall Lane and Bishopstoke Road and other junctions on Bishopstoke Road (see policy E8 below);  
 d. All new development should be of the highest quality, providing clear 
environmental benefits including enhancement of the eastern and southern approaches to Eastleigh town centre, and according with the design and 
sustainability principles set out in this Local Plan;    
178 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
e. Development shall take advantage of existing high quality public transport links 
and the proximity to the airport;  
 
f. There shall be no adverse impact on the sensitive nature conservation 
interests of the Itchen valley and development on any part of the site should 
not cause or increase adverse impacts on t he River Itchen Site of Special 
Scientific Interest or Special Area of Conservation;  
 
g. The residential amenities of the occupiers of dwellings in Barton Road, Campbell Road and Southampton Road must not be adversely affected by 
activities in adjoining industrial areas, including through noise, light, air 
pollution, traffic generation or hours of working;  
 
h. The airport building height limits are respected, and development within the 
airport’s Public Safety Zone, as shown on the policies map, is limited in 
accordance with the provisions of DfT Circular 01/2010 and any proposals  for 
high density development adjacent to the PSZ does not significantly increase the net risks across the overall site;  
 i. Any pollution, including contaminated land, shall be mitigated or remediated in 
accordance with policy DM8, Chapter 5; and  
 j. In order to safeguard the continued operation of the Chickenhall Wastewater 
Treatment Works, no development sensitive to odours shall be located within 
the odour zone surrounding the works (to be determined by odour modelling in 
consultation with Southern Water).  
 
4. A site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate how this 
site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site.  
 
   
179 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.4.31 Strategic policy S4, Chapter  4 identifies Eastleigh River Side as an area for regeneration.  It 
is also identified for this purpose by the South Hampshire Strategy (October 2012), and was 
mentioned in similar terms in the former South East Plan.  The area also covers parts of the 
Southampton Airport Economic Gateway (SAEG).  
 
6.4.32 Development of Eastleigh River Side is currently constrained by the proximity of the airport and 
related limitations on development (including a Public Safety Zone), by limited vehicular access, 
and by extensive rail infrastructure –  also by the waste water treatment works, and the 
sensitivity of the Itchen valley to the east. However, there are also opportunities –  with improved 
links to the town centre the site has potential to include a wider range of uses, whilst the valley 
provides an attractive setting for development and opportunities for green links through the site. 
There is also significant potential for enhancing the use of public transport.  
 6.4.33 The area cov ers a number of industrial sites and railway sidings east of Eastleigh railway 
station, and bordering the sensitive Itchen valley to the east and Southampton Airport to the south.  It includes the historic former railway works which sits within a rail ‘loop’ that provides an 
essential turning facility for trains. Network Rail is reviewing its landholdings adjacent to the 
railway at Eastleigh. While they anticipate that most sites will still be required for operational 
reasons, the Council will work in partnership with them on a land strategy to consider any 
options to release sites for development. Within the eastern boundary of the area there is the 
Chickenhall Lane Waste Water Treatment Works. It also includes the residential street 
Campbell Road that was originally occupied by  railway workers –  the houses in Campbell Road 
are valued for their local heritage interest. It is bordered to the west by the main London-
Weymouth railway line, which divides it from the town centre, and it is bisected by the 
Eastleigh- Fareham railway line.  
 
6.4.34 As it is now defined, the Eastleigh River Side area comprises the existing developed areas 
between Bishopstoke Road and Southampton Airport (all of which are occupied by 
  
180 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  business enterprises or local households) and approximately 5.7ha of greenf ield land at the 
southern end of Chickenhall  Lane. A further 29ha of currently inaccessible greenfield land 
lies to the south of the Fareham railway line, to be developed for employment uses over the 
Local Plan period, if access can be provided. The Eastleigh River Side area and its 
neighbouring development opportunities can be divided into a number of different parts ( to 
be shown on the policies map ), each of which has different characteristics.  
 
6.4.35  The new greenfield site allocated for employment development under Policy E6(2)(c) is one 
of a handful of strategic employment sites of sub- regional importance at Eastleigh River 
Side which form a key element of the Borough’s and sub- region’s future employ ment 
supply. As such it is considered important to retain this site (and those allocated under 
Policy E7 and E9(2)) for the employment uses specified in the policy. For this reason, 
planning permissions on these sites may be conditioned to restrict development to these 
specified uses in order to ensure these sites can continue to perform this strategically 
important economic role.  
 
6.4.36  Eastleigh River Side currently gains access from:  
 
• Bishopstoke Road via Chickenhall Lane, which extends along the eastern boundary of the site as far as the Fareham railway line. Bishopstoke Road is congested at peak hours, 
and right -turning traffic entering Chickenhall Lane from the west significantly impedes 
traffic flows from Bishopstoke and Fair Oak to the east; and  
• Southampton Road via the Campbell Road bridge, which is narrow and of poor alignment.  
 
6.4.37  These access arrangements mean that much traffic for the site has to pass through or 
close to Eastleigh town centre, with associated problems of congestion and poor air 
quality.  
 
6.4.38  Most of the existing buildings on the site are of some age . The Council  continues to support the 
comprehensive regeneration of the site  and adjoining sites (E7 and E9)  by working with 
partners to deliver a new link road from Bishopstoke Road to Wide Lane, via Chickenhall Lane 
and the airport  (the Chickenhall Lane link road) . This would also help to remove traffic from the 
town centre. Det ailed assessment has suggested that it may not be economically viable to 
constru ct the full road in the short term . However the full regeneration potential of Eastleigh 
River Side will not  be realised without the provision of such a link, and its provision  can be 
realised in stages with different phases of development. The Council therefore remains 
committed to working with partner s to deliver the Chickenhall Lane link road  in phases with the 
first phase being those parts of the CLLR necessary to deliver the employment allocations . 
 
6.4.39 A balance needs to be struck between resolving local transport issues and enabling economic 
growth.  D evelopment can be brought forward on the site during this Local Plan period while 
maintaining the ability to provide the full link road in the longer term . There is considered to be 
scope for enhancing the existing accesses and other parts of the local road network 
sufficiently to support more intensive or additional development that would help to achieve at 
least some regeneration of the site, and would help to contribute towards local and sub -
regional economic growth objectives. It is recognised that this approach will not remove traffic 
from the town centre, but it could help t o bring forward some improvements to local roads and 
junctions which could help to resolve existing problems of peak -hour congestion, in particular 
on Bishopstoke Road.  
 
6.4.40  The full link road is likely to be funded by a mixture of developer contributions and other 
sources (e.g. Government funding). An underlying principle is that each applicant should fund 
their share of the overall developer contributions proportionate to the transport effects of their 
development.  A number of sites currently have no road access. Therefore in some cases an applicant may already have constructed a significant proportion of the link road to access that  
site. If at a later date they propose further development on a remaining phase of their site, the 
contribution they have already made to the construction of the link road will be taken into   
181 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  account to ensure this underlying principle is met.  
 
Development opportunities adjoining Eastleigh River Side  
 
Policy E 7, Development opportunit ies adjoining Eastleigh River Side  
 
1.  The development of approximately 8.5 hectares of land to the east of the railway 
works as defined on the policies map will be permitted f or approximately 34,000 
sq.m of employment uses (in use classes B2,  B8 or E(g)(ii)/(iii) ) subject to the 
following criteria:   
 
a. Vehicular access to the site shall be provided to the satisfaction of the 
Highway Authority;  
b. The design and layout of new development shall not preclude but shall allow 
for the provision of a new Chickenhall Lane link road, with an alignment as indicated on the policies map or as agreed with the Borough Council and the 
Highway Authority;  
c. Where there is a reasonable prospect of a full link road being viable and deliverable, development proposals should make a contribution towards the 
full road link proportionate to the traffic impact of that proposal and of any 
contributions/funding the applicant had already made to the road. Parts of 
this road should be constructed as part of the new site access 
arrangements;  
d. There shall be no adverse impact on the sensitive nature conservation 
interests of the Itchen valley or the landscape setting of the Itchen Valley 
Country Park and the Itchen Way. Development on any part of the site 
should not cause or increase adverse impacts on the River Itchen Site of 
Special Scientific Interest or Special Area of Conservation ; 
e. Land owned by Network Rail within the Itchen Valley Site of Special Scientific Interest shall be transferred to the Borough Council ; and  
f. A site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site.  
 
   
182 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.4.41  Although it is currently inaccessible from the public highway, the greenfield land to the south 
of the railway line (formerly entitled the Northern Business Park) clearly has significant potential to provide additional employment floorspace. The majority of this site adjoins the 
operational area of the airport and is owned by Southampton Airport Ltd, who have plans to 
expand the airport’s operations. The greenfield land immediately east of the railway works is 
owned by Network Rail . 
 6.4.42  The new greenfield site allocated for employment development under Policy E7 is one of a 
handful of strategic employment sites of sub -regional importance at Eastleigh River Side 
which form a key element of the Borough’s and sub- region’s future employment supply. A s 
such it is considered important to retain this site (and those allocated under Policy E6(2)c and 
E9(2)) for the employment uses specified in the policy. For this reason, planning permissions 
on these sites will be conditioned to restrict development to t hese specified uses in order to 
ensure these sites can continue to perform this strategically important economic role.  
 
6.4.43  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered withou t adverse effect on any European site. Particular reference 
should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with 
regards to the River Itchen SAC, the Solent Maritime SAC and the Solent and Southampton 
Water SPA and Ra msar site and the avoidance and mitigation measures identified. These 
include:  
 
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to risk introducing invasive non- native species  
 
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
 
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of watercourses 
  
183 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  to preserve the otter mov ement network.   
 
 
Junction improvements, Eastleigh 
 
Policy E 8, Junction improvements, Eastleigh  
 
1. The Borough Council will support the Highway Authority in developing and 
delivering capacity improvements as required at:  
 
a. Twyford Road/Romsey Road roundabout in order to enhance traffic conditions whilst enabling development and regeneration to take pl ace in the 
Town Centre and its immediate periphery. Improvements to conditions for pedestrians and cyclists across this junction will be integr al to scheme 
design including a pedestrian/cycle bridge adjacent to the Twyford road 
crossing of the Chandler’ s Ford line;  
b. the Chickenhall Lane/Bishopstoke Road junction, including the insta llation of 
traffic signals and widening of the Bishopstoke R oad approaches;  
c. various locations in relation to the South of Chestnut Avenue development site 
(several schemes committed);  
d. at other locations if a requirement is identified in the Transport Assessment.  
 
6.4.44  In addition to site- specific transport requirements  such as the Chickenhall Lane link road the 
ongoing work to prepare a Transport Assessment has identified a number of junctions in 
Eastleigh where traffic modelling has indicated improvements may be required to assist in 
mitigating existing and anticipated future traffic congestion.  
 
6.4.45  The Council’s current traffic modelling work on “do something”  and “do more”  scenarios is 
focused on seeking to maximise the benefits of the Chickenhall Lane link road proposal, with 
the aim of reducing the required scope or removing the need for some of the s chemes listed 
below. The Transport Assessment indicates that whilst the new Local Plan development with a 
link road and “do more” junction improvements avoids severe delays, there will still be 
significant delays in the corridor below.  In any case this is  an existing “pinch point” and delays 
are likely to increase as a result of development already permitted.  The Council will continue to 
work with the highway authority to deliver improvement schemes in this area to improve this 
situation and support the economy of central Eastleigh.  
 Twyford Road/ Romsey Road/ Bishopstoke Road/Station Hill roundabout  
 
6.4.46  The roundabout in Eastleigh town centre at the junction of Twyford Road, Romsey Road, 
Bishopstoke Road and Station Hill acts as a point of convergence for traffic accessing or 
crossing the town centre, and is currently operating over -capacity at peak times.  There is a 
significant issue of peak hour congestion in the area. Contributions hav e been received for 
improvements to this roundabout.  
 
6.4.47  As development in the town centre and the wider area progresses it will be important to continue to secure improvements to this roundabout to increase its capacity and improve traffic 
flows. This issue is recognised in the TfSH Transport Delivery Plan as part of a wider issue 
involving the Bishopstoke Road corridor. Improvements to this roundabout will be 
supplemented by a strategy to enhance traffic conditions along the Bishopstoke Road corridor, 
particularly at key junctions, to ease peak -hour traffic congestion.  
 6.4.48  The need for, and scope of, a Bishopstoke Road corridor strategy will be identified in the

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Chickenhall Lane/Bishopstoke Road  
 
6.4.49 This scheme could also form part of a Bishopstoke Road corridor scheme.  The existing mini -
roundabout at the junction of Chickenhall Lane and Bishopstoke Road facilitates right -turning 
traffic into and out of Chickenhall Lane which causes long queues on Bi shopstoke Road 
during peak hours. The re is potential  to signalise the junction, and also to widen the 
Bishopstoke Road approaches to it.  This w ould require widening of the existing bridge to the 
east of the junction as well as some works to the west of the junction.  
 
 
South of Chestnut Avenue development site  
 
6.4.50  The committed development at the South of Chestnut Avenue site will deliver a number of 
junction improvement schemes in the south of Eastleigh town area.  These are:  
 
i. Southampton Road/Chestnut Avenue:  Provision of a new right turn lane on 
Southampton Road  
ii. Derby Road/Passfield Avenue: Widening and additional lane on Passfield Avenue 
approach  
iii. Chestnut Avenue/Passfield Avenue: Widening on all arms and conversion from 
mini- roundabout to a standard roundabout  
iv. Chestnut Avenue/Stoneham Lane: Widening and additional lane on Chestnut 
Avenue (eastbound) and Stoneham Way approaches  
v. Stoneham Lane/Stoneham Way: Conver sion of current restricted moves junction 
to a four arm roundabout and changes to the road network in this area  
vi. Chestnut Avenue/Nightingale Avenue: Conversion to a signalised staggered 
crossroads  
 
6.4.51  No significant traffic impacts, above impacts from committed developments, were forecast at 
this location in the “do minimum” modelling of the Council’s preferred Local Plan Strategy.  
 6.4.52  Other junction improvements may be required as part of development proposals. Details of 
these highway improvements will b e included in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. The Borough 
Council will work with the highways authority to secure funding for  proposal s from developers’ 
contributions, including s.106 and community infrastructure levy funding, along with other 
sources of funding if necessary, in accordance with the principles set out in strategic policy S 12.   
 Southampton Airport  
 
Policy E 9, Southampton Airport
 
 
1. The Borough Council will continue to work with the operators of Southampton Airport 
to promote its viability, and will support the expansion of the airport’s operations and 
related development provided that the proposals:  
 
a.  are necessary for economic growth within the Borough or the improvement of 
airport operational efficiency, and passenger safety and convenience;  
b. would not physically or visually diminish the settlement  gap between 
Eastleigh and Southampton;  
c.  are supported by transport assessments which confirm local network 
capacity and are consistent with the airport operators’ agreed Airport 
Surface Access Strategy; and  
d.  will not unacceptably increase noise and other environmental impacts on the 
Borough’s residents.  
 
2. Approximately 19.5 hectares of land identified to the northeast of the runway as 
defined on the policies map may be developed for airport -related activities and/or   
185 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  approximately 78,000 sq.m of employment uses in use classes B2 , B8 or E(g) , 
subject to the following criteria:  
 
a. any new vehicular access between the site and the public highway shall be 
provided to the satisfaction of the Highway Authority. The design and layout of 
new development shall not preclude but shall make allowances for the 
provision of a new Chickenhall Lane link road, with an alignment as indicated 
on the policies map  or as agreed with the Borough Council and the Highway  
Authority;  
b. where there is a reasonable prospect of a full link road being viable and 
deliverable, development proposals should make a contribution towards the 
full link road proportionate to the traffic impact of that proposal and of any 
contributions /funding the applicant had  already made to the road. Part s of this 
road should be constructed as part of the new site access arrangement s; and 
c. there shall be no adverse impact on the sensitive nature of conservation 
interests of the Itchen valley or the landscape setting of the Itchen Valley 
Country Park and the Itchen Way. Development on any part of the site should 
not cause, or increase adverse impacts on the River Itchen Site of Special 
Scientific Interest or Special Area of Conservation.  
 
3. A site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate how this 
site will be delivered without  adverse effect on any European Site.  
 
 
 
6.4.53  The airport gains access from junction 5 of the M27 and local roads, including local bus routes, 
and from the main line London- Weymouth railway via the station at Southampton Airport 
Parkway .  The current operators, Southampton Airport Ltd, have plans to expand operations at 
the airport in the medium to long term as set out in the Southampton Airport Masterplan 2006. They have powers to undertake airport -related development within the operati onal area of the 
airport without the need for planning permission.  
  
186 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
6.4.54  The issues set out in Chapter 2 refer to the airport’s impacts on the local area in terms of the 
traffic it generates, noise and emissions from aircraft, and restrictions on development arising 
from the operational needs of the airport. These include height restrictions and a Public Safety 
Zone to the north of the airport across Eastleigh River Side and extending into parts of the 
town centre. There are broad consultation zones for t he airport and its radar facility relating to 
the height of structures and developments likely to attract birds.  
 
6.4.55  The following policy continues to provide for the future development of Southampton Airport in 
the light of the above issues and to support the increase in use of regional airports to relieve 
London airports.  
 
6.4.56  The Borough Council will ensure that the airport’s operational constraints are respected, 
including height limits on development in the vicinity of the airport. Development within the Southampton Airport Public Safety Zone (as shown on the policies map ) will be restricted in 
accordance with DfT Circular 01/2010.  
 
6.4.57  The new greenfield site allocated for employment development under Policy E9(2) is one of a 
handful of strategic employment sites of sub -regional importance at Eastleigh River Side which 
form a key element of the Borough’s and sub -region’s future employment supply. As such it is 
considered important to retain this site (and those allocated under Policy E6(2)c and E7) for the employment uses specified in the policy. For this reason, planning permissions on these 
sites may be conditioned to restrict development to these specified uses in order to ensure 
these sites can continue to perform this strategically important economic role.  
 
6.4.58  Southampton Airport is one of three gateways in to south Hampshire (the other two being the 
ports of Southampton and Portsmouth) and has a wide catchment that covers central southern 
England. Whilst it is a major employer in its own right, with 1,200 employees based on site 
across 30 companies, it also acts as a catalyst for growing and rebalancing the economy. It will 
be important to ensure that the airport’s operation is not impeded by development in its vicinity. 
If and when expansion does occur, it should respect local environmental constraints and have 
an acceptable impact on the local area, including through road access, aircraft noise and 
impacts on the adjoining Itchen valley. The Borough Council will continue to work with 
Southampton Airport Ltd on these issues through the Airport Consultative Committee.  
 
 
Heritage  
 
Aviary Estate, Eastleigh 
 Policy E 10, Aviary  Estate, Eastleigh
 
 
1. In order to protect the special character of the Aviary Estate as shown on the policies map, development including extensions will not be permitted unless all the following 
criteria are met:  
 
a. the size, scale, architectural style, materials and detailing of the proposals 
closely reflects the character of the existing development; and  
b. the open spaces identified on the policies map are retained and their 
settings are not adversely affected.  
   
187 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.4.59 This estate of former public housing has a pleasing and distinctive character. The estate is 
typified by housing grouped around open spaces of various sizes. The housing has a number of 
rustic architectural features. While the development is typical of the era in which it was built, the 
Aviary Esta te is a particularly good example which has been largely unspoilt over the years 
either by the development of inappropriate extensions or by the development of key open 
spaces.  
 
 
Allbrook and North Boyatt parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.4.60  Allbrook and North Boyatt parish is the smallest in the Borough . It lies north of Eastleigh 
adjoining the northern edge of the Borough  and Winchester district. In 2011 the population was 
1,755 and there were 758 dwellings (2011 Census). In 2015 the populat ion had fallen to 
1,67666. 
 
6.4.61   The settlement has its origins in the small village of Allbrook that now forms part of the 
northern extremity of the built -up area of Eastleigh. It includes an area of countryside centred 
on the former clay pit (now a lake) that forms a settlement gap betw een an outlying part of the 
settlement at Pitmore Road and rest of the parish at North Boyatt.  
 
6.4.62  The parish has very little employment, being primarily residential. However, it has good access 
from the M3 via junction 12 and Allbrook Way. There are also strong road links to Eastleigh 
town centre via Twyford Road and Woodside Avenue. Public transport comprises bus links to 
Eastleigh and Winchester. There is no local centre.  
 
66 Small Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council  
  
188 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
6.4.63  Despite its close proximity to Eastleigh, Allbrook has quite a strong sense of community and 
local identity. Existing scout halls in Boyatt Lane and Allbrook Hill provide useful community 
facilities.  
 
6.4.64  There is a former infant school in the parish at Rookwood. Although not currently in use as a 
school it is still in the ownership of the Education Authority and although the buildings are in 
need of improvements, it  remains suitable for educational uses.  
 6.4.65  There is currently no parish plan.  
 
 
Development proposals and special policies  
 
6.4.66  The following policies apply in the parish of Allbrook:  
 
AL1 Land east of Allbrook Way   
AL2 Land west of Allbrook Way  
 
  
 
Housing  
 
Land east of Allbrook Way and west of Pitmore Road 
 
Policy AL1, Land e ast of Allbrook Way  
 
1.  Approximately 7.76 hectares of land east of Allbrook Way and west of Pitmore 
Road, as defined on the policies map  is allocated for approximately 95  dwellings, 
public open space and a relief road to resolve the existing traffic constraints on 
Allbrook Hill . Planning permission will be granted provided that detailed 
proposals accord with the development plan and meet the following specific development requirements:  
 
a. vehicular access shall be from Pitmore Road or off the new relief road;  
b. adequate land across the site is safeguarded for a new relief road to address 
the existing traffic constraints on Allbrook Hill; and this road is implemented 
if a transport assessment demonstrates it is necessary for the development ; 
c. the design of the buildings is of a high quality and is sympathetic to the character  of the older parts of Allbrook;  
d. public open space and play space to serve the development shall be 
provided with connections to Lincolns Copse;  
e. the development shall retain the biodiversity interests of the site and 
provide buffers of up to 50m  to the existing watercourse and undeveloped 
buffers to the south of Lincolns Copse and to the protected trees to the east;   
f. to preserve water quality and flows into the Lower Itchen, details of Sustainable Urban Drainage shall be provided in accordance with policy 
DM6 as part of any application for outline or full planning permission;   
g. ensure avoidance or mitigation of direct and indirect adverse  impacts on 
habitats or species protected by legislation or identified as of principal importance within the NERC Act 2006 S41 lists and that there is a net gain in 
biodiversity ;  
h. a site level Habitats Regulations Assessment is required to demonstrate 
how this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site;  
i. provision of pedestrian and cycle links, both within the site and to connect with the surrounding area;  
j. contributions wi ll be required for transport infrastructure;    
189 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  k.  a highway and parking strategy shall be prepared and implemented in 
consultation with the Council and the highway authority designed to reduce 
traffic congestion on Allbrook Hill, enhance the amenities of ex isting 
occupiers and maintain highway safety ; and  
l.  occupation of the development shall be phased to align with the delivery of  
any necessary  wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service 
provider; and the layout is planned to ensure future access to existing wastewater infrastructure for maintenance and upsizing purposes.  
  
 
 
 
 
6.4.67  On the eastern side of Allbrook Way and raised well above the level of the road is an area of 
land currently used for grazing. The land slopes down from north to south and from west to east. Lincolns Copse, an area of ancient woodland and a Site of Importance for  Nature 
Conservation adjoins to the north. There is a belt of mature trees along the eastern boundary which are protected by a Tree Preservation Order. There is also a watercourse in this part of 
the site which runs north to south along the eastern boundar y. Residential properties adjoin 
to the east in Pitmore Road and to the south in Allbrook Hill. Allbrook Hill is a narrow and 
congested road with limited capacity for on -street car parking for existing residents. 
Development of the site should help to impr ove this situation. Development should safeguard 
land for, and where necessary provide a new relief road to address  the existing traffic 
situation on Allbrook Hill .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
190 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Land west of Allbrook Way  
 
Policy AL2, Land west of Allbrook Way  
 
1.  Approximately 4.2 hectares of land west of Allbrook Way and north of Knowle Hill, 
as defined on the policies map is allocated for approximately 45 dwellings. Planning 
permission will be grant ed provided that detailed proposals accord with the 
development p lan and meet the following specific development requirements:  
 
a.  vehicular access shall be from Knowle Hill;  
b. appropriate land is safeguarded if needed for the construction of a new junction 
with Allbrook Way for the relief road which will cross land allocated under Policy 
AL1;  
 
c. appropriate provision is made for the retention of existing public access rights 
across the site and to secure public access to the SINC woodland to the west ; 
d. the provision of contributions to, or delivery of, off -site highway improvements 
considered necessary to serve the development;  
 
e. the development shall avoid or adequately mitigate any direct or indirect adverse 
impacts on habitats or species protected by legislation or identified as of 
principal importance  within the NERC Act 2006 S41 lists and shall deliver a net 
gain in biodiversity;   
 
f. the biodiversity interests of the site shall be retained and appropriate buffers 
provided to protect the SINC, protected trees and other features of environmental significance (note: size of the buffers will depend on the outcome of the 
appropriate species and habitat surveys to be carried out and submitted with any 
planning application for the site);  
 
g. to preserve water quality and flows into the Lower Itchen, details of Sustainable 
Urban Drainage shall be provided in accordance with policy DM6 as part o f any 
application for outline or full planning permission;   
 
h. a site level Habitats Regulations Assessment is required to demonstrate how this 
site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site;   
 
i. the provision of an appropriate landscape scheme;  
 
j. provision of pedestrian and cycle links, both wit hin the site and to connect with 
the surrounding area;  
 k. implementation of appropriate measures to address any land contamination 
associated with former uses of the site;  
 l. implementation of appropriate measures to mitigate any adverse air quality 
and/or noise impacts arising from the proximity of the M3 Motorway to the west 
and/or Allbrook Way to the east;  
 m. thorough exploration of the nature and extent of the underlying m ineral resource 
and of the potential for the extraction of any viable deposits on the part of the 
site affected by minerals safeguarding; and  
 
n. occupation of the development shall be phased to align with the delivery of any 
necessary wastewater network reinforcement, in liaison with the service   
191 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  provider; and the layout is planned t o ensure future access to existing 
wastewater infrastructure for maintenance and upsizing purposes.  
 
6.4.68 On the western side of Allbrook Way and raised well above the level of the road is an area of 
land approximately 4.2ha in area currently used for grazing. It slopes gently from north to 
south and west to east. The area includes a large residential property  south of its centre but 
this property and its curtilage are excluded from the site though the access to the property is 
included. This forms one of two accesses to the site from Knowle Hill.  A public footpath runs 
approximately north south across the wes tern part of the site. A woodland protected by a 
Tree Preservation Order abuts the north -western boundary and mature vegetation extends 
down the western boundary. A substantial tree belt provides a buffer along much of the 
eastern boundary to Allbrook Way (the A335) which connects to junction 12 of the M3 Motorway beyond the site to the north. There is no screening along the southern part of the 
eastern boundary. There are protected trees within the curtilage of the residential property in 
the centre of the  site.  
 
6.4.69 The site contains part of the Allbrook Clay Pits Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC)  (west of the public right of way) which will need to be retained and protected within 
any development by the provision of appropriate buffers. There is the potential for bats to be 
present within the woodland. There is potential for contamination from for mer use of the 
wider area as a brickworks. There is also the potential for noise and air quality issues arising from vehicles using the A335 to the east. The majority of the site is safeguarded in the 
adopted Hampshire Minerals & Waste Local Plan (2013) for sharp sand and gravel.  
 6.4.70  It is considered that the buffers to be provided to protect the Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation, protected trees and other ecology substantially reduce the net developable 
area of the site, possibly down to as little as 1.5ha resulting in the site being allocated for 
approximately 45 dwellings.  
  
192 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.5 Hedge End, West End and Botley  
 
Hedge End Parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.5.1  Hedge End is centrally located within the Borough  with the settlements of  Horton Heath and Fair 
Oak to the nor th and the Hamble peninsula to the south. It adjoins Botley parish to the no rth and 
east, Bursledon parish to the south and West End parish to the west.  
 
6.5.2  The town has seen significant  growth in recent years, including extensive residential 
development that has expanded the town nor th to the Eastleigh-  Fareham railway , and 
substantial residential, commercial and industrial development to the south- west including 
major out -of-town shopping at junction 7 of the M27.  It is now the second largest settlement in 
the Borough , and in 2011 had a population of some 20,790 and 8,488 dwellings (2011 
Census). In 2015 the population was 21, 79167. 
 
6.5.3  The boundaries of Hedge End town closely follow the urban edge of the settlement, and it 
includes ver y little open count ryside.  Land to the nor th of the railway in Botley parish 
contributes to the separation between Hedge End and Ho rton Heath to the nor th, and Boorley 
Green to the east.  To the east, other land in Botley parish provides a narrow settlement gap 
between the urban area of Hedge End and the village of Botley .  [Note – dwellings accessed  off 
King’s Copse A venue fo rm pa rt of the urban area of Hedge End although they lie in Botley 
parish.]  
 
6.5.4  The parish includes a narrow strip of count ryside to the south- west of the M27 which 
comprises the settlement gap between Hedge End and Southampton.  This area is under on -
going development pressures, and the extensive development at junction 7 has also 
diminished this settlement gap significantl y. 
 
6.5.5  Within the parish there are some areas of open space generally in the fo rm of playing fields,  
managed open spaces and green links through residential areas.  Outside the parish to the 
south east is the Manor Far m Count ry Park. There is little heritage interest in the town.  
 
6.5.6  Hedge End contains some of the Borough’ s more extensive industrial and commercial 
developments in the area adjoining junction 7 of the M27, with the out -of-town superstores, 
other major retail stores and industrial estates.  
 
6.5.7  The town has a district centre.  Here, howeve r, the proximity of the out -of-town stores has 
impacted on its vitalit y.  It is also bisected by busy roads.  The Council is keen to enhance and 
regenerate the centre and achieve comprehensive redevelopment of sites in line with the principles set out in policy DM1. The Council may prepare a development brief on this 
regeneration.  
 
6.5.8  Hedge End gains vehicular access primarily from the M27 junctions 7 and 8. The main route to 
Southampton is via the A334 from junction 7.  There are problems of peak hour congestion on 
the M27, at junctions 7 and 8 and on the approach roads to these junctions, including routes through the industrial and commercial area at Hedge End such as T ollbar Way. 
 
6.5.9  There is a railway station at Hedge End located on the nor thernmost boundar y of the 
settlement.  Hedge End is also se rved by a number of bus se rvices to Southampton and 
Eastleigh.  
 
6.5.10  There has been considerable residential development in Hedge End over recent decades, 
 
67 Small Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council    
193 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  including a variety of house types and tenures e.g. Dow d’s Farm. There is an increasing need 
for specialised accommodation for elderly people and for affordable housing.  
 
6.5.11  The main secondar y school in the area is the Wildern School which is operating over capacit y.  
There is understood to be some spare capacity at a few of the primar y schools such as 
Shamblehurst, but others are accommodating more than planned and having to expand where 
possible.  The Wildern School site is a hub site for leisure, arts, dance and theatre including The 
Berry Theatre which is an innovative concept bringing live ente rtainment to this pa rt of the 
Borough.  
 
6.5.12  Medical facilities are provided by two GP surgeries.  
 
6.5.13  Hedge End does not have a parish plan.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
 
 
6.5.15  A site comprising approximately 51.1 ha of land on the western side of Woodhouse Lane is 
currently in agricultural use. The site is bounded to the north east by the Fareham to Eastleigh 
railway line, to the south east by Woodhouse Lane and to the west by the existing built -up 
area. It comprises gently undulating farmland whic h is bisected by a stream within a wooded 
corridor which is a locally -protected site of nature conservation interest (Bottom Copse Bushy 
Copse Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation SINC). A small part of the site lies in an 
area at risk of flooding.   
 
6.5.16  A high voltage overhead power line runs parallel to the northern edge of the site adjacent to 
the railway line which is mostly in a shallow cutting. The site is crossed by underground water 
and gas pipelines and a public footpath linking Woodhous e Lane with the existing housing 
area of north Hedge End.  
 
6.5.17  In accordance with Environment Agency advice, waste water should be treated via the sewer 
system and not by an on -site solution. There are understood to be waste water capacity issues 
in the area, and the connections should be at the nearest point of capac ity. Where possible a 
combined solution with si te BO2 Land north east of Winchester Street, Botley should be found.   
 
6.5.18  Taking the above into account, the development of this site for residential development and a 
secondary school together with a local centre is proposed.

which addresses the following specific requirements: - 
 
a. the provision of a range of housing types, sizes  and tenures;  
 
b. the provision of on- site public open space and play areas, to serve the 
development  providing it is kept outside the natural woodland areas, the 
headwaters and the buffers for Badnum Creek ;  
 
c. to preserve water quality and flows into the headwaters and Badnum Creek 
the foll owing studies and information will be required f or the HRA:  
i.  a thorough hydrological survey of the water flow across the site  
ii. a full exploration of the headwater system taking account of impacts 
from phase 1, chemical and water quality testing, and suggesting any 
remediation that can be provided and how the remaining headwater

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.5.20  This site of approximately 0.6ha lies to the west of Hedge End close to the M27 motorway. It 
is a gently sloping site in agricultural use bounded on its northern, western and south -western 
boundaries by a block of woodland and tree planting which creates a strong boundary. The woodland to the north is protected by a Tree Preservation Order. Beyond this  to the west lies 
the M27 motorway. The eastern boundary is formed  by the curtilage of an industrial building 
which is accessed from St John’s Road. Full planning permission has been granted for 14 
dwellings and a light industrial unit on the land including the industrial unit between this site 
and St John’s Road through which access may need to be secured. The majority of the site is 
safeguarded for sharp sand & gravel in the adopted Hampshire Minerals & Waste Local Plan 
(2013). The site is allocated for a residential development of approximately 16 dwellings.  
 
Housing in adjoining areas  
 6.5.21  Adjoining Hedge End parish to the south there is a residential development proposal in 
Bursledon Parish that will affect Hedge End parish.  This is the development east of Dodwell 
Lane and no rth of Pylands Lane, which includes the Sundays Hill bypass.

Policy HE4, Land off Peewit Hill Close and Dodwell Lane 
 
1. Approximately 2.3 hectares of land o ff Peewit Hill Close and Dodwell Lane, as 
defined on the policies map, is allocated for approximately 9,200 sq.m of 
employment uses in use classes B8 and E (g)(ii)/(iii)  subject to the following 
requirements:  
a. in accordance with the sequential approach, major offi ce development (greater 
  
200 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  than 1,000 sq.m  gross) will only be supported if there are no suitable, available 
or viable alternative sites available in either Eastleigh town centre, the wider 
Eastleigh urban renaissance quarter, at Eastleigh River Side, (Southampton 
Airport) , or in district and loca l centres ; 
b. the development provides the remainder of the new road link between the 
souther n boundar y of the residential allocation to the nor th (policy HE2) and 
Dodwell Lane;  
c. access to the site is from the new road link;  
d.    the use of the site is compatible with neighbouring residential uses and does 
not a ffect their residential amenities by adding to noise or light pollution, air 
pollution, tra ffic or by hours of working;  
e. appropriate landscape screening is provided in the interests of maintaining 
visual amenity ; 
f. the development is built to a high standard of design compatible with its 
location on the southe rn side of Hedge End within proximity to the entry 
point to the settlement; and  
g. a site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate 
how this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European 
site. 
 
 
 
6.5.22  To the south of the land allocated for residential development by policy HE2, there is an area 
of count ryside lying between the proposed new road and the existing urban area which is 
significantly  affected by noise from the motor way and is therefore not suitable for residential 
development.  Howeve r, it offers an oppor tunity for the development of commercial uses less 
sensitive to m otorway noise.  
 
6.5.23  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site. Par ticular reference 
should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with 
  
201 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  regards to the Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation  and t he Solent and Southampton 
Water Special Protection Area and Ramsar site and the avoidance and mitigation measures 
identified. These include:  
 
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to risk introducing invasive non- native species  
 
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
 
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of watercourses 
to preserve the otter movement network.  
 
6.5.24  There is also potential for previously unidentified archaeology of prehistoric and Roman 
date. Any planning application should include an assessment of the potential for previously 
unidentified archaeological sites and the impact of the proposed development upon these 
in accordance with policy DM12 . 
 
Other employment sites, Hedge End 
 
Policy HE5, Land at Netley Firs, Kanes Hill, Hedge End 
 
1. An area of approximately 1.8 hectares of land at Netley Firs, Kanes Hill, Hedge End as 
defined on the policies map is allocated for approximately 7,200 sq.m of employment 
use subject to the following conditions:  
 
a. the site is developed for employment in use classes B2 or E(g)(ii)/(iii) 
compatible  with the existing employment uses on the site, with nearby 
dwellings and the proposed adjoining Travelling Showpeople’ s site; 
b. access shall be from the A27 Kanes Hill via an access shared with the adjoining Travelling Showpeople ’s site; and  
c. existing trees within the site shall be retained and protected as pa rt of a 
landscape scheme for the site.  
 
2. An area of approximately 1.5 hectares of land at Netley Firs, Kanes Hill, Hedge End, 
as defined on the policies map , is suit able for use as a travelling showman ’s yard 
subject to the following conditions : 
 
a. access shall be from the A27 Kanes Hill via an access shar ed with the 
adjoining employment site;  
b. a noise impact assessment should infor m the siting and design of plots to 
minimise noise nuisance from the adjoining moto rway and from activities on 
the site; and  
c. existing trees bordering the site shall be retained and reinforced with 
additional planting as par t of a landscape scheme for the site, to provide 
visual and noise screening.  
   
202 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.5.25  A further small site has been identified in Hedge End parish with the potential for the 
development small -scale employment premises to help meet the needs of local employers and 
those seeking to work locally. There is a small site at Netley Firs, Kanes Hill, where there is 
some existing employment and this site is also suitable for a T ravelling Showpeople’s yard.  
 
6.5.26  There is some potential for previously unidentified  archaeology of prehistoric and Roman date. 
Any planning application should include an assessment of the potential for previously 
unidentified archaeological sites and the impact of the proposed development upon these in 
accordance with policy DM12 . 
 Employment in adjoining areas  
 6.5.27  Adjoining the boundar y of Hedge End off Tollbar Way there is a proposal for a small extension 
to the Ber rywood Business Park (see policy WE3 section 6. 5). 
 
 
Transport  
 
6.5.28  Traffic flows generated by the strategic development at Boorley Green are forecast to generate significant additional demand on routes towards M27 Junction 8 via Woodhouse Lane and 
Maypole Roundabout.  A capacity improvement scheme at Maypole Roundabout is  committed in 
relation to this development.  
 
6.5.29  The traffic modelling of the new Local Plan development indicates the need for a further 
improvement at the Maypole Roundabout as set out in the Transport Assessment.     
 
  
203 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  6.5.30  The Council also has a l ong-standing policy seeking to deliver a new road to the south of Hedge 
End linking the western end of the Sundays Hill bypass with St John’s Road.  An initial part of 
this route will be delivered by committed housing development at St Johns Road and the 
Council will continue to seek completion of this additional route.  
 
 
Other transpo rt improvements  
 
Policy HE6, Hedge End Railway Station, Hedge End  
 
1. The Borough Council will work with the train operators, Network Rail and the Highway Authority to achieve improvements to Hedge End railway station including 
a new accessible footbridge.  
 
 
6.5.31  Strategic policy S 11 also indicates the Borough Council ’s intention to work with the Highway 
Authority to achieve improvements to junction 7 of the M27.  There is now a commitment in place 
from central government to fund upgrades to the traffic signals at this junction to provide better 
coordination and improve throughput.   
 
6.5.32  The centre of Hedge End is dominated by busy roads, and needs transpo rt improvements.  
Proposed transpo rt improvements to local roads, cycleways and footpaths are set out in the 
Eastleigh Borough Local Transpor t Statement and the Council ’s emerging Infrastructure Deliver y 
Plan 
 6.5.33  A need has been identified  for improvements to Hedge End station to cater for increasing use.  
While there is a footbridge connecting both platfor ms, it is  not fully accessible (e.g. to those with 
disabilities) - those with mobility difficulties must use the narrow, unlit Shamblehurst Lane North 
road bridge and indirect connecting paths instead.  
 
6.5.34  Use of Hedge End railway station is increasing and is likely to increase fu rther with new 
development in the area.  Improvements are likely to be needed to inc rease its capacity and the 
level of amenity it provides for rail users.  Funding for such improvements will be sought from a 
variety of sources including the train operating companies, Network Rail and developer 
contributions.  
 
Open space and recreation  
 
6.5.35  The Sports Facility Needs Assessment and Playing  Pitch Strategy  Update  has identified a 
need for community access junior pitches within Hedge End. It is anticipated that the new 
housing allocations will provide some of this land, in par ticular the l and west of Woodhouse 
Lane (policy HE1). In Hedge End there is also a requirement to continue to invest and enhance existing  sports facilities and playing pitches. The Open Space Needs Assessment 
did not identify any outstanding needs across the Plan period.   
 
 
 
West End parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.5.36  The parish of West End lies on the south -weste rn boundar y of the Borough  adjoining 
Southampton.  In te rms of its built fo rm, the settlement has effectively merged with 
Southampton and there is no settlement gap between the two.  
 
6.5.37  The parish is divided by the M27 and extends some way to the no rth of the moto rway, 
bordering Bishopstoke and Fair Oak parishes to the nor th, and Hedge End to the east.  T o   
204 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  the west it includes the Itchen valley and borders Eastleigh.  A small area of the parish 
extends around Thor nhill (in Southampton) and adjoins Hound parish to the south.  
 6.5.38  The settlement of West End has grown in recent decades and in 2011 had a population 
of 11,470 and 5,168 dwellings (2011 Census). By 2015 the population had increased to 
11,836
68. 
 
6.5.39  There is a narrow settlement gap between the built -up areas of West End and Hedge End, 
alongside the M27 moto rway, but this is under threat from development pressures.  There are 
some open spaces within the settlement and its wooded hills and views across the Itchen have 
drawn many people to W est End. However the main area of count ryside in the parish lies no rth 
of the moto rway. This area includes the Itchen V alley Count ry Park, a valued amenity which 
serves a wide area.  
 
6.5.40  The area can claim to be a centre of spo rting excellence as it contains the Ageas Bowl, home 
to Hampshire County Cricket Club, and the Hampshire T ennis and Health Club, with 
associated golf course and hotel facilities.  This is a substantial venue of regional significance.  
As well as major spo rting fixtures it hosts other events such as large conce rts.  It has 
implications for the area because of the amount of traffic  that it attracts for such events.  
Access is from the already busy roads leading from junction 7 of the M27.  On-site parking  is 
limited, necessitating the use of over flow and park and ride car parks in the surrounding area, 
including at Bursledon.  This facility is a major asset for the Borough  and has developed 
further sporting activities and outreach into schools including the Poseidon Boxing Club, Choi 
Kwang Do, Orbit Learning Centre and Hedge End Running Club.  There remains a sho rtage of 
junior pitches in the parish.  
 
6.5.41  Parts of the pa rish are of heritage value and it contains conse rvation areas at Gaters Mill and 
Romill Close.  There are remains of an ancient hill fo rt in T elegraph Woods.  
 
6.5.42   West End parish includes some of the large industrial units adjoining Hedge End, and a scatter 
of employment uses created through re -use of buildings in its rural areas, including Ber rywood 
Farm off Tollbar Way, and along Allington Lane.  At Allington Lane such uses have degraded the 
character of the count ryside.  The parish also includes the Chalcroft Business Park, a for mer 
rail-based naval victualling depot that has poor road access but is now in a variety of 
commercial uses, mainly in uses class B8 storage and distribution, resulting in considerable 
disturbance to local residents from related traffic.  
  
6.5.43  The parish does not have access to a railway station.  However parts of the parish are served by 
regular buses to Southampton and Eastleigh.  
 
6.5.44   West End has a busy local centre which is in need of some regeneration and improvement.  
 
6.5.45  There is a primar y school and some pa rts of the parish are also se rved by schools in 
Southampton and Hedge End.  The parish includes Moorgreen Hospital, par ts of which have 
been recently redeveloped.  It neve rtheless provides specialised health ser vices including 
palliative care and some mental health facilities.  
 
6.5.46  The West End Parish Plan was produced in 2010.

1. Proposals for the alteration, extension, change of use or redevelopment of existing land and buildings within the Chalcroft Business Park (as defined  on the policies 
map) for class B2,  B8 and E(g)(ii)/(iii) uses will be pe rmitted if all of the following 
criteria are  met:  
 
a. in accordance with the sequential approach, major office development (use class 
E(g)(i)) (greater than 1,000 sq.m  gross) will only be supported if there are no 
suitable, available or viable alternative sites available in eit her Eastleigh town 
centre, the wider Eastleigh urban renaissance quarter, at Eastleigh River Side, 
(Southampton Airport) or in district and local centres;  
b. a new road is built as shown on the policies map to se rve the Chalcrof t 
Business Park and the new development west of Hor ton Heath; and  
c. development would not adversely a ffect the adjoining Round Copse or Chalcroft 
Business Park sites of impo rtance for nature conser vation.  
 
2. A site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate how this site 
will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site.    
206 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
 
6.5.48  At present, the Chalcroft Business Park occupies a rural location with poor road connections, 
and the site is largely surrounded by a woodland belt that is designated as a site of 
impo rtance for nature conser vation. Howeve r, the proposed development of land to the west 
of Ho rton Heath and Chalcroft Fa rm presents an oppor tunity both to improve vehicular 
access (see policy WE1) and extend the site (see polic y WE2). Fur thermore, a new 
landscape framework accompanying that development may present an oppor tunity to 
change the relationship between the distribution park and its immediate environs. T ogether 
these oppo rtunities could enable a more intensive  redevelopment of the site.  
 
Land adjoining the Chalcroft Business Park  
 
Policy WE 2, Land adjoining the Chalc roft Business Park  
 
1. A site of approximately 1.6 hectares between the Chalcroft Business Park and 
Burnetts Lane is allocated for approximately 6,400 sq.m of employment 
development in use classes B8 and E(g)(ii)/(iii) provided that:  
 
a. a new road is built  as shown on the policies map to se rve the Chalcroft 
Business Park and the new development west of Ho rton Heath ; 
b. the site is se rved by a shared access with the rest of the Chalcroft Business 
Park;  
c. the use of the site does not adversely a ffect the residential amenities of 
adjoining dwellings within the Chalcroft Business Park, or opposite the site on 
Burnetts Lane;  
d. the development would have no unacceptable adverse impact on the 
adjoining Chalcroft Business Park  Site of Impo rtance for Nature 
Conser vation or existing mature trees within and bordering the site; and 
  
207 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  e.    a substantial landscape screen is provided fronting Bur netts Lane to h elp 
screen the development from the dwellings on the opposite side of the lane.  
 
2. In accordance with the sequential approach, major office  development  (use 
class E(g)(i))  (greater than 1,000 sq.m gross) will only be supported if there are 
no suitable, available or viable alternative sites available in either Eastleigh 
town centre, the wider Eastleigh urban renaissance quarter, at Eastleigh River 
Side, (Southampton Airport) or in district and local centres.  
 3. A site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate how this site 
will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site.  
 
 
 
6.5.49 The site covered by  policy  WE2 is a small area bounded by the Chalcroft Business Park, its 
access road, Bur netts Lane and the railwa y. It would provide a useful extension to the 
business park, but its development for this purpose needs to take account of the proximity of 
dwellings with in the business park and opposite the site on Bu rnetts Lane, and the presence of 
mature trees within and bordering the site.  
 
6.5.50  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site. Par ticular reference 
should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan with 
regards to the Solent and Southampton W ater S PA and Ramsar site and the River Itchen SAC 
and the avoidance and mitigation measures identified. These include:  
 
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to risk introducing invasive non- native species  
 
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
  
208

Land west of Toolbar Way and south of Ber rywood Far m, Hedge End  
 
 
Policy WE 3, Land west of T ollbar Way and south of Ber rywood Business Park, Hedge End  
 
1.  An area of approximately 0.8 hectares of land west of Tollbar Way and south of 
Berrywood Business Park, Hedge End, as defined on the policies map  is allocated 
for approximately 3,200 sq.m of employment development  subject to the fo llowing 
conditions:  
 
a. the site is developed for employment in use classes B2 and E(g)(ii)/(iii) 
compatible with the existing employment uses on the adjoining Ber rywood 
Business Park;  
b. access shall be via the existing access ser ving the larger site on Tollbar Way; 
c. the development is of a high quality compatible with the adjoining buildings on the Ber rywood Business Park; and  
d. the existing hedgerow fronting Tollbar Way is retained and reinforced with 
additional landscape planting.  
 
2.  In accordance with the sequential approach, major office  development  (use class 
E(g)(i)) (greater than 1,000 sq.m gross) will only be supported if there are no suitable, 
available or viable alternative sites available in either Eas tleigh town centre, the wider 
Eastleigh urban renaissance quarter, at Eastleigh River Side,  (Southampton Airport) or 
in district and local centres.  
   
209 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
 
6.5.51  A number of sites have been identified in the Borough that have the potential for small -scale 
employment development to help meet the needs of local employers and those seeking to work locally .  These include an extension to an existing employment site at Ber rywood Far m, west of 
Tollbar Way, Hedge End, which lies in W est End parish.  This employment use came about 
originally  from the conversion of fa rm buildings, and the policy allocates a small  adjoining site 
for new employment development.  
 
6.5.52  Part of the site may be at risk from flooding from an adjoining watercourse and a flood risk 
assessment may be required in accordance with policy DM 5. Any planning application should 
include an assessment of the potential for previously unidentified archaeological sites and the 
impact of the proposed development upon these in accordance with policy DM12 . 
 
Transport  
 
Bubb Lane- Burnetts Lane link road  
 
6.5.53  As part of the West Horton Heath development, there is a commitment by developers to deliver 
a new road linking Burnetts Lane and Bubb Lane, serving the Chalcroft Business Park and new 
development west of Horton Heath (see policies HH1, Chapter 6, section 6.1 and  WE1, Chapter 
6, section 6.5). This road is intended to help reduce local difficulties caused by large vehicles accessing Chalcroft Business Park via narrow and unsuitable rural roads.  
 
6.5.54  The Transport Assessment indicates the new Local Plan development will not generate severe 
delays at  the A27 Mansbridge Rd/Swaythling Road/Allington Lane/Townhill Way junction under 
either “do something” or “do more” scenarios. Significant delays in the “do something” scenario disappear in the “do more” scenario, although this may be more due to the strategic  
improvements modelled at that time diverting more traffic, rather than the modest improvements 
added to this junction.   
  
210 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
6.5.55  The Transport Assessment will provide further detail on any requirement for improvements at 
this junction.   
 
Sport and recreation  
 
The Ageas Bowl and T ennis Centre, Botley Road (recreation)  
 
Policy WE4, Land at Ageas Bowl and Tennis Centre, Botley Road, West End  
 
1. Development will be supported where it facilitates the site’s important role in meeting 
sporting needs in the Borough and wider area;  complements the high quality design 
and open setting of the site; and protect s the settlement  gap.  Taking these aims into 
account, development will be permitted if it meets all of the following criteria:  
 
a. buildings or structures must be appropriate in scale, form and location to the 
predominantly green and open character of the area, taking account of the 
different  characteristics of the site;  and should only be visible from the 
surrounding area in the context of the wider landscape setting;  
b. development achieves a high quality design by paying careful  attention to 
detailing, hard landscaping and planting;  
c.   outside the urban edge  (as defined by the policies map) development is for 
outdoor  sports/ recreational purposes only (including ancillary facilities of 
appropriate location, scale and design to protect the settlement  gap, such as 
a golf clubhouse);  
 d.   inside the urban edge (as defined by the policies map) development is for 
outdoor  or indoor sports/recreation;  leisure ; hotel or office/research use 
provided that:  
i. any development creates  a high quality of design and takes the form 
of distinctive individual buildings each set within an open and high 
quality landscape setting;  the extent of development and the 
boundary treatment of that development (built design and landscape) 
creates a high quality, distinctive, green and open setting to the 
Ageas Bowl;   
ii. in addition to meeting criterion d i., any residential development is 
located solely in the north west corner of the site (as defined on the 
policies map); the development provides an appropriately designed 
access directly to/from the settlement of West End rather than via 
Marshall Drive for pedestrians/cyclists and also, unless demonstrated 
otherwise, for vehicles; and the layout and design of the development 
ensures an appropriate level of residential amenity in respect of the 
cricket  ground and events venue;  
iii. enables the enhancement of sporting facilities on the site;  
iv. does not compromise the function of the Ageas Bowl as an

6.5.56 The Ageas Bowl (fo rmerly the Rose Bowl), the tennis centre and golf course at West End have 
seen significant  development in recent years. The Council is keen to ensure the success of 
these facilities whilst maintaining the generally green, open, landscaped character of the a rea.  
Outside of the urban edge uses will be restricted to outdoor leisure/recreational uses or 
ancillary facilities to protect the settlement  gap and wider landscape setting of the site.  Within 
the urban edge a greater range of development will be suppor ted provided it is of a use and 
form which contributes to the overall concept of a leisure and sporting led venue with high 
quality buildings set within an open and green context.  The use of the present facilities causes 
traffic  congestion on occasions, and enhanced provision for pedestrians, cyclists and public  
transpo rt will be required in conjunction with any additional development.  Residential 
development will  present a range of additional issues which will require careful consideration in 
accordance with the policy. Residential development could only be supported on the part of the 
site identified by the policies map to the south of the Pitters development, so that it does not 
affect the setting of the wider site and connects directly to the existing settlement. (Other uses 
supported by the policy within the urban edge can also be located within this residential area as 
part of a mixed use scheme). The green open space required with any residential development 
  
212 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  can be considered adjacent to and outside of the designated residential area, if it relates to the 
boundary treatment to create the high quality and distinctive setting to the Ageas Bowl. All other 
open space required in accordance with criterion d.(i). will fall within the designated residential 
area. The existing access via Marshall Drive does not provide a direct route to West End and 
forms a separate access to the Ageas Bowl site which has a very different character to existing 
residential areas. A new appropriately designed pedestrian/cycle route providing a more direct 
connection to West End centre and to integrate new with existing residential communities will 
therefore be required. If the Pitters site were to be redeveloped in the future, this is likely to 
create the most direct and appropriate route. For the same reasons, and also because Marshall 
Drive is heavily used on match and events days, it may also be necessary for an alternative  
vehicular route to be created via any future redevelopment o f the Pitters site. The necessity for 
and deliverability of an alternative vehicular route will be considered at the planning application 
stage.  
 
6.5.57  The provision of any residential development on the site will increase the potential for impacts 
on residential amenity. Any residential development should not compromise the existing 
function of the Ageas Bowl.  
 
6.5.58  Policy WE4  allows for reasonable additional development, adaptation and change, whilst 
maintaining outdoor recreational activ ities as the primar y uses of the area, and seeking to 
ensure that any development is of the highest qualit y. Areas used for temporary or occasional 
car parking should not include any hardstanding or gravelled areas. Any surface treatment 
should blend into the landscape.  Development should achieve a net gain in biodiversity as set 
out in policy DM11 and with reference to the site’s Natural Environment Delivery Plan.  
 
 
 
Botley Parish  
 
Context and key issues  
 
6.5.59  Botley parish is located on the eastern boundary of the Borough adjoining Winchester district.  
The parish extends around the northern part of Hedge End, bordering Fair Oak  and Horton 
Heath parish, and includes housing on the eastern edge of Hedge End and in Boorley Green 
to the north of Botley.  
 
6.5.60  Botley is one of the oldest settlements in the Borough and has significant heritage interest . A 
major new development including 1,400 dwellings, a new primary school and public open space is currently under construction to the north and east of Boorley Green. Other 
developments with planning permission in the parish include 600 dwellings at Land at Hedge End north of Winchester Road. This will significantly increase the population in the parish which 
was recorded at 5,083 and there were 2,199 dwellings in the 2011 Census.  In 2015 the 
population was 5,061
69. 
 
6.5.61  There are dwellings in Botley parish that sit on the eastern edge of Hedge End. The settlement  
gap between these and other parts of Botley is important for the identity of Botley village, but its 
open and rural character is being eroded.  
 
6.5.62  Botley lies on the upper reaches of the River Hamble, which is tidal up to Botley Mill. It has an 
attractive village centre which is included in a conservation area, and a large number of listed 
buildings, including Botley Mill which is an historic flour m ill on the river.  The conservation 
area extends south of the village to include areas of countryside linked to it historically.  
 
6.5.63  There is also historic interest at the Manor Farm Country Park which lies within the parish.   
This provides an important recreational resource for the Borough and the rest of south 
 
69 Small Area Projections 2015 published by Hampshire County Council    
213 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Hampshire, although local pedestrian, cycle and bridleway links to it are in need of 
improvement.  
 
6.5.64  Other recreational resources in the parish currently include areas of public open space with 
related pitches, greens and courts.   
 
6.5.65  There is little employment in Botley apart from within local shops and small workshops –  most 
residents of working age commute to workplaces at Hedge End, Winchester and Southampton.  
 
6.5.66  The retail centre of Botley is attractive, but its prosperity is  compromised by the presence of 
significant flows of through traffic and the proximity of the out -of-town stores at Hedge End. The 
new development at Boorley Green includes a new local centre.  
 
6.5.67  Botley is served by the A334 extending through the vill age centre from Hedge End and linking 
through to Wickham and Bishop’s Waltham to the east. To the north, Winchester Street and 
Woodhouse Lane link the village to Boorley Green and Fair Oak.  There is a limited bus service 
to Eastleigh and Southampton.  
 
6.5.68  Traffic flows through the village include HGVs and are sufficient to have caused an Air Quality 
Management Area to be defined because of the related emissions. The traffic also affects the viability of the village centre and its heritage qualities, reducing its attractiveness as a place to 
visit and affecting quality of life for local residents.  Means of addressing poor air quality in the 
village are set out in the Council’s Botley Air Quality Management Area Action Plan. These 
include increasing the use of public transport and other modes, travel planning, working with 
local businesses to reduce vehicle movements, detailed analysis of traffic movements, vehicle 
emission testing and air pollution monitoring. However, the most effective measure to res olve 
air quality and other issues would be to divert traffic away from the village centre, and there is a long- standing proposal for a Botley bypass that is included in the Local Plan (see policy 
BO5). 
 
6.5.69  Outside the village to the east, in Winchester  district, there is a railway station serving the 
village.  It lies on the line linking Fareham and Eastleigh. At  the station there is a rail -served 
aggregates depot.  The station has little car parking.  
 
6.5.70  The parish is currently served by a range of  community facilities including meeting halls and a 
local primary school and other facilities will be provided as part of new development.  The school 
is supported by pupils from beyond the immediate parish. GP services are provided by two 
surgeries, including one in Botley and there is a need to ensure that there is adequate health provision for new development . There will also be  a need for additional cemetery facilities  to 
serve the area in the near future.   
 
6.5.71  Work is currently prog ressing on the preparation of a Neighbourhood Plan.

6.5.74  A site comprising approximately 26 hectares on the north eastern side of Winchester Street and 
to the south of the railway line is primarily in agricultural use. The site includes the listed 
farmhouse and buildings of Uplands Farm. The eastern part of the site lies adjacent to the River 
Hamble which is within an area at risk of flooding and is also adjacent to the Botley Mill Site of 
Importance for Nature Conservation  (SINC), designated for its wet woodland habitat and 
adjacent to the designated Botley Cons ervation Area. The site is crossed from north- west to 
south- east by a high voltage overhead power line and by a public footpath which runs north to 
south, linking the village with the open countryside to the north. A resolution to grant outline planning permission has been achieved for this site.   
 
6.5.75  In accordance with Environment Agency advice, waste water should be treated via the sewer system and not by an on -site solution. There are understood to be waste water capacity issues 
in the area, and the connections should be at the nearest point of capacity. Where possible a combined solution with site HE1 Land west of Woodhouse Lane, Hedge End should be found.

6.5.76  The site comprises  6.96ha of land on the eastern side of Kings Copse Avenue and Tanhouse 
Lane and falls within the River Hamble County Park estate. The site is split into two parcels with the larger open parcel to the south, currently used for agriculture and the smaller northern parcel 
consisting of mature woodland which is part of the Tanhouse Meadow  Site of Importance for 
Natur e Conservati on (SINC ) and Manor Farm Local Nature Reserve ( LNR). The Hedge End 
Stream is located within this area of woodland. Overhead powerlines cross diagonally through the eastern part of the site.   The s ite boundaries are well defined by mature vegetation apart 
from the north western boundary which abuts Kings Copse Avenue, where clear view s of the 
site are achieved. The topography of  the site falls gently t owards the north east. The site as a

Transport  
 
Botley bypass  
 
 
Policy BO5, Botley bypass  
 
1. An indicative route is reserved for a new road bypassing Botley to the north, as 
shown on the policies map.  This shall comprise:  
 
a. improvements to the Maypole roundabout, and to Woodhouse Lane from the 
Maypole roundabout in Hedge End to a new roundabout with a new road link 
across to Winchester Street, to be secured in connection wit h development 
proposals at Hedge End, Botley, Boorley Green, and Horton Heath;  
b.   a new road link between Woodhouse Lane and Winchester Street;   
c.    a new road link from Winchester Street to the River Hamble built to distributor 
road standard through the site allocated for development by policy BO2 above, to form part of the road network serving this development site;  
d.  a bridge over the River Hamble, and a road south -eastward to the junction of 
  
222 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  the A334 with the Curdridge Road in Winchester district, for future 
implementation (as set out in Winchester City Council’s Local Plan Part 2).  The 
design of the bridge over the upper reaches of the Hamble River should 
minimise damage to the river and to the adjoining Botley Mill Woodland Site of 
Importance for Nature Conservation ; and 
e.   a site level Habitats Regulation Assessment is required to demonstrate how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect  on any European site.  
 
2. The new road should include safe and convenient provision for pedestrians , 
equestrians  and cyclists including the ability to access Botley station to the east. An 
environmental impact assessment will need to be prepared to accompany the 
planning application for the road and the bridge over the River Hamble. In due course 
the Borough Council  will promote traffic management  measures within Botley village 
in association with the bypass.  
 
6.5.78  The village of Botley has suffered from increasing vehicular traffic and congestion in recent 
years. The A334 runs west to east through the village centre and provides access to 
Winchester district and Fareham Borough over the River Hamble. Traffic flows through the 
village are likely to increase as a result of the development proposals of this plan, and the 
major development approved at North Whiteley in Winchester district.  
 
6.5.79  For some years there have been concerns about the level of traffic in Botley village, which 
includes a higher than normal proportion of HGVs and has implications for health (an air 
quality management area has been designated in the village centre), amenity , community 
and the local economy. Traffic noise, poor air quality and difficulties in crossing the road affect the attractiveness of the centre as a shopping destination. These concerns led some 
time ago to the identification of an alternative route for t he A334 running north of the village, 
which is the long- standing Botley bypass proposal.  In summer 2016 Hampshire County 
Council held a consultation about the route of the bypass and a preferred route was identified 
which included some revisions to the hi storic bypass proposal. Planning permission has now 
been granted for the  creation of a bypass along this route. The Highways Authority and the 
Borough Council are working to secure sufficient funding for the road. The policy above 
seeks to secure elements of the bypass related to development proposals in this Local Plan, 
whilst reserving the whole route for future implementation.  
 
6.5.80  This proposal links to an equivalent proposal in Winchester district that continues the bypass 
past Botley Station to link with the A334. In preparing a scheme for the bridge over the River 
Hamble and the eastern- most part of the bypass, a Construction Environmental Management 
Plan is likely to be required. The environmental impact assessment should include specific 
consider ation of water quality impacts on the Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation 
(which includes the River Hamble estuary) and how adverse effects on the SAC will be 
avoided.  
 
6.5.81  A site level Habitats Regulations Assessment will be required to demonstrate the detail of  how 
this site will be delivered without adverse effect on any European site. Particular reference 
should be made to the findings of the Habitats Regulation Assessment  of the Local Plan with 
regards to the River Itchen Special Area of Conservation and the avoidance and mitigation 
measures identified. These include:  
 
a. careful design of new development, informing new residents and commitment to 
monitoring with regard to ri sk introducing invasive non- native species  
 
b. adherence to a Construction Environmental Management Plan and utilisation of standard 
pollution control guidance with regard to impacts on water quality; and  
 
c. avoidance measures with regard to disturbance of otters and protection of watercourses 
to preserve the ott er movement network.      
223 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
6.5.82  There is also potential for previously unidentified archaeology of prehistoric and Roman 
date along the route of the bypass. Any planning application should include an assessment 
of the potential for previously unidentified archaeological sites and the impact of the 
proposed development upon these in accordance with policy DM12 . 
 
Other transport improvements  
 6.5.83  Further improvements to the road system in Botley Parish are likely to be needed in 
association with the new development under construction at Boorley Green  and the 
committed development between Boorley Green and Hedge End station. Details  of the 
estimated cost and timing of these highway improvements will be included in an updated 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. These improvements include:  
 Botley Road/Bubb Lane roundabout (Denham’s Corner)  
 
Policy BO 6, Junction Improvement, Botley Road/Bubb Lane roundabout (Denham’s Corner)
 
 
1.  The Borough Council will support the County Council as highway authority in 
delivering capacity improvements as required at Botley Road/Bubb Lane roundabout (Denham’s Corner).  
 
6.5.84  This junction is located north west of  the Boorley Green strategic development site  and the 
development site north of Hedge End station, lying between these sites and the Horton Heath 
development area. It is a key node for traffic from both these areas and beyond.  
 
6.5.85  There is a commitment from the developers of the site between Hedge End station and Boorley Green to make improvements to this roundabout. These improvements will consist of enlarging 
the roundabout itself and widening to two lanes on the Winchester Road a nd Bubb Lane 
approach arms.  
  
 
Footpaths and cycleways  
 
6.5.86  In addition, improvements to footpaths and cycleways will be needed to serve the new developments and to link to strategic recreational green routes. These are set out in the 
Eastleigh Borough Transport Statement 2012 and will be included in the Council’s Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan.  
 
 
Open space provision 
 
6.5.87  The community’s need for new open space can be met through the new housing 
allocations as set out above.  Any new open space should meet the quantity, quality 
and accessibility standards as recommended  by the Open Space Needs  Assessment 
and detailed in C hapter 5.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Heritage  
 
Botley Mill 
 
Policy BO 7, Botley Mill 
 
1. Planning permission will be granted for development at Botley Mill subject to the 
other policies of this Local Plan and the following conditions:  
 
a. it enables the preservation, restoration and future maintenance of the 
buildings and their setting;  
b. it is sympathetic in terms of use, layout and design to the location of the site, the 
character of the listed buildings and their setting;  
c. it provides improved pedestrian links to the centre of Botley;  
d.    measures are taken to improve the safety of the vehicular access to the site; 
and 
e. development would not harm the nature conservation value of the River Hamble.  
 
 
 
 
6.5.88  The existing mill at Botley, which is a Grade II listed building, dates from about 1770 and is of 
considerable architectural and historic interest. It is a major feature of the village and the 
conservation area and it is considered essential to retain the historic buildings and their setting 
and encourage the continuation of its use. The Borough Council will therefore support 
sympathetic development which ensures the retention and enhancement of the character and setting of the Mill, its restoration, future  maintenance and continued use. Proposals should pay 
due regard to protecting the nature conservation value of the River Hamble.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Chapter 7: Monitoring and Review  
 
Monitoring  
7.1 Under the provisions of the Localism Act, local authorities are no longer required to produce an 
annual monitoring report.  However, they are expected to undertake regular monitoring, and to 
make the results of this available at the earliest opportunity.  
 
7.2 The Borough Council will continue to work with Hampshire County Council and other partners 
to monitor key aspects of the policies and strategy set out in the Plan to ensure that the objectives of the Local Plan are delivered. A ppendix C  sets out the framework of performance 
indicators, and targets to monitor the objectives set out in this Local Plan.  
 
7.3 The results of this monitoring will be published on the Council’s website when data becomes 
available along with a monitoring report annually. The Council will also periodically review the Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report whi ch contains basic information about the Borough.  
 
Review  
7.4 In accordance with Government guidance, the Council will regularly review the Local Plan to 
ensure it is up to date and make changes as required. This will help maintain a supply of 
development land; consider up to date data and trends; and take into account new strategies 
from the Partnership for South Hampshire, Solent Local Enterprise Partnership and other 
organisations and legislative changes.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Appendix B: Legislation and other plans and strategies  
 
 
A.1 There is a full list of the legislation, strategies, plans and policies that we must take into 
account in the Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Report Appendix 1.  
 
 
Legislation  
 
A.2 Statutory requirements are set out in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as 
amended by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (the 2004  Act), the 
Planning Act 2008, the Localism Act 2011, the National Planning Policy Framework 2012 
and the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012.  The 
Localism Act removed the former regional plans,  has introduced powers for local 
communities to prepare neighbourhood development plans, and made a number of further 
amendments to the 1990 and 2004 Acts and regulations.  
 
A.3 The 2004 Act established a different way of preparing Local Plans, introducing the concept 
of ‘Local Development Frameworks’ (LDFs) - portfolios of documents that included a core 
strategy and other development plan documents (DPDs) and Supplementary Planning 
Documents (SPDs). The government’s National Planning Policy Framework published in 
March 2012 has changed this, suggesting that all policies and proposals should now be 
included in a single DPD called a Local Plan .   
 
A.4 The National Planning Policy Framework has replaced the Planning Policy Statements 
(PPSs) and Planning Policy Guidance Notes (PPGs) which formerly set out national 
planning policies and guidance on how to prepare local development frameworks.  
 
A.5 The Government also publishes circulars and other guidance on planning matters. There 
are also many other pieces of legislation that are relevant to planning, for example relating 
to housing, public health, transport, biodiversity etc. All this legislation and guidance can be 
viewed in full at www.communities.gov.uk/ . 
 
 
Planning and other strategies  
 
A.6 As well as legislation, we must also take into account the plans and strategies that cover the 
wider area including and beyond the Borough’s boundaries. The Borough Council also has 
a lot of its own strategies, for example for housing, older people, young people, climate 
change etc. that need to be supported by the LDF. These are explained below.  
 
 
National plans and strategies  
 
National Planning Policy Framework  
 
A.7 In March 2012 the Government published the National Planning Policy Framework:  
 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national -planning- policy -framework --2 
 
The NPPF 2012 has since been replaced by the NPPF 2018, which has itself been replaced 
by the NPPF 2019 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national -planning- policy -
framework --2). In accordance with the transitional provisions in paragraph 214 of the NPPFs 
2018 and 2019, the NPPF 2012 has been applied in the examination of the Local Plan. The 
current NPPF is, however, a material consideration in planning decisions.  
   
232 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  County and sub-regional plans and strategies  
 
Hampshire County Council  
 
A.8 The County Council has responsibility for:  
 
• minerals and waste planning, along with the unitary city authorities of Southampton 
and Portsmouth and the New Forest and South Downs national park authorities;  
 
• transport planning, including the Local Transport Plan;  
 
• flooding – the County Council is now a Lead Local Flooding Authority under the Flood and 
Water Management Act 2010;  
 
• Management of the River Hamble –  the County Council is responsible for the Harbour 
Authority;  
 
• education;  
 
• social care and health;  
 
• libraries.  
 
A.9 It also has roles in encouraging business and the economy, leisure and tourism, landscape planning and heritage, promoting biodiversity etc. ( see www.hants.gov.uk ). 
 
 
Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan  
 
A.10 Hampshire County Council, Southampton City Council, Portsmouth City Council, the New 
Forest National Park Authority and the South Downs National Park authority are the minerals planning authorities for H ampshire.  The Hampshire Minerals  and Waste Plan 
(HMWP ) was adopted in October 2013 –  see 
https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/strategic -planning/hampshire-
minerals -waste -plan. The  HWMP has identified a mineral extraction site at Hamble 
Airfield in Eastleigh  Borough, along with a number of minerals and waste safeguarding 
sites. Local Plans must  reflect minerals and waste plans once these are adopted.  
 
 
Local Transport Plan 
 
A.11 Highway authorities have a duty under the Local Transport Act 2008 to produce a 
local transport plan. The Local Transport Plan for Hampshire (LTP3) has been 
prepared by Hampshire County Council and Portsmouth and Southampton City 
Councils setting out the long- term strategy for travel and transport within Hampshire 
for the period 2011 to 2031 -  https://www.hants.gov.uk/transport/localtransportplan .  
In the light of the recession and reductions in public spending, it identifies as an overall priority the need to make the most  of existing infrastructure.  Within this, 
there are a number of themes including maintenance and safety of roads, 
management of traffic, public transport,  quality of life and place, and transport and 
growth areas. The LTP contains sections relating to strategies for the various parts 
of Hampshire including a  Strategy for South Hampshire.  This identifies the   
233 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  characteristics and challenges relating to transport in south Hampshire, and 
outcomes required to deliver the vision. It contains 14 policies for the county and the 
two cities, a number of which are of pa rticular relevance to Eastleigh Borough, as 
follows:   
i. Support sustainable economic growth; this is of relevance to Eastleigh River  Side and 
other economic development in the Borough ; 
 
ii. Ensure reliable access to and from the three main ‘gateways’ in this area (the two 
ports and the airport); this includes improving rail access to the airport from the east, 
which has implications for the rail network through Eastleigh Borough  and within 
Eastleigh River Side.  It also includes measures to optimise use of the motorways;  
 
iii. Maximise the capacity of existing roads; this could include works to traffic lights and 
other more localised improvements and traffic management measures within the 
Borough;  
 
iv. Achieve a high quality and well -maintained transport network;  
 
v. Deliver improvements in air quality –  this is a particular concern within the Borough 
where there are four Air Quality Management Areas relating to roads and road 
junctions;  
 
vi. Develop sub- regional approaches to managing parking;  
 vii. Improve road safety;  
 
viii. Promote walking and cycling; this will link to the Borough Council’s existing 
walking and cycling strategies;  
 
ix. Encourage private investment in public transport (buses, taxis etc.);  
 
x. Develop the role of water -borne transport;  
 
xi. Work with rail operators to improve stations and facilities for people and freight –  this 
is likely to have implications for Eastleigh River Side;  
 
xii. Work with local planning authorities to integrate planning and transport;  
 
xiii. Develop and deliver public realm improvements (e.g. environmental improvements to 
streets); work has already progressed with Hampshire County Council to  identif y 
street scene improvements.  
 xiv. Safeguard and enable the delivery of a limited range of transport improvements within the area –  those relating to Eastleigh Borough include:  
 
• Safeguarding a route for the Botley Bypass;  
 
• Enabling developer -led solutions to access Eastleigh River Side;  and 
 
• Enabling developer -led improvements to facilitate access to planned 
major development areas.  
 
 
   
234 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Transport Delivery Plan 
A.12 Transport for South Hampshire working with Hampshire County Council (since replaced 
by Solent Transport)  produced the Transport Delivery Plan in 2013 as a statement of the 
major transport  schemes priorities to be progressed by TfSH .  It is a strategic plan and 
therefore does not include full details of all transport schemes to be progressed, which  
for each local authority area are set out in local transport statements.  
 
 
 Eastleigh Borough Local Transport Statement  
 
A.13 Hampshire County Council has worked with Eastleigh Borough Council to produce a statement which consists of the Transport Strategy and the proposed package of 
sustainable transport measures to improve acces sibility and  modal choice within the 
Eastleigh Borough Council (EBC) area. The Transport  Statement provides the following:  
 
• a comprehensive local transport policy framework for the Borough;  
• a framework to assist with the prioritisation of transport investment;  
• a sound basis for land use and development planning;  
• assistance to the local planning authority with infrastructure planning in support of the Eastleigh Borough Council Proposed Submission Local Plan 2016- 2036.  
 
 
Flood Risk 
 
A.14 Hampshire County Council is now a Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA). Under the 
requirements of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 and the 2009 Flood  Risk 
Regulations, the County Council has prepared a Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment –  
see 
https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/environment/flooding/strategies/pr
eliminary -flood- risk-assessment . The County Council has prepared a Local Flood Risk 
Management Strategy and a Groundwater Management Plan for Hampshire and is preparing surface water management plans for districts and Boroughs in the county.  
 
 
Hampshire Strategic Infrastructure Statement 2019 
 
A.15 Since 2009 Hampshire County Council has produced studies of the community 
infrastructure likely to be needed to support development proposals across the county.  
The latest published in 2019 includes details on the needs and requirements for 
transport and highways, education, countryside services , waste management, flood 
and water management, libraries, broadband, extra care, public health and blue light 
emergency services infrastructure  – see 
https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/strategic -
planning/infrastructure -planning .   
 
 
Older People’s Well Being Strategy  
 
A.16 The County Council has produced an Older People’s Well Being Strategy -  see 
https://www.hants.gov.uk/socialcareandhealth/publichealth/jsna/ageingwellsummary  - that 
seeks to address issues they face in remaining independent.  The County Council also 
seeks to ensure the provision of housing for older people across the county, and produced 
their Older People’s Housing Study in 2009.  
   
235 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
Hampshire School Places Planni ng Framework 2017 -2021 
 
A.17 The School Places Plan sets out the identified need for extra mainstream school places for 
the primary sector (4 to 11 year olds) and the secondary sector (11 to 16 year olds).   The 
latest Hampshire School Places Plan can be viewed at: 
https://www.hants.gov.uk/educationandlearning/schoolplacesplan . The Borough 
Council conti nues to discuss the Borough’s existing and future school needs with the 
County Council and the proposed provisions made in this Local Plan reflect the currently 
identified needs .  
 
 
River Hamble Harbour Authority Strategic Vision, Strategic  Plan and 
Business Plan  
 
A.18 The River Hamble Harbour Authority’s Strategic Vision, Strategic Plan and Business Plan -  
https://www.hants.gov.uk/thingstodo/riverhamble/harbourauthority  seek to bring together the 
various interest groups for the River Hamble and formulate common aims as well as agree 
policies and actions for a wide range of topics.  
 
 
Countryside Access Plan for Hampshire 
 
A.19 The Countryside Access Plan (CAP) for Hampshire comprises seven local area plans which, 
together with an eighth ‘County Overview’ CAP, form the Rights of Way Improvement Plan 
(ROWIP) for the county of Hampshire -  see 
https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/countryside/accessplan .  These 
plans meet the Government’s aim of better provision for walkers, cyclists, equestrians and people with mobility problems.  
 
A.20 The plans relevant to Eastleigh Borough are the County Overview and the 
CAPs for the Forest of Bere, Solent and Test  and Itchen areas. These plans set  
out a framework by which the County Council and its partners can coordinate  
work to improve the network of rights of way and other forms of access to the  
countryside to facilitate and promote outdoor recreation and enjoyment of  
Hampshire’s countryside.  
 
A.21 Rights of Way Improvement Plans are closely linked with Local Transport Plans, with the 
aim o f delivering a more integrated approach to sustainable transport in rural and urban 
areas.  The CAP identifies the main issues and suggests what should be done to improve 
access to the countryside and contribute to walking and cycling access to services, 
amenities and transport hubs.  
 
 
Hampshire Biodiversity Action Plan  
 
A.22 The County Council has prepared a biodiversity action plan which reviews the status of 
wildlife in Hampshire and sets out a framework for action –  see 
https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/environment/biodiversity   
 
 
Faster broadband  
 
A.23 Hampshire County Council is also promoting a faster broadband initiative in order to 
achieve improvements in broadband access for businesses and residents – see   
236 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  https://www.hampshiresuperfastbroadband.com/ .  
 
 
Partnership for  South Hampshire (Pf SH) 
 
A.24 Eastleigh Borough sits within the south Hampshire area, which includes the cities of 
Southampton and Portsmouth along with neighbouring areas related to them through 
transport links, their local economy or community interests. In south Hampshire, a voluntary 
association of city, district and Borough  Council s – the Partnership for South Hampshire 
(PfSH)70 has arrived at an overall  economic strategy which informs all the plans and 
strategies  of its member  authorities.  
 
 
 
PfSH South Hampshire Spatial Position Statement  
 
A.25 PfSH has produced a statement that apportions the identified development requirements 
between its constituent authori ties, informed by the Economic Development Strategy and 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment . It is a non -statutory document which provides 
evidence of meeting the statutory duty to co -operate across the sub- region.  The PfSH South 
Hampshire Spatial Position Statement can be viewed at: https://www.push.gov.uk/wp -
content/uploads/2022/03/PUSH -Spatial -Position -Statement -2016.pdf  
 
For Eastleigh Borough, the South Hampshire Spatial Position Statement ; 
 
• Identifies the northern part of Eastleigh Borough as a strategic development locations for 
mixed use development, subject to significant infrastructure investment (SDL1);  
 
• Identifies Eastleigh River Side as a major regeneration opportunity;  
 
• Identifies Eastleigh town centre as a large Town Centre where there is to be modest expansion of retail, office and other town centre uses;  
 
• Restricts out -of-centre retailing;  
 
• Requires the development of a net additional 40,000sq .m. of offices and 74,000sq.m. of

• Requires the provision of 14,950  dwellings in the Borough between 2011 and 2034;  
 
• Identifies the importance of strategic countryside gaps between settlements (to be 
identified in Local Plans) . 
 
PfSH Green Infrastructure Strategy  and Implementation Plan  
 
A.26 The P fSH Green Infrastructure Strategy (2017 – 2034) identifies the key green 
Infrastructure (GI) features and future requirements for South Hampshire, which will be critical in enabling growth and development to take place, informing the location of new 
development, and providing a high quality GI network for South Hampshire’s communities .  
 
70 PfSH is a par tnership  of the unitar y authorities of Por tsmouth and Southampton, Hampshire County Council (HCC) and district/Borough 
authorities of Eastleigh, East Hampshire, Fareham, Gospor t, Havant, New Forest district, New Forest National Park Authority, T est Valley and

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  It was adopted by P fSH in March 2017 and updated in July 2018. It can be viewed at:  
https://www.push.gov.uk/work/planning -and- infrastructure/green -infrastructure-
flooding- water -management/ .  This strategy builds on earlier work undertaken by PfSH 
and has been developed by reviewing and building on the existing evidence base with 
greater focus on GI at a strategic level.  
 
A.27 The PfSH Green Infrastructure Implementation Plan (2019) is the delivery plan for South 
Hampshire Green Infrastructure Strategy 2017 -2034. It will support the enhancement of 
the area’s GI network, enabling growth and development across the sub- region and 
enhancement of the area’s natural environment through the delivery of a number of key 
strategic GI projects/initiatives. The Plan also sets the framework for more locally based GI 
planned and delivered at the district and community levels. It also builds on earlier work undertaken by PfSH and will be used as a bid for resources and potential sources of 
project funding. The Plan can be viewed at:  
https://www.push.gov.uk/work/planning-
and- infrastructure/green- infrastr ucture -flooding- water -management/  
 
  
Other PfSH policies  
 
A.28 PfSH has also drawn up guidance (including policy) frameworks on a variety of issues 
including:  
 
 
• affordable housing;  
 
• sustainable development;  
 
• the Integrated Water Management Strategy;  
 
• climate change and quality places;  
 
• the use of developers contributions to provide workforce training.  
 
 
A.29 This guidance also informs the policies of this Local Plan. All P fSH policies and guidance 
can be viewed on their web site which is  at http://www.push.gov.uk/ . 
 
 
Solent Transport (formerly Transport for South Hampshire and Isle of 
Wight ) 
 
A.30 Solent Transport is P fSH’s partner in achieving its economic strategy and leads on 
addressing existing and future transport requirements for south Hampshire.  It 
comprises representatives of the  area’s highway authorities (Hampshire County 
Council and Portsmouth and Southampton City Councils). Solent Transport (and 
TfSH IoW before July 2014)  has produced a number of strategies relevant to the 
management of transport in the Borough including:  
 
 
• A ‘Reduce’ Strategy (2009) designed to:  
   
238 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   reduce the need to travel;  
 
 maximise the number and proportion of journeys made by alternative modes to 
the private car; and  
 
 contribute to wider environmental and health benefits, such as reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality.  
 
See https://www.solent -transport.com/research -and-resources/
   
 
• A Freight Strategy (2009), which aims to, “facilitate the safe and efficient transportation of freight into, out of and within the TfSH sub -region, supporting a competitive local and 
regional economy, whilst taking into account the existing and future needs of our 
society and the environment.”  
 
See https://www.solent -transport.com/research -and-resources/ . It examines issues 
relating to road, rail, maritime and air freight in south Hampshire, and includes  a freight 
action plan which contains a number of general measures to address the issues 
identified.  
 
Solent Local Enterprise Partnership  
 
A.31 The Solent Local Enterprise Partnership (Solent LEP) helps to determine local economic 
priorities and drive local economic growth and the creation of new jobs . The Solent LEP is 
a business led collaboration between public, private and education sectors across the 
Solent. This includes 9 local authority members, including Eastleigh Borou gh Council. As 
a partnership organisation, all members  are actively working together to secure a more 
prosperous and sustainable future for the Solent area.  Solent LEP has produced a 
delivery plan for the sub- region – see  https://solentlep.org.uk/media/2999/solent -lep-
delivery -plan-rev-april -2020- final.pdf . 
 
Solent Local Economic Partnership Transforming Growth Strategy  
 
A.32 The Solent LEP has published a Transforming Growth Strategy (2015) which summarises 
its Strategic Economic Plan for the period between 2014 –  2020 – see 
https://solent lep.org.uk/what -we-do/transforming- solent -growth- strategy/ .This 
ambitious plan builds on the areas’ strengths, harnesses the drivers for growth and addresses the barriers, which if not addressed, could hinder growth in the Solent region.  
 
A.33 Its vision is “to create an environment that will bring about sustainable economic growth 
and private sector investment in the Solent. It will assist this globally -competitive area 
reach its full potential, enabling existing businesses to grow, become more profitable and 
to be greener; enabling the creation of new businesses and attracting new businesses to the region.”  
  
A.34 The revised P fSH Economic Development Strategy proposes economic development to help 
boost south Hampshire’s economic performance, which is lagging slightly behind that of 
other areas in the south- east of England. It suggests 1.36 - 1.72 million sq. m. of new 
employment development over the period 2006 to 2026. It also proposes around 74,000 dwellings for south Hampshire over the same time period.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
Eastleigh Borough Council  
 
Eastleigh Borough Council strategies  
 
A.35 Eastleigh Borough Council has three strategic priorities, which are:  
 
 
• A Green  Borough : Making a difference to our environment  
 
• A Prosperous Place:  Where everyone is able to share in prosperity  
 
• A Healthy Community : Active and lively with a spirit of togetherness . These closely 
parallel the three elements of the former Community Plan Vision, and have been used 
as the basis for the vision, objectives and policies included in this Local Plan.  
 
 
A.36 The Borough Council has a particularly wide range of strategies that assist to achieve its 
strategic priorities, as follows:  
 
 
• Air Quality Action Plans  
 
• Biodiversity Action Plan   
 
• Children & Young People Strategy  
 
• Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan  
 
• Community Safety Partnership Plan  
 
• Cultural Strategy  
 
• Cycling Strategy  
 
• Equality and Diversity Strategy and Accessible Homes Strategy 2008- 2011 
 
• Health  and Wellbeing Strategy  
 
• Home Energy Conservation and Fuel Poverty Strategy  
 
• Homelessness Strategies  
 • Housing Strategy for Eastleigh  
 
• Play Strategy and Action Plan 
 
• Prosperity Strategy and Delivery Plan 
 
• Public Art Strategy  
   
240 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  • Public Transport Strategy for Eastleigh  
 
• Sport & Recreation Strategy  
 
• Walking Strategy  
 
These are referred to in related topics within the Local Plan.  
 
 
32 
Neighbouring authorities  
 
A.37 In arriving at its strategy for the Local Plan, the Borough Council has also taken into 
account the plans of neighbouring authorities:  
 
A.38 Southampton City Council:  The Borough’s close relationship with Southampton has 
involved joint transport assessment, joint work on affordable housing, a joint retail s tudy 
(with the City Council and Test Valley Borough Council) and close working over site -
specific cross- boundary issues, including green infrastructure and the settlement gaps  
between the city and the settlements in the Borough.  There has also been discussion of 
the City Council’s current aspirations for Park  and Ride sites in Eastleigh Borough, and 
whether these will ever be needed.  The activities of the Port of Southampton, including its links to Southampton Airport, and its on- going requirements for warehousing have 
implications for this Borough.  Movement of people and goods generated by  development 
proposals in Southampton will have implications for the strategic transport networks that pass through this Borough . 
 
A.39 Test Valley Borough Counci l: There is close working with Test Valley Borough Council 
on green infrastructure, in particular the proposed Central Forest Park in southern Test 
Valley which borders the Borough. There is  also liaison on other issues, for example 
relating to the shared boundary at Valley Park and Chandler’s Ford, transport links and 
a joint retail study (see Southampton City Council above).  
 
A.40 Winchester City Council:  Winchester’s proposals for development at Whiteley have 
implications for road proposals in Eastleigh Borough, including the proposed Botley 
Bypass.  There is also co- ordination with them over housing and rural gap issues.  
 
A.41 Fareham Borough Council: We need to take into account the implications of Fareham 
Borough Council’s Strategic Development Area north of Fareham town (a new community 
to be known as Welborne), e.g. in terms of traffic generation. We also need to coordinate 
our policies for the River H amble.  
 
A.42 New Forest District Council (NFDC): NFDC has led the production of the North Solent 
Shoreline Management Plan - see www.northsolentsmp.co.uk.  Eastleigh Borough 
Council has been part of the project management group that has helped to produce the 
document.  It covers the whole of the Borough’s coastline, and identifies which areas are to 
be protected from  coastal erosion, and for how long.  
 
 
Other agencies and bodies  
 
A.43 Southern Water and Portsmouth Water: These authorities’ Water Resources 
Management Plans (WRMPs) are important because they set out how water is to be 
supplied and waste water dealt with in the Borough.   
 Southern Water’s WRMP is at:  https://www.southernwater.co.uk/our -story/water -  
241 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  resources- planning   
Portsmouth Water’s WRMP is at:  
https://www.portsmouthwater.co.uk/news/publications/water -resources- planning/  
 
A.44 Environment Agency (EA):   The EA is responsible for identifying the areas at risk from 
flooding, and it also has responsibilities for controlling how much water is taken from the 
rivers, a nd what is discharged into them.  These all have implications for how much 
development can be accommodated and where. The EA has produced:  
 
• A River Basin Management Plan for the South East, which includes  Eastleigh 
Borough – see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south- east-
river -basin -district -river -basin -management -plan. 
• Two Catchment Flood Management Plans covering the Borough , the Test and 
Itchen, and South East Hampshire CFMPs, which develop policies for managing 
fluvial flood risks in these catchments –  see 
https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/catchment -flood- management -
plans  
 
A.45 Historic England (HE):  Historic Engla nd is the Government’s statutory advisor on the 
historic envi ronment. It provides advice  on development proposals affecting Grade I and 
Grade II* listed buildings, historic parks and gardens and larger developments in 
conservation areas. It also administers the Scheduled Monument Consent regime on 
behalf of the Secretary of State for Digital,  Culture, Media and Sport.  
 
A.46 Natural England (NE):  NE is responsible for areas of nature conservation value, and for soil quality and agricultural land value. These factors also influence where development 
can go.  
 
A.47 Marine Management Organisation (MMO): the MMO has been set up to undertake marine 
planning of the seas around the coast of the UK. The aim is to ensure a sustainable future 
for coastal and offshore waters through managing and balancing the many activities,  
resources and assets in the marine environment.  Marine planning is following a similar 
approach to terrestrial planning – setting the direction for decision making at a local level to 
lead to the efficient and sustainable use of marine resources. Marine planning will:  
 
• guide marine users to the most suitable locations for different activities;  
• manage the use of marine resources to ensure sustainable levels;  
• work with all marine users to ensure everyone has an opportunity to contribute 
to marine plans;  
• take a holistic approach to decision making and consider all the benefits and impacts 
of all the current and future activities that occur in the marine environment . 
 
A.48 Southampton Airport ’s Masterplan 2037  sets out the growth path for the airport  over the 
next 20 years – see https://www.southamptonairport.com/masterplan  It is currently 
under review.

Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Glossary  
 
Active travel: ‘Active travel’ (or active transportation or mobility) means walking or cycling as an alternative 
to motorised transport (notably cars, motorbikes/mopeds etc) for the purpose of making everyday journeys.  
 
Adoption: The final confirmation of a development plan or Local Development Document (LDD) as having 
statutory status by a Local Planning Authority (LPA).  
 
Affordable housing: Defined in the March 2012 NPPF as social rented, affordable rented and intermediate 
housing, provided to eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. Eligibility is determined 
with regard to local incomes and local house prices. Affordable housing should include provisions to remain 
at an affordable price for future eligible households or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative 
affordable housing provision.  
 
Social rented housing is owned by local authorities and private registered providers (as defined in section 
80 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008), for which guideline target rents are determined through the 
national rent regime. It may also be owned by other persons and provided under equivalent rental 
arrangements to the abo ve, as agreed with the local authority or with the Homes and Communities Agency.  
 
Affordable rented housing is let by local authorities or private registered providers of social housing to 
households who are eligible for social rented housing. Affordable R ent is subject to rent controls that require 
a rent of no more than 80% of the local market rent (including service charges, where applicable).  
 
Intermediate housing is homes for sale and rent provided at a cost above social rent, but below market 
levels s ubject to the criteria in the Affordable Housing definition above. These can include shared equity 
(shared ownership and equity loans), other low cost homes for sale and intermediate rent, but not 
affordable rented housing.  
 
Homes that do not meet the above definition of affordable housing, such as “low cost market” housing, may 
not be considered as affordable housing for planning purposes.  
 
Air Quality Management Area: The monitoring locations for Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) are 
chosen to target areas where air pollution is expected to be high, areas where members of the public spend 
an hour or more near busy roads, and areas that represent a background level that is not impacted by road 
traffic or industrial sources. These monitoring locations gi ve us a picture of the air pollution levels across the 
Borough.  
 Allocations: These identify sites and allocate land for different types of uses required to deliver the scale of 
growth and development set out in the Eastleigh Borough Local Plan (2016- 2036) . This includes sites for 
housing, employment, transport infrastructure, retail, community and leisure related uses and site 
designations primarily for environmental protection including open space.  
 
Appropriate Assessment: Evaluates the significance of the impacts of a proposed plan or project (either 
individually or in combination with other proposals) on sites of EU importance (Natura 2000 sites), in order to inform the decision- making process.  
 
Archaeological Interest: There will be archaeological inter est in a heritage asset if it holds, or potentially 
may hold, evidence of past human activity worthy of expert investigation at some point. Heritage assets with 
archaeological interest are the primary source of evidence about the substance and evolution of  places, and 
of the people and cultures that made them.  
 
Article 4 Direction: These are a means by which a local planning authority (LPA) can bring within planning 
control certain types of development, or changes of use, which would normally be permitted development 
(i.e. not require an application for planning permission).  
   
253 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  Authority Monitoring Report: Local planning authorities must publish information at least annually that 
shows progress with local plan preparation, reports any activity relating to the duty to cooperate, any 
information which relates to indicators in the plan, and any policies which are not being implemented. Local 
planning authorities can also use the Authority Monitoring Report to provide up- to-date information on the 
implementation of any neighbourhood plans that have been bought into force, and monitor the provision of 
housing for older and disabled people. It can help inform if there is a need to undertake a partial or full 
update of the local plan, when carrying out a review at least every five years from the adoption date.  
 Biodiversity: Defined as ‘the range of life forms which constitute the living world, from microscopic 
organisms to the largest tree or animal and the habitat and ecosystem in which they live’.  
 
Biodiversity A ction Plan: Provides a framework for the maintenance and enhancement of the biodiversity 
in Eastleigh Borough.  
 
BREEAM: This is the world’s leading sustainability assessment method for masterplanning projects, 
infrastructure and buildings. It recognises and reflects the value in higher performing assets across the built 
environment lifecycle, from new construction to in- use and refurbishment.  
 
Building Regulations: Building regulations are minimum standards for design, construction and alterations 
to virtually every building. The regulations are developed by the UK government and approved by Parliament.  
 
Carbon sequestration: Often referred to as carbon dioxide removal, this is the long- term removal, capture 
or sequestration of greenhouse gasses, particularl y carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to slow or reverse 
atmospheric CO2 pollution and to mitigate or reverse global warming. In practice this could be through the 
storage of carbon in plants, soils, geologic formations, and the ocean. The most effective way for achieving 
this in Eastleigh Borough is through the absorption of CO2 by trees and other vegetation.  
 Countryside: All areas outside the urban edge as defined on the policies map, including river valleys, 
ancient woodland and the undeveloped coast.  
 
Density: This is calculated by dividing net developable area by the number of proposed dwelling units. Net 
developable area includes only those areas which will be developed for housing and directly associated 
uses. This will include: access roads from within the site; private garden space; car parking areas to serve 
the development; incidental green space; and children’s play areas, where they are to be provided. It 
excludes: major distributor roads; schools and sites of other community buildings; open spac es serving a 
wider area; significant landscape buffer strips and noise attenuation mounds; the canopy spread, or 
potential canopy spread of trees worthy of  retention; and other landscape or water features worthy of 
retention.  
 
Development: The carrying out of any building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or 
under land, or the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land.  
 Green infrastructure: Defined in the March 2012 NPPF as a network of multi -functional green space, 
urban and rural, which is capable of delivering a wide range of environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities.  
 
Gypsy and Travellers: Defined in Annex 1, Planning Policy for Traveller Sites ( 2015 ) as ‘Persons of 
nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on grounds only of their own 
or their family’s or dependants’ educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel temporarily, 
but excluding members of an organised group  of Travelling Showpeople or circus people travelling together 
as such.’  
 
Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA): The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017). 
The purpose of the HRA is to identify any aspects of the emerging Local Plan that w ould have the potential 
to cause a likely significant effect on Natura 2000 or European sites (Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), 
Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and Ramsar sites), (either in isolation or in combination with other plans   
254 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022  and projects), and to identify appropriate avoidance and mitigation strategies where such effects were 
identified.  
 Heritage assets: Defined in the March 2012 NPPF as a building, monument, site, place, area or landscape 
identified as having a degree of significance meriti ng consideration in planning decisions, because of its 
heritage interest. Heritage asset includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local 
planning authority (including local listing).  
 Large sites: Defined as 10 or more dwellings (net gain) and at least 1,000 sq.m of floorspace (or net gain) . 
 National Planning Policy Framework: Introduced in March 2012, this sets out the Government’s planning 
policies for England and how these are expected to be applied. This was revised in July 2018 with 
additional changes resulting in a further update in February 2019. It provides the framework within which local councils can produce local plans, which reflect the needs and priorities of their communities. This 
document which constitutes the Eastleigh Borough Local Plan (2016 -2036) was examined under the 
provisions of the March 2012 NPPF due to it being submitted to the Secretary of State before the 24 
January 2019 transition period deadline.  
. 
Neighbourhood Plan: A plan prepared by a Parish Council or Neighbourhood Forum for a neighbourhood 
area (made under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004). There are currently no made 
Neighbourhood Plans in Eastleigh Borough.  
 
Noise sensitive use/development: Noise sensitive uses are those uses sensitive to noise which require 
protection for reasons of either health or quality of life. They include residential development, hotels and 
hostels, schools and other education institutions, hospitals, clinics, law courts, religious and other 
institutions or activities where a peaceful and quiet environment is a feature necessary for their successful 
operation and/or effectiveness.  
 
Open space: This includes all open space of public value, and can take many forms, from formal sports 
pitches to open areas within a development, linear corridors and country parks. It can provide health and 
recreation benefits to people living and working nearby; have an ecological value and contribute to green 
infrastructure (see 2012 NPPF paragraph 171), as well as being an important part of the landscape and 
setting of built development, and an important component in the achievement of sustainable development 
(see 2012 NPPF paragraphs 7- 9). 
 Partnership for South Hampshire (PfSH): The Partnership for South Hampshire –  consisting of 12 local 
authorities in the area. (The Partnership is referred to as PfSH throughout the Plan, although was previously 
known as PUSH, the Partnership for Urban South Hampshire).  
 
Policies Map: An important part of the development plan, showing the location of proposals identified in the 
adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan (2016- 2036), on an Ordnance Survey base map.  
 Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE): This is the process of obtaining feedback on a building's performance 
in use. It provides feedb ack throughout a building’s lifecycle from initial concept through to occupation. The 
value of POE is being increasingly recognised, and it is becoming mandatory on many public projects. POE is valuable in all construction sectors, especially healthcare, education, offices, commercial and housing, 
where poor building performance will impact on running costs, occupant well -being and business efficiency. 
The information from feedback can be used to inform future projects, whether it is on the process of deliv ery 
or technical performance of the building.  
 
PfSH Spatial Position Statement (2016): This sets out the overall need for and distribution of 
development in South Hampshire up to 2034. It is the result of collaborative working to ensure that key 
strategic priorities across local boundaries are properly co- ordinated. As the statement is a non -statutory 
document, it will enable each Council to review its statutory Local Plan, and consider how development could be delivered. A key component of the statement is  setting out the housing and employment needed to 
promote economic growth,  jobs and homes for all. As such, it forms a key component of this Council’s wider 
statutory Duty to Cooperate obligations with other key  statutory bodies and organisations.    
255 
Adopted Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2022   
Settlem ent Gaps: Areas of predominantly undeveloped land between settlements that have been defined 
to protect  the individual identity of those settlements and prevent their coalescence (the merging together of 
separate settlements to form one single settlement).  
 
Settlement Hierarchy: This categorises the Borough’s settlements to recognise their different roles. A 
hierarchy groups together  the settlements that have similar characteristics and roles.  
 
Supplementary Planning Document (SPD): These provide additional guidance and detail to development 
plan policies for a specific  area or a specific topic but do not form part of the development plan.  
 
Sustainability Appraisal (SA) : This is a tool used to appraise planning policy documents in order to 
promot e sustainable development.  Social, economic and environmental objectives are taken into 
consideration. It incorporates Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA).  A SA is required under the 
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, to be carried out on all Development Plan Documents.  
 Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS ): A solution which manages surface and groundwater sustainably 
by mimicking natural  drainage regimes and avoiding the direct channelling of surface water through 
networks of pipes and sewers to nearby watercourses.  SuDS aim to reduce surface water flooding, improve 
water quality and enhance the amenity and biodiversity value of the environment.
