Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Foreword  
 
This Northumberland Local Plan is the first Local Plan adopted since the formation of 
Northumberland as a unitary authority in 2009. It contains new policies aimed at tackling 
real challenges facing different parts the County. It supersedes all the previou s plans 
prepared by the former District, Borough and County Councils. This new Local Plan 
provides a modern, up -to-date basis for making decisions on the thousands of applications 
submitted to the Council each year.   
When we started preparing this Plan, w e invited views on your preferred locations for new 
homes and businesses, and the key planning issues that the Plan should address. Your 
responses helped shape a Draft Plan, with  strategic and detailed policies to guide future 
growth across the County up to 2036.   
We listened to, and carefully analysed your comments on the Draft Plan. Amendments were 
made, and the Draft Plan was consulted upon again before being submitted to the 
Government in May 2019. The Council is grateful for your input, and we think it is a stronger 
Plan as a result.  
Government recognises that this is a Plan for growth. While the amount of land allocated for 
employment uses is aspirational, it is considered th at this will ensure that our minimum  
target of at least 15,000 additional jobs over the plan period can be delivered. The 17,700 
homes that this Plan proposes to provide for is more than the number that is required by the 
Government.

“We are absolutely delighted to have Government approval for our Local Plan. It’s 
progressive, forward looking and reflects modern approaches to tackling important 
challenges. I’m pleased to see that Government agrees with us that this is an 
ambitious strategy for employment growth”  
Portfolio Holder for Community Services, Cllr Colin Horncastle:  
“This new Local Plan is an important step in us setting out a single, clear agenda for 
the future of Northumberland. It gives an impo rtant framework for decisions on new 
homes, businesses and investment in the County”.  
This Plan provides for land in the right locations to support job growth and includes policies 
which will support and enable town centres, the rural economy and tourism t o thrive. It will 
allow for homes to be delivered where they are needed, including affordable and accessible 
homes, and ensure that there is the necessary infrastructure to support them – including 
new and expanded schools, improved roads and health care f acilities to meet the needs of 
all residents.  
While supporting growth, the Plan achieves this without the need to remove land from the 
Green Belt for housing, and it protects the countryside from encroachment by defining 
boundaries to many settlements. Th e Plan also offers protection to Northumberland’s 
environment and heritage which is hugely valued, not just by local residents, but also by the 
increasing numbers of visitors f rom across the region and beyond.    
 Foreword   
2  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  The Leader of the Council, Cllr Glen Sande rson:   
“This Plan is about people and places. It seeks to raise the profile of good, locally 
distinctive design and supporting more active, healthy lifestyles through better 
facilities for walking and cycling.  
The Plan also follows through on our commitm ents to the environment; it will help 
deliver our Climate Change Action Plan and looks to put biodiversity and ecology at 
the heart of decision making”.   
While a new Local Plan may be in place, communities across the County can continue to 
influence the lo cation and form of development in their local areas.  
Portfolio Holder for Community Services, Cllr Colin Horncastle:  
“I am committed to this Plan, and the way we can work together, using it as a 
supportive platform for resident’s initiatives like new Neigh bourhood Plans, local 
design guides and community -led housing schemes.”  
While this Plan provides an up -to-date basis for planning decisions across Northumberland, 
the Council recognises that the world does not stand still. Recent inward investment into th e 
County and the opportunities presented by the North of Tyne Devolution Deal and the 
Borderlands Growth Deal suggest the Council is right to be ambitious. While the Covid -19 
pandemic may have a lasting impact upon how and where people work and where they 
want to live, and the long -term changes caused by Brexit to some sectors of the economy 
remains unclear, the Plan is  flexible enough to support the changing needs of the 
Northumberland economy and its communities.

1. Introduction   
3 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  1. Introduction  
 
What  is the Development  Plan?  
 
1.1 The Development Plan is a set of policies, proposals and allocations setting out  how 
and where land is to be developed with new homes, places of employment,  services 
and facilities. Development Plans consist of Local Plans prepared by Local  Planning 
Authoritie s and neighbourhood plans prepared by local communities.  Together they 
form the statutory framework for future development of land and  buildings.  
 
What  is the Northumberland  Local  Plan?  
 
1.2 All local planning authorities are required to have an up -to-date Local Plan. The 
policies in the Northumberland Local Plan replace all those that were set out in the 
previous District , Borough , and County Council  plans , which are superseded : 
 
• The Core Strategies of the former Local Authorities of Alnwick (2007), Blyth 
Valley (2007), and Tynedale (2007) , and the Blyth Valley Development Control 
Policies Development Plan Document  (2007);   
• The saved Local Plan policies (under the Secretary of State's Direction) of the 
Northumberland Minerals Local Plan (2000 ), Northumberland Waste Local Plan 
(2001), Alnwick District Wide Local Plan (1997), Berwick upon Tweed Local Plan 
(1999), Blyth Valley District Local Plan (1999), Castle Morpeth District Local Plan 
(2003), Tynedale District Local Plan (2000), and Wansbeck District Local Plan 
(2007) ; and 
• Saved Policy S5 of the Northumberland County and National Park Joint Structure 
Plan Alteration (February 2005).  
 
1.3 The Northumberland  Local  Plan:  
• Sets the strategic  planning  policies  of the Council,  taking  account  of key factor s 
like population trends, economic growth, climate change, resources and  
environmental  character;  
• Sets the general scale and distribution of new development which is required  to 
meet  Northumberland’s  needs  to 2036;  
• Provides  the planning  principles,  including  detailed  ‘development  management’  
policies  to guide  decisions  on planning  applications;  
• Shows in detail where new homes, workplaces and facilities will be located  
through  allocations  of land;  and 
• Shows key environmental designations and include site specific proposals f or  the 
conservation  and enhancement  of historic  and natural  assets.  
 
1.4 Planning law states that planning  applications  should  be determined  in accordance  
with the Development  Plan unless  material  considerations  indicate  otherwise.  
Therefore, the policies within the Northumberland Local Plan, together with those in 
neighbourhood plans, represent the starting point for the assessment of all planning 
applications.  
 
 1. Introduction   
4  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  1.5 The Local Plan reflect s the Government’s  National  Planning  Policy  Framework  (or 
‘NPPF’) and associated Government legislation. It also sits underneath  frameworks  
and strategies  produced  regionally  and sub-regionally,  including  the Strategic 
Economic Plan for the North East prepared by the North East Local Economic  
Partnership (or ‘NELEP’). Finally, the Council itself has its own strategies on the 
economy and community matters, to which the Plan has full regard.  
 
1.6 As set out in the Local Development Scheme (LDS), the Council is committed to 
undertaking an early and p artial update of the Local Plan in so far as it relates to 
open space, sport and recreation and sites allocated as Protected Open Space in 
Policy INF 5, and to produce a separate Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople Local Plan (GTTSLP). When adopt ed, the policies in the GTTSLP will 
supersede Policy HOU 12 in the Northumberland Local Plan. In addition, the Council 
is committed to an early partial update of the plan, to reflect recent changes in 
national planning policy, where necessary.  The partial update, and the GTTSLP will 
be submitted within 18 months of the adoption date of this Local Plan.  
 
What  is the area covered  by the Northumberland  Local  Plan?  
 
1.7 The Northumberland Local Plan covers the whole of Northumberland with the 
exception of t he area of the Northumberland National Park, which is a separate  local 
planning authority. Figure 1.1 illustrates the extent of the area covered by the 
Northumberland Local Plan.  
 
What  is the relationship  with neighbourhood  plans?  
 
1.8 A number of communities across the County have prepared or are in the proce ss  of 
preparing neighbourhood plans. Once 'Made' (adopted) following independent  
examination, and agreed by the community following a referendum, these plans  form 
part of the statutory  Development  Plan.  
 
1.9 The scope  of neighbourhood  plans  is determined  by Town  and Parish  Councils  in 
consultation  with their communities.  Neighbourhood  plans  may cover  a wide range  of 
topic areas and include land allocations; or they may be limited t o selective topics  or 
sites.  
 
1.10 The County Council has a duty to support Town and Parish Councils engaged in  
neighbourhood  planning.  There  are a number  of Neighbourhood  Plans  in various  
stages of production across Northumberland. The position on progress will change  
across the life of the Local Plan and details of the update to date position can be  
found  on the County  Council's  website.  
 
1.11 The Local Plan has a key role to play in supportin g neighbourhood planning. In  
seeking to meet the Basic Conditions all neighbourhood plans must be in general  
conformity with the strategic policies in the development plan for their area. To  
facilitate this, in accordance  with national  policy  and guidance,  the Northumberland  
Local  Plan sets out clearly  the strategic  policies  for the County.  Neighbourhood  plans 
should reflect these policies and should plan positively to support them.  Specifically, 
neighbourhood plans should not promote less development than set  out in the Local  
Plan and must  not look to undermine  its strategic  policies.  1. Introduction   
5 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.

Consultation  
 
1.12 The Council was committed to engaging with local communities and interested 
parties throughout the preparation of the Local Plan, in accordance with the 
Statement of Community Involvement (SCI). Comments received through early 
engagement and in relation to the Regulation 18 Draft Local Plan, informed the  
preparation of the Publication Draft Local Plan (Regulation 19). Representations 
received on the soundness of the Local Plan at the Regulation 19 stage, and in 
relation to proposed Main Modifications to the Local Plan, have informed the adopted 
version of  the plan.  
1. Introduction   
6  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Evidence  
 
1.13 The Local Plan has been informed by a substantial body of evidence. This includes 
numerous technical studies covering a range of topics, undertaken or commissioned 
by the Council, evidence from national sources, and a number of technic al supporting 
papers which pull together information from different sources.  
 
1.14 The Local Plan has been informed by a Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and a Habitats 
Regulations Assessment (HRA) at each key stage in its preparation, as well as a 
Health Impact and an Equality Impact Assessment. These assessments ensure that 
policies accord with the principl es of sustainable development taking into 
consideration reasonable alternatives,  minimise the potential significant impacts 
upon European sites designated for their nature conservation importance, and that 
the impact of policies on public health, equality  and diversity has been considered.  
 
Duty  to Cooperate  
 
1.15 A 'Duty  to Cooperate'  was introduced  through  the 2011  Localism  Act and it is 
incorporated into the NPPF. It places a legal duty on local planning authorities and 
public bodies to cooperate on strategic planning issues that cross administrative 
boundaries. Local planning authorities must demonstrate how they have complied 
with the duty at the Independent Examination of their Local Plans. The Duty requires 
the Council to : 
• Work with neighbouring a uthorities on a joint approach to sustainable  
development  or use of land,  where  there  would  be a significant  impact  on both/all  
of the local planning  areas  concerned;  
• Set out planning  policies  to address  such  issues;  
• Work  with a range  of public  bodies  to set out agreements  on how strategic  issues  
will be dealt  with through  the plans  of each;  and 
• Consider  joint approaches  to plan making.  
 
1.16 The Council  worked  closely  with a number  of bodies  during  the preparation  of the 
Local Plan in accordance with the requirements under the Duty to Cooperat e, as set 
out in the Council’s Duty to Cooperate Statement of Common Ground and Statement 
of Compliance.  
 
1.17 The Local Plan’s evidence base documents, and the statutory assessments including 
the SA a nd HRA reports, are available on the Council’s website, together with the 
Council’s consultation statement and Duty to Cooperate Statement.  
 
How will the plan be implemented?  
 
1.18 To ensure the vision and objectives set out in the Northumberland Local Plan are  
realised, various mechanisms exist to guide and manage implementation of the  
policies  and proposals  in the Plan.  The main  purpose  of Local  Plans  is to address  the 
spatial implications of economic, social and environmental change. National  policy 
requires that Local Plans should set out the opportunities for development  and create 
clear policies on what will or will not be permitted and where. Only  policies that 
provide a clear indication of how a decision maker should react to a  development  1. Introduction   
7 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  proposal should be included in the Local Plan. The plan has been  prepared  in 
conformity  with this requirement.  
 
1.19 It follows that the most apparent means by which the Local Plan will be implemented 
is through  the Development  Management  process.  The Local  Plan, once  adopted,  
will be the starting point for the assessment of all planning applications. It will sit  
alongside any made neighbourhood plans which have equivalent status in the  
decision  making  process.  
 
1.20 The Planning Acts require that, to the extent tha t development plan policies are  
material to an application for planning permission, decisions must be made in  
accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate  
otherwise.  This is a well established  principle  which  recognises  the primacy  of the 
development  plan in our plan-led system.  
 
1.21 The Northumberland  Local  Plan provides  a comprehensive  set of planning  policies  to 
guide decisions on planning applications. Where appropriate, the Council may  
consider preparing more detailed guidance on certain topics through the creation  of 
Supplementary  Planning  Documents.  However,  for the most  part, it is expected  that 
the policies  in the Local  Plan will provide  sufficient  clarity  and precision,  when  read 
alone and when the Local Plan is read as a whole, such that they provide a  practical 
framework within which decisions on planning applications can be made  with a high 
degree of predictability and efficiency, in conjunction with any made  neighbourhood  
plans, as  required  throu gh national  policy.  
 
1.22 Whilst the express purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the  
achievement of sustainable development, the creation, management, maintenance, 
support and care required to foster sustainable communities requires much more  
than the delivery of sustainable development. It requires input from a wide range  of 
organisations,  agencies,  businesses  and individuals.  
 
1.23 Accordingly,  in addition  to its role in shaping  decision  making,  the Local  Plan has 
been prepared in part to complement many existing and emerging strategies,  policies 
and projects at a national and local level, outwith the town planning  framework,  and 
as a means  of influencing  the review  of those  strategies.  These  include the 
Northumberland Local Transport Plan,  the Northumberland Economic Strategy, and 
the North East Strategic Economic Plan.  
 
1.24 Effective and efficient implementation of policies in the Local Plan which are intended 
to support  sustainable  communities  will depend  upon  continued  management  and 
coordination of activities and roles across a range of organisations, agencies and  
business es. Northumberland County Council has a key role to play in this regard.  As 
well as delivering  and supporting  the development  of a comprehensive  planning  
policy  framework,  the Council  will work  with stakeholders  to proactively  support  the 
delivery of sustainable development. This will include working with: local  
communities; developers; landowners; service, utilities and infrastructure providers; 
and Advance  Northumberland.  
 
 1. Introduction   
8  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  1.25 Supporting sustainable communities may involve securing the prudent use, and if 
necessary disposal, of Council owned land and assets to facilitate the rationalisation 
of service provision, for example: through the shared use of buildings for leisure and 
customer services. It may also involve direct delivery by the Council of approp riate 
development and supporting infrastructure. In exceptional circumstances the Council 
may use its powers of compulsory purchase to acquire land and premises where the 
purpose would align with the strategy and policies set out in the Local Plan and it i s in 
the public interest to do so.  
 
1.26 In the case  of delivering  development  on large  scale  sites,  the Council  will seek  to 
work with developers to prevent piecemeal development and ensure sites are  
developed comprehensively with coordinated delivery of infra structure at the time  it is 
needed  to serve  the development.  
 
1.27 To support and secure implementation of the Local Plan the County Council will  
commit to undertake those actions identified below as implementation commitments:  
 
 
 
Implementation  commitments:  
 
The County Council will work proactively to bring about the delivery of th e 
Northumberland  Local  Plan by seeking  to: 
 
1. Align  its own plans,  strategies,  programmes  and investment  priorities  to deliver  
the vision  and objectives  set out in the Local  Plan;  
2. Collaborate to influence the plans, strategies, programmes and investment  
priorities  of other  public  bodies,  infrastructure  providers  and other  organisations  
to seek  alignment  with the Local  Plan;  
3. Support comprehensive and coordinated development of sites, including 
through masterplanning;  
4. Support communities, through their Town and Parish Councils, who wish to  
develop neighbourhood plans or use other neighbourhood planning tools 
provided these are in general conformity  with the strategic  policies  of the 
Northumberland  Local Plan, contribute towards the achievement of sustainable 
development,  and help shape the gr owth and development of neighbourhoods 
in a positive  way; 
5. Make use of its legislative powers, including where necessary through land  
acquisition and compulsory  purchase,  where  there  is an identified  need,  to bring  
about development to meet the vision, objectives, strategy and policies of the  
Local  Plan;  
6. Influence  and use public  and private  funding  opportunities  to maximum  effect  to 
deliver  the Local  Plan;  
7. Monitor the implementation and achievements secured through the Local Plan  
throughout  its existence  at least  annually;  and 
8. Through the monitoring process, and by maintaining an up -to-date evidence  
base, the County Council will implement appropriate measures to address any  
policies or proposals that fail to deliver anticipated outcomes or that be come  
obsolete.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2. Spatial  Portrait  
 
2.1 Northumberland is England's northernmost County, stretching from the Scottish  
Border in the north and west to Tyneside and County Durham in the south. The  
County  is flanked  by Cumbria,  the Cheviots  and North  Pennines  to the west and by 
the North  Sea to the east.  As such  it is part of the North  East Region  of England.  
 
2.2 The County,  the largest  unitary  authority  by geographic  coverage  with the greatest  
area of Green Belt of any Local Planning Authority, is also the most sparsely  
populated in England with only 63 people per square kilometre. Home to around  
316,000  people,  Northumberland  remains  mostly  rural,  with its largest  settlements  
having  no more  than 40,000  residents.  It is nonetheless  diverse  and different  parts of 
the County have distinct characteristics, functions and needs contrasting from  urban  
to rural,  coastal  to upland  and well connected  to remote.  
 
2.3 The south -east of the County  is the most  densely  populated,  with the three  largest  
towns,  Blyth,  Cramlington  and Ashington.  These  act as main  employment  centres,  
drawing  from a wider  area than just south -east Northumberland.  They  also provid e a 
significant  range  of services  in their respective  centres  and offer assets  such  as 
Northumberland College and large scale leisure facilities that have a wider reach.  
Beyond  the south -east,  the County's  main  settlements  are located  along  the Tyne  
Valley corridor, and on a north -south axis across the lowland coastal strip; both  areas  
incorporate  main  roads  and rail lines.  Morpeth,  Hexham,  Prudhoe,  Berwick -upon -
Tweed  and Alnwick  are the main  market  towns,  all of which  have significant  rural 
hinterlands.  The predominantly  rural areas  of the County  are interspersed with 
smaller towns, some with their own hinterlands, as well as  numerous  villages,  hamlets  
and isolated  farmsteads.  
 
2.4 Areas  in the south  of the County  have  the strongest  relationship  with the Tyne  and 
Wear  conurbation.  Tyneside  attracts  people  from Northumberland,  who reach  into the 
area for work,  education,  cultural  activity  and shopping.  To a lesser  extent  areas in the 
north and west of the County have relationships with the Scottish Borders,  Edinburgh  
and the Lothians  and Carlisle.  
 
2.5 Northumberland's rural villages are still closely linked to agriculture, which is the  
lifeblood  of much  of the County.  Many  have  been  sustained  by tourism,  althoug h the 
needs  of this industry  have  created  development  pressures.  Part of their 
attractiveness  is the organic way in which they have grown within their landscape  
settings.  The forestry  sector  is very important  to the economy  of the North  of Englan d and 
Northumberland, which has a very large timber industry from harvesting to  
production. Kielder For est, for example, is the largest man made forest in Europ e and 
the largest  working  forest  in England.  
 
Natural,  historic  and built  environment  
 
2.6 Northumberland's environment is distinctive in terms of its natural beauty and  historic 
significance. The sweeping landscapes and seascapes, important wildli fe  habitats,  
iconic  landmarks  and characteristic  towns  and villages  are hugely  valued,   not just by 
local inhabitants, but also by the many visitors from across the region  and beyond.  2. Spatial  Portrait   
10  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2.7 Superimposed  on Northumberland's  internationally  recognised  natural  assets  is a  rich 
cultural heritage - a legacy of archaeological sites and structures and histori c  
buildings, settlements and landscapes. The relatively undeveloped n ature of the  
County has allowed often exceptional levels of preservation for some parts of the  
historic  environment.  
 
2.8 There  are numerous  designated  areas  and sites,  many  of which  are recognised  
internationally  and nationally,  for their nature  conservation,  geological,  landscape   or 
heritage  value.  Most  notable  are: 
• Northumberland National Park (a separate local planning authority area);  
• Northumberland Coast and North Pennines Areas of Outstanding Natural   Beauty  
(AONB);  
• Historic landscapes, reflective of past forms of habitation and cultivation;  
• Areas of international biodiversity and geo -diversity importance, mostly  
concentrated  along  the coast  and in more  remote  upland  areas;  
• 9 National Nature Reserves, and more than 100 Sites o f Special Scientific 
Interest;  
• Over 200  Local  Wildlife  and Geological  Sites; and  
• 23 Local Nature Reserves;  
• 3 Marine Conservation Zones;  
• Kielder  Water  and Forest  Park;  
• Frontiers  of the Roman  Empire:  Hadrian’s  Wall World  Heritage  Site (WHS);  
• Northumberland  International  Dark  Sky Park;  
• Northumberlandia  human  landform  sculpture;  
• Several Registered Historic Parks and Gardens surrounding some of th e 
County's  castles  and stately  homes;  
• Numerous  Registered  Battlefields;  
• 70 Conservation Areas marking out historic villages, town centres and other  
unique  built environments;  
• Well over 5 ,000 nationally Listed Buildings and Structures - approaching half  of 
all those in the North -East - including many of great significance, including  
Norman  castles,  country  houses,  fortified  farmhouses,  and buildings  associate d with 
the County's diverse economic, social, religious and cultural legacy; and  
• Around a thousand Scheduled Monuments, (approximately half of which are  
within  the boundary  of the National  Park).  
 
2.9 There are also highly important assets that are less easy to attribute to an exact  
location,  such  as some  of the protected  species.  The County's  many  environmental 
assets  do not all receive  statutory  protection.  It is important  to consider  the County's 
biodiversity, historic environment and ecosystems as a whole in terms of the threats 
that they face and the opportunities they present. Many natural and built assets are 
vulnerable to development and human activity and some heritage assets remain 'at 
risk'; all of these need careful protection, enhancement and/or management, including 
through planning decisions. Northumberland's natural, historic and built environment 
presents many opportunities to raise people’s awareness and understanding of, and  
attachment to, their environment. This ranges from outdoor learning for children and 
young people through communities being empowered to protect the environments that 
are important to them to tourists and day visitors appreciating Northumberland's 2. Spatial  Portrait

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  unique assets. The natural environment also plays a role in making a positive 
contribution to the health of the population.  
 
Economy  and employment  
 
2.10 Northumberland makes a major contribution to regional and national prosperity. It   is 
home  to major  globally  competitive  and connected  companies,  niche  producers   and 
providers of excellent products and services. Northumberland is at the heart  of the 
northern  economy,  sitting  between  the competitive  city economies  of Newcastle  and 
Edinburgh,  with good  links to national  and international  markets  via  Newcastle  Airport,  
the strategic  road and rail network  and the Port of Blyth  and the  region's  other  sea 
ports.  There  is increasingly  good  digital  connectivity,  which  includes  rural parts  of the 
County.  
 
2.11 The Northumberland  economy  has grown  steadily  in recent  years.  However,  Gross  
Value Added (GVA), which is an economic measure of the value of goods and  
services  in an area,  is lower  than both the North  East Local  Enterprise  Partnership  
(NELEP)  area and national  rate of growth.  This can be explained  by low productivity  
which  points  to the need  to improve  the quality  of jobs and skills  in Northumberland , and 
attract  new business  in higher  value  sectors.  
 
2.12 The structure  of the County's  economy  has undergone  substantial  change  over the  
past 30 years. There has been a downsizing of the agricultural workforce and th e 
complete departure of deep coal mining. The economy now has a broader base  
which incorporates manufacturing and cer tain service sectors. There is particul ar 
reliance  on the public  sector  although  as elsewhere,  this sector  has been  reducing.  
Significantly there has been a decline in manufacturing employment, including  some 
of the newer sectors that replaced mining and h eavy industry, reflecting  national  
trends.  Unlike  past periods  of change,  there  has not been  a parallel  growth  in high value 
service sector employment although there is potential for strong  growth.  
 
2.13 Northumberland  has relatively  healthy  levels  of economic  activity  and employment   
with both being  greater  than the regional  rate, (although  slightly  below  the national  
rate) in 2017.  The Northumberland  unemployment  rate in 2017  was also lower  than  the 
regional  average,  at 5.0%  and this has continued  to fall. 
 
2.14 However, these levels vary significantly across the County. The Plan therefore  needs 
to support a quantitative increase in the number of jobs in the County, in  order to 
provide suitable job opportunities for people to move into employment,  alongside 
support for skills initiatives to enable the County's current labour force  to meet the 
requirements of b usinesses. The spatial distribution of areas of high  unemployment 
and economic inactivity shows that the issues are most acute in  the south -east, 
pointing to the need to provide opportunities accessible to this  population.  However,  
those  living  in more  peripheral  rural parts  of the County  can struggle  to access  
employment  and training  opportunities  due to the cost and infrequency  of public  
transport.  
 
  2. Spatial  Portrait   
12  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2.15 There  are a number  of key positive  features  of the Northumberland  economy:  
• Small businesses dominate the economy with 89% of enterprises employin g 
fewer  than ten people  in 2017;  
• Many small businesses are leading edge in their sectors and are a vital part   of 
the economy;  
• A number  of the larger  companies  are high tech and operate  globally;  
• New business start -ups are generally resilient, with failure rates below the  
regional  and national  average;  and 
• Although  the number  of new business  ventures  established  is proportionately 
lower  than elsewhere  in the UK, in certain  settlements,  such  as Hexham, 
Morpeth,  and Ponteland,  it has been  relatively  healthy.  
 
2.16 In contrast, the number of large firms is comparatively low, with only 0.2% of the  total 
number of businesses employing over 250 people in 2017, compared to an  average 
of 0.4% across North East England. The wider benefits large firms bring  such as 
supply  chain  growth and skills development are desirable and it is important therefore  
that Northumberland  is as flexible  as possible  to accommodate  major  inward 
investment and the growth of indigenous businesses.  
 
2.17 Northumberland's economy is intrinsically linked  to the economies  of neighbouring  
areas, Tyneside in particular. The 2011 Census showed a net outflow of commuters 
from Northumberland of over 23,000 people – mostly between Northumberland  and 
Tyneside.  
 
2.18 Northumberland is operating in a global market and has been successful in focussing 
on sectors  in which  it has competitive  advantage.  The County's  economy  has core 
strengths and opportunities in key sectors such as energy, low carbon industries,  
certain manufacturing and process industries such as pharmaceuticals and  
engineering, ports, an d tourism. Expansion of production and research and  
development operations within these sectors has the potential to offer higher  value,  
knowledge  based  jobs to Northumberland  residents,  commuters  and in-migrants.  
 
2.19 The growth of high quality service jobs c an be strongly influenced by lifestyle factors, 
given the ability  to attract  highly  skilled  workers.  Improving  telecommunications  will 
allow for remote operation of such businesses. Northumberland's beautiful and  
historic  market  towns  and its attractive  rural landscapes  provide  key opportunities  to 
attract mobile, highly skilled migrants likely to bring or establish such businesses, and 
to be a focus for business start -ups in creative and knowledge based service  
industries. Continued improvemen t in the quality of telecommunications is vital to  
achieving  this. The County  offers  the scope  to attract  the higher  value  service  jobs,  
serving  wider  markets  and growth  in the service  sector  is forecast  to be strong  whilst 
there are key opportunities for certain creative and tourist related industries.  
 
2.20 However, the geography of Northumberland means that the locations where sites  
and infrastructure are available, are not always where businesses want to locate,  and 
in particular  where  the site characteristics  complement  growth  sectors;  but the 
County  offers  significant  opportunity  to improve  on this position.  2. Spatial  Portrait   
13 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Education  and skills  
 
2.21 The Northumberland labour market in terms of educational attainment, skills,  
earnings,  and forms  of employment  is geographically  and socio -economically  split. In 
2017 the average weekly earnings of Northumberland residents in full time  
employment  was 8.6%  higher  than the average  weekly  earnings  of people  working  in 
full-time Northumberland  based  jobs.  Looking  at average  hourly  earnings  (excluding 
overtime) the differential is nearer 11%. This illustrates the fact that the County's 
higher earning and more skilled residents commute out of the County for work.  
 
2.22 Northumb erland's residents achieve higher qualifications than the North East 
average,  but this is still low when  compared  to the national  figure.  This,  combined  
with the lack of appropriate  training,  could  limit the County's  ability  to grow  and 
diversify in relation to the national economy1. However, the proportion of residents 
with no qualifications is lower than both the regional and national average.  
 
2.23 In terms of school level attainment there has been a steady increase in the  
percentage of young people in  Northumberland attaining 5 or more GCSEs (at A*  to 
C or an equivalent) – reaching 77% of those aged 16 to 64 years old by 2017,  
compared to 73% in North East England. Attainment of 2 or more A levels (or  
equivalent) by young people aged 19 in Northumberla nd has also increased steadily 
since  2005.  By 2017  54% of those  aged  16 to 64 years  old had this level of 
qualification, compared to a North East England figure of 52 % 2. 
 
2.24 Turning  to Higher  Education,  looking  at the adult  population  as a whole,  (aged  16 to 
64) 35% have one or more high level qualifications3 in 2017 – higher than the regional 
average, but lower than the national average. However, there are geographical 
variations within the County: there is evidence that the proportion of young people in 
the south -east entering higher education, equates to only half the proportion doing so 
from the rest of the County. The North East of England's universities were by far the 
most popular destinations for undergraduate and postgraduate students, aiding the 
likelihood of retaining local graduates. As  Northumberland does not have a university 
many people in the 15 to 24 age group leave the County, predominantly for further 
and higher education and do not return at the same rate. However, Northumberland 
College, which is the largest training provider in the County, has made and continues 
to make significant investments  in upgrading facilities, and has a strong reputation.  
  
 
1  This is reaffirmed  through  the Economic  Land  Review  (ELR)  business  survey,  where  20% of respondent s stated  
that skills  shortages  were  an obstacle  to growth.

3  A higher level qualificatio n means a Degree (for example BA, BSc), Higher Degree (for example MA,  PhD,  
PGCE),  NVQ  Level  4-5, HNC,  HND,  RSA Higher  Diploma,  BTEC  Higher  level,  Foundation  degre e  (NI) or 
professional  qualifications  (for example  teaching,  nursing,  accountancy) . 2. Spatial  Portrait   
14  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Population  of Northumberland  
 
2.25 The population of Northumberland is ageing and the significance of this demographic 
change  makes  it a major  policy  issue  for the prosperity  and resilience  of 
Northumberland Communities: Between 2016 and 2036 there is projected to be a 
significant increase i n those over 65 (by almost half), with those over 80 years of age 
doubling in number. Conversely, the core working age population of 20 to 6 4 year 
olds is projected to decrease by over 12%.  
 
2.26 Due to these  demographic  patterns  and the Office  for National  Statistics  forecasts  it 
is predicted that without positive policy intervention the County's population will  
increase by only 1.8%. By contrast, the UK population is projected to increase by  
5.5%  in just the first ten years  of this period.  
 
2.27 If this does  occur,  projections  show  that it would  result  in a significant  reduction  in 
working age population and a subsequent reduction in the number of working people 
in Northumberland.  As a result,  there  could  be a consequent  reduction  in the ability  of 
Northumberland  to provide  a labour  force  to existing  or potential  employers  who want  
to locate  in the County.  Whilst  older  people,  particularly  those  retiring  to 
Northumberland, have the potential to bring spending power with them to support the 
local economy, an ageing population profile will place a steadily increasing strain on 
already stretched healthcare services. This coupled with a reduction in the working 
age population has significant potential to impact on the future sustainability and 
resilie nce of Northumberland’s communities. The projected make -up of the 
population, without policy intervention, forms probably the most important aspect of 
the context of this Local Plan.  
 
Housing  
 
2.28 Currently there are approximately 152,000 dwellings across Nort humberland. Many 
of these  are in the larger  settlements  in the south -east,  together  with market  towns  
across the County. However, there are also a significant number of dwellings in  
smaller villages and hamlets. While the majority of dwellings meet the Government's 
Decent Homes Standard, including all Council owned stock, maintaining and  
enhancing the quality of the existing stock remains a challenge, with much of it in  
private  owner ship.  Given  the rural nature  of the County,  some  communities  are not 
connected to the gas network, and rely on oil or electricity  to heat their homes. Many 
rural homes are also more difficult to insulate, as a result of their age and type, 
adding to the  cost of maintaining  a home  in these  areas.  
 
2.29 In addition to improving the existing stock, a key challenge is to ensure that ther e are 
sufficient homes, of the right type,  of a high quality,  in the right locations  to meet  the 
needs  of Northumberland's  current  and future  population.  The provision  of new 
homes not only will meet a need but also free up and allow better use of existing  
properties  as people  find accommodation  better  suited  to their needs.  
 
2.30 Given the size, and diverse nature  of Northumberland different housing issues are 
apparent across the County. While housing delivery has been strong in recent years, 
there are parts of the County where few dwellings have been built. While homes that 
have been built have met the needs of so me people, the availability and affordability 2. Spatial  Portrait   
15 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  of housing, to buy or to rent is a significant problem in parts of the County, and given 
the demographic profile of Northumberland, ensuring there are homes to meet the 
needs of older people now, and in the fut ure remains a challenge.  
 
Health  
 
2.31 Northumberland presents a mixed picture in terms of the health of its citizens and  
consequent health and social care needs. Both men and women in the County  have  
a higher  healthy  life expectancy  than in the North  East LEP area,  (only  slightly  lower 
than the England average). However, the ageing population and its dispersed nature, 
mean that calls on adult social care are greater than for more urban parts  of North 
East England. There are hotspots of deprivation in older households in  the south -
east of the County and, here, life expectancy is lower than in the rest of  
Northumberland.  
 
2.32 Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has invested significantly to enhance 
healthcare provision across Northumberland and in North Ty neside. This investment 
includes a new Specialist Emergency Care Hospital (SECH) at Cramlington to  serve  
Northumberland  and North  Tyneside  that opened  in 2015;  improving  and refurbishing 
Hexham and Wansbeck General Hospitals, and replacing Haltwhistle Memo rial 
Hospital with a new purpose -built facility to form an integrated health and social care 
scheme. In Berwick -upon -Tweed, the NHS Northumberland Clinical  Commissioning 
Group (CCG) is currently working with partners at Northumbria Health Care Trust and 
Northumberland County Council to consider alternative healthcare arrangements.  
 
2.33 Despite  these  improvements  in facilities  around  the County  and the presence  of a 
range of more local healthcare facilities in other towns and villages, access to  
healthcare  remains  a challenging  issue,  especially  in deprived  and more  remote  rural 
communities.  
 
Transport  and infrastructure  
 
2.34 Northumberland is served by both strategic roads and railways. The main transport  
links are shown in Figure 2.1. It is crossed north to south by the A1 strategic road  and 
East Coast Mainline railway, and east to west by the A69 strategic road and  
Newcastle to Carlisle rail line.  The Tyne Valley rail line also connects with the  
transport interchange at Carlisle Station and from the re, north -south. The A69  and 
the Tyne Valley rail line also connect the area with the Tyneside conurbation  and its 
links north -south.  Newcastle  International  Airport  is located  on the southern  edge  of 
the County.  Carlisle  Airport  lies to the west of the County  and is scheduled  to 
commence commercial passenger services from Spring 2019, which will serve  to 
widen  the air passenger  offer available  within  the Borderlands  area.  
 
2.35 As the most sparsely populated county in England, Northumberland faces  challenges 
of connecting remote rural communities, and sometimes, unavoidable  reliance upon 
car based travel. Northumberland is interdependent with neighbouring areas, 
including the city regional economies of both Tyne and Wear and Edinburgh. These 
factors present sp ecific issues for ensuring the mobility of knowledge, people, goods  
and services.  
 2. Spatial  Portrait   
16  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2.36 Commuting is a major consideration in the County.  The daily outflow  of commuters  
from Northumberland to Newcastle has increased steadily. There is a two -way flow, 
but out-commuting,  mostly  to Newcastle,  North  Tyneside  and Gateshead,  exceeds  in 
commuting  by a ratio of 2:1. This places  pressure  on transport  infrastructure  including 
roads and public transport. The latest information demonstrates that the net outflow is  
falling: it has decreased by 19% between 2001 to 2011, as more workers commute 
into Northumberland, and effective connections across boundaries will remain crucial 
to the C ounty's success.  
  
Minerals,  waste  and energy  
 
2.37 Northumberland is rich in a number of mineral deposits. Where they are or may  
become  of potential  economic  interest  as a basis  for the extraction  of a commodity  
then they can be considered as a mineral resource. The minerals currently extracted 
in Northumberland include Carboniferous limestone, clay (including brick clay, brick 
shale and fireclay), coal, igneous rock, sandstone and sand and gravel. These  
provide  the materials  necessary  to support  the infrastructure,  buildings,  goods  and 
energy  that both society  and the economy  needs.  
 
2.38 Households, businesses and other institutions produce a range of wastes. Wider  
policy seeks to minimise the amount of waste generated and where waste is  
generated  manage  it as a resource  rather  than disposing  it. This has meant  a move  
away  from landfill  as a method  of managing  waste  to more  sustainable  waste  
management practices. Northumberland has a network of facilities to manage  
materials collected for recycling, re -use and other recovery but opportunities exist for 
new or enhanced facilities to further improve resource recovery.  
 
2.39 Renewable and low carbon energy is currently generated from a number of sources  
in Northumberland. Sources include anaerobic digestion, biomass, heat pumps,  
hydro, onshore wind and solar photovoltaics. Northumberland's potential to provide 
renewable and low carbon energy from these sources must be balanced against  
landscape,  heritage  and local amenity  considerations.  
 
Delivery  Areas  
 
2.40 Northumberland  is large  and diverse  and different  parts  of the County  have  distinct  
characteristics,  functions  and needs.  The Delivery  Areas  are shown  in Figure  2.1. 
 
2.41 The four Delivery  Areas:  
• Are defined in terms of their social, economic, and cultural characteristics;  
• Take  account  of the roles  and relationship  between  towns  and villages  across  
Northumberland;  and 
• Take  account  of the interaction  of places  with adjoining  areas,  particularly  
Tyneside  and Scotland.

2. Spatial  Portrait   
18  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2.42 Defining  Delivery  Areas  has helped  the Council  to: 
• Better  distribute,  and in future  to monitor,  the delivery  of development  according   to 
local needs;  
• Define  the scale  and function  of individual  Main  Towns  and Service  Centres'  
capacity  to accommodate  additional  development;  and 
• Explain  the functional  relationships  between  settlements  and connections  with  
their hinterlands.  
 
2.43 However,  a countywide  policy  approach  remains  appropriate  in some  instances.  
 
2.44 The remainder  of this section  provides  some  context  to each  of the areas  of 
Northumberland.  
 
 
South  East  Northumberland  Delivery  Area  
 
2.45 The South  East Northumberland  Delivery  Area  extends  inland  from the coast,  from 
its southern  boundary  with North  Tyneside  and Newcastle  upon  Tyne,  to Amble  in 
the north.  The Area  includes:  
• The Main  Towns  of Amble,  Ashington,  Bedlington,  Blyth  and Cramlington;  
• The Service  Centres  of Guidepost/Stakeford/Choppington, Newbiggin -by-the-Sea 
and Seaton  Delaval/Holywell;  and 
• Some  other  sizeable  villages  including  Ellington,  Lynemouth,  Hadston/South  
Broomhill/Red  Row,  New Hartley,  Seaton  Sluice/Old  Hartley,  Seghill  and 
Widdrington  Station,  as well as numerous  smaller  villages.  
 
2.46 The Green Belt extends across parts of the area to prevent coalescence with the  
Tyneside conurbation to the south. There are important green infrastructure links  
along  the coast,  many  of which  are protected  by nature  conservation  designations.  
The landscape of the area was historically dominated by coal mining. While  
examples of this mining heritage are retained, notably at Woodhorn, the majority  of 
mining sites in the area have now been restored and provide imp ortant ecological 
and recreational resources. Surface coal mining is still present and makes a valuable 
contribution  to the local economy.  There  is one coal producing  site at Shotton,  which 
overlaps into the Central Delivery Area. A further site, at Ferney beds near 
Widdrington Station, has been granted planning permission but has yet to 
commence. Potland Burn and Butterwell are currently being restored and former 
workings at Steadsburn and Stobswood are now largely restored . 
 
Population  
 
2.47 The South East Deli very Area is the most densely populated part of Northumberland 
at 737 people per square kilometre, with 163,239 people in 71,630 households. 
While the population is ageing, the proportion aged over 65 (17.6%) is smaller than in 
the other Delivery Areas and  it has the largest proportion of younger residents aged 
up to 15 years (17.9%)4.

19 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Roles  of the Main  Towns  and Service  Centres  
 
2.48 Amble, Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth and Cramlington provide the largest  
concentrations  of housing,  employment,  retailing  and services  within  the area.  
 
2.49 Amble  is a key centre  in the northern  part of the Delivery  Area.  It is 
Northumberland's most important fishing centre and has an important tourism role as 
a result of its location at the southern approach to the Nor thumberland Coast AONB 
and the establishment of a marina. It has a small catchment area that stretches 
across into the North Delivery Area, taking in villages such as Warkworth.  
 
2.50 Ashington  was once  a centre  of the coal mining  industry.  The town  now plays  an 
important strategic employment role in the County and includes the strategically  
important Ashwood Business Park. Northumberland College and Wansbeck Hospital 
are also located  in the town.  
 
2.51 Bedlington , together with the linked settlement of Bedlin gton Station provides  
housing for those working in the neighbouring towns and commuting to Tyneside.  
Given the close proximity of larger towns, services provided predominantly serve  the 
local market,  however  the redevelopment  of the town  centre  will streng then the role 
of the town.  
 
2.52 Blyth  has a strategically important employment function. There is significant  
economic growth potential around the Blyth Estuary, which includes sites with  
Enterprise Zone status. Opportunities exist that build on existing assets including  the 
national Offshore Renewables Catapult, and the Port of Blyth which is a sizeable 
commercial port with a deep -water harbour and warehousing facilities. Specific  
sectors  being  targeted  include  offshore  oil and gas, renewables  and advanced  
manufacturing. The town is on the edge of the Green Belt which lies to its south.  
 
2.53 Cramlington  has a sub -regional role as a centre for industry and houses the largest 
concentration of manufacturing businesses in Northumberland, including a clust er of 
pharmaceuticals companies. It is a prime location for inward investment because of 
the quality of its environment and road network. The redevelopment of the town 
centre, including a cinema, and a new specialist emergency care hospital to the east 
of Cramlington has strengthened the role of the town. The town is on the edge of the 
Green Belt which lies to its south and west.  
2.54 The Service Centres of Guidepost/Stakeford/Choppington,  Newbiggin -by-the-Sea 
and Seaton Delaval/Holywell provide important servic es for both residents and 
communities within neighbouring areas. Given the close proximity of the larger towns, 
the sphere of influence of these settlements is limited. Other smaller settlements 
within the area also provide local services to their resident  communities. Seaton 
Delaval/Holywell, New Hartley, Seghill, and Seaton Sluice/Old Hartley are 
surrounded by Green Belt.  
  2. Spatial  Portrait   
20  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Housing  – development  pressure  and delivery  
 
2.55 The south east of the County had experienced consistent under delivery of housing 
in recent  years  compared  to the housing  allocations  in existing  Local  Plans.  Some  
large housing sites have stalled and sites on previously developed land have proven 
unviable, as a resu lt of the recession. However, since 2014/15 housing completions 
have increased significantly. The close proximity, and good road links, mean that  the 
South East housing market area is closely  linked  with the Tyneside  conurbation  to 
the south.  
 
Transport  
 
2.56 The key transport characteristics and attributes in the South East Delivery Area are:  
• The A189/A19 corridor provides important sub -regional road links to Tyneside for 
jobs, learning, shopping and leisure;  
• There are some issues with localised traffic congestion in Blyth and at key 
highway junctions, such as Moor Farm roundabout, at peak times;  
• Cramlington benefits from passenger services on the East Coast Main Line;  
• There is a Northern Rail service which calls at Widdrington Station Monday to 
Saturday and links to stations such as Alnmouth and Chathill in North 
Northumberland and south and west to Newcastle and to the Metrocentre (on the 
Carlisle line);  
• There are opportunities from the proposed reintroduction of passenger rail 
services to the Northumber land Line (formerly referred to as the Ashington, Blyth 
and Tyne Line).  
 
Employment  
 
2.57 This area faces  particular  challenges;  social  and environmental  deprivation  arising  
from unemployment  and poverty  continue  to frustrate  the ability  of communities  to 
emerg e from the post-industrial,  coal mining  legacy  into sustained  and sustainable  
growth.  The recent  closures  of the RioTinto  Alcan  smelter  at Lynemouth,  and 
Northumberland Foods in Amble have also had an impact upon the communities and 
supply chains locally. However the area has been successful in attracting  inward 
investment, most recently the establishment of a high -tech paint manufacturing plant 
at Ashington.  
 
2.58 Key opportunities  for future  economic  growth:  
• Blyth estuary area - is being actively prom oted to the renewable and low carbon 
energy,  advanced  manufacturing  and offshore  sectors;  
• Cramlington continues to be recognised as a prime location for inward   
investment  due to the quality  of its environment  and road network;  
• Development of the visitor economy through major attractors, key example s 
being the continued development of harbour -related attractions at Amble, a  
leisure destination based around the former Stobswood, Maidens Hall and  
Steadsburn  surface  coal mining  sites in the northern  part of the Area;  the 
Woodhorn  Museum  near Ashington;  and Seaton  Delaval  Hall, now a National  
Trust  property  in the south  of the area.  2. Spatial  Portrait   
21 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Relationship  with other  areas  
 
2.59 The close  proximity,  and good  road links,  mean  that the Delivery  Area  is closely  
linked  with the Tyneside  conurbation  to the south.  While  links are not so strong  with 
the wider Central and North Northumberland Delivery Areas, the market towns of 
Morpeth and Alnwick both provide employment and housing opportunities and also 
provide a wo rkforce for major employers in Cramlington and Blyth. These links have 
been strengthened with the opening of the Morpeth Northern bypass. The town of 
Amble, on the northern edge of the Delivery Area, has strong links with Alnwick and 
intervening villages, such as Warkworth, which lie in the North  Northumberland 
Delivery Area.  
 
 
Central  Northumberland  Delivery  Area  
 
2.60 Central  Northumberland  Delivery  Area  extends  north  and west from the boundary  
with Tyne  and Wear.  The area includes:  
• The Main  Towns  of Hexham,  Morpeth,  Ponteland  and Prudhoe;  
• The Service  Centre  of Corbridge;  and 
• Numerous villages of varying sizes and functions, including some sizeable  
commuter villages, such as Stocksfield and Stannington, as well as many  smaller  
rural settlements.  
 
2.61 Much of the area is covered by Green Belt to protect the countryside from  
encroachment  from the Tyne  and Wear  conurbation.  The south -west of the area 
includes  part of the North  Pennines  AONB.  
 
Population  
 
2.62 The population density in the Central Delivery Area is 83 per square kilometre, with 
78,976 people in 33,713 households. The proportion of the population aged over 65 
is relatively high, compared to the county as a whole, at 22.1%, as is the proportion 
aged up to 15 years at 16.8%  5. 
 
Roles  of the main  towns  and service  centres  
 
2.63 Morpeth, Hexham, Ponteland and Prudhoe are the key hubs for housing,  
employment,  retailing  and services.  
 
2.64 Morpeth  is a historic  market  town,  serving  a wide rural hinterland  that extends  into 
the North Northumberland Delivery Area. It has a commuter housing role due to  good  
transport  links and the close  proximity  of the Tyneside  conurbation,  although  
significant  numbers  also work  and use services  within  Morpeth.  It also has a strong  
relationship with the South East of the County, particularly Cramlington. This has  
been strengthened through the construction of the Morpeth Northern bypass, which  
will facilitate  development  to the north of the town  and remove  some  through  traffic  
from the ancient  market  town  centre.  
 
5  Northumberland  Knowledge  2011  Census  Fact Sheet  - Central  Delivery  Area . 2. Spatial  Portrait   
22  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2.65 Hexham  is a historic market town in the Tyne Valley. It serves a wide rural hinterland 
that extends into both the North Northumberland and West Northumberland Delivery 
Areas.  It has a longstanding  local employment,  housing  and service  centre  role with 
good transport links to the Tyneside conurbation and into Cumbria. Its auction mart is 
regionally and nationally significant. The town serves as a gateway to the 
Northumberland National Park and to the Hadrian’s Wall He ritage Site. It has an  
important commuter housing role for Tyneside. Future growth of the town is 
constrained by the Green Belt.  
 
2.66 Ponteland  is a town that provides services to a wider rural area, although not to  the 
same extent as Morpeth and Hexham. Ponte land looks to Newcastle upon Tyne for 
its main  employment,  retailing  and services  and provides  an executive  housing  offer 
for those  commuting  to Tyneside  and the wider  region.  While  the vacating  of the 
Police Headquarters complex has provided some expansio n opportunity on  
brownfield  land,  the settlement's  further  growth  is constrained  by the Green  Belt. 
 
2.67 Prudhoe  is located on a hillside, overlooking the Tyne Valley, close to the Tyneside 
conurbation. Within the influence of Tyneside, it has a commuter housing role but  
also has a longstanding  local employment,  housing  and service  centre  role. Future  
growth  of the town  is constrained  by the Green  Belt. 
 
2.68 Corbridge  is a village of great historic and architectural significance. It has a  
commuter housing role but also is an important service centre, which provides  
services  to a wider  rural area.  It looks  to Hexham  for its higher  services.  The village  is 
surrounded  by the Green  Belt. 
 
2.69 Other smaller settlements within the area also provide local services to their resident 
communities,  many  of which  are surrounded  by or located  in the Green  Belt. 
 
Housing  – development  pressure  and past delivery  
 
2.70 Much of the central area of the County is covered by Green Belt; this has sought  to 
protect the countryside from encroachment  from the Tyne  and Wear  conurbation  and 
maintain  the separation  of settlements.  This area has some  of the highest levels of 
development pressure within Northumberland, largely due to the ease of commuting 
into Tyneside. House prices are high, resulting in affordability pressures across the 
area. Past planning policies, including the former Regional Spat ial Strategy, have 
constrained development across the central area, through Green Belt designations, 
low housing targets and policies to restrict development in the countryside. In the 
former Castle Morpeth area, despite Morpeth and Ponteland being identif ied as the 
focus for new housing development in the Castle Morpeth Local Plan, in accordance 
with regional planning policy at that time, the majority of housing development prior to 
2016 took place in the Morpeth hinterland and former coalfield areas and n ot the 
main settlements.  
 
Transport  
 
2.71 The area is crossed  by the A1 and East Coast  Main  Line (ECML)  corridor,  and the 
A69 and Newcastle to Carlisle rail line. These routes link with north -south routes  on 
the east and west coasts  respectively,  as well as further  west to the port of Cairnryan. 2. Spatial  Portrait   
23 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  While Hexham, Prudhoe and Corbridge and other villages are served by regular train 
services on the Tyne Valley Line, with good links to Tyneside, only Morpeth benefits 
from relatively regular services to Tyneside on t he ECML. The Main Towns and 
Service Centres, and settlements along the main transport corridors are well served 
by buses while, in the wider rural hinterlands, services are less frequent. Newcastle 
International Airport is located on the southern edge of t he Delivery Area.  
 
Employment  
 
2.72 Within the Delivery Area, many jobs are in the public sector, particularly within Local  
Government and health services. In the Tyne Valley, at Hexham and Prudhoe  wood  
processing  industries  are major  employers,  such  as Egger  and SCA.  The towns  of 
Hexham, Morpeth, Prudhoe and Ponteland contain successful industrial estates,  
many of which have limited land for new businesses. The area is increasingly a  focus 
for knowledge based and creative businesses. Much of the area enc ompasses 
productive agricultural land, while tourism makes a significant contribution to the  
economy  particularly  in the west.  
 
Relationship with other areas  
 
2.73 The Central Delivery Area has strong relationships with both urban and rural parts of 
Northumberl and: 
• The close proximity of the Main Towns and Service Centres to Tyneside means 
they have a strong relationship with the conurbation and they provide popular 
locations for commuters;  
• The influence of Hexham and Morpeth extends into the West and North 
Northumberland Delivery Areas respectively, with the towns providing employment 
and services for wide hinterlands;  
• Morpeth also has a strong relationship with Cramlington and the South East 
Northumberland Delivery Area, which has been further strengthened foll owing 
completion of the Morpeth Northern Bypass.  
 
 
North  Northumberland  Delivery  Area  
 
2.74 The North Northumberland Delivery Area is bounded to the north by the Scottish  
Border,  to the west by the Cheviot  Hills of the Northumberland  National  Park and to 
the south by the Simonside Hills and the Coquet Valley. The coast, which is  
designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty forms the eastern boundary.  The 
delivery  area includes:  
• The Main  Towns  of Alnwick  and Berwick -upon -Tweed;  
• The Service Centres of Belfor d, Rothbury, Seahouses  and Wooler; and  
• Numerous  villages  along  the coastal  strip including  large  villages  such  as 
Warkworth  and Longhoughton,  as well as settlements  lying further  inland.  
 
Population  
 
2.75 Much of the North Delivery Area is sparsely populated, with an overall density of 26.3 
people per square kilometre, and a population of 53,585 in 24,246 households. With 2. Spatial  Portrait

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  23.7% of its resident population aged over 65, it is the Delivery Area with the larges t 
proportion of older residents, and its proportion of younger residents, up to 15 years 
(15.4% of the population), is the smallest6. 
 
Roles  of main  towns  and service  centres  
 
2.76 The towns  of Berwick -upon -Tweed  and Alnwick  are the key locations  for housing,  
employment,  retailing  and services  within  the area.  
 
2.77 Berwick -upon -Tweed  is the northernmost market town in Northumberland, one  of 
England’s outstanding historic towns and a key hub between the conurbations  of 
Edinburgh and Tyneside. Its history and geography give the town a unique sense of 
place  and it is a popular  tourist  destination.  
 
2.78 Alnwick  is another of Northumberland’s  important  historic  market  towns,  providing  
services for a wide rural hinterland; th e centre is dominated by the 11th century  
castle.  Alnwick  Castle  and The Alnwick  Garden  are popular  tourist  attractions.  
 
2.79 Belford and Seahouses  provide a range of services to support the local  
communities  and the tourism  industry.  Seahouses  is a key hub for visitors  to the 
North  Northumberland  coast  and the Farne  Islands.  
 
2.80 Rothbury  is the largest settlement in western Coquetdale with its services supporting 
its resident population and those people who live in the more remote villages, 
including those in t he Northumberland National Park. The village acts as a gateway 
to the Park for visitors and has important relationships with Alnwick and Morpeth.   
 
2.81 Wooler  has an important  relationship  with both Berwick -upon -Tweed  and Alnwick  
and is a local hub for services  for its satellite  communities.  It is also a gateway  for 
visitors to the northern part of the National Park. It has a working mart and is also  the 
location for an important cluster of agricultural engineering and construction  
companies.  
 
2.82 Other smal ler settlements within the area also provide local services to their resident 
communities.  
 
Housing  – development  pressure  and past delivery  
 
2.83 Large  parts  of the north of the County  are subject  to high house  prices;  by contrast  
the area has the lowest average gross incomes across the County primarily because 
of a higher than average reliance on employment in the agriculture and tourism  
sectors.  Access  to affordable  housing,  particularly  within  the rented  sector,  is an 
issue acro ss the area. High house prices are a particularly acute problem in the 
Northumberland Coast AONB and its coastal villages, where there are especially 
high levels of second home and holiday accommodation. Development pressure in 
the AONB poses a threat to t he conservation of its natural beauty but the 
sustainability of local communities by providing housing and employment 
opportunities is also considered to be integral to its protection and enhancement.

25 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2.84 In terms of past housing delivery across the north of t he County, the town of  Berwick -
upon -Tweed  has under  provided  in recent  years  despite  an abundance  of housing  
sites with planning  permission.  Delivery  elsewhere  in the former  Berwick -upon -
Tweed Borough has exceeded past policy, particularly in the coastal zone. Delivery in 
Alnwick reflects the current planning policy but Rothbury has experienced higher 
levels of delivery.  
 
Transport  
 
2.85 The key transport characteristics and attributes in the North Delivery Area are:  
• The A1/East Coast road and rail corridor connects the Area with the Tyneside 
conurbation and Edinburgh, with the A697 providing an additional link between 
these locations; much of the A1 remains as single carriageway, although, in late 
2014, the Government announced proposals to dual par t of this (as far north as 
Ellingham);  
• The A698 provides a route south -west to Hawick, the A7 and, eventually, the M6 
and routes west to Cairnryan and Ireland;  
• Berwick -upon -Tweed is well served by the East Coast Main Line, while the 
station at Alnmouth (fo r Alnwick) provides more limited but important access to 
the strategic rail network;  
• There are limited bus services operating outside the A1 corridor, the 
Northumberland coastal route and the axes of the A697 and A698.  
 
Employment  
 
2.86 In the North Delivery Ar ea, employment is characterised by a mix of sectors in the 
larger centres and across the wide rural area:  
• The towns of Berwick -upon -Tweed and Alnwick have large industrial estates, 
with smaller estates in settlements such as Wooler, Rothbury and Belford;  
• The port of Berwick -upon -Tweed is important to the wider area; it is capable of 
handling larger freight vessels and is considered to have an important role in 
increasing exports and catering to the visitor industry;  
• There are a number of small harbours in the area, at Beadnell, Craster, Holy 
Island and Seahouses, which primarily support the local fishing industry. 
Seahouses provides access by boat for visitors to the Farne Islands, and this 
function is important to the visitor economy;  
• Tourism is an importa nt employment sector in coastal settlements, both year 
round and seasonal;  
• Further inland, there remains a reliance on the traditional rural industries but 
tourism is becoming increasingly important.  
 
Relationship with other areas  
 
2.87 The North Delivery Area has relationships with other areas both within the County, 
and north of the border with Scotland:  
• The Area is influenced by the Tyne and Wear conurbation in terms of travel to 
work, but not to the same extent as the Central and South East Areas;  
 2. Spatial  Portrait   
26  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • The north  of the Area, in particular Berwick -upon -Tweed, is influenced by the 
Edinburgh City -Region, which extends across the Scottish Borders and which is 
the focus of a strategic growth strategy. Proposals for expansion in the central 
Scottish Borders and the re -opening of the Waverley line could also have 
implications for the social and economic well -being of the north section of the 
Area;  
• There are strong links with the town of Amble in the South East Northumberland 
Delivery Area, especially from Alnwick and int ervening villages such as 
Warkworth.  
 
 
West  Northumberland  Delivery  Area  
 
2.88 The West  Northumberland  Delivery  Area  straddles  the southern  part of the 
Northumberland National Park. It includes the Kielder area to the north -west of the 
National Park, the North Tyne Valley, the South Tyne Valley and parts of the  
Hadrian’s Wall World Heritage Site and the North Pennines AONB. The Delivery 
Area includes:  
• The Main  Town  of Haltwhistle;  and 
• The Service  Centres  of Haydon  Bridge,  Allendale  and Bellingham;  and 
• Nume rous small settlements, which are scattered throughout the Deliver y  Area.  
 
Population  
 
2.89 The West Northumberland Delivery Area is the most sparsely populated in the 
County, with 11.2 people per square kilometre; it has the lowest population of the 
four area s with approximately 20,228 people in 8,945 households. The proportion of 
population aged up to 15 years is small at 15.5%, while 21.5% are aged 65 years or 
older7. 
 
Roles  of main  towns  and service  centres  
 
2.90 Haltwhistle  is the largest settlement in the Area; it is located in the South Tyne  
Valley.  It grew  as an industrial  town  when  the Newcastle  to Carlisle  railway  opened  in 
the 1830s.  It is a hub for housing,  employment,  retailing  and other  services,  and is 
one of the key gateways  to Hadrian’s  Wall.  Haltwhistle  has good  links with Hexham, 
Carlisle and Cumbria, and is served by the high school at Haydon Bridge.  
 
2.91 Bellingham  is the largest settlement in the North Tyne Valley and provides services 
to a wide rural hinterland. It grew as an agricultural market town during the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries. For a time the village had industries associated with 
surrounding coal and iron working and it was linked by railway to the rest of the North 
East, as well as Scotland. Bellingham act s as a gateway for people visiting the 
National Park and Kielder Water and Forest Park. It looks to Hexham for many higher 
level services. An increasing number of residents commute to Tyneside.  
 
 
 
7  Northumberland  Knowledge  2011  Census  Fact Sheet  - West  Delivery  Area . 2. Spatial  Portrait   
27 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  2.92 Allendale  is located within the North Pennines AONB in the E ast Allen Valley. Its  
main role is as a local centre for housing and services, supporting the agricultural  
sector  and tourism.  The village  is within  commuting  distance  of Tyneside.  
 
2.93 Haydon Bridge  is located in the South Tyne Valley, west of Hexham. While it is  
within  the commuting  influence  of Tyneside,  its main  role is as a local housing  and 
service  centre  for its immediate  surroundings.  The main  high school  in the south-west 
of the County is located in Haydon Bridge.  
 
2.94 Other smaller settlements with in the area also provide local services to their resident 
communities.  
 
Housing  – development  pressure  and delivery  
 
2.95 Development across the west of the County generally serves local markets and  
pressure for development is relatively low. However, the reaction to historic  
development pressure in the extreme south -east of the area is reflected in Green  Belt 
designation.  The housing  delivery  strategy  of adopted  planning  policy  sought  to 
stabilise the population in this area. This has largely been achieved  with the  
exception  of Haltwhistle  which  has seen  an unintended  decrease.  
 
Transport  
 
2.96 The east-west Tyne  Gap corridor  runs through  the area,  with the Tyne  Valley  rail line, 
relatively  frequent  bus services  and the A69 Trunk  Road  connecting  the settlements 
of Haltwhistle, Haydon Bridge and Bardon Mill with Hexham. The route also provides 
links to Carlisle and, from there, north -south, as well as west to the port of Cairnryan. 
The route also connects the area with the Tyneside conurbation and its links north -
south. Within the Delivery Area, the North Tyne Valley and, to the south, the Allen 
Valleys and the upstream part of the South Tyne are more poorly connected by road 
or public transport.  
 
Economy  
 
2.97 The economy of the area is dominated by agriculture, forestry and tourism. Although 
the area has a high percentage of people of working age (63%), the population i s 
ageing.  
 
Relationship with other areas  
 
2.98 The West Delivery Area has strong relationships wit h other areas both within 
Northumberland, and beyond the County boundary:  
• There are strong social, economic and cultural relationships with Hexham in the 
Central Northumberland Delivery Area, with residents looking to the town for key 
services;  
• The eastern  part of the Delivery Area is on the periphery of the main Tyneside 
commuter zone;  
• Links with Carlisle and Cumbria are stronger here than elsewhere in the County.  
 2. Spatial  Portrait

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Key issues  
 
2.99 The spatial portrait identifies a number of key issues which the plan proposes to  
address.  These  include  the need  to: 
• Improve the quality of jobs and skills to attract new businesses in high valu e 
sectors, improve economic activity in the south of the county and improve  access  
to jobs in rural areas;  
• Attempt  to stem  the decline  in the age of the working  age population  to prevent   a 
consequential  reduction  in the ability  to provide  a labour  force  to existing  or 
potential employers who want to locate in the County, reduce the increasing  
strain on already stretched healthcare services, and enhance the future  
sustainability  and resilience  of Northumberland’s  communities;  
• Provide  a mix of quality  well designed  housing,  in the right places,  to meet  the  
diverse needs of current and future population, including homes which are  
affordable, and which meet the needs of an increasingly ageing population;  
• Ensure that there is good and equitable access to good health care facilities , and 
that new development  enables  people  to live healthier  lives;  
• Ensure that the Count y's many natural and heritage assets are carefully  
protected, enhanced or managed to ensure that their  vulnerability to  development  
and human  activity  is minimised;  
• Ensure the County is well connected in terms of transport, broadband and  
telecommunications , to ensuring  the mobility  of knowledge,  people,  goods  and  
services;  
• Ensure an adequate supply of minerals is maintained to support the county' s  
economic ambitions, and that opportunities to minimise waste, and utilise  
renewable  energy  resources  are embraced,  but that these  needs  are balance d 
against  landscape,  heritage  and local amenity  considerations.3. Spatial  Vision,  Objectives  and Outcomes

Vision  
 
3.1 The vision sets out what the Local Plan intends to achieve, the vision informs all  of 
the policies within the plan. It has been informed by the context of partnership  
strategies outlined in the 'Duty to Cooperate' section above. It reflects the Council’s  
Corporate Priorities set out within the Corporate Plan 2018 -2021 and the  
Northumberland  Economic Strategy 2019 -2024 which are complementary and seek 
to deliver  a prosperous,  inclusive  and connected  economy  for Northumberland.  
 
 
By 2036:  
 
Northumberland's physical and cultural identity will be conserved and nurtured; its  
resources  will be utilised  in a sustainable  way. The breadth,  scale  and quality  of its 
special,  varied  landscapes  and biodiversity  will be conserved,  enhanced  and 
increased.  The quality  of its buildings  and spaces  will be conserved  and improved . 
New development will be well designed, minimise environmental harm and reduc e the 
effects  of climate  change.  
 
The economy will be thriving and competitive,  and deliver more and better jobs.  
Supported  by investment  and infrastructure,  building  on existing  strengths  whilst  
diversif ying and realising  the potential  of the rural and visitor  economy.  
 
The health  and wellbeing  of the county’s  people  and communities  will be safeguarde d by 
continually improving education and skills, and ensuring access to decent,  affordable  
homes,  services  and facilities  is secured.  
 
 
 
Strategic  objectives  
 
3.2 The Strategic  Objectives  of the plan have  been  developed  to deliver  the vision  for 
Northumberland. They clearly relate to the issues identified within the spatial portrait 
of the County.  Given the importance of Northumberland’s environment, the  
overarching aim is to deliver sustainable economic growth whilst conserving and  
enhancing Nor thumberland’s distinctive and valued natural, historic and built  
environment.  The strategic objectives are interlinked and not shown in priority  order.

Economy  and jobs 
 
3.4 The Northumberland  Economic  Strategy  (2019 -2024)  sets out a vision  for growing  
Northumberland’s  economy  to 2024.  It seeks  to deliver  a prosperous,  inclusive  and 
connected Northumberland. The Local Plan provides positive planning policies to  
enable  development  to take place,  encourage  economic  vitality  and to allow  
Northumberland residents to be able to access facilities, education and training and 
retail choice in convenient locations across the County. It complements the North 
East Enterprise Local Economic St rategy Economic Plan and the emerging North of 
Tyne Combined Authority ambitions and Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.  
 
3.5 Key outcomes:  
• Land and buildings will have been identified in sustainable locations to meet  
demand, allow for choice and to provide for an additional 15,000 new jobs  
between  2016  and 2036;  
• Close  cooperation  with partners  across  administrative  boundaries  will ensure  that 
locations in the south east and central areas of Northumberland will be  seen  
regionally,  as attractive  altern atives  to the Tyneside  market  and that the north of 
the County can benefit from the Scottish Borders and Edinburgh  employment 
markets. Likewise the western areas of Northumberland can  benefit  from the 
economic  opportunities  arising  from its connection  with Cumbria;  
• Existing employment sites will have been protected relative to need and  demand;  
• A diverse range of interconnected sites around the Blyth Estuary will have  been

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Connections  
 
3.10 The required  level of growth  across  Northumberland  will increase  demand  on local 
infrastructure  services  and facilities.  The Local  Plan ensures  that infrastructur e 
requirements are appropriately planned, secured and implemented to ensure the 
timely delivery of development proposals.  
 
3.11 Key outcomes:  
• Provision of essential infrastructure e.g. transport, water supply, sewerage,  
energy,  flood  alleviation,  telecommunication,  education,  and health  and social  
care,  will have  been  coordinated  and positively  planned  for; 
• There  will have  been  effective  partnership  working  between  the Council,  other  
infrastructure  providers  and developers  to facilitate  infrastructure  delivery  and 
opportunities for the co -location and multi -functional use of existing and new  
infrastructure  services,  amenities  and facilities;  
• Existing infrastructure services and facilities will have been protected, unless   they 
are no longer needed  or there  is alternative  provision  elsewhere;  
• The provision  of new or improved  infrastructure,  where  need  is demonstrated , will 
have been positively supported, provided there is no detrimental  environmental  
impact;  
• A range  of viable,  efficient  sustainable  transport  alternatives  will have  been  
provided  to reduce  reliance  on the private  motor  vehicle,  although  it is recognised  
that in rural areas  reliance  on the private  car will remain  extensive;  
• Improvements  to transport  and communications  infrastructure  and the County's  
gateways  to international  growth  – dualling  of the A1 and A69, the East Coast   
Main  Line and Tyne  Valley  Railways,  the Ports  of Blyth  and Berwick,  passenger  
services on the Northumberland Line, and links to Newcastle International  Airport  
will have  been  supported;  
• County  highways  and Highways  England  roads  will have  been  improved  to 
incorporate  safe,  comfortable  and convenient  standards  for cycling,  facilitating  
increased  travel  by cycle  and reduced  car dependence.  
 
Community  health  and wellbeing  
 
3.12 Key outcomes:  
• Accessible local services and community facilities will have been protecte d and 
where  possible,  enhanced;  
• Green infrastructure, open space provision and recreational facilities will  continue  
to be protected  and where  possible,  enhanced  to help promote  social  inclusion  and 
health  and wellbeing;  
• State  of the art hospitals  will provide  improved  healthcare;  
• Communities  will have  access  to high quality  education  facilities;  
• Neighbourhood Plans will have been produced by communities that wish to  
promote particular development in their areas, adding detail to the overarching 
policies  within  the Local  Plan;  
• Strategic  growth  will have  been  matched  by the delivery  of improved  and new 
community  infrastructure.  3. Spatial  Vision,  Objectives  and Outcomes

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Climate  change  
 
3.13 Tackling  climate  change  is a key role for the planning  system  by contributing  to the 
delivery of the most  sustainable  development  and by shaping  communities  that are 
resilient to the unavoidable conseque nces of a changing climate. Climate change  
poses  a long term threat  to preserving  the special  landscapes  and cultural  heritage  of 
the County.  
 
3.14 Key outcomes:  
• A sustainable pattern of development will have been delivered, including the  
focusing of the provision of housing, employment, education, healthcare and  
retail particularly within Main Towns and Service Centres resulting in a reduction 
in the need  to travel;  
• The supply of energy and heat from renewable and low carbon sources will  have  
contributed  towards  meeting  national  targets  and helped  to address  fuel poverty;  
• New development will have incorporated sustainable building practices and  
where possible will have contributed to improving the existing building stock;  
• High energy  efficiency  will have  been incorporated  into new development;  
• New developments  will have  been  effectively  assessed  for the risk of floodin g and 
if appropriate  will have  been  sited  elsewhere;  
• New developments  will have  incorporated  multi -functional  green  infrastructure,  
which  can assist  in the mitigation  of, and adaptation to  climate  change.  
 
Resources  
 
3.15 Northumberland  is rich in energy  and other natural  resources.  Its minerals  provide  
the raw materials  that are necessary to deliver the infrastructure, buildings, goods 
and energy that  both society  and the economy  needs.  There  is also potential  for 
further  renewable  energy development, however it is recognised that there is a limit 
to the scale of  wind energy development that can be accomm odated in 
Northumberland without  significantly  adversely  affecting  the special  landscapes  and 
cultural  heritage  of the County,  or impacting  on residential  amenity.  Alternatives  to 
wind energy  are increasing in prominence as technology advances.  
 
3.16 The efficient  use of land and buildings  is important  when  planning  for housing  and 
economic  development.  Sustainable  design  and construction  seeks  to create  high 
quality  developments  that are cheaper  to run, consume  less energy  and minimise  
their environmental  impact.  
 
3.17 Key outcomes:  
• Finite mineral resources across the County have not been unnecessaril y 
sterilised  and land has been  made  available  to meet  defined  needs;  
• Minerals extraction, transport and processing does not have unacceptable  
adverse  impacts  on natural  resources  (air, water,  soil),  the natural  and historic  
environment  or local communities;  
• Net gains in biodiversity have been delivered,  with the creation  of new priority  
habitats  and green  infrastructure  in minerals  reclamation  schemes;  
• The minerals  industry  remains  an important  source  of employment;  3. Spatial  Vision,  Objectives  and Outcomes   
36  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • Northumberland  continues  to have  a well-established  and spatially  distributed  
network of waste management facilities, with sufficient capacity. Recycling  and 
recovery  rates  are maximised ; 
• The need to generate energy is effectively balanced with the need to protect  
Northumberland's  environment  and communities  from any significant  adverse  
impacts  associated  with it; 
• Efficient  use is made  of land and existing  buildings,  with priority  given  to the 
development  of previously  developed  land,  wherever  possible.  
 
Quality  of place  
 
3.18 The way in which we experience the places that we live, work and spend our leisure  
time in  has a huge impact on our sense of wellbeing. Northumberland has many  very 
high quality places and landscapes that are valued greatly by communities  and 
visitors.  
 
3.19 Key outcomes:  
• The design  of new development  will have  been  of a high quality  for its purpose;  
• The individual character of the places in Northumberland  will have been  
maintained  and improved;  
• New development in Northumberland will have provided attractive living and  
working  environments  that are valued  by their communities;  
• Development  will have  improved  the accessibility  to services  for communities;   
• Public  spaces  will be welcoming  and easy  to move  around;  
• The people  of Northumberland  will continue  to be proud  to live in the County.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland  
 
Development  strategy  
 
4.1 The Local Plan defines the level and distribution of development and includes  
specific policies that are required to deliver the spatial vision. The vision and  
objectives highlight the importance of protecting and enhancing the physical and  
cultural identity of Northumberland,  but also the need  to allow  development  to grow  
and diversify the economy, and provide homes and facilities which will help to  
safeguard  the wellbeing  of local communities.  
 
Northumberland  - A predicted  future  
 
4.2 A significant challenge to the delivery of the vision of the Local Plan is the profile  and 
dynamics  of the Northumberland  population.  While  the overall  population  is projec ted 
to increase from 316,287 in 2016, to 321,878 in 2036  8 or by a modest 1.8%, this 
increase is dependant  upon migration as natural change (the difference between 
births and deaths) would result in a loss of circa 21,000 people.  
 
4.3 The projections show that there is likely to be a significant acceleration in the ageing 
of Northumberland's  population  profile.  Between  2016  and 2036  there  is projected  to 
be a significant  increase  in older  age groups:  
• 43.8% increase in the over 65 years age group (from 74,494 to 107,105);  
• 100% increase in the over 80 years age group (from 18,856 to 37,737); and  
• 161.1%  increase  in the over 90 years  age group  (from  3,322  to 8,673).  
 
4.4 Alongside this, the core working age population of 20 to 64 year olds is projected  to 
decrease  from 176,529  to 154,148,  a reduction  of 22,381  (-12.7%).  The impact  of 
this is a significantly  shrinking  labour  force,  with fewer  working  age people  within  the 
County. It is true that people are predicted to work until they are older in the  future, in 
part as a result in changes to the state pension age. Indeed the older  demographic 
make a significant contribution to the Northumberland economy. Even so, if the 
projections  in paragraph  4.3 are realised,  they have  the potential  to have  a significant 
negative impact on the long term prosperity of Northumberland and  the diversity  and 
wellbeing  of communities  across  the County.  
 
4.5 To plan for a level of growth aligned with the population projections has the potential 
to have  a number  of adverse  effects:  
• A reduction in the level of wealth created and retained within the County;  
• Impact of r educed local expenditure - reducing income to local businesses and 
threatening further job losses;  
• Those who have marketable or transferable skills may move elsewhere to find  
employment or further, higher education or training;  
• The County as a whole could become less competitive in increasingl y 
 
8  These figures are from the 2014 -based Sub -national Population Projections. While later 2016 -based 
projections  have  been  released,  the 2014 -based  projections  were  used  in the Council's  latest  population 
studies  so are also presented  here for consistency.  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
39 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  competitive  markets;  
• A reduction  in wealth  creation  may be accompanied  by reduced  investment  in the 
buildings  and spaces  which  make  up the fabric  of the County's  towns  and  
villages,  together  with its natural  and historic  environments;  
• This in turn may impact  on the ability  to attract  new investment  in the new 
economy;  and 
• A lack of choice  in the housing  market  across  the County,  inhibiting  the ability  of 
existing household to secure the homes they need, and attract a working  age 
population.  
 
4.6 The Local Plan therefore puts policies in place to minimise these risks, and sets  out a 
strategy to support economic growth and expand choice in the housing market.  
 
A strategy  for sustainable  growth  across  Northumberland  
 
4.7 The growth strategy for Northumberland is predicated on an ambition to support  the 
delivery of additional, better paid and higher skilled jobs in the County, and to  provide 
homes to meet not only the needs of the resident population, but also to  
accommod ate the needs of people moving into Northumberland, who create and  fulfil 
jobs across  the County.  The strategy  aims  to help deliver  the five foundations  of the 
Industrial Strategy (2017)  9, the aspirations of the North East Strategic Economic 
Plan (SEP) (2017), and the North of Tyne Devolution Deal and the Borderlands 
Initiative, and the Council's Economic Strategy.  
 
4.8 The North East Strategic Economic Plan (SEP)  (2017)  proposes  to deliver  more  
and better jobs. The SEP aims to support the economy to d eliver 100,000 additional 
jobs in North  East England  by 2024,  an uplift  of 11% on 2014,  and ensure  60% of the 
new jobs delivered are ‘better’ jobs – offering higher skilled, more productive  and 
better  quality  opportunities  to more  people  in the area.  
 
4.9 To achieve these aims the SEP recognises the importance of business park  
opportunities  in Cramlington  and activities  around  the Port of Blyth,  as well as the 
Enterprise Zones that have been designated around Blyth Estuary ('Round 1'  
Enterprise Zones), and in parts of Ashington, Berwick -upon -Tweed and Morpeth,  
('Round  2' Enterprise  Zones).  These  locations  can, therefore,  be regarded  as 
important regionally, as well as at a Northumberland level.  
 
4.10 In addition to the SEP, new powers and funding will be available t hrough the North 
of Tyne Devolution Deal , administered through a directly elected Mayor. It supports 
economic growth across all three constituent authorities (Newcastle, North Tyneside 
and Northumberland). Northumberland, together the five local authority areas either 
side of the border with Scotland will also deliver the  Borderlands Initiative , which 
aims to unlock cross -border growth potential in  the types  of tourism  and small s cale 
activities  that can flourish  in more  remote  rural areas,  thanks  to advances  in 
technology.  
 
9  The Industrial  Strategy  Government  White  Paper  sets out five foundations  pf productivity  as Ideas  (the 
world ’s most  innovative  economy),  People  (good  jobs and greater  earning  power  for all), Infrastructure  (a 
major upgrade to the UK's Infrastructure), Business Environment (the best place to start and grow  a 
business)  and Places  (prosperous  communities  across  the UK). 4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
40  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.11 While there is an element of competition across the Local Enterprise Partnership  
(LEP)  area as a whole,  and the North  of Tyne  area,  many  of the County’s  strengths  
are in different  economic  sectors  and complementary  to those  elsewhere.  It is 
recognised that Northumberland's offer is different to that of its partners. Within the 
North of Tyne Devolution Deal, Northumberland will be the focus of initiatives to help 
rural communities, as the rural economy and tourism sectors in p articular are 
strengths of Northumberland.  
 
4.12 The Local Plan proposes to support the delivery of an appropriate proportion of the 
jobs uplift identified in the SEP in Northumberland.  Rather  than assuming  growth 
across all sectors of the economy represented i n the wider LEP area, the  growth  
strategy  assumes  that additional  growth  will occur  in those  sectors  in which  
historically Northumberland has been strong, but also sectors which can be  
anticipated  to grow  as a result  of investments  and local policies  and initiatives.  
 
4.13 Evidence indicates that the sectoral growth forecast by the Plan's growth  strategy10 
will see: 
• The number  of 'workplace  jobs' in Northumberland  increase  by 16,500,  or 750  per 
annum over the period 2014 to 2036, or approximately 15,000 workforce   jobs 
over the Local  Plan period  2016  to 2036;  
• The number of Full -time equivalent jobs grow by 12,500, or 570 per annum;  
• The labour  force  increase  by 6,500;  
• A stemming  of the reduction  in the size of the workforce  aged  16 to 64 years;  
• A reduction  in the unemployment  rate. 
 
4.14 To support the number of jobs forecast, sufficient land is required to be protected  for 
employment  purposes,  to ensure  there  is land available  for businesses  wanting  to 
either  start up in Northumberland  or expand.  The plan proposes  to allocate  and 
reserve considerably more land for employment purposes than the forecast suggests  
is required11. The rationale for this approach is set out in more detail in the economic 
development chapter. Howe ver, the plan only proposes to protect land which may be 
needed for employment uses. While some land is protected for  ‘main employment’  
land uses only, the plan allows for other employment generating uses on other sites.  
 
4.15 The majority  of jobs however  are forecast  to come  forward  in sectors  which  are not 
‘main employment’  uses such as offices, general industrial uses, storage and 
distribution.  Many of these will be service sector jobs, such as accommodation and 
food services, retail, professiona l services, health and education. These jobs do not 
necessarily  need  allocated,  dedicated  employment  land to support  them.  
 
  
 
10  The growth  strategy  is aligned  with the 'ambitious  growth  scenario'  as set out the Council's  Housing  and 
economic  growth  options  report  (Peter  Brett  Associates,  2018).  
11  The ambitious  growth  scenario  indicates  40 hectares  of employment  land is required.  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
41 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.16 The Local  Plan will assist  in delivering  this growth  by: 
• Protecting  key employment  sites,  including  those  identified  in the SEP,  and 
ensuring there is a sufficient supply of land available to support economic  
development  in locations  which  are attractive  to the market;  
• In total,  providing  for the supply  of 242 hectares  of available  employment  land,  
comprising 201 hectares of general employment land, plus 41 hectares on  
strategic  employment  sites in the Blyth  and Cramlington  areas;  
• Ensuring  an appropriate  distribution  and quality  of employment  land including,  
within the 201 hectares of available land, 78 hectares on  new sites, ensuring   that 
all towns  have  a sufficient  and appropriate  supply;  
• Enabling the development and diversification of the rural economy, by  supporting 
the creation and expansion of hubs for business services and  creative industries, 
the visitor economy and enabling home run enterprises;  
•  Supporting  improvements  to town  centres;  
• Supporting improvements to the County's gateways to international growth – the 
Ports of Blyth and Berwick, and links to Newcastle International Airport;  
• Recognisin g the importance  of developments  along  the main  transport  corridor s to 
the economic strategy, supporting improvements to the East Coast Main  Line, 
the re -introduction of passenger services on the Northumberland Rail  Line,  and 
improvements  to the strategic  highway  corridors  of the A1, the A19,  the A189  and 
the A69; 
• Supporting  the roll-out of effective  superfast  broadband  across  the County,  and 
improvements  to mobile  communications.  
 
4.17 By continually improving education, skills and transport in the County, opportunities 
for residents  to access  better  jobs,  start their own business,  and earn a decent  wage 
will be enhanced. A better skilled workforce will also be more attractive for potential 
investors in the County, generating more and better jobs, which will assist in retaining 
those of working age. While there is significant scope for the County's economically 
active population to start businesses and take up jobs, in order to deli ver on its 
objectives, there is also a need to attract people of a working age, with the 
appropriate skills to Northumberland.  
 
4.18 In order to meet the needs of Northumberland's resident population, including the  
diverse needs of an ageing population, and to provide attractive housing options  for 
those moving into the County to boost the economy, the plan proposes to extend 
choice  in the housing  market.  
 
4.19 Evidence  indicates  that to support  the additional  15,000  workforce  jobs over the plan 
period,  approximately 17,700 dwellings are required, equating to 885 per  annum. As 
such, the plan proposes to support the delivery of at least 17,700  dwellings.  This is 
significantly  more  than the minimum  'Local  Housing Need'  calculated  using  the 
standard  methodology12, but is considered  to be reasonable  given  the aspirations  of 
the wider  LEP,  the Council itself,  the Devolution  and Growth Deals  with the 
Government,  and committed  infrastructure.  
 
12  Using the Standard Methodology for calculating Local Housing Need, as set out in Planning Practice 
Guidance, Northumberland's requirement is for 717 dwellings per annum for the initial 10 -years of the plan 
period from 2016 to 2026.  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
42  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.20 The plan proposes  to deliver  the right types  of homes  in the right places.  The 
amount,  and varying  type and tenure  of housing  will: 
• Provide  a range  of attractive  housing  options  for those  skilled  workers  movin g into, 
or considering  moving  into the County;  and 
• Enable residents of a working age to access homes they can afford to buy or   
rent, which  together  with increased  attractive  employment  options  will reduc e the 
number  moving  away;  and therefore  
• Help to rebalance  and re-energise  the resident  population,  and strengthen  the 
labour  force;  and 
• Help to maintain  and enhance  vitality,  and the provision  of local services  in the 
County's  rural communities;  and 
• Help deliver  affordable  homes,  and specialist  housing  including  extra  care to 
meet  the needs  of Northumberland’s  ageing  population.  
 
4.21 While the growth strategy, informed by regional and sub -regional economic  
ambitions, sets out the overall quantum of job growth, employment land and housing 
over the plan period,  the spatial  strategy  indicates  at a strategic  level,  how this will be 
delivered across the county, and which locations will be the focus of development.  
 
Spatial  strategy  
 
4.22 One of the ways in which  the Local  Plan can contribute  to a more  sustainable  future  
for Northumberland is by providing a steer to the location of development. The  spatial 
strategy sets out the overall approach to the distribution of development  across  the 
county.  While  delivering  the Growth  Strategy,  it takes  into account  and assists  in 
delivering  a number  of key strategic  objectives  with a spatial  dimension.  
 
4.23 The spatial  strategy  of the plan is founded  on the principle  of proportionate  
distribution within the constraints of the Green Belt . This approach focuses the 
majority of new development in Northumberland's key settlements with smaller scale 
development allowed elsewhere in order to support local services and the  rural 
economy. It restricts development in the open countryside. While focussing 
development in the most sustainable  locations, this approach will leave existing 
Green Belt boundaries largely intact, ensure that the countryside in the Green Belt is 
safeguarded from encroachment, check unrestricted urban sprawl, prevent the 
merging of settlements, and preserve the charac ter and setting of historic 
settlements.  
 
4.24 It is considered that this approach will contribute to the vitality and viability of the  
market towns and urban areas and assist the regeneration of town centres. It will  
allow  for an appropriate  level of developme nt in villages,  particularly  those  with key 
services, support the rural economy, helping to create a critical mass of development 
to ensure the maintenance and delivery of new services, infrastructure and facilities, 
and enable  local people  to live in the communities  in which  they grew  up. It is 
recognised that in some Green Belt settlements the level of development will 
however be less than that which may be expected, when compared to similar sized 
settlements outwith the Green Belt.  
 
 4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
43 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.25 The Local Plan Sustainability Appraisal confirms that this appr oach performs well  in 
terms  of sustainability.  
 
4.26 The spatial strategy directs development to locations where it can support, and 
benefit from the use of existing local infrastructure and facilities, and support 
economic growth, whilst protecting the country side and character of settlements. New 
development is focussed in those locations which benefit from facilities and/or have 
the greatest potential to support new facilities and services, as a result of their 
location and/or a result of the size of the popu lation within them. Such an approach 
will allow for limited resources to be allocated in an effective way that maximises 
access to facilities and services.  
 
4.27 The Green  Belt in Northumberland,  which  forms  part of the wider  Tyne  and Wear  
Green Belt has an important role in helping to direct development to the most  
sustainable locations. The Local Plan consolidates the Green Belt boundaries which 
were adopted by former districts and boroughs and establishes the detailed 
boundaries of the Green Belt extension  around Morpeth13. The defined Green Belt 
wraps around the Tyneside conurbation, extending to the west of Hexham  and to the 
north of Morpeth.  National policy attaches great importance to Green Belts to prevent 
urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open.   
 
4.28 Given that Northumberland already has a significant amount of housing committed 
across the County, it is not considered that exceptional circumstances exist to justify 
the alteration of Green Belt boundaries for residential development. Therefore, while  
the plan aims to direct most housing to the larger settlements, and villages with a 
number of key services, this is done without removing land from the Green Belt. 
However, in order to support economic growth, some limited changes to past Green 
Belt bound aries have been made in the vicinity of Hexham, Prudhoe and Ponteland.  
 
4.29 The spatial strategy also gives recognition to the fact that the Green Belt extends 
across wide swathes of the Northumberland countryside, which also happens to be 
the most easily reached from the conurbation. This area contains many hundreds of 
farming and other small rural businesses. It is vital to ensure that the Green Belt 
status does not unduly stifle rural economic development or the local visitor 
economy. So, within t he bounds of Green Belt restriction, the Plan seeks to ensure 
that the Green Belt rural economy can thrive just as other countryside areas and 
aims to add value to Green Belt areas as a resource for visitors.  
4.30 Northumberland is a diverse county. The followi ng paragraphs set out what the 
spatial strategy means across the four Delivery Areas identified in the spatial 
portrait14. 
 
  
 
13  The general  extent  of the Green  Belt extension  was established  in Policy  S5 of the revised 
Northumb erland  County  and National  Park Joint  Structure  Plan (2005),  the details  of which  are defined 
in this plan. 
14  See Figure  2.1 Delivery  Areas  in Northumberland  for Delivery  Area  boundaries.  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
44  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.31 More than half of the county’s population is located in the South East Delivery Area , 
the only part of the county which could be considered urban in nature. This  area is 
also where many of Northumberland's key employment centres are located, including 
some of those of regional importance. Located close to Tyneside, the  area is 
considered a cost effective alternative location for bot h industrial development and 
housing.  The A189  'Spine  Road'  runs through  the Delivery  Area  from north  to south.  
The plan proposes  to reinforce  the role of South  East Northumberland  by: 
• Protecting strategic employment areas around the Port of Blyth and  Cram lington,  
enterprise  zone  sites in Blyth  and Ashington,  and a range  of other  employment  sites 
across  the area;  
• Supporting the regeneration of the former Alcan aluminium smelter site at  
Lynefield  Park;  
• Directing  more  than half of the plan’s  proposed  housing  to this area,  particularly   the 
towns  of Cramlington,  Blyth  and Ashington;  and 
• Supporting the re -introduction of passenger services on the Northumberlan d Rail 
Line,  to provide  better  access  to jobs.  
 
4.32 The Central Delivery Area  is home to approximately 25% of Northumberland’s  
population,  and includes  a number  of market  towns.  It is located  close  to Tyneside  
along the A1 and A69 corridors. The area is one of high market demand for both  
housing  and employment  space.  The plan proposes  to reinforce  this role by: 
• Protecting  key employment  sites including  the enterprise  zone  in the northern  
part of Morpeth;  
• Taking  land out of the Green  Belt in Hexham,  Ponteland  and Prudhoe  for 
employment  uses;  settlements  where  there  is strong  demand;  
• Directi ng approximately  a quarter  of the plan’s  housing  to the area,  particularly  
Morpeth  with its strong  links to South  East Northumberland;  and 
• Ensuring that Hexham, Ponteland and Prudhoe accommodate as much housing 
as possible  to meet  needs,  without  taking  land out of the Green  Belt. 
 
4.33 The North Delivery Area  is home to approximately 17% of the county's population,  
is largely rural in nature but a lso contains a number of market towns along the A1  
corridor, and bordering Northumberland National Park. With proposed improvements 
to the A1, Alnwick and Berwick -upon -Tweed will be more  accessible,  and attractive  
to the market,  while  the Borderlands  Initiative  will support  job growth  in rural areas.  
The plan will support  the area’s  role by: 
• Protecting key employment sites, including the enterprise zone i n Berwick -upon -
Tweed15; 
• Supporting rural economic development and the visitor economy t hroug h  positive  
policies;  
• Directing  approximately  19% of the plan's  housing  to area,  with half of this  going  
to Alnwick  and Berwick -upon -Tweed;  and 
• Allocating  land for housing  in Berwick -upon -Tweed  to boost  delivery  here.

45 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.34 The West Delivery Area  is the smallest  in population  terms,  with approximately  6% 
of the county’s  population  living  here.  Much  of the area is rural,  but it also includes 
key market towns and villages along the A69 corridor and in upland areas. Much of 
the area has seen little residential development in recent years, and it is not an area 
of high market demand for employment land or housing. With the help of the 
Borderlands Initiative, the plan proposes to strengthen the role of the west by:  
• Protecting  the most  important  employment  land,  particularly  in Haltwhistle  to 
support  economic  growth  in the area;  
• Supporting rural economic development and the visitor economy through   positive  
policies;  
• Directing approximately 5% of the plan's housing to the area. While this is  slightly 
less than may be expected given the share of population, delivering   these  
numbers  would  represent  a step change  in this area;  
• Allocating  land for housing  in Haltwhistle,  Bellingham,  Haydon  Bridge  and 
Allendale  to boost  delivery;  and 
• Supporting  improvements  to the A69. 
 
Settlement  hierarchy  
 
4.35 In the context of the principle of proportionate distribution within the constraints 
of the Green Belt , a hierarchy of settlements for development is set out, which gives 
priority to identified Main Towns, Service Centres and Service Villages. There is no 
specific definition of a Main Town, Service Centre or Service Village, in respect of the 
particular facilities they provide rather their importance lies in their functional context. 
The role of settlements within these categories varies across the County. In rural 
parts of Northumberland, a smaller settlement may provide the focus for a spread of 
communities, offering key services for a wide catchment area, and be the clear 
primary cen tre for different levels of services. In more urban parts of the County in 
particular, where settlements are closer together, the roles of different settlements 
are less easily defined. The  catchment of some larger settlements in the south -east 
of Northumb erland may  be more limited as residents utilise a range of services 
across different settlements. However, many of Northumberland’s key employment 
areas are located in the south -east, with employees being drawn from further afield 
including from outside th e County. The pull of the Tyneside conurbation is more 
significant in the south -east, both for work and accessing higher level services.  
 
4.36 The Local Plan directs larger scale development to Main Towns which offer the  
greatest  range  of services  including  schools,  healthcare  facilities,  leisure  facilities,  
shops  and employment  opportunities.  Service  Centres  also have  a number of key 
services for their communities and surrounding areas, but the range and number is 
generally more limited than the Main Towns, so the level of development directed 
towards them is also at a lower level.  
 
4.37 Service Villages generally have a school or a shop, and population of a size  
considered  likely  to maintain  the viability  of such  services  into the future.  They  have  a 
reaso nable  level of public  transport  to enable  residents  to access  some  higher  level 
services without the reliance upon private transport. A settlement's status is  not 
reliant  upon  one specific  criterion,  and may be influenced  by its close  proximity   to 
other  settlements. A proportionate level of growth is supported in Service Villages to 
support the provision and retention of services and facilities.  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland

North Delivery Area.  
 
 
4.38 Northumberland contains many small villages and hamlets. While the Local Plan 
does not actively direct development to small villages, it is recognised that a level of 
development is required in rural areas to support social and economic vitality, and 
that development in one village can support services and facilities in another nearby. 
In small villages not identified as Main Towns, Service Ce ntres or Service Villages, 
small scale development will be supported subject to Green Belt policy where 
relevant and  a number of criteria.  
 
4.39 A Small Village is defined as a cluster of dwellings and associated buildings which 
has a recognised name and identi ty, and a church or other community building. 
Appendix A identifies those settlements identified as Small Villages.  
  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
47 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Settlement  boundaries  
 
4.40 In order to enable th e Local Plan to better manage the location of development, in 
accordance with the settlement hierarchy , settlement boundaries are proposed. While 
criteria based policies will also be used, it is considered that settlement boundaries 
will provide a higher degree of certainty to communities and developers as to where 
future development ma y be appropriately located. They will help to protect the 
countryside, prevent the merging of settlements, maintain the character and form of 
settlements, and protect the settings of historic and ecological assets.  
 
4.41 The plan defines settlement boundaries f or all Main Towns, Service Centres and 
Service Villages (except in the Green Belt where inset boundaries are defined) 
unless local communities, through the neighbourhood planning process:  
• are defining  boundaries; or  
• have  specifically  chosen  not to define  a boundary;  or 
• have  indicated  that they do not wish to retain  a previously  defined  boundary.  
 Where a qualifying body has indicated a wish to have a settlement boundary defined 
when one was not originally introduced in a ‘made’ neighbourhood plan, t he Local 
Plan defines a boundary.  
 
4.42 Except in these circumstances, all settlements which benefitted from settlement 
boundaries in previous development plan documents, including those not listed in the 
settlement hierarchy, have retained their boundaries, al beit that in some instances 
they may have been adjusted. Settlement boundaries are defined on the Policies 
Map.  
 
4.43 Settlement boundaries defined in neighbourhood plans, including those for 
settlements not listed in the hierarchy are not replicated in the Loc al Plan. 
Nevertheless, they remain part of the development plan for the local area.  
 
4.44 Boundaries for all Main Towns and Service Centres have been defined in order to 
enable them to accommodate, in full, their housing requirements, as set out in the 
Plan. Boundaries for Service Villages have also been defined in order to 
accommodate a level of development appropriate to their scale, role and function, 
allowing them to grow and thrive. In some locations, the quantum of housing required 
over the plan pe riod is largely met by sites with planning permission or indeed by 
permissions which have been built out over the early years of the plan period. In 
others, housing allocations are proposed to meet the needs. Boundaries are drawn in 
order to support these developments.  
 
4.45 In areas where there is particular development pressure, most notably along the  A1, 
A69, and A697  corridors,  the north  Northumberland  coast,  and just beyond  the 
boundaries of the Green Belt, settlement boundaries are defined for a number of  
smaller  settlements . 
 
4.46 While boundaries provide a degree of certainty, there are circumstances where 
housing development beyond a boundary may be appropriate. The plan supports 
rural exception sites to meet local housing needs, including those of Service Villages 
where suitable and available housing land could not be identified for allocation, and 4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
48  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  allows for an appropriate level of development within and adjacent to Small Villages. 
It is also permissive about some forms of development in other sett lements, and in 
the countryside.  
 
4.47 While in many instances, locations within settlement boundaries may be the most 
appropriate to meet the needs of businesses and communities, it is recognised that 
to enable the growth and expansion of all businesses, and t o facilitate the provision 
of some community facilities, development adjacent to, or beyond defined settlement 
boundaries may be required. Policies in the Plan are flexible to accommodate these 
needs where they arise, whilst recognising the intrinsic chara cter and beauty of the 
countryside.  
 
4.48 In the open countryside, development will be restricted and need to demonstrate that  
it meets  a policy  test. The open  countryside  is defined  as: 
• Land beyond settlement boundaries or Green Belt inset boundaries, where they 
are defined on the Local Plan policies map or neighbourhood plan policies maps,  
• Land not within, or immediately adjacent to the built up form of Main Towns, 
Service Centres, Service Villages or Small Villages and land that is not wit hin the 
built form of other settlements , where  boundaries are not defined.  
 
4.49 The above  approach  will support  economic  growth,  provide  the right homes  in the  
right places,  and protect  the character  of Northumberland's  towns  and villages  and its  
valued  countryside.

investment in rural areas , to support the provision and retention of local retail, 
services and facilities;  
 
d. In order to support the social and economic vitality of rural areas,  and 
recognising  that development  in one village  can support  services and facilities  in 
other nearby villages , Small Villages listed in Appendix A will support a 
proportionate level of development subject to Green Belt policy considerations 
where relevant . 
 
e. Sustainable development will be supported within Green Belt inset boundaries 
and within sett lement boundaries defined on the Local Plan policies map or in 
neighbourhood plans. Sustainable development within, or immediately 
adjacent to the built up form of Main Towns, Service Centres, Service Villages, 
and Small Villages without defined Green Belt  inset boundaries or settlement 
boundaries will be supported, subject to Green Belt policy considerations 
where relevant,  if it is:  
i. Commensurate with the size of the settlement; and  
ii. Reflects the role and function of the settlement; and   
iii. Does not adversely impact upon the character and appearance of the 
settlement; and  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland

iv. Does not adversely impact upon the setting of the settlement or the 
surrounding countryside.  
 
f. Development in other settlements not identified as Main Towns, Service 
Centres, Service Villages or Small Villages will be limited to that within the built 
form of the settlement, and the conversion, extension or redevelopment of 
existing buildings unless it supports the sustainable growth of an existing 
business or the formation of a new business, or provides for new or enhanced 
community facilities.  
 
g. Development in the open countryside will be supported if it can be 
demonstrated that  it: 
i. Supports the sust ainable growth and expansion of existing business or 
the formation of new businesses in accordance with Policy ECN 13; or  
ii. Supports the development and diversification of agricultural and other 
land-based rural businesses in accordance with Policy ECN 14; o r 
iii. Supports sustainable rural tourism and leisure developments in 
accordance with Policy ECN 15; or  
iv. Provides for residential development in accordance with Policies HOU 7 
or HOU 8; or  
v. Supports the retention, provision or improvement of accessible local 
services and community facilities which cannot be provided in 
settlements, in accordance with Policy I NF 2; or  
vi. Provides for essential transport, utilities and energy infrastructure in 
accordance  with other  policies  in the Local  Plan;  or 
vii. Relates to the extraction and processing of minerals, in accordance  with 
other  policies  in the Local  Plan.  
 
h. Forms of development in the open countryside, other than those identified in 
criterion g, will be permitted if they are supported in a made neighbourhood 
plan.  
 
i. Development  in the open  countryside  should  be sensitive  to its surroundings, not  
have an unacceptable im pact upon the local road network, and use  previously  
developed  land where  opportunities  exist.  
 
 
 
Sustainable  development  
 
4.50 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is clear that the purpose of the  
planning system is to contribute to the achievement of the three dimensions of  
sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. The NPPF sets  out 
a presumption  in favour  of sustainable  development  and the Local  Plan seek s  to 
encourage sustainable development through growing the eco nomy, supportin g  
healthy  and vibrant  communities  and contributing  to protecting  and enhancing  the 
natural,  built,  water  and historic  environment  of Northumberland.  
 
 4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
51 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.51 The presumption in favour of sustainable development will not apply when the 
application of policies in the NPPF that protect areas or assets of importance provide 
a clear reason for refusing the development proposal16, or when any adverse impacts 
of development would significantly outweigh the benefits when assessed against the 
policies in the NPPF as a whole. It is also important to note that paragraph 1 82 of the 
NPPF (July 2021) states that the presumption in favour of sustainable devel opment 
does not apply where development requiring appropriate assessment because of its 
potenti al on a habitats site is being planned or determined.  
 
4.52 The policies in the Local Plan set out how the Council will apply the presumptio n in 
Northumberland. Policy STP 2 explains how the presumption will be applied  overall  
and Policy  STP 3 identifies  a numb er of sustainable  development  principle s to which  
development  proposals  will be expected  to adhere  to.

Presumption  in favour  of sustainable  development  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. When considering development proposals, the Council will take a positive  
approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development  
contained  in the National  Planning  Policy  Framework  (NPPF).  It will always  work  pro-
actively  with applicants  to seek  to find solutions  that mean  proposals  that improve  
the economic,  social  and environmental  conditions  in the area can be  approved  
wherever  possible.  
 
2. Planning applications that accord with the policies in the Northumberland Local 
Plan, and policies in 'made' Neighbourhood Plans, and those which have passed  
referendum, will be approved without delay, unless material considerations 
indicate otherwise.  
 
3. Where there are no relevant policies or the policies which are most important  for 
determining an application are out of date the Council will grant permission  unless:  
  
a. The application of policies in the NPPF that protect areas or assets of 
particular importance provide a clear reason for refusing the development 
proposed ; or  
 
b. Any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and 
demonstrably outw eigh the benefits when assessed against the policies in  the 
NPPF taken as a whole.  
 
 
 
 
16  The policies referred to are those in the NPPF  relating to: habitat sites (and those sites listed in paragraph  
181 of the NPPF , July 2021 ) and/or  designated  as Sites  of Special  Scientific  Interest;  land designated  as 
Green  Belt, Local  Green  Space,  an Area  of Outstanding  Natural  Beauty,  or defined  as Heritage Coast;  
irreplaceable  habitats;  designated  heritage  assets  (and other  heritage  assets  of archaeological  interest

Principles  of sustainable  development  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. In applying the presumption in favour of sustainable development in 
Northumberland, and to deliver against economic, social and environmental 
objectives develop ment proposals will be expected to adhere to the following 
principles where appropriate:  
 
a. Contribute  to building  a strong,  responsive  and competitive  economy  acros s 
Northumberland, support more and better jobs, protect and enhance the  
vitality and viability of Northumberland's town centres and other importan t 
economic  sectors;  
 
b. Provide a type and mix of homes to meet local housing need, and increase 
choice in the local housing market;  
 
c. Support and provide opportunities to improve health, social and cultural  
wellbeing  for all, and provide  the infrastructure  which  is required  to enhan ce the 
quality  of life of individuals  and communities;  
 
d. Contribute to the conservation and enhancement of Northumberland's   natural, 
historic, water and built environment assets, and contribute to   increasing  the 
natural  capital  resource;  
 
e. Minimise  their impact  upon  local amenity  for new or existing  residents  and 
businesses , adjoining  premises  and land uses;  
 
f. Contribute  to net gains  for biodiversity  and establish  a coherent  and resilient 
ecological  network;  
 
g. Prevent or minimise waste and make prudent and effective use of 
Northumberland's available finite and renewable resources;  
 
h. Make efficient use of land including achieving higher densities in more 
accessible locations where appropriate, and through the re -use of brown field 
sites (except where priority species have been demonstrated to rely on a 
brownfield site);  
 
i. Demonstrate high quality sustainable design which is accessible to all, and 
which respects and enhances the local distinctiveness of the natural, historic 
and built environment, helps promote a sense of place, reduces the need for 
energy, and facilitates flexible and adaptable buildings and environments;  
 
j. Be accessible by, or be able to be made accessible by public transport, 
walking or cycling where feasible, thereby reducing the need to travel for both 
people and goods, and the dependence on travel by private car;

k. Make best use of existing facilities and infrastructure, whilst making 
appropriate provision for new or additional infrastructure as required;  
 
l. Effectively manage the impact on the highway network and utilities 
infrastructure;  
 
m. Maximise energy efficiency and the use of renewable and low carbon energy 
sources including, but not limited to decentralised energy supply sys tems;  
 
n. Be located in areas which are least vulnerable to climatic impacts such as risk 
from all sources of flooding and rising sea levels; and  
 
o. Anticipated impacts, including those from climate change, on the historic and 
natural environment, including lan dscape, biodiversity,  ecosystems and water 
resources should be avoided by locating development elsewhere, adequately 
mitigated, or as a last resort, adequately compensated for.  
 
 
 
Climate  change  mitigation  and adaptation  
 
4.53 Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the environment, society  and 
the economy  both at a global  and local level.  Spatial  planning  has an important  role 
to play in influencing  greenhouse  gas emissions  and increasing  the resilience  of 
communities and infrastructure to climate change through influencing the location 
and design  of development.  This seeks  to assist  in meeting  the UK's requirement  
under  the Climate  Change  Act 2008  to reduce  its greenhouse  gas emissions  by at 
least  80% (from  the 1990  baseline)  by 2050.  Local  planning  authorities  are also 
importantly bound by the legal duty in Section 19 of the 2004 Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act (as amended) to ensure that, taken as a whole, local plan 
policies contribute to th e mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change.  
 
4.54 Policy STP 4 sets out how development proposals should contribute to climate  
change mitigation and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Other policies 
throughout  the plan set out more  detai led policy  requirements  to mitigate  and build  
resilience  to climate  change .

Climate  change  mitigation  and adaptation  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. Development  proposals  should  mitigate  climate  change  and contribute  to meeting 
nationally binding t argets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. When determining 
planning  applications,  support will be given  to development  proposals that help 
mitigate climate change and consideration will be given to how proposals:  
 
a. Through their location, layout a nd pattern of development, reduce the need to 
travel for both people and goods, and encourage sustainable modes of 
transport, including walking, cycling and the use of public transport;  
 
b. Are designed to reduce energy consumption;  
 
c. Incorporate decentralised , renewable and low carbon energy;  
 
d. Include the re -use of existing buildings, and materials;  
 
e. Incorporate multi -functional green infrastructure, which can provide carbon 
storage and provide environments that encourage walking and cycling;  
 
f. Protect and enha nce habitats that provide important carbon sinks, including 
peat habitats and woodland; and  
 
g. Incorporate electric vehicle charging facilities.  
 
2. Development  proposals  should  support  adaptation  to climate  change,  be resilient  to 
climate change, and not make neighbouring areas more susceptible to the  
negative impacts of climate change. When determining planning applications  
support will be given  to development  proposals that help provide future resilience 
to climate change and consideration will be given to how proposals:  
 
a. Incorporate  design  features  to ensure  that they provide  resilience  to climat e 
change;  
 
b. Are designed  to reduce  demand  on water  resources;  
 
c. Through their location, take into account the risk of flooding and coastal 
change;  
 
d. Incorporate the use of sustainable drainage systems, to minimise and control 
surface water run -off; and  
 
e. Incorporate, where feasible, multi -functional green infrastructure, which can 
help species adapt to climate change through preventing fragmentation or 
isolation of habitats, reduce the heating of the urban environment, and 
manage flooding.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Health  and wellbeing  
 
4.55 Evidence shows that health and wellbeing, and quality of life is linked to a range of 
social, economic and environmental factors. Development, through its location and 
design, has the ability to positively influence health and wellbeing. It can improve 
access to community facilities, healthy housing, healthcare facilities, local 
employment opportunities, open space, healthy food, and  encourage active lifestyles.  
 
4.56 The provision of green and blue infrastructure, open space, sport and recreation 
facilities is an important factor. Areas of open space that are valued by residents 
provide an important community function, and can make a significant contribution to 
quality  of life. Allotments, community gardens, community orchards and private 
gardens, in addition to providing green space in an area, also provide opportunities 
for outdoor recreation, contribute to physical and mental wellbeing by providing a 
place for people  to interact, and to produce healthy locally grown food. The presence 
of natural and semi -natural features such as green spaces, watercourses, street 
trees and other vegetation is linked with higher levels of physical activity and general 
wellbeing as well  as improving health indirectly through supporting better air quality, 
climatic conditions and tranquillity . 
 
4.57 With an increasing proportion of older people in the County, and communities with 
diverse requirements, it is essential to make sure that the need s of all are met in a 
fair and inclusive way. Development can contribute to ensuring that residents have 
equal access to opportunities in employment, housing and health, and that 
opportunities for social interaction are provided in a safe environment. By s eeking an 
equitable distribution of services and amenities, the plan can help reduce health 
inequalities and encourage healthy lifestyle choices.  
 
4.58 National Planning Practice Guidance recognises Health Impact Assessment (HIA) as 
a useful tool to assess and address the impacts of development on health. HIAs 
ensure that the impact of development on health is considered and responded to 
effectively during the planning process.  
 
4.59 Policy STP 5 requires that a Healthy Planning Checklist is completed for all major 
development proposals, to determine whether the potential impact on health resulting 
from the development warrants any further assessment. Where there is likely to be 
an impact on health, a proportionate HIA will be required to be submitted as part of 
the a pplication process. A HIA may be a separate statement or may form part of a 
Design and Access Statement or a required environmental assessment.  
 
4.60 HIA screening should consider:  
• whether the proposal is likely to impact on health, including consideration of 
determinants of health;  
• the possible  scale  of the impacts,  who they are likely  to affect  and whether   these  
are likely  to be positive  or negative;  and

To improve  the health  and wellbeing  of those  living  and working  in Northumberland,   the 
Council  will: 
 
a. work  in partnership  with relevant  stakeholders;  
b. support  the protection  of existing  and provision  of new or improved  health  facilities i n 
locations  which  are accessible  to residents  and workers;  
c. promote  allotments  and gardens  for exercise,  recreation  and for healthy  locally 
produced  food;  
d. promote  improvements  and seek  to enhance  accessibility  to good  quality  green  
spaces,  green  infrastructure  and cycling  and walking  routes;  
e. control  the location  of unhealthy  eating  outlets,  and promote  healthy  options;  
f. seek  contributions  towards  new or enhanced  facilities  from developers  where 
development  results  in a shortfall  or worsening  of provision.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Green  infrastructure  
 
4.62 Green infrastructure is the integrated network of green areas and features,  
connecting  natural  habitats,  human  activities  and town  and countryside.  Green  
infrastructure  is not simply  open  space,  it incorporates  many  different  forms  of 'green 
space' including parks, playing fields, woodlands, urban greening, private  gardens 
and blue spaces18. Being close to where people live, high quality multi -use local 
green spaces can play a key role in providing alternative settings for sport and 
healthy activitie s for communities, in addition to providing other indirect health and 
wellbeing benefits. Some of the many other benefits of green infrastructure  include 
supporting wildlife, mitigating and adapting to climate change, improving air quality 
and regulating m icro climates.  
 
4.63 Bringing  about  meaningful  green  infrastructure  across  Northumberland  is a central  
aspiration of this plan. The approach recognises the importance of the quality of  the 
environment and availability of green space on health and well -being, wi ldlife and the 
environment. Policy STP 6 and a number of other policies throughout th e Plan, seek 
to realise the multiple benefits of green and blue space and reconne ct people  and 
nature.  
 
4.64 Across  Northumberland  and reaching  into adjoining  authority  areas,  'green  
infrastructure' is a network of multi -functional, natural and managed green space and 
blue space which:  
• Helps sustainable planning - by addressing global climate change and providing 
wide ranging ecosystem services, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions 
through carbon storage or reduced car use from walking and cycling provision;  
• Improves air quality and climatic conditions, particularly in urban areas;  
• Supports networks which link habitats and biodiversity sites - preventing 
fragmentation or isolation of habitats;  
• Protects and enhances natural, historic and built assets and links between them;  
• Connects people with their environment and heritage - creating a sense of place 
and identity or helping people develop an attachment to the ir environment;  
• Improves public health locally - making high quality green space available to 
everyone;  
• Helps people to develop new skills and responsibilities through environmental 
and heritage volunteering;  
• Provides opportunities for growing healthy food ; 
• Helps to get more children learning outdoors - removing barriers and increasing 
schools' abilities to teach outdoors; and  
• Balances the potential of green infrastructure to support economic growth and 
sustainable tourism with the protection of vulnerable environmental and heritage 
assets.  
 
 
 
 
18  Blue spaces  such as streams  and other  water  bodies  are considered  to be part of the green  infrastructure  
network  but may also be referred  to as blue infrastructure  4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
59 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.65 The government has made a commitment in its 25 Year Environment Plan (2018) to 
adopt national standards for green infrastructure, which will be identified in 
partnership with Natural England. The standards, due to be published in 2019, are 
anticipated to determine the contribution of new developments towards green 
infrastructure. Should these standards or any other national standard for green 
infrastructure come forward within the plan period, consideration will be giv en to how 
development proposals address green infrastructure in line with national standards.  
 
Strategic  green  infrastructure  
 
4.66 Northumberland's strategic green infrastructure includes many features including 
international and national natural designations,  key moorlands, forests, river valleys, 
rivers, ponds and other water bodies including the sea itself. Together, these 
represent an overlying network of assets, some linear, some covering wide areas, 
which bring a range of quality of life benefits for loca l communities. However, the 
network can never be regarded as complete as long as there are disconnects 
between natural, green areas and there are opportunities to add to the network. 
Green infrastructure does not stop at local authority boundaries. The Cou ncil 
continues to work with neighbouring authorities and Local Nature Partnerships to 
ensure that strategic green infrastructure assets are aligned.  
 
4.67 Maintaining and enhancing well -planned green infrastructure networks, by creating 
new assets and links or new functions for existing green spaces, will significantly 
improve the existing attraction of Northumberland as a place in which to live and 
work, visit or invest. However, for successful integration and multi -functionality, green 
infrastructure needs to be planned at all levels or scales. The Local Plan identifies 
'strategic green infrastructure' that sets the strategic framework for developing 'local 
green infrastructure' such as village greens / Local Green Spaces, bridleways, street 
trees or amenity pl anting. The Plan also identifies and protects areas of existing 
green space and sets requirements for creating new green space and vegetation 
within new development. It is considered that local green infrastructure may also be 
identified through Neighbourh ood Plans, including Local Green Spaces and wildlife 
corridors.  
 
4.68 As well as scale differences between strategic and local green infrastructure it is 
important to recognise differences in the scope of green infrastructure provision 
between rural and urban a reas. Northumberland’s more urban south -east has 
significant local green assets but a lack of overall connectivity, while in the rural areas 
an apparent abundance of open countryside can mask an actual lack of multi -
functionality and public access. The Sou th East Northumberland Wildlife Network, as 
shown on the Policies Map, identifies the network of natural and semi -natural green 
spaces in the more urban area of the County which should be preserved and 
enhanced to enrich the connectivity of nature in this area. Figure 4.1 shows 
Northumberland's strategic green infrastructure network.

Green  infrastructure  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. In assessing development proposals, the contribution of strategic and local green 
infrastructure to the health and well -being of Northumberland's communities and 
visitors,  as well as its economy,  will be recognised,  promoted  and enhanced.  
 
2. Development prop osals should where relevant, and in a proportionate way, seek 
to protect, improve and extend  Northumberland's  green  infrastructure, and integrate 
with the network.  When determining planning applications, c onsideration  will be 
given  to how development  proposals:  
 
a. Protect and enhance strategic and/or local green infrastructure assets,  provide  
high quality  links between  existing  assets  including  links with green 
infrastructure networks in adjacent authority areas and/or provide additional 
uses for multi -functionality;  
 
b. Secure improved access to green infrastructure, including rights of way,  the 
network of cycle routes and high quality provision for the widest possible range 
of ages, abilities and interests where this would not have an unjustified 
adverse  effect  on biodiversity  and environmental  and heritage  assets;  
 
c. Secure net -gains for biodiversity through the protection, creation and  
enhancement  of coherent  ecological  networks;  
 
d. Improve  the potential  green  infrastructure  to support  economic  growth  and 
sustainable  tourism  without  adverse  effects  on environmental  and heritage  
assets;  
 
e. Create a sense of place by fully integrating high quality,  green  infrastructure  
into the plan or proposal design to reflect locally distinctive character  having  
regard  to rural and urban  character,  open  space,  connective  corridors  and 
links with the wider  countryside;  
 
f. Integrate green infrastructure with sustainable drainage and the management 
of flood  risk; 
 
g. Consider the management and maintenance of new and existing green  
infrastructure throughout and beyond the plan period, including opportunities 
for community -led management;  
 
h. Provide opportunities for growing healthy food, including through community 
schemes; and

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
 
Green  Belt in Northumberland  
 
4.69 The Green Belt in Northumberland forms part of a wider area of Green Belt 
designation surrounding the conurbation of Tyne and Wear. Since the original 
designation in 196319, the Green Belt in Northumberland has undergone a number of 
modifications, with areas being added to as well as removed from the Green Belt. 
This Plan consolidates the boundaries defined in the Local Plans and Core 
Strategies of the former Tynedale , Castle Morpeth and Wansbeck districts, and the 
Borough of Blyth Valley, and identifies the detailed boundar ies of the Green Belt 
around Morpeth20. The Northumberland Local Plan identifies the full extent of the 
revised Green Belt in Northumberland, as defined on the Policies Map.  
 
The purpose  of the Green  Belt 
 
4.70 Nationally, the Government attaches great importan ce to the Green Belt. The NPPF 
states  that the fundamental  aim of Green  Belt policy  is to prevent  urban  sprawl  by 
keeping land permanently open, and that a key attribute of land in the Green Belt  is 
its openness.  
 
4.71 The NPPF sets out the five purposes of the Green Belt21, which are  to: 
• Check  the unrestricted  sprawl  of large  built-up areas;  
• Prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another;  
• Assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;  
• Preserve the setting and special charac ter of historic towns; and  
• Assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other 
urban land.

63 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.72 The main function of the Green Belt in Northumberland is to prevent the unrestricted 
sprawl  of the Tyne  and Wear  conurbation  by keeping  land permanently  open.  The 
protection of the Green Belt is a key element of the Plan’s development strategy.  In 
line with the purposes of the Green Belt identified in the NPPF, the strategic  
approach  to the Green  Belt in Northumberland  is set out in Policy  STP 7. 
 
 
 
Policy  STP 7 
 
Strategic  approach  to the Green  Belt (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. The Green  Belt within  Northumberland,  as defined  on the Policies  map,  will be 
protected  to: 
 
a. Check  the unrestricted  sprawl  of Tyne  and Wear;  
 
b. Safeguard  the countryside  from encroachment;  
 
c. Prevent  the merging  of: Newcastle  upon  Tyne  with Ponteland,  Newcastle  
Airport,  or Cramlington;  and North  Tyneside  with Cramlington  or Blyth;  
 
d. Preserve  the setting  and special  character  of Hexham,  Corbridge  and 
Morpeth;  
 
e. Prevent  Morpeth  merging  with neighbouring  settlements;  
 
f. Prevent  the merger  of rural settlements;  and 
 
g. Assist  in the regeneration  of settlements  in South  East Northumberland  
beyond  the Green  Belt.  
 
 
 
Development  in the Green  Belt 
 
4.73 In plan making and the determination of planning applications, the overarching  
principle  is that the Green  Belt should  preserve  openness  and reflect  the purposes  of 
the designation. The NPPF sets out a list of development that is not inappropriate in 
the Green Belt. Where development is considered not inappropriate in the Green Belt 
it will still be subject to other planning considerations. Where proposed  development  
is inappropriate  in the Green  Belt (as defined  by the NPPF)  it is considered  harmful  to 
the Green  Belt and will only be permitted  where  very special  circumstances  are 
demonstrated.  Very special  circumstances  will only exist where  harm  to the Green  
Belt, and any other harm caused by the development, is clearly outweighed by  other  
considerations.  
 
4.74 Whilst the Plan seeks to resist inappropriate development in the Green Belt, it is  
recognised that development can be positive, for instance where it improves access 
to the countryside  or supports  outdoor  sport  and recreation.  Proposals  that support  a 4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
64  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  positive  use in the Green  Belt will be encouraged,  providing  they comply  with the 
restrictions  on Green  Belt development  set out in national  planning  policy.  
 
4.75 Policy STP 8 sets out how Green Belt in Northumberland will be protected and  
enhanced in accordance with national planning policy. Policy ECN 16 within the  
Economic Development Chapter of the Plan sets out further requirements in relation 
to Green  Belt and the tourism  and visitor  economy.  
 
Limited infilling in villages  
 
4.76 In accordance with the NPPF, limited infilling in villages is not inappropriate 
developme nt in the Green Belt. Infilling is not defined in the NPPF and case law 
suggests that the decision of what constitutes limited infilling is a matter of planning 
judgement. The Council considers the commonly accepted definition of limited 
infilling as 'deve lopment of a small gap in an otherwise built up frontage' to be an 
appropriate interpretation where limited infilling occurs in villages. Development 
which diminishes the open character of a village, for instance where it would 
consolidate loose -knit or is olated buildings into built -up areas, will not be considered 
to be limited infilling, in accordance with part 2 of Policy STP 8.  
 
4.77 It is acknowledged that limited infilling or the partial or complete redevelopment of 
previously developed land can take place in accordance with the NPPF.  
 
4.78 The NPPF implies that villages washed -over by the Green Belt contribute towards the 
openness of the Green Belt due to their open character. The scale and form of the 
development would therefore be relevant in relation to  whether the infilling is 
sufficiently limited to ensure that the loss of significant gaps between the built form 
are not diminished and the open character is preserved.  
 
 
4. Delivering  the Vision  for Northumberland   
65 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4.79 When determining whether a proposed development is within a village, this will 
require a judgement from the decision maker regarding whether, on the ground, the 
site appears to be within the village. Whether the site is physically and visually linked 
to the settlement will be of particular relevance. Gaps between the built edge of a 
village and other buildings which are not physically and visually linked to the 
settlement are not appropriate locations for infill development.  
 
 
 
Policy STP 8  
 
Development in  the Green Belt (Strategic Policy)  
 
1. In assessing development proposals within the Green Belt:  
 
a. Development that is inappropriate in the Green Belt, in accordance with 
national planning policy, will not be supported except in very special  
circumstances  where other considerations clearly outweigh the potential harm 
to the Green Belt, and any other harm resulting from the proposal;  
 
b. Development which is not inappropriate in the Green Belt, as defined in 
national planning policy, will be suppo rted; 
 
c. Development which improves access to the countryside; provides 
opportunities for outdoor sport and recreation; enhances landscapes and 
biodiversity; or improves damaged and derelict land will be encouraged and 
supported, provided it does not conflic t with national policy in relation to Green 
Belt. 
 
2. In villages in the Green Belt, limited infilling of a small gap in an otherwise built up 
frontage will be supported. Development which fills a small gap between buildings 
within a village in the Green Belt  will be recognised as limited infilling in villages, in 
accordance with the NPPF, and will be supported, providing it would not constitute 
the following:  
 
a. Development between loose -knit groups of buildings;  
 
b. Development between the built edge of a villag e and other buildings which are 
not physically and visually linked to the settlement;  
 
c. Development of a scale or form that would result in the loss of significant gaps 
between buildings or diminish the open character of the village.  
 
3. Other forms of limited infill development in the Green Belt may be supported if it 
meets the tests of the NPPF.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Safeguarded land  
 
4.80 Green Belt boundaries are intended to endure over the longer term.  Therefore , when 
defining new Green Belt boundaries , where necessary, they should be drawn having 
regard to potential development needs arising beyond the plan period. Given that 
Green Belt boundaries around Morpeth are being defined for the first time, 
safeguarded l and has been identified within Policy ECN 6 to meet the long -term 
employment requirements of the town. This safeguarded land is not allocated for 
development at the present time.  Planning permission for the permanent 
development of the safeguarded land wi ll only be granted following an update to the 
Plan which may allocate the land for development during that Plan period. The 
monitoring framework identifies indicators to help determine when a Plan review may 
be required.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  5. Economic  Development  
 
Introduction  
 
5.1 The Development Strategy, at Chapter 4, set out an ambitious growth scenario for 
employment that will deliver on the Local Plan's main 'Economy and Jobs' and other 
objectives that aim to benefit economic well -being. The Development Strategy goes 
on to list what the Local Plan can do t o deliver on this, by way of:  
• A locational strategy  that will recognise the importance to Northumberland's 
economy of each of its component parts - the urban core areas of South East 
Northumberland; the key strategic sites, the main 'gateways' (such as ports and 
the Airport), the rural economy, the County’ s town centres and its very  wide 
range of visitor destinations.  
• A strategy for businesses and the workforce  aimed at increasing the quality of 
jobs, the skills of the workforce and working in partnerships to support business 
investment.  
 
A planning  strateg y for the Northumberland  economy  
 
5.2 The spatial strategy for planning economic development and regeneration will reflect 
the overarching spatial strategy set out in the Plan. It will:  
• Continue to focus economic development opportunities in Northumberland's 
towns , in their centres, their dedicated employment areas and through other 
opportunities;  
• Promote the main communication lines and hubs  - notably the North -South 
and East -West corrid ors, the Port of Blyth and Newcastle International Airport;  
• Maximise opportunities for the rural economy  in the context of local constraints, 
including through supporting digital communications, farm diversification and the 
reuse of redundant buildings;  
• Continue to build on the economy of South East Northumberland , 
strengthening links with the conurbation and promoting specialised economic 
opportunities, including at Blyth estuary; and  
• Seek to provide more widely for latent visitor and tourism  demand throu gh 
efforts to increase opportunities throughout the year and across the County.

Planning  strategy  for the economy  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. The Plan will deliver economic growth, while safeguarding the environment and 
community well -being, so helping to deliver the objectives of the Council’s 
economic strategy.  
 
2. Development  proposals  will: 
 
a. Seek  to deliver  sufficient  employment  land and premises  of the necessary  
range  and quality  and in sustainable locations compatible with the spatial 
strategy to meet  requirements;  
 
b. Support both existing and new businesses ; 
 
c. Support  town  centres  as locations  for employment  and business;  
 
d. Assist the regeneration of existing areas through employment -related  
measures;  
 
e. Support  rural enterprise;  
 
f. Support  and promote  tourism  and the visitor  economy;  
 
g. Recognise the role of the County's natural and historic environment a s drivers  
of economic  development;  
 
h. Support  the further  development  of the County's  key infrastructure  and  the 
digital  economy;  
 
i. Recognise  the continued  importance  of military -related  activity  as a sourc e  of 
employment;  
 
j. Facilitate  the training  and upskilling  of the workforce.  
 
 
 
Planning  for employment  growth  
 
5.3 Long -term employment forecasts inform how jobs are likely to grow. These forecasts 
provide the basis for objectively assessing how much land needs to be made  
available for economic development through the plan period. This is looked at in  the 
context of what proportion of the forecast jobs growth can be accommodated  in ways  
other  than land provision.  
 
5.4 The Local Plan evidence base applies an employment sector based approach, to 
arrive at forecast jobs growth. This involved examining which sectors are successful 
in Northumberland and applying a series of assumptions about the speed at which 5. Economic  Development   
69 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  sectors could grow and what this could mean for jobs. The Local Plan promotes an 
ambitious job growth scenario, which would see growth of an average of around 
+750 jobs a year22. The strategy aims for a situation where  the Council will be able to 
keep more of its own re sidents working in the County (rather than commuting out). 
This, in turn will place a greater reliance on the quality of the new jobs and 
associated training and upskilling.  
 
5.5 Translating the potential jobs into additional land is not straightforward. Howev er, 
analysis has shown that around 30 percent of new jobs will rely on land allocated in 
dedicated employment areas, with the remainder being generated in key nodes such 
as town centres, or in a more dispersed manner through activities such as tourism 
smal l businesses and rural enterprise23. 
 
5.6 The translation of future jobs growth into purely quantitative, county -wide 
employment land needs suggests that about 40 hectares of land will be required. 
This is clearly before different job markets, locations, sizes  of site and quality of 
provision, as well as the extensive size and spatial geography of the County are 
taken into account.  
 
5.7 Employment land is land primarily but not exclusively occupied by industrial or office -
based businesses in the form of industrial estates, business parks or stand -alone 
‘single user’ premises. Recent changes to the Use Classes Order mean that it is 
important to define a set of main employment uses. The proposed definition includes 
general industrial uses, and warehouses, p urpose -built offices, light industrial and 
research establishments. The full definition can be found in the glossary.  
 
5.8 It is encouraging to understand that most of the jobs generated in the County will not 
require the effort and expense of bringing dedicat ed employment land and buildings 
on stream. However, the Council regards the provision of a wide range of land and 
premises across the County, appropriate to its scale and settlement pattern and 
tailored for a wide variety of potential users, as a vital pa rt of its strategy for the 
County’s economy.  
 
Measuring  and meeting  the need  for employment  land 
 
5.9 The Council regards it as key to its strategy to allocate and reserve considerably 
more land for future employment needs than the forecasts would suggest. In deciding 
the amount, range and distribution of land, the factors that influence the Council's 
approach include the following:  
• It is not desirable or prudent to plan for exhaustion of the supply of land by the 
end of the plan period: growth could be greater than current projections over a 
twenty year span; for example, a major inward investment could result in 
unexpected uptakes of land;  
 
22  The de rivation  of the ambitious  jobs led scenario  can be found  in the 'Housing  and Economic  Growth 
Options  Findings  Report'  June  2018,  (prepared  for the Council  by Peter  Brett  Associates).  The report 
looked at a number of scenarios for housing and economic growth. The forecasts within the report  have,  
while  informed  by the North  East Local  Enterprise  Partnership's  Economic  Plan and other region -wide 
strategies and initiatives, strongly reflected a close examination of the unique pattern of employmen t 
sectors in Northumberland, their relative success in creating/retaining jobs and their growth potential.  
23  See the PBA Report,  (June  2018)  referred  to in the previous  footnote . 5. Economic  Development   
70  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • There are strategic employment needs that require their own, dedicated land 
supply;  
• More generally, it is important  to maintain a wide portfolio of sites and premises 
at all times and in all areas. The spread -out geography of the County 
necessitates extra flexibility in the choice of land: the land needs of a firm looking 
to a particular town will not necessarily be sa tisfactorily met simply because land 
is available in the wider area or the next nearest town;  
• The development of employment land does not always result in an increase in 
jobs, such as when a factory expands onto adjacent land simply to accommodate 
additional automation;  
• Assumptions must be built in to cover unexpected losses from the employment 
land portfolio: even where the land supply situation would suggest retaining land 
in employment use, there have sometimes proven to be other soun d planning 
reasons for land to be lost to non -employment uses;  
• Conversely, serviced sites in some areas may not have been taken up but 
deallocating them would be inappropriate, since they would not be suitable for 
other uses, being in the heart of serviced  employment areas, or because 
deallocation might threaten any future industrial/commercial investment at the 
site or even the continued existence of a business at the site;  
• Some specific cases require a policy intervention. For example, the closure of the 
former Alcan smelter site is still relatively recent, affecting an area that strongly 
relied on the plant for its employment. The creation of a new employment area 
('Lynefield Park') on the site is therefore still regarded as exceptional. While the 
new sit e is intended for general employment, the employee density is likely to be 
low. For these reasons it is concluded that reductions in available land elsewhere 
to compensate for this new injection of available land would be neither 
reasonable nor desirable;  
• As employment areas are developed, a proportion is developed for supporting 
uses such as roads, substations and public landscaping.  
 
Considerations  regarding  the allocation  of employment  land 
 
5.10 Notwithstanding  the low modelled  figure  for overall  employment  land needs,  the 
detailed evidence base24 has provided the necessary steer on which areas of the 
County have experienced surpluses or shortages of suitable employment land. The 
two independent studies carried out for the Council found that, in terms of quantity, 
quality, suitability and marketing , there were shortages in towns to the west of 
Tyneside, and a possible oversupply in parts of S outh East Northumberland, for 
reasons relating to Green Belt constraints and industrial legacy (respectively).  
 
5.11 From the evidence gathered, referred to above, i t has been possible to conclude  
which previously monitored employment areas should now be taken forward as  
employment designations. These sites contain around 149 hectares of available  land, 
much of which is part and parcel of an existing, otherwise occupi ed employment 
area. Made neighbourhood plans have added a further 14 hectares  of available  land.  
 
24  The evidence includes: the 'Northumberland 'Employment Land and Premises Demand Study' 2015 
(carried out for the Council by the ES Group); the Northumberland 'Employment Land Review' 2011 
(carried  out for the Council  by Nathaniel  Lichfield  and Partners)  and its update  (2013);  the Northumberland 
'Employment Land Schedul e' (carried out each year by the Council); and the Northumberland  'Employment  
Land  Take -up Study'  (also  carried  out by the Council  annually).  5. Economic  Development   
71 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  5.12 Besides this, the Local Plan proposes the allocation of 78 hectares  of further land to 
meet key requirements in certain locations. These include:  
• 18 hectares o f new land to boost the supply in towns constrained by the Green 
Belt; 
• 49 hectares that will result from the regeneration of the land at the former 
Lynemouth aluminium smelter ; 
• 6 hectares comprising a second phase of Wansbeck Business Park at Ash ington ; 
• 3 hectares comprising the key enterprise and service centre site at the new 
junction of the A1 north of Morpeth . 
 
5.13 In total, therefore, the portfolio of available employment land brought forward, 
through this Local Plan, in designated areas or separ ate allocations, amounts to 242 
hectares split between 41 hectares on strategic employment sites  and 201 hectares 
of generally available employment land25. 
 
Allocating  strategic  employment  sites  
 
5.14 A vital element of the portfolio of employment land in Northumberland is land for 
large -scale, specialised and/or strategic purposes. There are three elements to this:  
• The Blyth Estuary area, devoted to port logistics, energy generation, and  more 
recently specialist research and advanced manufacturing - a sign ificant 
proportion of the area (at Bates and East Sleekburn) has the advantages of 
Enterprise Zone status;  
• West Hartford , a 'prestige' site to meet the needs of businesses requiring a high 
quality environment, including those proposing a scale of developme nt that could 
not easily or suitably be accommodated within existing employment areas.  
• Three 'Round 2' Enterprise Zones  at Ramparts Business Park  (Berwick -upon -
Tweed), Fairmoor (Morpeth) and Ashwood Business Park (Ashington) which will 
complement other ini tiatives encouraging ‘smart  specialisation’ - often small and 
medium enterprises contributing to growth sectors. All three are strategic 
locations in a Northumberland context.  
 
Blyth  Estuary  Strategic  Employment  Area  
 
5.15 The Blyth Estuary has historically bee n a focus for economic activity in South East 
Northumberland, including ship building, port logistics, energy generation, and more 
recently specialist research and manufacturing.  
 
5.16 Based on numerous factors including the recent growth of these sectors natio nally, 
the North East SEP highlights that low carbon and renewables have the potential to 
deliver significant new investment and jobs. It identifies Blyth as an 'innovation hub' 
for this sectoral growth. This is supported by the Northumberland Economic Str ategy. 
Specifically the area around the Blyth Estuary is considered to have a number of 
advantages which put it ahead of other areas targeting this economic activity:  
 
 
 
25  A further  10 hectares  of general  employment  land is available  but under  option  for development.  There   are 
also some  substantial  areas  of largely  undeveloped  land which  are held for expansion  by existing  
companies  or operations,  mostly  within  the Blyth  Estuary  strategic  area.  5. Economic  Development   
72  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • The offshore renewable energy cluster, located at the Port of Blyth, is the centre 
of innovation excellence for the development, testing and commercialisation of 
renewable technologies;  
• The Port's existing deep water port facilities and access to marine engineering 
skills and training;  
• Proximity to sites in the North Sea with pote ntial sites for offshore wind energy 
production, being roughly equidistant from Dogger Bank and the Firth of Forth.  
 
5.17 The appeal of Blyth Estuary is wider, attracting interest from other businesses related 
to offshore and sub -sea activity, including those i n manufacturing, engineering, 
relevant service providers and ancillary facilities (such as on -shore convertor 
stations).  
 
5.18 In addition, energy generation is a strategic sector to which the Blyth Estuary offers 
site characteristics which cannot be readily fo und elsewhere in the country. A large 
amount of land is for planned future investment in a new power station. Given the 
strategic nature of the location for energy generating uses, it may also be appropriate 
for related uses to be sited on unallocated land  around the Blyth Estuary. However it 
is important to avoid uses in the close vicinity of the Port frontages that do not, in 
some way, need such a location.  
 
5.19 The potential to attract investment around Blyth Estuary should be greatly helped by:  
• Enterprise Z one (EZ)  status , covering around 16.5 hectares across four sites 
(parts of East Sleekburn and Bates, as well as Wimbourne Quay, 
Commissioner’s Quay and Dun Cow Quay) - 14 hectares of Enhanced Capital 
Allowance (applicable to energy and water efficient plan t) and around 2.5 
hectares of Business Rate Discount.  
• 'Local Development Orders' , which cover a wider area - around 73 hectares 
straddling the estuary - at Bates Colliery and East Sleekburn - which eases the 
delivery of offshore energy and marine operations by automatically granting 
planning permission for related development (to 2019 ). 
• Proximity to key rail freight routes - i.e. the 'Northumberland Line' rail route  
where the reintroduction of passenger services is planned, along with its 
branches. (NB the passenger route would follow the existing Ashington Blyth and 
Tyne freight line but would not disrupt the important movement of freight to and 
from the Port of Blyth).  
 
5.19 The strategic policy approach must also recognise that the Blyth Estuary is a 
nationally designated ecological site.  
 
5.20 The competitive advantages of  the Blyth Estuary sites and their strategic importance 
in regional and Northumberland economic strategy for the attraction of inward 
investment in new economic sectors, indicate their distinction from the supply of 
general employment land. The likely low job densities and requirement for large sites 
within the targeted sectors also indicate the need for this  substantial land allocation. 
Demand for land in the Port and 'Energy Central'  areas is high at present. Much of 
the allocated land is under option, al though it is difficult to predict precisely the speed 
of take up of this land .5. Economic  Development

Policy  ECN  2 
 
Blyth  Estuary  Strategic  Employment  Area  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. Land  at Blyth  Estuary  is allocated as a 'Strategic Employment Area' within which 
the following sectors within the main employment industrial uses will be prioritised:  
 
a. low carbon  and related  environmental  goods  and services;  
 
b. offshore  and sub-sea engineering;  
 
c. energy generation sectors with special emphasis on renewable and low 
carbon;  
 
d. development which will support and strengthen the economic role of the Port  
of Blyth.  
 
2. Other sectors will also be supported within the defined area, particularly if they can 
demonstrate a link with or reliance on proximity to the above sectors, es pecially if 
they have significant land requirements and/or require proximity to the Port.  
 
3. Development proposals in the above categories will be supported where there  is 
no unacceptable  adverse  impact  upon:  
 
a. Neighbouring sites of biodiversity importance, including the Northumbria Coast 
Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar Site, the Northumberland Marine 
SPA, the Northumberland Shore Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and 
the Blyth Estuary Local Wi ldlife Site, including the Mount Pleasant Peninsula; 
and 
 
b. The significance and setting of the Grade II listed Coal Staithes at the former 
Blyth Power Station site.  
 
4. Within the wider hinterland of Blyth Estuary:  
 
a. favourable consideration will be given to pr oposals which will directly or 
indirectly support the growth of the Blyth Estuary Strategic Employment Area 
and its prioritised industrial sectors, especially on key employment sites in 
South East Northumberland;  
 
b. necessary infrastructure improvements will  be sought that allow the smooth 
flow of goods to and from the Port of Blyth and the wider Blyth Estuary area.  5. Economic  Development   
74  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  West  Hartford  Prestige  Employment  Area  
 
5.21 Cramlington has a history of being seen as a strategic location for employment 
growth given its proximity to Tyneside, former new town status and modern layout.  
 
5.22 As such, when the former Regional Spatial Strategy was prepared, the town was 
identified as the location for a large, 'prestige' employment site and West Hartford  
was assessed as being the most suitable location for this. It would have the role of 
meeting the needs of businesses requiring large sites in a high quality environment, 
on a scale that could not easily or suitably be accommodated within existing 
employme nt areas. This continues to be regarded as the priority for the site, although 
parts of the site could also be opened up for smaller scale employment uses seeking 
a very high quality setting that is nevertheless close to the Tyneside conurbation.  
 
5.23 While co nsiderable infrastructure investment has taken place, the land requires 
further remediation, as well as provisions for its better connection with the rest of the 
town, for example for pedestrians.  
 
5.24 Given the nature of the proposed use of the site and the r emaining investment 
needed to allow development, it is difficult to predict when development will occur. 
However there is a good degree of confidence that this will happen well within the 
Plan period.  
 
5.25 It will be important that a masterplan is prepared for  the site to reflect the dual role, 
define the proportion of the site which will be available for prestige and general 
employment and ensure that development is of the highest quality. In addition, 
safeguards will be needed to take into account constraints  within or adjacent to the 
site. 
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  3 
 
West  Hartford  Prestige  Employment  Area  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. Land at West Hartford, Cramlington is allocated as a 'Prestige Employment Area’ 
within which the following will be prioritised:  
 
a. Large -scale main employment uses requiring a well -defined site of at least 5 
hectares, directly accessible from the Core Road Network and with scope to 
provide each user with a high quality landscape setting;  
 
b. Smaller scale main employment use s within Use Class E (Commercial, 
business and service uses) that require a well -defined site of at least 2 
hectares in a high quality landscape setting.  
 
Office uses will be limited to those that are not subject to a sequential test or have 
met the test.  
 
 5. Economic  Development   
75 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
2. Development proposals should be guided by a masterplan or development 
framework, prepared by, or agreed with the Council, or otherwise demonstrate that 
they will not reduce or hinder the development options for the wider site. 
Development proposals should:  
 
a. Reflect the intended role of the site defined in part 1 of this policy;  
 
b. Make provision for, and be phased to achieve a suitable landscape structure, 
connections to  the rest of Cramlington and with existing public rights of way, 
non-motorised transport,  appropriate environmental mitigation and other 
measures that will ensure that development is of the highest quality.  
 
3. Development proposals will be supported where there is no unacceptable adverse 
impact upon:  
 
a. Plessey Woods Local Wildlife Site along the River Blyth corridor; and  
 
b. The significance of the Grade II Listed farm building group and shelter shed at 
West Hartford Farm, including any contribution made by its setting.  
 
 
 
'Round  2' Enterprise  Zones  
 
5.26 Enterprise Zones are designated to encourage b usinesses to invest by putting in 
place infrastructure and enhancing their access to specific benefits, including 
discounted business rates or increased levels of capital allowance on investment in 
plant and machinery.  
 
5.27 The 'Round 2' Enterprise Zone sites, designated in 2017 and spread across the 
North -East, were chosen for their potential to provide strategic locations where the 
scope for 'Smart Specialisation' industries, advanced manufacturing and research, 
technological/digital industries , etc. co uld be realised. Three sites in Northumberland 
have 'Round 2' Enterprise Zone status, which are also covered by the General 
Employment allocations later in this chapter. They are:  
• Ramparts Business Park, Berwick -upon -Tweed , covers over six hectares and 
will focus on improving the quality of manufacturing and industrial premises 
building on these existing economic strengths in Berwick -upon -Tweed. The site is 
seen as highly strategic, as it is mid -way between Newcastle and Edinburgh, 
close to the A1 and Be rwick -upon -Tweed railway station.  
• Fairmoor, Morpeth , covers around nine hectares of greenfield land in northern 
Morpeth on the new junction between the A1 and the 'northern bypass' link to 
South East Northumberland. The intention has been to support knowle dge 
intensive growth, drawing on a highly -skilled labour pool, by developing an 
innovation park with new office, light industrial and incubator premises; recent 
evidence points towards small office premises forming the most likely future 
occupiers of the l ocation.  
• Ashwood Business Park, Ashington , covers over sixteen hectares at a 
strategic point on the South East Northumberland Spine Road (the A189). The 
focus is on pharmaceuticals and mixed manufacturing, building on past 
successes and the strengths shown  in the local economy.  5. Economic  Development

1. Within  the defined  sites with Enterprise  Zone  status  at Ramparts  Business  Park in 
Berwick -upon -Tweed, Fairmoor  north of Morpeth and Ashwood Business Park at 
Ashington, which form part of the general employment site allocations in Policy 
ECN  6, support  and encouragement  will be given  to high quality  employment  in 
line with the overall  strategy  of these  sites as follows:  
 
a. At Ramparts, Berwick -upon -Tweed, high quality business premises in main 
employment uses, so long as there is no adverse impact on the significance of 
adjoining battlefield site;  
 
b. At Fairmoor, Morpeth, main employment uses within Use Class E 
(Commerc ial, business and service uses) particularly knowledge intensive 
office, light industrial and incubator premises;  
 
c. At Ashwood Business Park, Ashington, main employment uses, particularly 
pharmaceuticals and mixed manufacturing . 
 
2. Other uses will be supported, especially where these support the preferred 
sectors . 
 
3. Non employment uses will not be supported unless they meet (2) above and there 
is a clear need for their location within the Enterprise Zone areas.  
 
4. Office uses will be limited to those that  are not subject to a sequential test or have 
met the test.  
 
 
 
Large -scale  windfall  employment  development  
 
5.28 The Blyth Estuary Strategic Employment Area and West Hartford Business Park, as 
explained, will include the opportunity for large -scale inward investment opportunities 
in key sectors. However, some significant inward investment opportunities can be 
unforeseen and emerge quickly. When large firms plan to invest in a new location, 
their site requirements can be very particular and therefore the sea rch is often 
national or wider. Similarly existing local or regional businesses may experience 
growth at greater rates than expected with no suitable allocated site available.  
 
5.29 The windfall employment policy aims to address such circumstances by allowing f or 
the accommodation of large -scale major economic development proposals with 
specific requirements that cannot be met by the existing land portfolio.  
 
5.30 It is important to emphasise that this is an exceptions policy. Northumberland's 
existing employment lan d portfolio and key allocations must remain the focus for 
business development; greenfield land should not be developed unnecessarily; other 5. Economic  Development   
77 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  objectives and policies in this Plan should not be compromised. Therefore, to be 
considered under this policy:  
• The development must be 'large -scale and 'major', the definition of which may 
vary according to the context (given the range of characteristics that exist across 
Northumberland's towns, employment areas and landscapes), but at the very 
least should compris e built floorspace totalling at least 10,000 square metres 
and/or a site area of at least 2 hectares;  
• The development should lead to significant job creation; and  
• The needs of the business must not be capable of being met on an existing 
employment site, bo th within Northumberland and, within reason, in adjoining 
authorities which make up the functional economic area of the North East LEP.  
 
5.31 Clearly  the policy  is not intended  to include  Green  Belt areas,  which  could  only be 
considered  as a last resort after other areas. Applying Green Belt policies, it would 
need to be demonstrated that there were 'very special' circumstances where other 
considerations clearly outweigh any potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of 
inappropriateness, and any other ha rm resulting from a proposal.

provided that it can be robustly demonstrated that:  
 
a. The development represents a major inward investment and would provide a 
significant number of ne w, permanent jobs; and  
 
b. The needs of the business cannot be reasonably met on allocated 
employment land within the North East Local Enterprise Partnership area; and  
 
c. The proposal would not compromise the viability or deliverability of sites 
allocated for development that are demonstrably deliverable within the Plan 
period; and  
 
d. The development can be satisfactorily accommodated through proposed

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  General  employment  land – Introduction  
 
5.32 As explained earlier, through evidence26 it has been possible to identify a range of 
existing employment areas, suitable to take forward. This is based on a range of 
assessment criteria including the overall distribution of employment land, local 
demand, sustainability, quality, marketability, a nd site constraints27. 
 
5.33 The existing areas to be taken forward are those that have good potential to 
contribute to future employment needs. They largely consist of existing industrial 
estates and business parks, many of which are substantially occupied by existing 
employers but include vacant sites of good quality, in a range of locations to meet 
potential needs. All sites have been subject to a certain level of reassessment; this 
includes a Heritage Significance Assessment28. The amount of available vacant  land 
totals 109 hectares.  
 
5.34 The evidence in the two studies, identified a number of Main Towns where a 
shortage of employment land would be likely in terms of local supply and demand. 
Setting aside those locations - notably Alnwick and Morpeth - where the identified 
shortfall is accounted for in made neighbourhood plans (including 13 hectares of new 
land in Alnwick), this leaves a handful of settlements where additional allocations of 
employment land will be necessary to meet shortfalls and provide a sustai nable 
pattern of development.  
 
5.35 As such a further 78 hectares  of land for general employment development is 
identified in the Local Plan in specific places, to meet the need for employment land 
between 2016 and 2036.  
 
5.36 A full explanation of how the evidence has been used to derive total employment 
land needs for each town/area is given in a series of technical background papers 
accompanying this plan. The derivation of the additional 78 hectares is explained 
below.  
 
Foci for general  employment  land provision  
 
5.37 It is important to stress that the places where this plan allocates land for future 
factories, warehouses and offices are the places where a large proportion of the 
County's population will be expected to find work. It follows that the bulk of t his land 
should be in the places that are most accessible to most of the population - i.e. the 
Main Towns of Alnwick, Amble, Ashington, Bedlington, Berwick -upon -Tweed, 
Blyth, Cramlington, Haltwhistle, Hexham, Morpeth, Ponteland and Prudhoe.  
 
5.38 The Service Ce ntres , also have a role in providing suitable sites for more local 
businesses; but some of these are constrained  by heritage or other protections, while 
 
26  This is contained in the Northumberland Employment Land Review 2011 (NLP) and its update, as  updated  
and added  to in the Northumberland  Employment  Land  and Premises  Demand  Study  (2015).  
27  It should be noted that the evidence also identified a significant number of employment areas and   
individual sites that should not be taken forw ard, but which were previously allocated/monitored . These  
sites tended  to be poorly  located,  run-down  or with little prospect  of development.  
28  See Appendix 2 of the ‘Employment Land: Strategy Considerations and Assessments of Sites Technical 
Paper 2018.  5. Economic  Development   
79 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  others are not on as many public transports routes as nearby Main Towns. Therefore 
there is a necessity  to be more selective in how and whether land is allocated for 
employment in these towns. In some cases, new or expanding businesses will need 
to locate in the nearest main town.  
 
5.39 Finally, Lynemouth , where regeneration is being pursued following the closur e of the 
aluminium smelter, forms an additional key location for general employment land.  
 
Meeting  the shortfall  in general  employment  land - the Green  Belt towns  
 
5.40 Given the employment role of the Main Towns, it is vital that each of them has a 
sufficient supply and range of available land for general employment purposes to 
meet the needs of its own and its likely catchment population for the whole of the 
plan period, taking full account of patterns of travel to work. Balancing the evidence 
on de mand in each town with the availability of viable and sustainable sites for 
general employment in the current portfolio, and taking into account what has already 
been allocated through neighbourhood plans, it is clear that the Main Towns that will 
see a sh ortfall within the plan period, unless additional sites are found are those that 
are constrained by the Green Belt. It is considered that the strategy of maintaining 
the role of each main town as a provider of general employment opportunities in an 
accessi ble location will not be fulfilled unless new areas of land are found in, or close 
to these settlements29. 
 
5.41 Hexham  has been identified as needing 10 to 15 hectares of general employment 
land over and above the small amount that remains in the town’s existi ng 
employment areas. This cannot be achieved within the existing Green Belt inset 
boundary. For this reason, it is considered that exceptional circumstances warrant 
the deletion of an area of Green Belt to the east of the Egger Plant, at Harwood 
Meadows, t otalling about 10 hectares . This site has been assessed against other 
alternatives around the town and has been found to be the most sustainable option. 
The land will be made suitable for employment use through reclamation, following the 
gradual extraction  of sand and gravel from the site and through an improved access 
point onto Rotary Way.  
 
5.42 Prudhoe  has been identified as needing up to 10 hectares of general employment 
land over and above that remaining in the town's existing employment areas. Again, 
this cannot be achieved within the existing Green Belt inset boundary. For this 
reason, it is considered that exceptional circumstances warrant the deletion of an 
area of Green Belt to the west of the former Hammerite plant. This site has been 
assessed against other alternatives around the town and has been found to be the 
most achievable sustainable option. The site will only contribute about 2.5 hectares 
but would be difficult to extend further without harming the Green Belt and for 
reasons of topography and a ccess. Opportunities will need to be sought to 
accommodate additional, small scale employment opportunities on unallocated land 
within the town, as opportunities become available.  
 
 
29  All newly proposed sites have been subject to assessment; this includes a Heritage Significance 
Assessment - See Appendix 2 of the ‘Employment Land: Strategy Considerations and Assessments of 
Sites Technical Paper’ 2018 . 5. Economic  Development   
80  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  5.43 Ponteland  has been identified as needing 5 additional hectares of land for 
employment uses. Opportunities within Ponteland's existing Green Belt inset 
boundary do not exist. For this reason, it is considered that exceptional 
circumstances warrant the release and allocation of an area of partly reclaimed land 
opposite the Airport entrance at Prestwick Pit for predominantly industrial uses, and 
the release and allocation of  land at nearby Prestwick Park Business Park for small 
scale rural offices.  Overall, around 5.5 hectares  of land is removed from Green Belt 
protection, and alloca ted for employment uses over the plan period.  
 
5.44 Morpeth  has been identified as needing 15 hectares of general employment land, 
including the Fairmoor area that was already an allocation in the Morpeth 
Neighbourhood Plan. The requirement will be met through land allocated in the made 
Morpeth Neighbourhood Plan, plus the area to the south east of the new junction 
between the A197 and the A1 that has permission for an innovation centre and 
service area. It is, however, important to ensure that, in drawing the G reen Belt inset 
boundaries, opportunities remain for a continued supply of land to follow the take -up 
of the allocated land. As such, around 5 hectares  south of the A196, close to the 
existing Coopies Lane employment area, has been included in the inset an d is 
safeguarded for future employment use.  
 
5.45 National policy indicates that when Green Belt boundaries are defined, they should 
be done so using physical features that are readily recognisable and likely to be 
permanent. While the area released from the Green Belt in Prudhoe for allocation for 
employment uses, and the area safeguarded for employment uses in Morpeth both 
benefit from strong Green Belt boundaries, the boundaries to the sites allocated to 
meet the needs of Hexham and Ponteland are currently weakly defined. Therefore, 
substantial planting along the boundaries will be required as part of the development 
of these sites, in order to create effective, recognisable and permanent Green Belt 
boundaries in these locations. Landscaping schemes detailin g suitable boundary 
planting to address this objective will be required with any detailed or reserved 
matters application.  
 
Compensatory improvements to remaining Green Belt land  
 
5.46 The Council has removed around 23 hectares of land from the Green Belt in order to 
provide employment land in the Main Towns of Hexham, Ponteland and Prudhoe. 
The NPPF states that plans should “set out ways in which the impact of removing 
land from the Green Belt can be offset through compensatory improvements to the 
environment al quality and accessibility of remaining Green Belt land”. In order to 
deliver improvements on remaining Green Belt land, through the development 
management process, the Council will seek to secure developer contributions or 
planning conditions on the sit es which have been removed from the Green Belt.  
 
5.47 With a view to ensuring that improvements are deliverable and meaningful, developer 
contributions will be linked to Council -led green infrastructure, cycling and walking 
infrastructure and sports and recreat ion projects identified in the Northumberland 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP). When selecting projects from the IDP to direct 
contributions towards, the Council will prioritise any projects which are within the 
locality of the site that has been removed  from the Green Belt. Given that timescales 
for delivery of the allocated sites are not fixed, contributions will be sought for 5. Economic  Development

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  emerging projects identified within the most up -to-date IDP available when the sites 
are brought forward through the planning ap plication process.  
 
5.48 Alternatively, the Council may consider that improvements of equivalent value can be 
delivered on land adjacent to the allocated site if it is within the applicant’s wider 
ownership and could be secured through planning conditions. Deli very of 
improvements through planning conditions will be dependent upon early discussions 
with the Council through the pre -application process to ensure that the proposal 
would deliver appropriate improvements, over and above that which would otherwise 
be required to make the scheme acceptable in planning terms.  
 
Outstanding  employment  land issues  – Non-Green  Belt towns  
 
5.49 For the remaining towns and larger village service centres, based on available 
evidence, other practical considerations and constraints, i t has been concluded that 
no additional (new) employment land needs to be found over and above what is 
already part of employment land portfolios, (or allocated in the Alnwick and Denwick 
Neighbourhood Plan). Aside from countywide quantitative consideratio ns, the 
reasons for this conclusion can be summarised as follows:  
• For South East Northumberland, the close -knit nature of the settlement pattern 
means that, while there are detailed land -supply issues in certain areas, which 
may become more marked as the plan period progresses, surpluses in other 
locations should be able to address the imbalance, with the additional input of 
reclaimed and recycled land at Lynemouth providing a valuable backstop to the 
supply;  
• For rural areas, other than the Green Belt towns, where shortfalls are being 
addressed above, the supply is generally sufficient.  
 
5.50 In spite of this the following more specific issues are identified:  
• There are likely to be places where regeneration and possible targeted 
redevelopment of existing emp loyment areas could benefit the land supply 
situation as time progresses. Such places might include the Blyth Business Park 
area, Double Row in Seaton Delaval and parts of Haltwhistle;  
• Some places where, ideally, additional land should be identified are ne vertheless 
too constrained for this to be a practicality. An unmet need has been noted in 
Rothbury and an expansion of Rothbury's employment area could be supported if 
deliverable and justified, following further investigation. Solutions in constrained 
smaller towns could include:  
o allowing smaller sites to come forward more easily within the built -up area 
(as proposed for Prudhoe);  
o a neighbouring town possibly providing additional land (e.g. the highly 
constrained village of Corbridge looking to Hexham); or  
o opportunities being maximised for rural conversions to soak up some of the 
demand.  
 
5.51 All of the above  approaches  can be realised  by: 
• Supporting small scale windfalls close to settlement edges and/or the edges of 
existing employment zones (although not where Green Belt would be affected);  
• A permissive approach to the conversion of rural premises for employment uses;  5. Economic  Development   
82  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • An approach to small scale employment uses locating on vacant or infill sites 
within built -up areas . 
 
5.52 Sites allocated for general employment land, and safeguarded for future employment 
use, are shown on the policies map. These sites are in addition to employment land 
already allocated in Neighbourhood Plans . 
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  6 
 
General  employment  land - allocations  and safeguarding  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. In order to support the strategic plan for economic development across  
Northumberland, general employment areas, comprising industrial estates, 
business parks and some additional land, are allocated, as shown on the Policies 
Map.  
 
2. It will be recognised that, within established employment areas, certain locations, 
especially business parks within South East Northumberland, offer the opportunity 
to add significantly to the range and quality of the County's employment offer, 
including through functional linkages with the Blyth Estuary Strategic Employment 
Area defined in Policy ECN 2.  
 
3. The general employment areas allocated in part (1) above will include 78 hectares 
of land in areas that are additional to the established general employment areas, 
including 49 hectares at Lynefield Park, regenerating the area of the fo rmer 
Lynemou th aluminium smelter, and additional land allocations to ensure a 
continued essential supply for towns constrained by the Green Belt. The allocated 
sites below to be released from the Green Belt to are to meet the identified needs 
specific to their locatio n, and their uses limited, as follows:  
 
a. Hexham, Harwood Meadows, around 10 hectares, for a mix of main 
employment uses;  
b. Prudhoe, Eltringham, around 2.5 hectares, for main employment uses, 
predominantly industrial;  
c. Ponteland - Prestwick Park, around 2.5 hec tares, for small scale rural offices;  
d. Ponteland - Airport inset, Prestwick Pit, around 3 hectares, for main 
employment uses, predominantly industrial.  
 
4. The range of land uses that will be supported within general employment areas will 
be either the main employment uses only, in accordance with Policy ECN 7, or a 
wider range of employment -generating uses, in accordance with Policy ECN 8.  
 
5. Around 5 hectares of land south of A196 at Coopies Way, Morpeth is safeguarded 
for long -term employment needs beyo nd the period of the Local Plan as shown on 
the Policies Map. This land is not currently allocated for development, but may be 
allocated to meet employment needs in a future update to the Plan.  
 
 5. Economic  Development   
83 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
6. Where the above allocations involve loss of Green Belt, this will be offset through 
compensatory improvements to the environmental quality and accessibility of 
remaining areas of Green Belt, with priority given to areas close to the allocation 
sites where appropriate. Such improvements must be agreed with the C ouncil 
before planning permission is granted and ideally through the pre -application 
process. Improvements will be secured through:  
 
a. Developer contributions towards green infrastructure, cycling and walking 
infrastructure or sport and recreation projects located within the Green Belt ; or 
 
b. Planning conditions on adjacent land in the Green Belt, which secure 
environmental improvements equivalent to the value of the alternative 
developer financial contributions.  
 
7. In order to ensure that Green Belt boundaries are recognisable and permanent, as 
part of the development, substantial planting will be required along the boundaries 
of the allocation sites identified in parts 3a, 3c and 3d of this policy.  
 
 
 
Appropriate  ranges  of employment  uses  in defined  employment  areas  
 
5.53 The nature of many of the County's industrial estates, business parks and other 
monitored employment areas is such that there is a need to differentiate between:  
• Key employment areas where the main employment uses will be encouraged and 
supported - essentially, manufacturing, research, warehousing and the category 
of office that would not require regular access by the public; and  
• Employment areas where it would be  beneficial to take a more flexible approach 
to the employment uses to be supported - referred to as wider employment -
generating uses. These tend to include areas close to busy town centres and/or 
in smaller service centres and/or where take -up for  the mai n employment uses 
has been slow.  
 
5.54 The wider employment -generating uses are defined as land uses generating 
permanent on -site employment. Discretion will be used in deciding which 
employment generating uses would be appropriate in particular circumstances, but 
as a general rule:  
• May include certain 'non -residential institution' uses, where the scale or nature of 
the operation, or lack of the need for regular public access would make a location 
in a town centre or central to where people live less necessary. Examples might 
include training facilities of various sorts (Class F.1), or some Class E uses that 
are not in the main employment uses category, such as some trade counter retail 
operations or leisure businesses that are not suited to town centres, creches  that 
serve people working in the employment areas themselves or types of health 
clinics that provide for specialised needs and are only occasionally visited;  
• May include sui generis uses which typically operate from employment sites such 
car garages, taxi  firms, or home recycling centres;  
 
 5. Economic  Development   
84  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • Unless in a town centre location, they will exclude retail or leisure uses that fall 
within the category of main town centre uses; retail use can sometimes form an 
ancillary part of an employment proposal - e.g. a facto ry shop - which may be 
acceptable subject to other considerations such as access and parking - see 
Policy ECN 9);  
• They would not include any of the C -Class residential -type uses.  
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  7 
 
Key general  employment  areas  for main employment uses  
 
1. Within the key general employment areas, as delineated on the Policies Map, 
main employment uses will be supported. Development of wider employment 
generating activity in these areas will be supported if the development:  
 
a. Directly supports and is ancillary  to the primary functioning of the site as 
a location for main employment uses; and  
 
b. Will not have a detrimental impact on the functioning of existing or future main 
employment uses operating on the site; and  
 
c. Ensures that main employment uses remain the m ajority activity on site.  
 
 
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  8 
 
Areas  for wider  employment -generating  uses  
 
1. General employment areas, where employment -generating uses wider than the 
main employment uses will be supported, are identified on the Policies Map. 
Within these areas, unless otherwise limited by relevant policies in made 
neighbourhood development plans, permission will be granted for uses generating 
permanent on -site employment, provided that they comply with the definition of 
wider employment generating us es; and:  
 
a. The proposed  economic  activity  is compatible  with existing  businesses  on the  
site and adjoining  land uses;  and 
 
b. The proposal  would  not generate  an unacceptable level of continual  access by 
members of the public who do not work within that employment area.  
 
 
 
 
 5. Economic  Development   
85 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Additional  flexibility  in general  employment  areas  
 
5.55 Even with the flexible approach set out above, there are occasions when it will be 
appropriate to introduce additional flexibility as to what may or may not be permitted. 
For example, purpose built premises may have stood vacant over a long period, or 
dereliction and eyesores could put potential employers off moving into or staying in 
an area. There may be a need to pump prime the development of employment uses 
with a non -employment use or that use may serve a strong and sustainable purpose 
within the employment areas.  
 
5.56 The Local Plan proposes to improve the quality of employment in the County and 
provide better work opportunities for residents. A key part of this  is to support, 
spatially, initiatives to improve skill levels in Northumberland's resident workforce in 
accordance with the Northumberland Skills Strategy; through for example the 
development of dedicated technical training centres on employment sites.  
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  9 
 
Additional  flexibility  in general  employment  areas  
 
1. Within  areas  allocated  for general  employment  use in Policy  ECN  6, permissio n for 
uses wider than the ranges specified in Policies ECN 7 or ECN 8 may be granted  
if the proposal  meets one or more of the following:  
 
a. It is ancillary to and will support the main employment -related use of the area;   
 
b. It is for part of a larger site or pr emises and would facilitate the retention of the 
remainder in the specified employment use range;   
 
c. It is on part of a larger development site and would facilitate the development 
of the remainder for employment uses in the specified range, which would 
otherwise be undeliverable;  
 
d. It would bring back into use a building which has stood vacant for at least 12 
months, and the reoccupation of which by an employment use is 
demonstrated to be unlikely;   
 
e. It would provide the optimal location for essential infrastructure provision;   
 
f. It can be demonstrated to deliver significant community and economic benef its 
that override the need to maintain the site or premises within the specified 
range of employment uses;   
 
g. It would help foster skills development and cannot be provided in an existing 
educational establishment  or as ancillary  to an employment  use. 5. Economic  Development   
86  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Addressing  loss and depletion  of employment  land 
 
5.57 The development of employment land for non -employment uses, such as housing or 
large scale retail or leisure use, can deplete the supply of land available and  make it 
more challenging t o deliver the plan's economic growth objectives. The loss of high 
quality, well connected sites could be especially detrimental. Conversely anticipated 
market demand may not materialise in the long term. For some sites it may not be 
beneficial to continue to protect them unnecessarily.  
 
5.58 As such the portfolio of sites will be regularly monitored and reviewed by the Council 
to assess if they are still likely to attract investment. The vacancy of existing premises 
within these same employment areas will also f orm part of this monitoring process. 
The Policy below therefore sets out criteria which would need to be addressed when 
development of allocated employment land for entirely  non-employment uses is 
proposed. It focuses on the feasibility of demand across th e plan period as well as 
recent market signals.  
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  10 
 
Loss  or depletion  of employment  land 
 
1. Within the areas identified in Policies ECN 6, ECN 7 and ECN 8, and subject to 
the exceptions set out in part 2 of this policy, development for non -employment 
generating uses, such as housing, will be supported where robust evidence can 
demonstrate that:  
 
a. There is no reasonable prospect of an application co ming forward for an 
employment use; and/or  
b. There would not be an unacceptable loss of active businesses and jobs; 
and/or  
c. There would not be an unacceptable adverse impact on the continuing 
function of nearby existing businesses and/or the development of available 
employment land.  
 
2. Development for non -employment generating uses will not be supported, in the 
following locations:  
 
a. any Enterprise Zone; or  
b. Northumberland Business Park; or  
c. any other employment area considered key to the delivery of the Council's 
economic strategy; or  
d. any employment land area that has been created through a Green Belt 
deletion  
e. Where policies in made neighbourhood development plans provide specific 
controls or limitations on the use or development of land and buildi ngs for 
employment generating uses.  
  5. Economic  Development   
87 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Other  means  of accommodating  employment  
 
5.59 Apart from land provision, the other important contributors to the economy of  
Northumberland include business activity occupying small sites and underused 
buildings around the built -up areas of towns and villages, rural enterprises away from 
towns, activity at and around visitor destinations, and small businesses in people’s 
homes.  
 
Micro -businesses  - opportunities  in residential  locations  and in homes  
 
5.60 Micro -businesses account for a high proportion of the County's work opportunities. 
Evidence shows that these occur throughout the County's built -up areas but also are 
spread surprisingly evenly across rural areas. Therefore it is important to support 
busin esses being created within the areas where people live.  
 
5.61 Within the built up areas of towns and villages, the Council has sought to avoid wide 
expanses of housing with no jobs or services, recognising, in line with national 
planning guidance, that mixed ar eas can work as long as 'bad neighbour uses' and 
parking issues can be successfully addressed and avoided. With some towns being 
constrained such that only limited dedicated employment land can be brought 
forward, the potential contribution of small, windf all employment sites and premises 
conversions can be valuable.  
 
5.62 More than one third of all businesses in the North East LEP area operate from home, 
and this may well rise with improving telecommunications. Such businesses are a 
feature of all parts of Nort humberland but their relative significance is magnified in 
remote rural areas where, cumulatively, they are a lifeline to the local economy. As 
they are set -up and grow, these businesses may rely on the modest additions such 
as the conversion of outbuildin gs or small -scale new buildings within the dwelling 
curtilage. These will be supported through planning decisions, as far as the scale and 
the context allow.  
 
5.63 In principle the plan also supports the provision of new build 'live -work' units to 
provide purpo se built accommodation for business and residential development 
within one building.

Policy  ECN  11 
Employment  uses  in built -up areas  and home  working  
 
1. Businesses operated from within built -up areas, including residential areas and 
people’s homes, will be supported, subject to highways, access and amenity 
considerations, by:  
 
a. Allowing small -scale windfall employment sites adjoining existing employment 
areas, provided that they are not allocated for other uses;  
 
b. Permitting business proposals seeking to occupy small sites or buildings within 
residential or other built -up areas, provided that they are not allocated for other 
uses or are otherwise protected;  
 
c. Allowing for the creation of workspace for home -run busine sses involving the 
conversion of part of a dwelling, its outbuildings, or the development of 
appropriately scaled new buildings within the dwelling curtilage;  
 
d. In appropriate locations, either separately or as an element of a larger housing 
scheme, supporting and permitting buildings designed as 'live -work' units - part 
living accommodation, part workspace.  
 
 
 
 
Rural  economy  
 
5.64 Northumberland's geography is such that only a small proportion of the total County 
area (in its south -east corner) can be des cribed as 'urban', with the remainder being 
'rural'. If the market towns on which the rural County is centred are included, rural 
Northumberland contains around half of its population. However, once these main 
market towns and service centres are deducted from the total, it becomes clear that 
upwards of 50,000 people are distributed very sparsely across hundreds of small 
villages, hamlets and farmsteads. Analysis also shows that small businesses are 
widely spread across all areas of the County.  
 
5.65 Rural North umberland is highly significant in terms of how the economy of the  County 
functions and how this affects the well -being of its communities. Evidence  suggests30 
that the vast majority of new jobs coming forward in Northumberland during the Plan 
period will be in the types of employment that do not require specific land allocations 
- i.e. including the types of jobs typically provided in the County's rural areas. 
Planning for a thriving rural economy therefore demands measures that allow the 
accommodation of these jobs within rural communities, on farms, in tourist areas and 
generally across the countryside.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  The importance  of Northumberland's  rural  areas  to the regional  economy  
 
5.66 The contribution of rural Northumberland to the region's wellbeing has been  
recognised recently in the devolution deal for the North of Tyne area. This newly 
defined mayoral area is to become a national exemplar for rural growth and 
stewardship with Northumberland as the focus. In support of this, a comprehensive 
North of Tyne Rur al Productivity Plan is being developed. This will align with the 
Strategic Economic Plan (SEP) for the wider north -east and the Borderlands initiative 
which links up rural initiatives on either side of the Scottish Border.  
 
5.67 The North of Tyne deal proposes  a partnership approach with a view to scaling up 
small rural businesses, and where necessary, removing barriers to this growth. 
Innovation will be fostered - e.g. looking at how digital technologies can enhance the 
interconnectedness of rural economies.  
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  12 
A strategy  for rural  economic  growth  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. The growth  of the rural economy  will be encouraged  through:  
 
a. Fostering innovation, promoting digital technologies and enhancing the 
interconnectedness of rural economies;  
b. Within constraints, facilitating the formation, growth and up -scaling of 
businesses in rural locations;  
c. Safeguarding the rural environment, rural  communities and traditional rural 
businesses upon which the rural economy depends ; and  
d. Supporting rural main towns and service centres as the most accessible and 
suitable hubs for rural economic growth.  
 
 
 
5.68 The traditional rural occupations do not employ a nywhere near the numbers that they 
used to, although their contribution to the rural economy remains strong. Farm 
diversification into uses, such as specialist agricultural products, food and drink and 
leisure activities, are increasingly important for far ms to remain viable. The equine 
industry also makes a significant contribution. However, there is a limit to the scale of 
these activities that can be absorbed into the landscape and by local communities. 
Market towns provide the best and most accessible w ork opportunities within rural 
Northumberland. However even they are not easily accessible. So keeping the rural 
economy thriving presents one of the greatest challenges for this plan to address.  
 
5.69 Rural areas need to generate adequate wealth to support loc al services and more 
sustainable communities - part of the Plan’s vision. Encouraging young people to 
stay in Northumberland is challenging - but especially so when they have grown up in 
rural areas. This means that the plan must seek to add to the  diversi ty of job 
opportunities in rural areas for young people to access.  5. Economic  Development   
90  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  5.70 While it is considered that most employment activity should stay in accessible town 
locations, the plan seeks to ensure that reasonable opportunities are taken to support 
employment in coun tryside areas, applying adequate safeguards. The need to cater 
for economic supply chains in rural areas is also recognised, which can be just as 
complex as for urban manufacturing or service industries. The creation of rural 
enterprise hubs will allow clu sters of small businesses to locate together with shared 
facilities, and will be supported, particularly where existing buildings can be used and 
the locations are accessible. Opportunities to enhance the skills of those living and 
working in rural areas o f the County will be supported.  
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  13 
 
Meeting  rural  employment  needs  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. The role of rural locations in providing employment opportunities, to meet the 
needs of those living in such areas is recognised. Therefore, in the countryside, 
development that will generate employment opportunities, proportionate to the 
rural location, will be supported where all of the following apply:  
 
a. Existing buildings are reused or, where this is not possible, extensions or new 
buildings that c ontribute positively to local landscape character and, where 
applicable, local building traditions;  
 
b. The proposal is related as closely as possible to the existing settlement 
pattern, existing services and accessible places;  
 
c. It will not have an adverse impact on the operational aspects of local farming 
or forestry.  
 
2. Within the parameters of the above criteria, particular support will be given to:  
 
a. Developments on farms which would add value to farm produce on -site and 
provide other supply chain o pportunities in the County therefore reducing the 
distance products need to travel during the production process;  
 
b. The further diversification and development of educational facilities where 
these will help to further enhance Northumberland’s rural economy  and 
training opportunities for rural professions, particularly those in relation to the 
County’s further and higher education offer;  
 
c. Rural enterprise hubs where a number of small businesses are located in a 
cluster with shared broadband connection and ot her essential facilities, with 
preference given to building conversions to house them ; and  
 
d. Proportionate well related development, necessary for the continued operation 
in situ of an existing rural business.  
 
  5. Economic  Development   
91 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Farm  / rural  diversification  
 
5.71 Farm diversification is important to widen sources of income and sustain agricultural 
businesses. It is one of the primary ways in which diversification of rural work 
opportunities can be achieved. Typically farm diversification provides for tourism and 
leisure  activity, but also new office and workshop space, as well as on -site 
manufacturing, and in some cases sale of farm produce.  
 
5.72 The policy approach supports diversification schemes and encourages the re -use of 
redundant farm buildings where possible, and see ks to ensure that new development 
is accessible and located as close as possible to existing buildings on the farm. 
However it is important that the main agricultural function of the farm is maintained to 
ensure farmland remains productive. To support this , new build development should 
avoid using the best and most versatile agricultural land, given its importance to the 
productivity of the agricultural sector, and the nature of the development should be 
complementary and compatible in scale with the contin uing farm enterprise.  
 
5.73 Some farms or estates in the County have diversified to provide education 
opportunities and are considered to be of key importance to the County’s rural 
economy, particularly those catering for the higher education sector and it is 
considered important that the future development of these should be supported.  
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  14 
 
Farm  / rural  diversification  
 
1. Rural  diversification  developments  will be supported  if the proposed  use is: 
 
a. Directly related to agricultural, horticultural or forestry operations, or other  
activities,  which  by their nature  would  require  a rural location;  and/or  
 
b. For leisure,  recreation  or tourism  activities  that require  open  land in a 
countryside  location;  and/or  
 
c. A business or employment genera ting use that complies with Policy ECN13.  
 
2. The scale, nature and detailed location of proposals for rural diversification  should  
not prejudice  the long (or short -term)  operational  needs  of the host farm or other  
rural operations;  
 
3. The need for farm diversification will not, on its own, be accepted as a reason  for 
granting permission for a new dwelling in the open countryside, except  where  it is 
clearly necessary to accommodate a rural worker to meet the operational needs of 
a rural business in accord ance with  Policy  HOU  8. 5. Economic  Development

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Tourism  and visitor  development  
 The strategy  for tourism  
5.74 The Northumberland Tourism Destination Management Plan31 sets out a strategy for 
a sustainable visitor economy, developing Northumberland's attractions and 
activities. It seeks to bring about a better range of visitor experiences, depressurising 
areas most likely to experience environmental harm from more visit s, by distributing 
visitors more widely across the County and throughout the seasons. The need for 
diversification also extends to the range of accommodation available and to the types 
and quality of jobs available.  
 
The range  and quality  of Northumberland 's tourism  attractors  
 
5.75 Northumberland's key foci of visitors include the coastal, river valley, and upland 
landscapes, as well as key historic assets such Hadrian's Wall, castles and the 
County's historic market towns. It is important that the Local Plan s upports heritage 
led regeneration and sustainable tourism growth to create jobs and economic 
resilience.  
 
5.76 Tourism development differs from other forms of economic development in that 
attractions often exist in poorly accessible locations, (e.g. with no pub lic transport), 
meaning that car travel may be the only means of reaching them. Where a new 
attraction is being created, it should be possible to direct this to an accessible 
location but such places must also be attractive in their own right, otherwise th is can 
be counterproductive.  
 
5.77 It is important to state that the Council fully understands that Northumberland’s key 
rural, coastal and heritage attractors, including the AONBs, the National Park and the 
World Heritage Site are what bring people to the County in the first place and the 
Local Plan must be as accommodating as possible for these visitor aspirations within 
the constraints present in these places. Nevertheless, it  is considered that the visitor 
sector has the potential to grow right across No rthumberland and that the plan can 
help this happen.  
 
5.78 Linear attractions can also contribute to this broadening of the offer. Cycling , walking 
and horse riding holidays are an integral part of the outdoor tourism offer and an 
important reason for visitor l oyalty. The County has an extensive Rights of Way 
network, which includes public bridleways, restricted byways open to all traffic and 
footpaths. There are renowned long distance walks like the Hadrian's Wall Path and 
the Reivers' Way. There is also a leng thy network of high quality cycle routes and 
100 miles of purpose built trails. Such holidays can be cross seasonal, help to 
disperse the benefits of the industry across the County and can be low impact. The 
plan supports the development of appropriate new  and expanded cycle and walking 
routes to add to Northumberland's network. Facilities that help to support the network 
of long distance routes, where appropriate, will be strongly supported.  
 
 
 
31  Northumberland  Destination  Management  Plan 2015 -2020,  Northumberland  Tourism.  5. Economic  Development   
93 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  5.79 Kielder Water & Forest Park is a strategic tourism destination within Northumberland 
and is both a major attraction and visitor accommodation base.  Due to the scale and 
character of the landscape, it has the capacity to accommodate additional tourism 
development without adversely affecting the environment or its scen ic beauty.  The 
growing popularity of the area's dark skies, along with its nature tourism and outdoor 
activity offer, has created a demand for additional visitor accommodation and 
facilities. Fulfilling this need will increase the amount of time visitors stay in this 
remote area, making tourism more sustainable, as well as bringing additional income 
to the local economy.  
 
5.80 The policy approach must seek to balance the development of visitor facilities 
throughout Northumberland with the protection of the uniq ue qualities of the County's 
natural and built environment, which are responsible for attracting many of the 
tourists in the first place. Development that involves new building must be prioritised 
in locations that are accessible, have complementary land u ses for tourists, can 
accommodate additional growth without causing significant environmental harm and 
have strong potential to attract visitors. At the same time, it is acknowledged that, 
from time to time, a small -scale building or structure may be neede d to serve a visitor 
attraction in a more isolated location - e.g. a visitor centre or toilet block. They may 
also be needed at locations where regular temporary events occur. Clearly such 
features would need to be capable of being absorbed into the local landscape as far 
as possible.  
 
Accommodation  for visitors  
 
5.81 There is a wide range of types of visitor accommodation in the County including all 
development falling within Use Class C1 (hotels and guest houses) as well as 
caravan, chalet and camping parks and facilities for business visitors such as 
conference and exhibition space.  
 
5.82 Hotel accommodation is a Main Town Centre Use and, wherever possible, this 
should be located within the centres of the County's Main Towns and Service 
Centres. A sequentia l approach to this type of accommodation will be applied, in line 
with the general approach for the development of Main Town Centre Uses.  
 
5.83 Other types of visitor accommodation are very often more suited to countryside 
locations. Small s cale permanent accommodation may be needed - e.g. to serve the 
long-distance walking and cycle routes mentioned above. These can be appropriately 
located in the countryside through the efficient use of existing buildings. This 
recognises the value of bring ing these buildings back into economic use. Failing this, 
the redevelopment of previously developed land may be acceptable. On occasion 
these approaches may not be viable or suitable for the business and so appropriately 
scaled and designed new buildings w ill be supported in accessible locations, where 
the development would improve and/or diversify Northumberland’s offer of tourism 
accommodation. Clearly, such accommodation would need to meet all other 
landscape and other environmental protection policies a nd have the ability to blend in 
with the settlement pattern and local landscape character.5. Economic  Development   
94  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  5.84 As far as non -permanent accommodation, such as caravans, chalets and campsites, 
are concerned, the approach taken will very much reflect the appropriate degree of 
protection that the area of the countryside in which the proposal is being made, with 
landscape character and visual impact, as well as the effects on local infrastructure 
and communities, being key considerations.  
 
 
 
Policy  ECN  15 
 
Tourism  and visitor  development  
 
1. Northumberland will be promoted and developed as a destination for tourists and 
visitors, while recognising the need to sustain and conserve the environment and 
local communities. As far as possible, planning decisions will facilitate the potential 
for Northumberland to be a destination for:  
 
a. heritage and cultural visits;  
b. cycling and walking holidays;  
c. landscape and nature based tourism;  
d. themed events, activity holidays;  
e. dark sky visits;  
f. weddings;  
g. out of season offer; and  
h. food and drink.  
 
2. This will be achieved through the development of new visitor attractions and 
facilities, accommodation and the expansion of existing tourism businesses, 
applying the following principles:  
 
a. Main Towns and Service Centres will be prioritised for the development of 
significant new facilities and accommodation;  
 
b. Where hotel development of over 2,500 square metres gross floorspace, 
proposed outside a defined town centre, meets the tests set out in Policy TCS 
4 and can therefore be sup ported, other Main Town Centre Uses that are truly 
ancillary to the hotel, will not themselves be subject to the sequential test;  
 
c. In rural locations outside the settlement boundaries and/or built -up areas of 
main towns, service centres or service villages , the development of new build, 
permanent buildings for holiday accommodation of any sort should be small 
scale and form part of a recognised village or hamlet;  
 
  5. Economic  Development   
95 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
d. In the open countryside, visitor accommodation should, wherever possible, be 
limited to the reuse of buildings that are structurally sound, or to chalets and 
caravans in accordance with part ( f) below. New permanent buildings for 
visitor accommodation will only be supported where they would:  
i. demonstrably improve and diversify the County's tourist offer and/or  clearly  
provide  necessary  accommodation  along  an established  touris t route;  and 
ii. be located  as close  as is practicable  to existing  development.  
 
e. The development of new build tourist accommodation in Kielder Water and 
Forest Par k will be supported to encourage visitors to spend more time in the 
park, providing there is no unacceptable adverse environmental impact, 
including on dark skies;  
 
f. New or extensions to existing sites for camping, caravans, and chalets will be 
supported in accessible locations outside the two AONBs and the World 
Heritage Site and its buffer zone, provided the development is adequately 
screened, taking into account short and long range views, by existing 
topography or vegetation or new good quali ty landscaping compatible with the 
surrounding landscape;  
 
g. Where there is a proven need to develop buildings, which do not include 
accommodation but would otherwise serve existing, established visitor or 
tourist attractions that are located in the open cou ntryside, the reuse of 
conveniently located, substantial buildings will be preferred.  
 
h. Tourism related developments that enhance the environment or bring 
neglected or underused heritage assets back into appropriate economic use 
will be strongly supported;  
 
i. In open countryside areas outside the two AONBs and the World Heritage Site 
and its buffer zone, new tourist development requiring larger buildings, 
totalling more than 500 square metres gross floorspace, in an open land 
setting, will be assessed on the p otential economic gain weighed against any 
possible harmful impacts and other plan policies. Comprehensive master 
planning should accompany such proposals;  
 
j. Promoting and protecting key routes through and around Northumberland 
followed by tourists and visi tors; 
 
k. Temporary events for visitors will be encouraged at suitably accessible 
locations by supporting any associated but ancillary structures if these would 
serve the needs of events for much of the year and meet the criteria in part (f) 
above.  
 
 
 
 
 5. Economic  Development   
96  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Green  Belt and the tourism  and visitor  economy  
 
5.85 The Northumberland Green Belt is very extensive, stretching up to 30 kilometres from 
the built -up area of Tyneside and covering in the region of 70,000 hectares in 
Northumberland alone. While larger settlemen ts within the extent of the Green Belt 
are inset, meaning that Green Belt restrictions do not apply within these towns and 
villages, numerous small settlements and groups of buildings are ‘washed over’ by 
the Green Belt and are subject to the limitations o n development imposed by Green 
Belt policy.  
 
5.86 The previous sections, dealing with the rural economy and tourism have sought to 
unlock the economic potential of countryside areas. It is true that most of the main 
countryside based tourist attractions - e.g. the North Northumberland Coast, 
medieval castles, Roman Wall, North Pennines, Kielder and (of course) the National 
Park - lie beyond the Green Belt. But the countryside areas that are the easiest to 
reach from the conurbation mostly lie within the Green Be lt. Day trippers from 
Tyneside and tourists who chose to base themselves there pass through these areas 
to reach the destinations beyond.  
 
5.87 It is considered important in the context of the objectives of this plan to include a 
planning approach that seeks to  capture some of the economic potential of Green 
Belt countryside, while maintaining fully the Green Belt’s protective role.  
 
5.88 National policy urges councils to plan positively to enhance the beneficial use of the 
Green Belt. Much of Northumberland’s Green Belt is rolling, managed farmland. It 
includes highly attractive countryside such as estate landscapes, incised river valleys 
and small woodlands. Nevertheless there is clear scope for landscape and 
biodiversity enhancements and, hand -in-hand with these, a  greater level of 
countryside access for informal recreation. More formal sport and recreational 
activities also have a legitimate role in the Green Belt context, especially near to  
larger settlements.  
 
5.89 All these types of uses have the potential to stimula te the economy and can be 
associated with business uses and employment generation, as well as significant 
visitor dwell -time and spending. While the Green Belt limits the scope for substantial 
buildings, there are ways in which modest built development, ne cessary for such 
businesses to operate successfully, can be realised and provide high quality 
contributions towards the wider economic and tourism strategies:  
• Through limited infilling within an existing (washed -over) group of buildings ; 
• Through  the use of derelict  brownfield  land;  
• Through  the conversion  of existing  buildings;  and 
• Through buildings that are small and discreet that are demonstrably ancillary  to 
open  space  uses  occupying  a large  expanse  of land.  5. Economic  Development

Green  Belt and tourism  and visitor  economy  
 
1. The potential of the Green Belt areas to contribute towards strategic economic  and 
tourism aims will be maximised, while ensuring that there would be no  greater 
impact on the Green Belt and the purposes of including land in it.   This will be 
achieved  by: 
 
a. Subject to national Green Belt policy, allowing open land uses that may lead to 
a reduction in operational farmland subject to:  
 
i. The ability  of the farm to continue  to operate;  and 
ii. The proposal  resulting  in a significant  increase  in the ability  of the publi c to 
access the countryside on foot, bicycle or on horseback and/or the   
creation  of a new or enhanced  visitor  attraction  of a type that would  be most  
appropriately  located  in a countryside  setting;  
 
b. Allowing new buildings that provide for employment -generating or tourism -
related uses, as limited infill within the built up form of settlements that are 
washed over by Green Belt, subject to any built conservation considerations;  
 
c. Allowing for the replacement of a building in employment -generating or 
tourism -related use, so long as the new building is in the same use and not 
materially larger than the one it replaces;  
 
d. Allowing employment generating or tourism development to occupy previously 
developed land (but not where temporary buildings have been sited) so long 
as the new buildings do not impact the openness of the Green Belt more than 
the buildings or structures that were previously on the site.  
 
2. Within the above restric tions, and in line with national Green Belt policy , proposals  
will be supported  if they:  
 
a. Allow an existing business and/or employment to continue or modestly grow in 
situ; 
 
b. Allow  for facilities  that contribute  to education,  training  and upskilling  that is 
connected to rural sectors including agriculture, horticulture and tourism.  5. Economic  Development   
98  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Military  establishments  
 
5.90 There are a number of defence and military related sites and facilities in 
Northumberland. These include:  
• Albermarle Barracks;   
• Ponteland  Rifle Range;  
• RAF Boulmer  (Main  site);  and 
• RAF Boulmer  Southern  Ops site. 
 
5.91 There are also numerous radar and communications sites in Northumberland. In 
addition, areas of Kielder and Wark Forest are used for training purposes. The 
Otterburn Training Area is located within Northumberland National Park and borders 
the plan area. Th ese sites and facilities play a role in terms of national defence and 
military capability and training. The Ministry of Defence is also a major employer  in 
Northumberland.  
 
5.92 Given the presence of these sites and facilities in Northumberland, it is important  to 
consider them in the Local Plan. There is an ongoing need to safeguard these 
facilities for defence purposes and to support further development to meet 
operational requirements at each of these sites in line with paragraph 9 7 of the NPPF  
(July 2021) . 
 
5.93 It is recognised that the Albermarle Barracks site and Ponteland Rifle Range site are 
located within the Green Belt. Any proposals at these locations would be considered 
within the constraints of the Green Belt.  
 
5.94 There are currently no key sites within Nor thumberland that have been announced 
for disposal by the Ministry of Defence. Should any sites become redundant and be 
proposed for disposal, their redevelopment should be considered through a  
masterplan approach to ensure this is considered in a holistic way. Given the rural 
settings of the sites, important considerations would be their accessibility and  
infrastructure capacity. Consideration will also be given to the suitability of the 
buildings for retention or re -use and retaining and enhancing areas fo r wildlife, areas 
of green space and landscaping measures. Where applicable, development would 
additionally need to be considered within the constraints of Green Belt policy.

2. Non-military or non -defence related development within or in the areas around a 
defence or military site will not be supported where it would adversely affect 
military operations or capability, unless it can be demonstrated that there is no 
longer a defence or military need for the site.  
 
3. Subject to national Green Belt policy, proposals for the redevelopment, conversion 
and re -use of redundant defence sites will be supported.  
 
4. Proposals for both military and defence related development and the 
redevelopment of redundant defence sites should:  
 
a. Be sympathetic to the character of the site and its su rrounding area and where 
possible, retain and enhance areas for wildlife, green space and landscaping; 
and 
 
b. Provide mitigation in terms of any adverse effects on local infrastructure

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services  
 
Introduction  
 
6.1 Northumberland's town and village centres are key to the functioning of the County’s 
economy. They are not only shopping centres but provide essential community 
services. They are the focus of significant employment opportun ities. In this context, 
it is important to note that all projections regarding likely new jobs created in the next 
15 to 20 years show that the vast majority will be in the types of employment that do 
not require specific new land allocations - i.e. includ ing the types of jobs typically 
found in the County’s town, village and local centres.  
 
6.2 In terms of the Plan's objectives, this means that centres help to achieve the 
'Economy and Jobs' objective and engender 'Community Health and Wellbeing'. As 
accessible  locations they help with the 'Climate Change' objective. Also, if the Plan’s 
objective of securing better 'Quality of Place' is to be realised, town centres present a 
clear focus for that quality.  
 
6.3 Northumberland includes town centres where considerable numbers of people rely 
on the jobs and services that they provide - sometimes from wide rural hinterlands. 
They cannot simply be retail centres but must also offer a range of essential services, 
leisure opportunities, jobs and businesses , and places to live.  
 
6.4 These roles sit within the context that these centres are the most long -established 
parts of the settlements and contain a significant proportion of the County's assets of 
historic significance - something that can attract additional visit ors but which can 
present constraints on future development opportunities. They have to act as cultural, 
social and economic centres, catering for many modern -day needs while conserving 
their historical significance.  
 
6.5 The main aims of the Local Plan for to wn centres are:  
• To establish  and maintain  their relative  roles  as service  centres  for residents  and 
visitors;  
• To bolster  their roles  as community  hubs  by allowing  for a wide range  of uses  
including shopping, other essential and non -essential services, leis ure facilities, 
offices  and other  workplaces,  as well as an increasing residential  presence;  
• To make  sure that they are not constrained  in fulfilling  these  roles,  physically  or in 
policy  terms;  
• To ensure that key uses are concentrated to the extent that the centres continue 
to be vibrant  and vital without  stifling  expansion  and innovation;  and 
• To provide scope for good transport access including space for public transport, 
pedestrians,  cyclists,  wheelchairs  and sufficient  car parking.  6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
101 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Retailing  
 
6.6 Shopping has traditionally often been thought of as the lynchpin of town centres - the 
main reason for visiting them. However, Northumberland's town centres have always 
served a much wider role than just shopping and, due to rapidly changing retail 
environment, it is more important than ever to plan the County's centres to be diverse 
with a compr ehensive range of essential services and attractions.  
 
6.7 Developments  and trends  which  will influence  the future  planning  of town  and key 
village  centres  are: 
• Changes to the planning use classes  that make it much easier for premises to 
move between retail and a number of service and employment uses.  
• The accelerating  growth  in online shopping  and the consequent  reduction  in 
footfall  on high streets  and reduced  potential  for investment  in ‘bricks  and mortar’.  
• High street adaptation  of retailing to these new trends with additional services 
and the growth  of niche  shops.  
• Supermarket diversification  - large stores widening their offer to include  more 
durable items, the growth of the 'discounters' in more medium size stores  and the 
emergence  of smaller  convenience  shops  on high streets.  
• Increased  popularity of cafes and leisure facilities  so that they become  
increasingly  appropriate  for key high street frontages.  
• Risk reduction  investment strategies  by the main  retail  chains  meaning  that any 
closures  are likely  to affect  smaller  town  centres  and any new investment  likely  to 
be in regional  centres.  
 
Maintaining  a hierarchy  of centres  
 
6.8 A large part of south and central Northumberland lies within the strong influence  of 
the main  regional  centres  of Newcastle  and the Metrocentre.  The northern  and 
western extremities of the County are influenced by the more distant regional  centres  
of Edinburgh  and Carlisle  respectively.  
 
 
6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
102  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  6.9 The Local Plan recognises that Northumberland's  centres  will always  be positioned  
below these strategic hubs in terms of importance and influence. However a key  
challenge is to avoid the County's centres dropping fur ther behind, as investment  is 
concentrated in regional centres which can already offer a wide -ranging visitor  
experience. In short, the centres of Northumberland's market towns may need to  'run 
in order  to stay still'. 
 
6.10 Evidence  helps  to define  a hierarchy  of centres,  based  mainly  on their retail  and 
leisure  offer.  As this approach  relies  on quantitative data, and it is the relative position 
of centres that is being measured, this continues to be an appropriate way of defining 
a hierarchy. Other measures may become appropriate as town centres evolve. 
Northumberland's main towns, as defined in Policy TCS 1, are split into two tiers as 
far as the town centre offer is concerned, with the service centres, in effect forming a 
third tie r and more local facilities a fourth:  
 
• Main towns - larger centres:  Alnwick, Ashington, Berwick -upon -Tweed, Blyth, 
Cramlington, Morpeth and Hexham all have a good level of retail  provision along 
with wide ranging town centre community facilities. They are hubs for public 
transport and offer a good level of off -street car parking.  They can be regarded 
as pivotal points for community activity, jobs and services for large populations 
and wide hinterlands.  
• Main town - smaller centres:  Amble, Bedlington and Halt whistle, Ponteland and 
Prudhoe have good local retail provision along with a reasonable range of town 
centre community facilities, serving the towns themselves and all except 
Bedlington also with modest rural hinterlands. These centres are accessible by 
public transport being on regular bus routes linking them to larger centres and 
some of their surrounding settlements.  
• Service Centres:  Allendale, Belford, Bellingham, Corbridge, Haydon Bridge, 
Newbiggin -by-the-Sea, Rothbury, Seahouses, Seaton Delaval and Wo oler are 
the settlements that are categorised in the second tier of the main hierarchy. 
They have a range of mainly essential services and serve hinterlands (some are 
extensive and rural), so allowing visits to larger centres further afield to be less 
frequent.  
• Below these sit:  
o Other  village  centres  providing  for the most  essential  day-to-day local 
service  needs  of the population  of one or two rural parishes;  
o Suburban  parades  of shops  and services  serving  the same  purpose. 
These  are increasingly  difficult  to define,  often  being  taken  over by non-
essential  services  or spread  out along  radial  routes.  
 
6.11 Policy  TCS 1 sets the hierarchy  and the levels  of protection  afforded  to centres,  in 
general terms, and seeks to maintain and bolster their positions in this hierarchy  
relative to other tiers and the regional centres that rank above them. The more  
detailed approach to protection in relation to the top three tiers in the hierarchy - their 
vitality and viability - are dealt with in the policies that follow. Where  communities are 
strongly dependent on the continuity of particular local services,  these  issues  are 
covered  as part of the wider  approach  to community  facilities  set out in Chapter  14.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
Policy  TCS 1 
 
Hierarchy  of centres  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. A hierarchy of centres is defined as follows:  
 
a. Main  towns  - larger  centres:  Alnwick,  Ashington,  Berwick -upon -Tweed,  Blyth,  
Cramlington,  Morpeth  and Hexham;  
b. Main town - smaller centres: Amble, Bedlington and Haltwhistle, Ponteland 
and Prudhoe;  
c. Service Centres: Allendale, Belford, Bellingham, Corbridge, Haydon Bridge, 
Newbiggin -by-the-Sea, Rothbury, Seahouses, Seaton Delaval and Wooler ; 
d. Other small parades or c lusters of shops and related services in towns and 
larger villages not part of the centres defined above.  
 
2. In assessing development proposals, growth within centres will be supported and 
encouraged at a scale which helps to maintain and reinforce their rol es within the 
hierarchy, as well as their relationship with regional centres.  
 
3. Proposals that seek to replace significant areas of Main Town Centre Uses with 
other uses will be resisted if it is demonstrable that this would undermine the 
centre’s overall r ole and position within the hierarchy.  
 
 
 
Defining  centres  in Main  Towns  
 
6.12 The Local Plan needs to include clear definitions of Northumberland's town centres if 
it is to be successful at promoting them as hubs for their communities and as service 
centres for people living in their catchment areas, as well as for visitors.  The centres 
must be vital and viable, which can best be achieved by directing 'Main Town Centre 
Uses', such as large shops, leisure centres and hotels, towards certain defined areas 
while discouraging them elsewhere.  
 
6.13 Centres have therefore been carefully defined, based on evidence regarding clusters 
of activity, as well as past consultations (e.g. those connected with neighbourhood 
planning). The five smaller town centr es have been given a single 'Town Centre 
Boundary', while the seven larger centres, with larger populations and wider ranges 
of facilities, have also been given tightly drawn 'Primary Shopping Areas', so as to 
keep key shopping streets as vibrant as possib le. 
 
 
Policy  TCS 2 
Defining  centres  in Main  Towns  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. Town  Centre  and Primary  Shopping  Area  boundaries  are defined  on the Policies  
Map.  These  may be subject  to review  or updating  in Neighbourhood  Plans.  Main  
Town Centre Uses should be located within these boundaries, unless there are  
positive planning reasons to locate them elsewhere that outweigh other policy  
considerations.  6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
104  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Establishing  the role of Northumberland's  centres  
 
6.14 The Council has gathered and intermittently updated evidence on people's spending 
patterns, their shopping and leisure habits and how these factors relate to the 
performance of Northumberland's town centres. This allows an assessment of the 
health of the centres and whether or not they are meeting their rol es as multi -
functional community hubs. Key to this is how they provide for shopping needs. If a 
centre fails in this, it is essentially failing as a centre.  
 
6.15 However, to be fully successful, they must offer a whole array of other accessible 
services, some essential, some leisure related, as well as being foci for work and 
business. This is especially true of the type and size of market town that 
characterises Northumberland. Continual reinvention and adaptation are needed. 
Planning for centres often has to be more aspirational than the raw growth forecasts 
suggest.  
 
6.16 Evidence shows that a range of planning approaches have helped Northumberland's 
centres to keep pace with each other and with regional centres:  
• The need to retain a strong retail presence  has been paramount in policy 
decisions on key frontages and the town centres as a whole;  
• There has been recognition that non-retail uses , such as cafes and leisure 
service uses can contribute to vibrancy on the high street and reduce vacant 
shop space;  
• The granting of permission for larger format stores  (often on edge -of-centre 
sites) has attracted national chains so keeping some spending in the town that 
may otherwise have leaked elsewhere;  
• Despite competition from national chains, the historic nature of many of 
Northumberland's town centres has helped protect a range of local independent 
retailers  that contributes to the range and interest of the shopping offer;  
• The use of flexible policy approaches to allow niche markets  (including 
temporary ‘pop -up’ sho ps etc.) to be developed in centres has been considered 
against the need to keep key essential services and a degree of stability;  
• The encouragement of residential uses  in town centres, to add a sense of 
community and security, and fill voids such as above  shops, has been 
considered against the need to keep a strong representation of shops and 
services and against possible conflicts like noise pollution and parking issues;  
• Initiatives relating to parking restrictions or pedestrianisation  have been 
looked at  in relation to any negative effects on local businesses.  
 
6.17 The roles of Northumberland's town centres will continue to be enhanced by 
continuing many of these approaches, but also by further diversifying their provision 
in terms of services, jobs and homes . 6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
105 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appropriate  enhancements  to individual  centres  
 
6.18 From the above, it is clear that opportunities must be sought to allow centres to 
expand in scale with the growth in the number of residents and their spending power, 
increased visitor numbers, innovations in the range and type of services  that can be 
offered and many other factors. A separate background paper32 contains the analysis 
that takes forward of the shopping and leisure habits of Northumberland residents 
and visitors, patterns of spending growth and retail trends.  
 
6.19 The initial conclusions identify what would be needed, and when, if the solution to 
maintaining the retail and leisure role of each town is expressed in terms of land 
needed to accommodate brand new floorspace. The initial conclusions are:  
• Cramlington  and Ashington  would  benefit  from additional  shopping  and leisure -
related space in the sh ort-term and may require up to 6 hectares each within the 
plan period.  
• Berwick -upon -Tweed  and Blyth  would  benefit  from additional  retail  capacity  in 
the short - to medium -term - particularly  for comparison  shopping  - requiring  up 4 
hectares in each of these  two towns within the plan period. However, in  the case 
of Berwick -upon -Tweed, with further proposals on the outskirts and  little land 
available in the historic core, solutions other than land allocations  will be needed  
to allow  the town  centre  to remain  vibrant  and complement  the additional  
floorspace  elsewhere  in the town.  
• Morpeth, Hexham  and Alnwick , i.e. the remaining 'large centres', are  
reasonably well provided for at present but may have scope for more floorspace 
in the medium term, (although  Morpeth would benefit from further choice of  
convenience  retailing  in the fairly  short  term).  Up to 3 hectares  may be needed  in 
each  of these  towns  by the end of the plan period,  (although  less in Alnwick  if the 
scheme  that currently  has permission  proceeds).  
• Amble, Bedlington, Haltwhistle, Ponteland  and Prudhoe  - i.e. all of those  
Main  Towns  with smaller  centres  - currently  retain  relatively  small  proportions  of 
the total spending  potential  of their populations.  In Haltwhistle  and Prudhoe  
particularly, current shops are few in number but trade well so that these centres 
would benefit from modest additional shopping choice in either the short - or 
medium -term but the land needed (by the end of the plan period) to fulfil this  
would  be minimal  - certainly  less than a hectare  in all cases.  Again,  proposals  
that do come forward in these smaller towns tend to be away from their older  
central areas, meaning that, while spending will be drawn back into the town  as a 
whole, innovative approach es will be required to keep the centres  themselves  
vibrant.  
 
6.20 The background analysis also assesses the influence of each of these factors on the 
ability of (or the need for) each centre to expand to the extent that the initial 
conclusions suggested. Ashing ton offers the greatest scope, followed in equal  
second place by Blyth and Cramlington, then Bedlington and Prudhoe. The two 
centres least equipped to accommodate significant extra floorspace are Alnwick and 
Hexham.

106  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  6.21 The Background Paper sets out detailed conclusions for each centre for the plan 
period, and these are summarised in Table 6.1 and reflected in Policy TCS 3.  
 
Table  6.1 Summary  of findings  and proposed  approach  for each  centre  
 
Ashington  A robust approach to delivering scope for additional retail, large scale 
leisure, bus station and other relevant town centre uses - achieved 
through:  
• Considering an area in the north east quadrant of the Town Centre 
for these purposes;  
• Encouraging renewal of some existing frontages along Station 
Road and Woodhorn Road.  
Cramlington  A robust approach to delivering scope for additional retail, large scale 
leisure and other relevant town centre uses - achieved through:  
• Considering an area in the south of Manor Walks and Forum Way 
for these purposes;  
• Allowing for further intensification within the existing centre.  
Blyth  A robust approach to bringing any future additions to its offer into the 
town centre - achieved through:  
• Considering an area to the north and east of Keel Row for these 
purposes, which will include existing uses such as the bus station, 
which would be retained/replaced within the site;  
• Encouraging renewal within frontages and blocks surrounding the 
Market Square, Bowes Street and Regent Street.  
Berwick -upon -Tweed  A strong approach to ensure that any significant future additions to 
floorspace are as close as possible to the town centre - achieved 
through:  
• A criteria -based approach to allow for small scale opportunities for 
enhancement of the Conse rvation Area through partial 
redevelopment that would deliver some additional retail space with 
large floor -plates;  
• Examining any development options that could achieve larger 
floorplates in locations within 300m of the edge of the Primary 
Shopping Area, s ubject to appropriate impact testing  
Morpeth  Recognition that scope exists for some additional retail and leisure 
floorspace but that, given the widely drawn Primary Shopping Area and 
Town Centre boundaries, these could be accommodated without the 
need for particular areas to be outlined - also achieved through:  
• A criteria -based approach to allow for small scale opportunities for 
enhancement of the Conservation Area through partial  
redevelopment that would deliver some additional retail space with 
large floor -plates.  6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
107 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
 
 
6.22 Offices  are a key element  in the mix of uses  found  in town  centres.  It is particularly  
important that offices which rely on frequent public access, such as banks and  
professional services, should  have  a town  centre  location.  However  all offices  have  
high employment densities: they therefore not only benefit from a central, accessible 
position  but their employees  can significantly  increase  footfall  and spending  within  
the centre. It is difficult to secure stand -alone privately funded office schemes in  most 
of Northumberland for reasons of viability. Therefore they should be  encouraged  as 
part of mixed  use schemes.  
 
6.23 With significant changes to development use classes and permitted development 
rights, as well as societal changes such as different ways of working and of 
accessing services, det ailed schemes may include a wider mix of land uses. 
However, the need to maintain, and in some cases, boost the role of centres remains 
essentially as described.  
 
  
 
 
 
Alnwick  No urgency for more significant additions to floorspace. No land 
allocations required. Nevertheless, from a qualitative point of view, there 
would be benefits if any additional floorspace were within the existing 
centre - achieved through:  
• A criteria -based approach to allow for small scale opportunities for 
enhancement of the Conservation Area through partial  
redevelopment that would deliver some additional retail space with 
large floor -plates.  
 
 
 
 
Hexham  No urgency for more significant additions to floorspace. No land 
allocations required. Nevertheless, from a qualitative point of view, there 
would be benefits if any additional floorspace were within the existing 
centre - achieved through:  
• A criteria -based approach to allow for small scale opportunities for 
enhancement of the Conservation Area through partial  
redevelopment that would deliver some additional retail space with 
large floor -plates.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Smaller  Centres  A positive approach is needed in order to facilitate modern retail 
floorspace on a modest scale which may help counteract leaking 
expenditure - achieved through:  
• Considering areas for new town centre development to the rear of 
the north side of Front Street,  Prudhoe, north of Front Street, 
Bedlington, at Merton Road, Ponteland, north west of Queen Street, 
Amble and south of the B6322, Haltwhistle;  
• Encouraging renewal of some existing frontages along Front Street, 
Prudhoe;  
• A criteria -based approach to allow f or small scale opportunities for 
enhancement of the conservation areas through partial  
redevelopment that would deliver some additional retail space with 
large floor -plates in Amble, Bedlington and Haltwhistle.  6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
108  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  6.24 The Council recognises that the centres of its market towns and larger villages are 
not nece ssarily accessible for all residents, including some living in outlying suburbs 
of the towns themselves. It therefore places great importance on retaining small scale 
shops, community meeting places and other essential community services within 
reach of as  many residents as possible. As such, the last part of the policy below 
aims to retain such facilities in situ, particularly if their loss would result in the 
absence of such services within easy reach of significant numbers of people.  
 
 
 
Policy  TCS 3 
 
Maintaining  and enhancing  the role of centres  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. Northumberland's town and village centres will be supported and promoted,  
through  planning  decisions,  in their role as: 
 
a. Community  and service  hubs;  
b. Vital and viable  centres  for shopping,  business,  culture  and leisure;  and 
c. Places  to live, work  and visit. 
 
2. This will be achieved in main towns by identifying opportunities and supporting  
proposals for developments which are physically and functionally integrated with  
and add choice  to the existing shopping and related service offer in the Primary 
Shopping Area and a wide range of Main Town Centre Uses in the wider Town 
Centre - spec ifically:  
 
a. Within or, where opportunities are lacking and sequential and impact testing 
allow, immediately abutting Town Centre boundaries, promoting the 
development of schemes involving a mix of appropriate Main Town Centre 
Uses, allowing an element of residential as part of any mixed use scheme. 
This will include:  
 
i. Blyth Town Centre, especially co nsidering opportunities to the north  and 
east of Keel Row,  including  a replacement  bus station,  should  the 
existing  bus station  be displaced;  
ii. Ashington  Town  Centre,  to the north -east of the town  centre,  including  
the possibility  of a new bus station  somewhere  within  the overall  area;  
iii. Cramlington Town Centre, especially the opportunities offered by vacant 
buildings  to the south  of Manor  Walks;  
iv. Bedlington,  to the rear of the north  side of Front  Street  within  the 
constraints  of the Conservation  Area;  
v. Prudhoe,  to the rear of the north  side of Front  Street;  
vi. Haltwhistle, to the south of the B6322, area including the existing service 
station;  
vii. Ponteland,  in the vicinity  of Merton  Road;  
viii. Amble,  including  land north  west of Queen  Street.  
 
 
 6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
109 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
b. Encouraging and supporting schemes for the renewal of blocks and frontages, 
especially where this will result in more modern shopping, leisure or office 
floorspace, offering larger floorplates, provided that this will not alter the 
historic layout or h arm the character or historic significance of the town centre 
concerned. This will include consideration of such opportunities in:  
 
i. Blyth Town Centre, areas around the Market Place, Regent Street and 
Bowes Street;  
ii. Ashington Town Centre, along parts of Station Road and Woodhorn 
Road;  
iii. Prudhoe Town Centre, along parts of Front Street.  
 
c. Further intensification of uses within Manor Walks, Cramlington . 
 
d. Within the constraints of built conservation policies, allowing for small scale 
opportunities for enhancement of town centre offer including, if possible, the 
introduction of larger floor -plates, in the defined centres of Alnwick, Berwick -
upon -Tweed, Morpe th, Hexham, Bedlington, Amble and Haltwhistle.  
 
3. Within Service Centres, and in other villages where there are clusters of services, 
new provision should be within a scale appropriate to meeting the shopping, 
leisure or other service requirements of residen ts living in those settlements and 
their catchments;  
 
4. All development of additional Main Town Centre Uses will be considered positively 
if it will deliver social, economic and/or environmental benefits for the centre 
concerned, but it must be in scale with  the size and function of the centre, taking 
into account the overall size of the settlement and its catchment and planned 
growth of that settlement over the plan period.  
 
5. Schemes that will facilitate the continuation of established town centre businesses 
in situ or elsewhere within the defined town centres will be supported.  
 
6. The location of purpose -built offices in defined Town Centres and their inclusion as 
part of mixed use schemes will be encouraged and supported.  
 
7. Town Centres will be promoted as places to live and work through the 
encouragement of a mix of residential and office use on upper floors on main 
shopping streets and other appropriate locations, especially if this leads to the 
reoccupation of disused premises and provided it would not, i ndividually or 
cumulatively, lead to an unacceptable reduction in vitality and viability or limit the 
operation of an existing established 'Main Town Centre' service or business.  
 
8. The unnecessary loss of valued facilities and services will be resisted, par ticularly 
where this would reduce the community’s ability to meet its day -to-day needs; this 
will especially apply to any significant loss of local community uses in Use Class 
F2 or the total loss of a parade of shops and services.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
 
Significant  propos als outside  centre  
 
6.25 In respect of Main Town Centres, the approach set out above promotes their role 
within the defined boundaries, as well as outlining some areas for possible expansion 
which may stretch beyond the current boundary lines.  
• Any detailed proposals falling beyond the defined centres, including within any 
expansion areas that stretch beyond the current boundaries, will need to be 
assessed, first, to ensure where appropriate that no more central a site is 
available, through the use o f a proportionate sequential test. While sequential 
tests  will normally be used in order to support the ‘town centre first’ policy, there 
may be occasions where it is legitimate to promote a main town centre use in 
another location, e.g. to ensure that vi tal local services are maintained and/or if 
the only viable location for development considered essential for a particular town 
is out of centre.  
• For proposals above certain ‘threshold’ sizes, it will be necessary to assess their 
likely impact on the vital ity and viability of the centre. This allows the option of not 
going ahead with, or refusing the development if the impact is not acceptable. 
The thresholds used are appropriate for Northumberland and are based on the 
overall scale of the County's centres and their vulnerability to out -of-centre 
development.  
 
6.26 Where impact testing is required, it should assess the net and (where relevant) 
cumulative impact of the proposal on the vitality and viability of any centre from which 
the proposal may derive its spen ding or its users. Whether such impact is acceptable 
will depend on a combination of factors including the existing health of the centre and 
how this will affect its ability to withstand impacts from competing development within 
the defined centre, any red uction in local consumer choice, any increase in vacant or 
dead frontages and/or any loss or delay to planned investment.

Proposals  outside  centres  
 
1. Where proposals for main town centre uses come forward on sites outside  defined  
town  centre  boundaries,  and they are of a scale  that would  be inappropriate in a 
less accessible location, they will be subject, first to proportionate and appropriate 
sequential testing and then, if a suitable more central site cannot be identified, to 
impact testing, as follows:  
 
a. Proposals that would add  more than 1 ,000 square metres gross retail 
floorspace : 
 
i. In Larger  Town  Centres,  those  beyond  Primary  Shopping  Area  
boundaries;  or 
ii. In Smaller Town Centres, those beyond Town Centre boundaries  
 
b. Proposals for leisure -related buildings of 2 ,500 square metres gross 
floorspace, not linked with wider open space activities, that are beyond defined 
Town Centre boundaries.  
 
2. Where  the above  testing  demonstrates  that the Main  Town  Centre  Use can only 
be accommodated  in an edge - or out-of-centre  location,  priority  should  be given  to 
accessible  sites well connected  to the town  centre  or (failing  that) connected  to 
other  existing  services,  and, wherever  possible,  be well related  to residential  
areas.  
 
3. Development of Main Town Centre Uses that are away from defined centres,  
below  the thresholds  in part 1 of this Policy,  and in the built-up areas  of towns  and 
villages,  will not be subject  to the above  testing,  but should:  
 
a. Wherever possible, contribute to the range and choice of services offered in 
the local area; and  
 
b. Be accessible and well related to existing services.  6. Town  Centres  and Central  Services   
112  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Keeping  high  streets  vibrant  
 
6.27 Northumberland’s historic town centres all have key streets, squares and frontages 
where most people congregate and where the centres are at their most vibrant. 
Traditionally, it has been retail shops and markets that have drawn people to these 
places but this has been changing as leisure -time services, such as restaurants, bar s 
and fitness clubs  have become interspersed with shops, banks and other financial 
institutions. This integration has been vital to the continued success of these centres 
in terms of daytime activity, the evening economy and in catering for visitors.  
 
6.28 However evolving patterns of living, working, leisure and spending are bringing 
increasingly rapid change to the high street, which could see their role as vibrant 
hubs of human activity significantly diminished.  
 
6.29 In order to prevent this, there remains a ne ed to retain a strong element of shop front 
activity in the busiest parts of centres - high streets, malls, market places and 
squares, which are identified and monitored through ‘health check’  surveys  that look 
at footfall and other key indicators.  
 
6.30 Within these locations , the approach traditionally used, of seeking to maximise the 
percentage of certain ‘Key Shopping Frontages’ that are occupied by vibrant uses will 
continue , with the aim of retail continuing as the key driver. However, with closures of 
many high street shops, greater allowance in how uses can change will give the 
flexibility necessary to reflect the wider purpose of town centres by allowing for other 
types of uses that also add to the vitality of the high street. Shops will be able to  
change to a range of leisure uses as well as certain types of workplace. This should 
help to minimise vacancies and maintain or increase footfall and average ‘dwell time’ 
(the total length of visits to the centre), as long as a high percentage of ‘active 
frontages’ are retained. Some Neighbourhood Plans have developed their own 
approaches for  their high streets,  based  on local evidence.  
 
6.31 Other  ways  in which  High Streets  can be improved,  enhanced  and kept as vibrant  
foci for town  centres  include:  
• Improvemen ts to the public realm , through  maintaining  and enhancing  areas  for 
markets  and events,  initiatives  such  as pedestrianisation,  seating,  local 
information and ancillary facilities such as public toilets, having clear regard to 
the needs of people with protected characteristics, such as disability; and  
• Clear guidance on the design of shop fronts, especially where the streets 
concerned are an impo rtant part of the historic environment or the local character 
of the town or village centre; and  
• Making sure ease of access  - on foot, by bicycle, by public transport and via 
parking  facilities  are as good  as possible  for visitors  to the heart  of a centre,  
including  adapting  centres  for new access  needs  such  as short -stay ‘click -and-
collect’.

Keeping  high  streets  vibrant  
 
1. Within defined Town Centres, the Council will seek to maintain and enhance 
vitality and viability through geographically specific policy approaches.  
 
2. Key Shopping Frontages are defined on the Policies Map for the seven Main town 
larger centres. Within these frontages, the Council will seek to maximise the active 
frontage through supporting and encouraging Use Class E shops, restaurants and 
cafes and, on a limited basis, other uses, subject to:  
 
a. Not supporting applications, if this would take the length of the active ground 
floor frontage to below 75% of the length of the Key Shopping Frontage;  
b. Not supporting ho t food takeaways on Key Shopping Frontages except in 
exceptional circumstances;  
c. Supporting changes to other main town centre uses on the ground floor 
frontage of the Key Shopping Frontage, where it can be demonstrated that this 
would result in an increase in the active street frontage;  
d. Permitting variation from (a) to (c) above where the unit concerned has been 
vacant for more than a year and the overall vacancy level of the Key Shopping 
Frontage exceeds 10% of the units  that have  a ground  floor frontage.  
 
3. Improvements in the public realm of centres will be designed to encourage  people  
to visit the centre  more  and remain  there  longer,  through  measures  such  as 
pedestrianisation, seating, landscaping, complementary services and  controlling  
shop  front design;  these  aspects  should:  
 
a. Adhere to the design policies elsewhere in the Plan and any design guidance 
that forms  part of the Northumberland  Design  Guide;  
b. Cater  for the needs  of people  with disabilities;  and 
c. Comply with the requirements of Policy QOP 3 Public Realm Design  
Principles.  
 
4. Proposals  will ensure  that there  is no loss of public  spaces  in central,  accessible  
locations that have the capacity to host markets or other events and activities  
appropriate  to town  centres.  
 
5. Within the constraints of res idential amenity, businesses that are likely to  
contribute to the evening economy and remain open late will be encouraged  and 
supported  to the extent  that they would  add to the vitality  of streets  but, those on 
Key Shopping Frontages, should not detract through being closed and shuttered 
during the day.  
 
6. Proposals will ensure that public transport stopping areas, car and cycle parking, 
short stay drop -off and collection points, and pedestrian and cycle routes into and 
around town centres are fit f or purpose to serve the access requirements of their 
main areas of activity.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Hot food  takeaways  
 
6.32 Hot food takeaways  are now a familiar  feature  of town  centres  and other  shopping  
centres and are regarded by many as an essential service. They can proliferate  and 
cluster in town centres or among shops that line main routes in and out of  towns. This 
can change the character of these locations through indiscriminate  parking and other 
disturbances such as noise and smells late at night. As such,  when clustered 
together, they can detract from the role of centres as vibrant  shopping  and service  
centres.  
 
6.33 In recent years, they have been associated with encouraging unhealthy eating,  
especially among children. As such there are strong and supportable r easons for  
excluding  them  from the immediate  surroundings  of schools.  In addition,  there  are 
strong reasons to limit their numbers where there is already a proliferation of  
takeaways or where there are higher than average numbers of younger children  
alread y falling  into the overweight  categories.  
 
6.34 Assessment of the numbers of hot food takeaways locally is based on information 
from the Local Land and Property Gazetteer. Its classification of 'Fast food outlets / 
Takeaways' is the same as that used nationally . It is based on business rates / VOA 
data, which, in turn, is informed by planning application information and 
supplemented by local intelligence from Environmental Health, Fire and Rescue (fire 
safety visits) and others. The Council will seek to ensure t hat the Local Land and 
Property Gazetteer remains up to date, and is informed by the latest and most 
accurate data.  
 
6.35 The implementation of Policy TCS 6 will rely on regular monitoring. As such, the 
Council will annually, publish (and use to inform decision  making) data on: hot food 
takeaway establishments per 1 ,000 resident population in each Main Town or 
electoral division based on the Local Land and Property Gazetteer; and prevalence 
of overweight or obesity in Year 6 pupils. When planning applications fo r hot food 
takeaways are assessed, Geographical Information Systems will be used to calculate 
the 400  metres  walking distance from schools, as referenced within the policy.  
 
6.36 Finally there has been a tendency for takeaways to occupy units in local parades a nd 
even in villages, which may only have a very limited retail presence of essential local 
services. Therefore, where the last such unit in such a parade or the final shop or 
public house in a village are proposed as a takeaway it is reasonable to resist this 
change.

Hot food  takeaways  
 
1. New hot food takeaways will be supported where all of the following apply:  
 
a. They are within a Main Town or, otherwise, within an electoral division where 
no more than 35.3 % of Year 6 pupils are classified as overweight or obese33;  
 
b. They are within a Main Town or, otherwise, within an electoral division where 
the number of approved hot food takeaway establishments per 1 ,000 resident 
population, based on the latest data from the Local Land and Property 
Gazetteer, is less than the Northumberland average of 0.6 per 1 ,000 resident 
population in March 2018;  
 
c. They are over 400 metres walk from any entrance gate of any existing or  
proposed  school  or college  with students  under  the age of 18 years;  
 
d. They  will not create  or add to a cluster  of three  or more  adjacent  hot food 
takeaways within a 100 metre radius of any given point;  
 
e. They will not be replacing the last convenience shop or public house in a 
village or the last convenience shop in a  parade of shops that serve a 
residential area;  
 
f. They would not create safety hazards for pedestrians or other users of the 
public highway;  
 
g. They  will not have  an adverse  effect  on the living  conditions  of any nearby  
residents from noise or disturbance or litter or odours or that any such  
disturbance  can be suitably  mitigated.

116  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  7. Housing  
 
Introduction  
 
7.1 The vision for housing is based on the principle that having a decent home is 
fundamental to the health and wellbeing of everyone living in Northumberland. The 
Plan objectives include extending housing choice across Northumberland by 
delivering homes for existing and future communities and to support the 
Northumberland economy, alongside providing well -designed and affordable homes 
to meet the diverse needs of an ageing population.  
 
7.2 With some 152,219 dwellings34 and other communal residential accommodation  at 
the plan period baseline in 2016, over 90% of the County’s housing that will be  here 
in 20 years  already  exists.  It is therefore  crucial  that the quality  of this existing  
housing stock is maintained, and adapted and improved where necessary, to ensure 
those  dwellings  continue  to meet  the changing  future  needs  of the County's  
residents, particularly as there i s the need to cater for an increasing proportion of 
older people.  
 
7.3 There is nevertheless an identified need to increase the supply of housing across  the 
County to meet  projected  population  and household  growth  in Northumberland,  
alongside  supporting  local economic  growth.  The Council  is committed  to meeting  the 
diverse housing needs of Northumberland's existing and new residents, by  providing 
a choice of decent and affordable homes, including specialist  accommodation with 
support. To achieve  well-balanced,  sustainable  and attractive  neighbourhoods where 
people want to live, work and prosper, the Local Plan needs to ensure  that new 
homes  are developed  in the right places,  at the right times  and of the right scale  and 
type for the right occupants,  while  respecting  and protecting  this beautiful  County.  
 
7.4 The strategic approach to housing provision is underpinned by the Government's  
NPPF  requirement  to positively  seek  opportunities  to meet  the identified  needs  for 
housing, significantly boosting the supply of housing to help support wider  
opportunities for economic growth while enabling sufficient flexibility to quickly adapt 
to changes  in circumstances  that may occur.  
 
Making  the best use of the existing  housing  stock  
 
7.5 Northumberland's housing market does not generally suffer from the problems 
associated with low demand and abandonment that some other parts of North East 
England have seen, with all Council -owned and the majority of private secto r 
dwellings now satisfying the Government's Decent Homes Standard. However, 
pockets of low demand and long -term empty dwellings (i.e. vacant for more than six 
months) are nevertheless evident within some parts of the County. The Council  will 
encourage and continue to actively support and implement initiatives to revitalise the 
existing residential areas and enable many of these long -term empty homes  to be 
brought back into use35.

117 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  7.6 Northumberland has a relatively high proportion of vacant dwellings, with 9,50 9 
recorded as at the Census 2011 (including over 2,300 long -term empty homes), 
representing a 6.4% vacancy rate (compared to the England average of 2.6%).  The 
housing market requires a small proportion of vacant dwellings (typically about 3%) to 
enable property turnover for the market to function efficiently, but there has been a 
significant increase from the 3.5% proportion recorded in the previous  Census 2001. 
This is considered to be largely as a result of the rapidly increasing numbers of 
seco nd and holiday homes without a usual permanent resident in the County. The 
prevalence of second homes and holiday lets is most stark along the attractive North 
Northumberland coast, and is specifically addressed in Policy HOU 10.

Blyth and Ashington;  
 
c. Supporting the conversion and change of use to residential use of other 
suitable redundant premises, including the renovation of under -used space 
above shops and the provision of live/work units for rural and agricultural 
workers' housing. Proposals for ch ange of use to residential use should take 
account of any impacts on the continued operation of surrounding businesses 
and any need to retain sufficient premises for business and commercial uses; 
and

118  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Planning  for growth  and meeting  housing  needs  over  the plan period  
 
7.7 The Local Plan should meet the objectively assessed development needs for 
projected growth insofar as it is reasonable to do so. The housing requirement 
planned for is then determined having taken account of any cross -boundary Duty to 
Cooperate agreements to help provide for a propo rtion of neighbouring local 
authorities' needs, as well as any physical and environmental constraints that 
cumulatively might reasonably restrict the ability of the area from meeting its needs in 
full. 
 
7.8 The Government has introduced a standardised approach  for robustly establishing 
each local authority’s minimum 'Local Housing Need', based upon the latest official 
household projections with an adjustment made to account for local affordability. The 
standardised formula suggests that Northumberland has an an nual average 'Local 
Housing Need' of +717 per annum for the initial 10 -year period from  2016 to 2026  36, 
which when applied to the whole plan period gives a minimum need for 14,340 net 
additional dwellings between 2016 and 2036. The standardised approach e stablishes 
the baseline of 'Local Housing Need' and the starting point for determining the plan's 
housing requirement.  
 
Meeting  the needs  of people  living  in communal  accommodation  
 
7.9 The minimum Local Housing Need figure only considers the projected growth in 
household population. The Census 2011 recorded 5,437 people not residing in 
households but living in communal and institutional forms of accommodation in the 
County, with the majority of these living in medical and care establishments. Official  
Projecti ons37 suggest that this figure currently stands at about 6,000 people and that 
the non -household population in the County will increase further by around +2,500 
people over the plan period up to in the region of 8,000 to 8,500 people by 2036. 
Given the projecte d increase in the County's elderly population, this trend -based 
growth is wholly based on a projected increase in the numbers of elderly people over 
75 years of age residing in institutional settings.  
 
7.10 The Council's latest assessments38 identify no immedia te need for new care home 
accommodation, and that there is sufficient capacity through vacancies and permitted 
schemes to meet future needs. The Council’s strategic approach to housing for older 
people is to enable more residents to live independently in t heir own homes and 
communities through providing support, the adaptation of existing dwellings and the 
building of new flexible homes.  
 
 
36  Source: Derived from the official 2014 -based household projections (published July 2016) used to inform  
the economic  and housing  growth  options  for the Northumberland  Local  Plan.  The official  sub-national 
population and household projections are updated every two years, and the average house price to 
earnings  affordability ratios published annually (March/April), such that this baseline minimum 'local 
housing need' figure will regularl y change. Government guidance nevertheless currently advises 
disregarding the latest 2016 -based sub -national household projections  (published September 2018) for the 
purposes  of calculating  Local  Housing  Need  and  to continue  using  the previous  2014 -based  projections  
instead  for the time-being.

119 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  7.11 Therefore, housing for much of the projected non -household population will be 
provided through the delivery of more independent living and supported housing 
options as part of existing commitments, new housing allocations and other delivery  
methods39. However, the Council will keep the need for communal accommodation 
under review as models and patterns of care provision  for older people continue to 
evolve, informed by revised needs assessments.  
 
Minimum  housing  requirements  
 
7.12 National guidance indicates that it is justifiable to identify housing need above the 
figure identified by the standard methodology. It indicates th at circumstances where 
an uplift for additional growth above historic trends will be appropriate include, but are 
not limited to, where growth strategies and funding are in place to promote and 
facilitate growth, and where strategic level infrastructure im provements are planned. 
Recognising the Council's economic ambitions, identified through Northumberland's 
contribution to delivering the objectives of the North East SEP, the North of Tyne 
Devolution Deal and the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal, together  with recently 
completed, committed and proposed infrastructure improvements, it is considered 
appropriate to consider a housing need figure in excess of that presented by the 
standard methodology.  
 
7.13 The NPPF requires local plans to be prepared positively a nd to be aspirational, while 
also being realistic and deliverable. For the overall 20 -year plan period, it is therefore 
considered that the level of housing growth should match the Council's economic 
ambitions, and therefore a minimum 17,700 net additional  dwellings  at an average 
885 per annum is required over the plan period40. 
 
7.14 Working closely with neighbouring authorities through the Duty to Cooperate, the 
Council will continue to ensure that planned housing growth across the wider region 
is complementar y and strategically co -ordinated. Northumberland County Council 
has not considered it necessary to ask for any of its neighbouring authorities to help 
provide for any of the County's identified needs.  
 
7.15 While a proportion of Northumberland's overall housing  need falls within the 
protected Northumberland National Park (an independent local planning authority), 
given their limited needs and the low level of new housebuilding, the Northumberland 
Local Plan does not make any specific reduction to take into accou nt housebuilding 
within the National Park.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
39  The Council's  Extra  Care  and Supported  Housing  Strategy  sets out a range  of delivery  methods   including  
working  in partnership  with a range  of organisations  and the use of Council  land.  
40  This level of growth  reflects  the Ambitious  jobs-led growth  scenario  in the Council's  Housing  and  economic  
growth  options  findings  report  (PBA,  June  2018).  7. Housing

a. The spatial strategy for Northumberland;  
 
b. Meeting the objectively assessed housing needs and housing priorities as 
identified through an up -to-date assessment;  and 
 
c. Making the best and most efficient use of land and buildings, encouraging 
higher densities in the most accessible locations and the redevelopment of

Distribution  of housing  requirements  
 
7.16 The indicative distribution of the dwelling requirements across the County is informed 
by the spatial  strategy.  The Plan also seeks  to ensure  the future  sustainability  and 
viability  of communities,  and improve  choice  to meet  the needs  and aspirations  of all 
existing  and future  residents.  The approach  therefore  takes  account  of the role of 
Main Towns and Service Centres, and the presence of key local services and  
facilities  in smaller  settlements.  
 
7.17 While planning to meet future needs, the distribution of new allocations  in this Local  
Plan is also informed by the scale of commitments in each area. Account is also  
taken of environmental constraints  and designations  (including  the Green  Belt) that 
may restrict  the ability  of some  areas  to fully meet  their needs  and thus necessitate  a 
slightly higher provision in neighbouring areas41. 
 
7.18 The indicative distribution of housing needs across Northumberland is set out in  
Table 7.1. The housing numbers presented refer to the indicative requirement for the 
Local Plan’s Delivery Areas and the parishes within which the County’s Main Towns 
and Service Centres are located. Indicative numbers are also presented for the rest 
of each Delivery Are a.  These indicative figures are not maximum limits to the 
numbers of net additional dwellings for each area, but provide a basis for monitoring 
delivery at sub -county levels, which is important given the size of Northumberland. 
Monitoring at these geograp hies will assist the Council in identifying whether and 
when there is a need to actively identify and support the delivery of additional sites to

plan period (as reflected in  the indicators, triggers and contingency actions in the 
Monitoring and Implementation Framework at Appendix I  of this Plan). The 
identification of a five -year housing land supply of deliverable sites is only required to 
be monitored at the countywide leve l. There is an expectation that the majority of 
development will be focused upon the larger settlement(s) within the parish, or group 
of parishes (i.e. the Main Towns, Service Centres and then Service Villages).

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Delivering  the housing  requirements  
 
Housing  completions  and existing  commitments  
 
7.20 Northumberland saw 6,580 new homes created during 2016 -20, the first four years  of 
the plan period43. In addition, 12,957  new homes remain to be built on already 
permitted development sites including many sites currently under construction,  while 
a further 1,810  units could arise  from other applications currently minded to  
approve44. Analysis of delivery rates and the likelihood of permissions lapsing before 
implementation have informed the Council's housing land supply calculations and the 
housing trajectories at Appendix C, and indicate that there is a reasonably high 
degree of confidence that the majority of permitted housing applications will  come 
forward and be delivered45. 
 
7.21 While Table 7.2 shows that the overall number of completions and outstanding  
commitments46 exceeds the minimum housing requirement for the plan period, a 
number of the County’s Main Towns, Service Centres and Service Villages have  little 
development committed, particularly in the more rural north and west of the County. 
Net additional dwellings are ther efore required to meet the future needs of these 
communities and help to balance the County’s housing market. A limited number of 
housing allocations are therefore proposed. Given that the majority of housing 
already committed is general needs housing, an increased emphasis is  required 
through this additional housing to meet the needs of an ageing population.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Housing  development  site allocations  
 
7.22 There are a number of locations where it is necessary to make housing allocations to 
support the spatial strategy and re -balance the County's housing market. Policy HOU 
4 sets out the housing development site allocations (five or more dwellings indicative 
capacity) necessary to deliver the strategic housing priorities and residual needs of 
the County. These housing site allocations are in addition to currently permitted and 
minded to approve sites, and also provide for some flexibility in ensuring that the 
County's overall requirements are delivered should any permissions lapse or minded 
to approve applications not gain final consent. They are also additional to site 
allocations within 'made' Neighbourhood Plans, which are set out for information in 
Appendix  B. 
 
7.23 The selection of sites was informed by the Council's Strategic Housing Land 
Availability Assessment (SHLAA), which includes sites on the Brownfield Land 
Register. The SHLAA considers the suitability, availability and potential achievability 
and viabil ity of sites for possible future housing development, together with their 
indicative dwellings capacity and details regarding their likely deliverability. Potentially 
developable sites, located in settlements where it is considered necessary to make 
housin g allocations to meet residual needs, have been appraised further to identify 
which are the most appropriate for allocation in this Plan47. 
 
7.24 Where appropriate, particularly for larger sites and those in more than one land 
ownership, masterplans or developm ent briefs will be encouraged, to help to ensure 
that allocated housing sites are delivered in a comprehensive joined -up manner. 
Planning applications may come forward without or in advance of a masterplan or 
development brief being prepared, provided that  the development proposal does not 
unacceptably reduce or hinder the development options for a wider site. The Council 
will prepare development briefs for allocated housing sites that it owns, where it is 
considered necessary to drive forward development. Masterplans prepared to 
support development proposals will be encouraged at the pre -application stage and 
considered in the determination of planning applications.

Technical  Paper (December 2018) .

a. Be guided by a masterplan or development brief prepared by or agreed with 
the Council, or otherwise demonstrate that they would not unacceptably 
reduce or hinder the development options for a wider site;  
 
b. Avoid the development of housing on any parts of the site within Flood Risk 
Zones 2 or 3, in accordance with the Sequential and Exception Tes ts for 
vulnerable uses (unless satisfactory mitigation is built into the scheme);  
 
c. Reflect the identified housing needs and market considerations as identified in 
the most up -to-date Strategic Housing Market Assessment or a local housing 
needs assessment  or other evidence of local housing needs verified by the 
Council, including the requirement to provide integrated affordable housing;  
 
d. Have regard to the provision and timing of the infrastructure enhancements 
and services necessary to support them, both i ndividually and cumulatively, 
while minimising and appropriately mitigating any adverse impacts on existing 
transport and utilities networks; and  
 
e. Take into account the findings of Northumberland Local Plan Heritage Impact 
Assessments, for the relevant sit e, and demonstrate that any negative impacts 
on the significance of designated and non -designated heritage assets and 
their settings have been avoided or otherwise minimised through the 
recommended site -specific mitigation measures.  7. Housing   
130  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  7.25 Through the high level of completions and outstanding commitments across the 
County, together with the allocations in the Local Plan and made neighbourhood 
plans, the Council will meet the housing requirements for the plan period set out in 
Policy HOU 2. This is demonstrated in the housing trajectories at Appendix C. To 
help plan, monitor and manage delivery against the Plan’s strategic objectives and 
ensure an appropriate  supply of housing land in the right locations, a 5 -year housing 
land supply for the  County as a whole will b e maintained48, bringing forward 
achievable allocated sites  from later in the plan period  should  it be necessary  to 
speed  up delivery.  In addition  to the commitments and allocations set out above, in 
many locations the SHLAA  identifies  other  developable  sites which  may have  
potential  to come  forward  during  the plan period, enhancing the flexibility in the 
housing market.  
 
7.26 To promote the development of a good mix of sites, the Government has an 
expectation that the development plan and brownfield register should accommodate 
at least 10% of the overall housing requirement on small and medium -sized sites no 
larger than 1.0 hec tares. Northumberland has already seen circa 1,375 net additional 
dwellings delivered on sites of up to 1.0 hectare in size up to 31 March 2020 since 
the start of the plan period. Additionally, extant planning consents provide for 1,214 
net additional dwel lings outstanding to be built on small and medium sized sites of  
five or more dwellings capacity,  and of 1.0 hectare or less49. The Local Plan does not 
therefore need to allocate any more small and medium -sized sites in order to satisfy 
this requirement (i .e. at least 1,770 of the overall 17,700 dwellings minimum 
requirement set out in Policy HOU 2).  The allocated sites in Policy HOU 4 and 
‘made’ Neighbourhood Plans (see Appendix B) do nevertheless include some sites of 
less than 1.0 hectare in size that w ill further contribute to this supply, while the 
Brownfield Land Register additionally includes numerous potentially developable 
sites below this threshold.  
 
7.27 Monitoring data shows that approximately 11% of net additional dwelling completions 
over the past 5-10 years have come from changes of use and conversions. The 
strategic policy objective for bringing long -term empty homes back into use will 
support the supply of small and medium -sized sites.  
 
  
 
48  Upon adoption of the Plan, the five -year housing land supply will be measured against the residual 
average annual housing requirement necessar y to achieve the minimum 17,700 net additional dwellings 
set out in Policy HOU 2 (plus the appropriate buffer informed by the annual Housing Delivery Test), taking 
into account the number of dwelling completions delivered since the start of the plan period  from 1 April 
2016.  With circa 6,580 completions delivered in the years 2016 -2020, as at 31 March 2020 the residual 
minimum requirement for the remaining 16 years of the plan period stands at 11,120 dwellings, equating to 
a residual annual average 695 dwe llings per annum.  This exceeds the standard methodology’s latest 
minimum Local Housing Need for Northumberland of 676 dwellings per annum for 2019 -2029. With the 
addition of a 5% buffer, for the purposes of calculating a five year housing land supply, the  requirement is 
for 730 dwellings per annum.  In accordance with the NPPF, once the adopted Plan is more than five years 
old the five -year supply will be measured against the latest Local Housing Need figure at the time (plus the 
appropriate buffer).  If, however, the residual annual average requirement drops below the latest Local 
Housing Need figure before the plan is five years old, the Local Housing Need figure will take precedence 
as the basis for calculating the five -year housing land supply.  
49  A fur ther 999 permitted dwellings are on sites of less than five dwellings capacity that do not form part of 
the Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA).  7. Housing   
131 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Housing  types  and mix 
 
7.28 Delivering a mix of high quality housing to meet people's needs and aspirations, 
including affordable homes and specialist needs housing, is essential for re -
balancing Northumberland's housing market and enhancing the sustainability of 
communities. The ongoing needs of the County' s increasingly elderly proportion of 
the population should be met while also recognising that attracting high quality 
businesses to locate in Northumberland will require an adequate supply of good 
quality, medium density family housing, as well as 'executi ve' housing (although 
some of this need will be provided for by the effect of older people downsizing to 
smaller homes). New housing constructed in the County (both market and affordable 
housing) will meet predominant needs, as informed by the latest analy sis of current 
supply and likely future demands50. This applies to homes provided through all forms 
of development opportunities, whether on allocated, unallocated or unanticipated 
'windfall' sites, through new build housing or by way of conversions and ch anges of 
use. 
 
7.29 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) indicates that, the majority of 
need is expected to be for 2 -bedroom and 3 -bedroom properties, together with some 
1-bedroom homes. There is a small need for larger dwellings of 4 -or-more bedroom s. 
In terms of dwelling types, need is split equally between houses for families upsizing 
and first -time buyers/movers, and bungalows or level -access accommodation for 
older people downsizing, together with flats. Analysis of aspirations and expectations 
in the SHMA however suggests a greater need for 1 and 2 -bedroom bungalows and 
level-access flats/apartments, further emphasising the need to meet the needs of an 
ageing population.  
 
 
Self-build  and custom -build  housing  
 
7.30 Interest  in self-build  and custom -build  housing  is strong  in Northumberland51, 
particularly  in and around  the County's  more  rural settlements.  The self-build sector 
plays an important part in enabling high standard (quality and efficiency), innovative, 
sustainable and environmentally -friendly housing that is aligned to individual needs 
and aspirations, while also sometimes being more affordable than buying new 
housing on the open market.  
 
7.31 Permitted housing development sites include over 230 plots  being set -aside for 
potential self/custom -build housing projects, in addition to plots already developed 
since the start of the plan period, while numerous completions and outstanding 
permissions for small -scale developments of one or two homes are also likely to be 
one-off cust omised projects. Independent  self/custom -build  plot-finder  websites  also 
reveal  additional  opportunities  for self/custom -build,  on sites  and plots  not explicitly  
identified  for self or custom  build  through  the planning  system.  
 
 
50  The Northumberland  Strategic  Housing  Market  Assessment  Update  Report  (Arc4,  2018)  analyse s the 
current  supply  and demand  for different  housing type.  
51  As at 30 October 2018, m ore than 300 individual people or couples/households plus six community groups 
have  registered  on the Council's Self -Build and Custom -Build Register since 1 April 2016  as having an 
interest in self -building or  commissioning  the custom -building  of their own homes  in Northumberland  and 
seeking  serviced  plots.  7. Housing   
132  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Community -led housing  
 
7.32 Northumberland has a particularly strong and well -developed community -led housing 
network, forming part of the wider independent North East Community -Led Housing 
Development Network coalition of community organisations, public sector bodies,  
housing associ ations and academic institutions. Community -led housing in its  various 
forms helps to diversify the housing market and increase choice, while  making a 
valuable contribution to the delivery of genuinely and permanent affordable homes 
not readily delivered b y the market, including on Rural Exception Sites. It  also 
supports urban and rural regeneration, the return of empty properties to use,  and 
helps  to strengthen  and sustain  local economies,  with the opportunity  to lever  in 
financial  resources  not otherwise  available  to other  housing  providers.  Community -
led schemes empower local communities and give social housing tenants a stronger 
voice, helping them to become more self -reliant and resilient, while reducing 
community opposition to development.  
 
7.33 To help provide for the Northumberland's affordable housing needs, we will support 
community -led housing schemes and the provision of serviced building plots below 
market value on larger development sites for self -build and custom -build housing, 
and interm ediate shared ownership models in which the shell of a property is built by 
a Registered Provider for the self -builder to finish off.  
 
 
 
Policy  HOU  5 
 
Housing  types  and mix 
 
1. A range of good quality, energy -efficient homes, including affordable homes, will 
be provided to deliver a more balanced mix of tenures and housing types and 
sizes, alongside supported specialist housing for older and vulnerable people. 
Development proposals will be assessed according to how well they contribute to 
meeting t he needs and aspirations of those living in and seeking to move to 
Northumberland, as identified in the most up -to-date Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment, a local housing needs assessment  and/or other evidence of local 
housing needs verified by the Counc il. 
 
2. Community -led housing, including individual and group self -build and custom -
housebuilding, will be supported and facilitated, particularly where they will 
contribute to meeting local housing needs. In addition to stand -alone serviced and 
unserviced pl ots, commercial housebuilders will be encouraged to set -aside 
dedicated serviced plots for self -build and custom -build homes where appropriate 
within 'major' housing development sites.  
 
 
 
 
  7. Housing   
133 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Delivering  affordable  housing  
 
7.34 Supporting the delivery of affordable homes is a priority for the Council. For the 
purposes of Policy HOU 6 and other development plan policies, affordable housing 
comprises affordable homes for rent, starter homes, discounted market sales 
housing, and oth er affordable routes to home ownership in accordance with the full 
definition of affordable housing set out in the glossary to this plan and in the NPPF.  
To ensure flexibility in response to new types of affordable housing and any revised 
definition in nat ional policy, Policy HOU 6 simply refers to affordable homes to rent 
and affordable home ownership.    
 
7.35 The latest official ONS affordability analysis from 2017 indicates that the ratio of 
lower quartile house prices to lower quartile earnings is more than 5.00 in 
Northumberland52. This countywide figure however disguises the fact that in parts of 
the County the affordability situation is more acute. Therefore, compared to mortgage 
lenders' typical 4 x household salary eligibility criteria, many households a re 
realistically only able to consider renting as a choice of tenure at present, while 
modern decent homes are generally beyond the reach of the average first -time 
buyer.  
 
7.36 The latest SHMA identifies a net affordable housing need over the 5 year period 
2017 -22 of 151 dwellings per annum, which is equivalent to 17% of the County’s 
overall 885 per annum housing requirement53. 
 
7.37 As well as need, the viability of delivering affordable housing is considered when 
setting local plan targets. Market developments in s ome areas of the  County may not 
be able to viably deliver 17% affordable housing, while higher rates will be achievable 
in higher value areas. Taking into account the evidenced differences in development 
viability in different parts of the County, Policy H OU 6 applies a balanced value area -
based approach to achieve the overall need54. Where a site falls across more than 
one viability value area, a proportionate level of affordable housing will be required.  
 
7.38 The Plan requires all major developments across a ll value areas to make an 
affordable housing contribution, except those of less than 30 dwellings in low and 
medium value areas. The exemption of such schemes reflects the need to enable 
improved viability of developments of this scale.   
 
7.39 The NPPF also indicates that local authorities should not seek contributions towards 
affordable housing from developments that are not 'major' developments55, but allows 
exceptions to this in designated rural areas, where a lower threshold can be applied if 
 
52  The lower  quartile  house  price  is £105,000,  compared  to a lower  quartile  salary  of £20,265  per annu m 
(ONS,  2018).  
53  This figure takes into account affordable homes forecast to come forward on planning permissions over a 5 
year period. If these commitments are excluded, the imbalance is 374 per annum equating to 42% of the 
County's requirement.  
54  The pol icy value areas, as shown on the Policies Map, set out the affordable housing requirements for 
different parts of the county, to meet the identified countywide affordable housing need. They are defined 
by Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) and are illustrativ e of the viability of delivering affordable housing. 
They do not, therefore, necessarily reflect the level of affordable housing need in those areas.  
55  The NPPF defines 'major' development for housing as where 10  or more homes would be provided, or the 
site area is 0.5 hectares  or more.  7. Housing   
134  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  considered appropriate. Given the rural nature of much of Northumberland, small 
development sites make a valuable contribution to the delivery of market ho using, 
and affordable housing. To enhance the delivery of affordable housing along the 
Northumberland coast where there are significant affordability issues, developments 
of 5 units or more within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty  (AONB) will be expected to make an affordable housing contribution.  
 
7.40 The Council recognises that there may be exceptional site -specific circumstances 
which impact on development viability, and mean a developer may not be able to 
meet all policy requiremen ts, including those for affordable housing. In these 
exceptional circumstances the Council may consider a reduced affordable housing 
requirement or contribution in lieu, if development is found to be otherwise 
acceptable, and it can be clearly demonstrated  that all or a proportion of the policy 
costs would otherwise prejudice development viability.  
 
7.41 The Government's expectation (subject to certain exemptions  set out in the NPPF) is 
that at least 10% of homes on 'major' housing developments will be available  for 
affordable home ownership as part of the overall affordable housing contribution from 
the site. Given the Council's success in bringing forward discounted market value 
homes for sale, it is anticipated that this will continue to be the primary form of  
affordable home ownership in  Northumberland in the coming years, particularly in 
lower value parts of the County. Recognising this while still meeting the need for 
rented affordable housing, the SHMA recommends an equal 50:50 split between 
affordable home s to rent and affordable home ownership products. Policy HOU 6 
therefore applies the value  area-based approach in seeking to achieve this balanced 
overall outcome while enabling the viable delivery of appropriate affordable housing 
products.  
 
7.42 The SHMA also  identifies that, when taking into account aspirations and 
expectations, the majority of Northumberland's future need is for smaller one and 
two-bedroom affordable properties, although there is still a need for some three and 
four-bedroom family homes. The  types and tenures of affordable housing to be 
provided on any specific development proposal will ultimately be determined on a 
case -by-case basis, informed by an understanding of the level of need and viability.  
 
7.43 In providing affordable housing, the presu mption and preference is that it is delivered 
on the application site itself in order to help meet local needs and promote social 
inclusion as part of a mixed and balanced community, unless off -site provision and/or 
a financial contribution is clearly just ified. On larger development sites, developers 
will be expected to 'pepper pot' the on -site affordable housing element of the scheme 
throughout the development wherever possible (subject to their viable management 
by an approved affordable housing provider ), rather than concentrating them all in a 
cluster. The affordable housing provision should therefore be designed to be 
integrated into the overall development, both in terms of their built form and external 
appearance, such that the affordable homes are i ndistinguishable from those 
intended for sale. Less desirable positions within a site should not be used for 
locating a particular tenure.  
 
 7. Housing   
135 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  7.44 Where a Section 106 financial contribution towards alternative off -site affordable 
housing provision is clearly justified and considered acceptable in lieu of on -site 
provision, the contribution expected  to be made will be in accordance with the 
formula set out in Appendix D of the Plan . The expectation will generally be that the 
commuted sums received will be spent in the area within which the development that 
has given rise to the contribution has taken place, following the sequential approach 
set out in Policy HOU 6 which takes account of local needs and Council priorities. 
Given that affordable housing co ntributions from comparatively low density schemes 
(particularly for 'executive' style or high value homes built on large plots) are usually 
delivered off -site, it is recognised that a purely target -based affordable housing 
approach can have an inequitable  effect, and therefore the in -lieu financial 
contribution expected will be determined in relation to the expected value of the 
development rather than the number of units per se. Further guidance on affordable 
housing provision and associated financial con tributions will be set out in a 
forthcoming supplementary planning document (SPD).  
 
7.45 Where affordable housing for rent, or discount market sales housing is provided, or 
where public grant funding is provided in other affordable routes to home ownership, 
the Council will seek to ensure that homes are made available at a cost that makes 
them accessible to local people, with legal agreements being put in place to ensure 
the properties remain affordable in perpetuity. To ensure long -term availability, 
affordable  housing for rent should be provided through an approved Registered 
Provider56 and thus be viable for them to provide and manage.  
 
7.46 The Council will monitor the delivery of new housing, including affordable homes, and 
periodically review housing needs through updates of the SHMA and local housing 
needs assessments. If delivery fails to meet the identified ongoing needs, 
mechanisms to increase the delivery of affordable housing will be triggered in 
accordance with the Plan's Monitoring and Implementation  Framework.

Affordable  housing  provision  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. To deliver  affordable  homes  for sale or rent to meet  the identified  needs  of those  
not otherwise met by the market, 'major' development proposals of 10  or more 
units  or 0.5 hectares  or more  (or proposals  for five units  or more  in the 
Northumberland Coas t Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), will be expected to 
provide on -site affordable  housing (or where robustly justified make an equivalent 
financial contribution in lieu to support off -site provision  which will help create 
mixed and balanced communities) as follows, in accordance with the housing 
viability value areas shown on the Polic ies Map:  
 
a. within  low value  areas  - 10% affordable (except developments of 10 or more, 
but less than 30 dwellings which are exempt from making an affordable 
housing contribution);  
b. within  medium  value  areas  - 15% affordable (except developments of 10 or 
more, but less than 30 dwellings which are exempt from making an affordable 
housing contribution);  
c. within  high value  areas  - 25% affordable;  or 
d. within  the highest  value  areas  - 30% affordable.  
 
2. The tenures and dwelling types of the affordable homes will be  negotiable within 
reason on a site -by-site basis to ensure affordability and to reflect local housing 
needs, as evidenced by the most up -to-date Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment or a local housing needs assessment  or other evidence of local 
housing nee ds verified by the Council, and taking into account local market 
conditions, the structure of the local housing market and interest from potential 
Registered Providers. The affordable provision will be expected to reflect the 
following indicative tenure sp lit (while ensuring at least 10% of the total number of 
homes on the site are for affordable home ownership products, unless NPPF 
exceptions or those defined in Part 1 of this Policy apply ) in accordance with the 
housing viability value  areas  shown  on the Policies  Map:  
 
a. within  low value areas  - 100%  affordable  home  ownership;  
b. within  medium  value  areas  - 33% affordable  homes  to rent and 67%  affordable  
home  ownership;  
c. within  high value  areas  - 60% affordable  homes  to rent and 40% affordable 
home  ownership;  or 
d. within  the highest  value  areas  - 67% affordable  homes  to rent and 33% 
affordable  home  ownership.  
 
3. The affordable housing provision and/or contribution will be secured by a Section 
106 planning obligation agreement. For affordable housing for rent, discount  
market sales housing, or where public grant funding is provided towards other  
affordable routes t o home ownership, the Section 106 agreement will ensure  that 
the on-site provision  remains  affordable  in perpetuity.  
 
 
 7. Housing   
137 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  4. Where a financial contribution in lieu of on -site affordable  housing  provision  is 
clearly  justified  through  negotiation  with the Council, this will be calculated in 
accordance with the formula set out in Appendix D of the Plan. Where off -site 
provision of affordable housing is clearly justified, in lieu of on -site provision or a 
financial contribution, the following sequential appro ach will be applied to 
determine where the affordable housing should be most appropriately delivered to 
help meet the County's needs:  
 
a. In the settlement (or grouping of Parishes or Wards which make up the  
settlement)  where  the contribution  arises;   
b. In an adjoining Parish or Ward;  
c. Elsewhere  in the relevant  housing  market  sub-area where  the contribution  
arises (as identified in the most up -to-date Strategic Housing Market  
Assessment);  
d. Elsewhere  in the Delivery  Area  where  the contribution  arises;  or 
e. To cross -subsidise affordable housing provision where priorities are identified 
throughout  the County.  
 
 
 
Exception  sites  
 
7.47 To help first-time buyers  and renters  to get onto the housing  ladder,  the NPPF  
requires local planning authorities to support the development of land which is not 
otherwise allocated, adjacent to existing settlements, for housing to provide wholly for 
entry -level homes offering one or more types of affordable housing, unless the need 
for such homes is already met within the local aut hority area. The latest SHMA 
identifies a particular need for smaller affordable properties  with one and two 
bedrooms. The Plan supports the development of Entry -level Exception Sites of no 
larger than 1.0 hectare or where the development would not exceed 5% of the size of 
the existing settlement where this need is not being delivered locally, through existing 
commitments or proposed allocations. In accordance with the NPPF, Entry -level 
Exception Sites will not be permitted within the Green Belt, Northumber land's 
AONBs, or where they would compromise protected environmental designations.  
 
7.48 Rural Exception Sites seek to help address pressing affordable housing needs of  
rural communities by enabling the release for development of small sites that would  
not norm ally be used for housing. In the context of the NPPF's definition of major  
development, small sites are considered to be less than 0.5 hectares in size or  
comprise less than 10 dwellings. Such sites are specifically for the purposes of  
providing  affordable  housing  in perpetuity  for households  who are either  current  local 
residents or have an existing family or employment connection (e.g. essential local 
workers) to the particular area. Permitted development rights will be removed to 
ensure that th e properties remain affordable. Some market homes may be allowed 
on Rural Exception Sites where it is clearly shown to be essential to support and 
facilitate the delivery of the predominant affordable element. Where it is proposed to 
include market housing  on a rural exception site, the number of market homes will be 
considered on a case -by-case basis. Any market homes element will be  restricted to 
occupation as a principal residence only (i.e. not for use as second or holiday homes) 
in order to support the  overall sustainability of the community and the viability of local 
services.  7. Housing

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Housing  in the open  countryside  
 
7.49 While Policy STP 1 allows for a level of development within and adjacent to existing 
settlements, and Policy HOU 7 provides for the delivery of exception sites, in 
accordance with the NPPF the plan does not generally support the development of 
isolated homes in the countryside, detached from existing settlements, except in 
certain circumstances.  
 
7.50 It is recognised that some rural businesses require a worker or workers  to reside at or 
near their place of work in order to support operational needs. Where it can be clearly 
demonstrated that there is an essential need for a rural worker to live close to their 
primary place of work in the countryside, who cannot otherwise b e accommodated 
locally, and that the business is viable, new rural workers dwellings may be 
permitted. It is also recognised that residential development can represent a viable 
use of heritage assets, and enable redundant and disused buildings of character  to 
be retained or brought back into effective use. Subject to policy criteria, such isolated 
development in the open countryside will be supported.  Permitted development 
rights allow for the conversion of existing farmstead buildings into up to five 
dwellings57. Proposals for the residential redevelopment of barns and other 
agricultural farmstead buildings should also take into consideration relevant up -to-
date guidance58. Where necessary, residential permitted development rights may be 
removed in the int erests of protecting the visual amenity of the countryside.  
 
 
 
 
57  Class  Q permitted  development  rights  currently  provide  for the conversion  without  planning  permission   of 
agricultural buildings into up to three 'larger homes'  (with a combined floorspace of no more than  465 
square metres), or up to five 'smaller homes' (each of less than 100 square metres), or a mix of  both (with 
no more than five homes including no more than three 'larger homes'), as long as the extent of any external 
structural works does not become a more substantial 'rebuild' rather than a 'conversion'.

Isolated residential  development  in the open  countryside  
 
1. The development of isolated homes in the open countryside will only be supported 
where:  
 
a. There is an essential and clearly established need for a full -time rural worker 
necessary to meet the operational needs of a rural business to live 
permanently at or near their place of work in the countryside, and where it can 
be demonstrated that:  
 
i. The business is financially sound and viable with a clear prospect of 
remaining so, the activity and landholding units concerned having been 
established for at least three years and been profitable for at least one of 
those last three years; and  
ii. The functiona l need could not be fulfilled by any existing dwelling on the 
landholding unit or any other existing accommodation in the immediate 
area, which is suitable (including by means of refurbishment or 
appropriate extension) and potentially available for occupat ion by the 
workers concerned; or  
 
b. It represents the optimal viable use of a heritage asset, or represents 
appropriate enabling development to secure the future of a heritage asset(s); 
or   
 
c. It re-uses redundant or disused buildings and enhances its immedia te setting; 
or   
 
d. It involves the appropriate sub -division of an existing residential dwelling; or  
 
e. The design is of exceptional quality, in that it is truly outstanding or innovative, 
reflecting the highest standards of architecture, and would help to raise the 
standards of design in rural areas, and it would significantly enhance its 
immediate setting, and be sensitive to the defining characteristics of the local 
area.  
 
 
 
Residential  development  management  
 
7.51 To ensure that any adverse impacts of new res idential development are minimised, 
the Plan sets out criteria against which applications which include housing will be 
assessed. These criteria seek to ensure residential development contributes to a 
sense of place, functions well, and is of a high qualit y of design. Additionally, criteria 
set out policy expectations relating to the extension and/or external adaptation of 
existing dwellings.

Residential  development  management  
 
1. Residential  developments  will be supported  where  they:  
 
a. Contribute to a sense of place, which supports community identity and  pride;  
 
b. Provide, where appropriate, multi -functional spaces that support different  
recreational  and social  activities,  and consider  opportunities  for community  
management and stew ardship to support long term management of  
neighbourhoods  and community  facilities;  
 
c. Provide functional space and facilities for refuse and recycling storage which is 
appropriate for the development. The location and design of facilities  should 
provide opp ortunities to screen or reduce their visual prominence,  not impact  
upon  amenity, health or security;  
 
d. Are constructed to a high quality of design and have regard to design

Design Guide; and  
 
e. Perform positively against 'Building for a Healthy Life' principles, or its 
successor.  
 
2. Householder proposals for the extension and/or external adaptation of existing 
dwellings will only be supported where the enhancement:  
 
a. Is well -related and subordinate in size and massing to the existing dwelling, 
and in combination with the existing dwelling forms a visually indivisible single 
dwelling as a whole;  
 
b. Does not have a significant adverse impact on the amenity of  adjoining 
properties in terms of structural proximity and unacceptable loss of 
daylight/sunlight, privacy and visual outlook;  
 
c. Respects , complements and does not have an unacceptable adverse impact 
on the style and character of the existing dwelling and i ts setting in terms of its 
design and use of materials, or on the character of the surrounding area; and

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Second  and holiday  homes  
 
7.53 Northumberland is a popular location for people to establish second and holiday 
homes due to its attractive rural environment and beautiful coastline. The Census 
2011 recorded 8,876 people from elsewhere in the Country as having a second 
home in Northumber land, 707 of which were for work purposes. However, 
concentrations of holiday accommodation that are only occupied for relatively short 
periods of the year have become particularly evident in certain locations, such as 
along the north Northumberland coast,  and to a lesser degree accessible upland 
areas.  
 
7.54 The Census 2011 identified that, across the County, 6.4% of household spaces had 
no usual residents. In a number of coastal parishes, the proportion exceeded 40%, 
with Beadnell in excess of 50%. While the l atest Census does not distinguish 
between vacant properties and second/holiday homes, the previous 2001 Census did 
make this distinction, and confirms that second and holiday homes make up a large 
proportion of the dwellings in parts of the County. The pro liferation of second and 
holiday homes along the north Northumberland coast in particular is further 
evidenced through Council Tax and Business Rates data59. 
 
7.55 While providing some economic benefits, the lack of permanent occupation of such 
properties is ha ving an adverse impact on the social fabric of affected communities 
as a result of diminished support and demand for local facilities and schools. 
Consequently, some settlements have began to lose their sense of community with 
some services only operating at certain times of the year. During peak holiday 
seasons however, some services struggle to meet the needs of visitors as well as the 
permanent population. Additionally, the demand for holiday accommodation in these 
locations, coupled with rising house pr ices and a limited supply and turnover of 
homes, has made many smaller properties unaffordable to the local population.  
 
7.56 To help sustain the vitality of communities, in parishes where 20% or more of 
household spaces are identified in the latest Census as h aving no usual (i.e. 
permanent) residents, a principal residency restriction will be applied to all new 
market dwellings, which will be secured through a Section 106 agreement.

Second  and holiday  homes  
 
1. Within Parishes identified in the most up -to-date Census as having 20% or more  
household spaces with no usual (i.e. permanent) residents, new market dwellings  
will only be supported  where  first and future  occupation  is restricted  in perpetuity  to 
ensure  that each  new dwelling is occupied  only as a 'principal  residence'.  This 
restriction  will be secured  through  a planning condition or Section  106 agreement.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Optional  technical  standards  
 
7.57 The Council seeks to ensure that all homes are accessible and flexible enough to  
meet the needs of current and future occupiers. National guidance allows local  
planning authorities, where justified by local needs and subject to viability testing,  to 
adopt through Local Plan policy the Government's optional technical standards  for 
housi ng. These relate to enhanced adaptability and accessibility, water efficiency and 
internal space standards (the Nationally Described Space Standard), and  where 
adopted require new housing to be constructed so as to exceed the minimum 
standards  required  by Building  Regulations.  
 
7.58 While initiatives to maximise water efficiency and use natural resources prudently  are 
supported,  it is not considered  that there  is sufficient  justification  to require  new 
homes to meet the tighter water supply efficiency standard. Due to the presence  of 
Kielder  reservoir,  Northumberland  is identified  by the Environment  Agency  to be an 
area of predominantly low water stress60. 
 
7.59 In terms of internal space standards, analysis of planning applications since 2011  
suggests that,  with a few exceptions, the average dwelling sizes of new housing  built 
in Northumberland  generally  satisfy  the Nationally  Described  Space  Standard  
(NDSS).  While there are deficiencies in some areas for some types of housing61, the 
degree of deficiency is not considered to be to an extent that would justify requiring 
imposition of the NDSS through policy.  
 
7.60 The Council nevertheless encourages developers to provide good quality homes  with 
sufficient useable and adaptable internal space to meet r esidents' changing  needs 
over their lifetimes, thereby reducing the need for specialist accommodation. It is 
particularly important to ensure  that affordable  homes  for rent provide  sufficient  
internal  space  in order  for them  to be attractive  and acceptable  to Registered 
Providers, so as to minimise the possibility of there being no end -user and the new 
homes consequently being lost from the affordable rented market, and sold as 
discounted market value housing instead.  
 
7.61 While it is considered that there is insufficient evidence to support the introduction of 
water efficiency and internal space standards, the projected demographic profile of 
Northumberland, together with up to date evidence of need62, indicates that a policy 
intervention to support the delive ry of adaptable and accessible homes is justified. 
The Council’s strategic objective is to enable people to be able to live actively and 
independently in their own homes for longer within inclusive communities that 
minimise the potential for loneliness and  social isolation. Ensuring a supply of homes 
that allow flexibility for adaptation and enhanced accessibility features will allow the 
housing requirements of older and vulnerable people to be met through general 
needs housing, reducing the need for specia list accommodation. Currently a 
relatively high proportion of households in Northumberland include a resident who 
 
60  See paragraphs  11.17  and 11.18  of the Water  Environment  Chapter.  
61  In particular,  it is evident  that new homes  in the south  east of the County  have  tended  to be somewhat  
smaller, such that they would not meet the recommended standards for single -storey 1 -bedroom,  two-
storey  2 and 3-bedroom  and three -storey  3-bedroom  dwellings.

and Support  in Northumberland  (2018).  7. Housing   
144  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  possesses a long -term activity -limiting illness or disability, and it is projected that the 
number of elderly people and those with mobility p roblems living in the County will 
increase.  
 
7.62 Therefore, adoption through the Local Plan of the Government’s optional housing 
technical standards for adaptability and accessibility as required enhancements of 
Part M of the Building Regulations is justified.  Taking into consideration the 
evidenced levels of need and associated viability considerations, Policy HOU 11 
requires 20% of new dwellings for market sale or rent and 50% of new affordable 
homes to meet requirement M4(2) (Accessible and Adaptable) of the  Building 
Regulations.  
 
Homes  for older  and vulnerable  people  
 
7.63 The Council  recognises  that most  people  who are able to do so prefer  to remain  
living well in their own homes within inclusive communities for as long as possible, 
with or without support, while others require specialist accommodation to meet their 
specific needs on either a temporary or longer -term basis. The Council wants to 
ensure the provision of better housing choices for older people and vulnerable 
groups, whatever their requi rements, including homes that are adaptable to  residents' 
needs over their lifetime and set within accessible ‘lifetime neighbourhoods’ that are 
well-designed places suitable for all people regardless of their age or disability.  
 
7.64 The needs of older people are diverse; some still have jobs or are still actively  
seeking work, while others have retired from work and can reorganise their lives  
around family responsibilities, leisure, non -vocational education and voluntary work. 
For some,  their lives are substan tially affected  by long-term illness  or disability  and 
they may require  additional  care or specialist  accommodation.  Given  the projected  
significant increase in the County’s elderly population, both from ageing and inward  
migration,  it is anticipated  that there  will be significant  growth  in the number  of older  
people  in need  of care and specialised  support.  
 
7.65 The Council will appropriately provide for the needs of various vulnerable groups  of 
people, such as those with complex learning needs and physical disabilities,  
dementia and other chronic age -related conditions, autism and enduring mental  
health  issues.  It is expected  that there  will be an increase  in the numbers of adults 
aged 18 -64 with multiple and complex needs requiring care and support over the 
plan period. In addition, offenders and those with substance misuse disorders 
needing rehabilitation, and people fleeing domestic ab use or other conflicts who have 
become homeless for a combination of these reasons (including asylum seekers and 
refugees) need to be accommodated.  
 
Supported  housing  
 
7.66 The Council aims to reduce the number of people living with dementia or autism, in 
hospi tal beds and residential care, and maximise opportunities for independent living 
in the community with appropriate homecare support. A mix of specialist 
(independent) supported housing solutions providing on -site care and support where 
appropriate is there fore encouraged for all client groups, tailored to the community's 
needs whether in urban or rural locations. While there will be some demand for care 7. Housing   
145 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  home accommodation, no new provision is specifically sought in the Plan, as there 
are around 300 bed -spac e vacancies in the County's current 115 care homes plus a 
large new care home under construction.  
 
7.67 New dwelling provision should take account of the needs and demands of older 
households. Through the provision of one and two -bedroom level -access flats and 
bungalows there will be more opportunities to down -size, thereby releasing larger 
family homes onto  the market to in turn help meet demand for this type of property. 
Additional self -contained units for independent supported living, including wardened 
sheltered and 'extra care' accommodation that may have some shared communal 
facilities are also required . 
 
7.68 The Council acknowledges that there are additional costs associated with the 
delivery of sheltered and extra care accommodation. While the delivery of housing of 
these types is encouraged as part of the housing mix in market housing 
developments, shelte red and extra care schemes are often bespoke and delivered by 
specialist providers. Where matters of viability arise and require negotiation, the 
Council will look to work with such providers, to identify solutions, in order to secure 
the delivery of shelt ered and extra care accommodation.  
 
7.69 The preference is for new housing designed for older people to be located centrally in 
Main Towns and Service Centres where they are accessible to local shops, 
community facilities and public transport, thereby supportin g the local economy and 
integrated into and complementing the surrounding community.  
 
7.70 The latest evidence63 indicates that the priority needs and opportunities for delivering 
supported housing are for:  
• 'Extra care' or specialised supported housing for olde r adults aged  over 65  years  
in Berwick -upon -Tweed,  Rothbury,  Bellingham,  Hexham,  Morpeth  and 
Cramlington, as well as for specialised supported housing in Blyth and  
Ponteland;  and 
• Independent  supported  living  schemes  for adults  aged  18 to 64 years  in the  north  
of the County.  
 
7.71 Some of the sites allocated in Policy HOU 4 have the potential to help provide for 
some of these supported housing needs.  
 
Homelessness,  refugees  and asylum  seekers  
 
7.72 The Council has a duty to ensure that suitable accommodation is available for 
applicants eligible for assistance, who are unintentionally homeless, and fall within a 
specified priority need group. The Council's Homelessness Strategy aims to ensure 
provision for all household types.  
 
7.73 Northumberland Coun ty Council currently provides dedicated units to accommodate 
homeless people in Cramlington, Ashington, Hexham, Alnwick and  Berwick -upon -
Tweed, while independent providers manage hostels in Hexham and Blyth. A number

and supported accommodation for young persons in Blyth and Berwick -upon -Tweed. 
Further bedspaces have been commissioned in supported hostel and dispersed 
accommodation countywide. Where there are gaps in provisio n identified, the Council 
will support the provision of suitable accommodation, including hostels and other 
houses of multiple occupation.  
 
7.74 The Council also has a legal duty to support refugees and asylum seekers and assist 
them in finding suitable accommo dation. A number of dwellings have been procured 
for families expected to be received, with additional properties likely to be required in 
the future. The Council will support the provision of housing to meet the needs of 
refugees and asylum seekers.

Gypsies  and travellers  and travelling  showpeople  
 
7.75 Gypsies and travellers and travelling showpeople communities are distinct groups 
with their own culture and traditions. The Council has a duty under the Human Rights 
Act 1998 and national planning policy to facilitate the traditional and nomadic way of 
life for ethnic  gypsies and travellers and travelling showpeople, while respecting the 
interests of the settled community, including promoting social inclusion and ensuring 
that they have fair and equal access to accommodation that meets their needs. 
National policy aims  to increase significantly the number of traveller sites in 
appropriate locations, while local authorities are required to provide for a five -year 
supply of suitable, realistic and deliverable gypsy and traveller residential caravan 
pitches together with i dentifying broad locations to meet the community’s needs for 
future years.  
 
7.76 The Council currently owns and manages two gypsy and traveller sites providing 39 
pitches, at Hartford Bridge near Bedlington and at Lyneburn Cottages/Shore Road 
near Lynemouth. Ad ditionally, there is an 18 -pitch privately -owned and  managed site 
in Berwick -upon -Tweed plus a couple of small family -owned sites in the north and 
south east of the County. The Council regularly records mainly small, short -lived 
incidences of unauthorised encampments, concentrated mainly towards the south 
east of the County, but while there are currently no formal authorised transit sites or 
stopping places, the travelling community's stopover needs are frequently satisfied 
through informal arrangements neg otiated with local farmers and other landowners.  
For the travelling showpeople community actively involved in travelling to work at 
fairgrounds and events, the privately -owned and managed Showmen's Guild yard at 
Bomarsund near Stakeford in South East North umberland currently provides 30 plots 
for caravans and the storage of equipment related to their businesses.  7. Housing   
148  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  7.77 The Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) (2018 Update) 
assessed the needs of gypsies and travellers and travelling showpeople commun ities 
in Northumberland. It indicated that there is:   
• No immediate need for additional permanent pitches, but that there is likely need 
for up to eight additional gypsy and traveller caravan pitches by the end of the 
plan period;  
• A likely need for transit accommodation provision of four to eight pitches to 
address unauthorised encampments; and  
• A likely need to provide additional travelling showpeople plots over the plan 
period.  
 
7.78 However, it is recognised that the initial survey work on which the 2018 GTAA 
Update was based is now somewhat dated.  It is also th e Council’s intention that 
future survey work should make further attempts to gain responses from those 
residents living on private gypsy and traveller sites in the County in order to better 
reflect any need arising from these sites.  The Council acknowled ges that further 
assessment is also required in relation to the supply of sites identified in the 2018 
Update.  Accordingly, the Council is preparing a new Gypsy and Traveller and 
Travelling Showpeople Accommodation Assessment (GTTSAA), which will inform t he 
preparation of a separate Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Local Plan 
(GTTSLP) document. This GTTSLP is expected to be submitted within 18 months of 
the adoption date of this Local Plan, in accordance with the LDS. In the meantime, 
Policy HOU 12 sets out the needs identified in the 2018 GTAA Update and how the 
Council seeks to meet these needs. Policy HOU 12 also sets out a range of criteria 
against which proposals for new or extended sites for Gypsies and Travellers and 
yards for Travelling Sh owpeople will be assessed.  
 
7.79 As a first principle in the determination of applications for new gypsy and traveller and 
travelling showpeople facilities, consideration will be given to any existing sites in the 
County, while support will be given to the deve lopment of long -term sustainable sites 
in appropriate locations which should help to reduce the potential for unauthorised 
encampments. The criteria set out in Policy HOU 12 are considered to be essential 
for the provision of satisfactory sites, while reco gnising that individual plots and sites 
for travelling showpeople should also have regard to the layout principles advised by 
the Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain.

Showpeople, and in determining planning applications. Sites and yards should:  
 
a. Allow for access to appropriate health services and ensure that children can 
attend school on a regular basis; and  
b. Incorporate soft landscaping to increase op enness and not be enclosed with 
hard landscaping, high walls or fences, such that the impression may be given 
that the site and its occupants are deliberately isolated from the local 
community; and  
c. Allow for necessary space for the storage of vehicles and equipment; and  
d. Not result in an unacceptable loss of amenity which may have a detrimental 
impact upon the health and well -being of any travellers that may locate there 
or others in the local community; and  
e. Provide for essential infrastructure and on -site facilities, inc luding water 
supply,  sewerage,  and waste  removal/recycling,  work  areas  and play areas.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  8. Quality  of Place  
 
8.1 Design is an integral aspect of sustainable development and is therefore fundamental 
to the successful delivery of the Local Plan. The NPPF attaches great importance to 
achieving high quality, inclusive design through the planning process and recognises 
that design quality should be considered throughout the evolution and assessment of 
individual proposals64. 
 
8.2 The Council  recognises  that new development  which responds  to the principles  of 
good design has the potential to maintain, enhance and enrich existing  
environments, in addition to creating vibrant new places. Good quality design will  
help deliver  against  a number  of objectives  of the Local  Plan,  particularly  in relation  to 
Quality  of Place.  
 
8.3 Northumberland is rich in heritage and natural beauty . It is important that the  
character  of Northumberland,  the essence  of what  makes  it unique  and distinctive,  is 
not only conserved  but enhanced  and enriched  by new development.  Innovative  
design which reflects changing architectural styles and construction techniques  can 
make  a valuable  contribution  towards  this objective.  Appropriate  consideration  should 
be given by developers, designers and assessors to the reality that the  buildings and 
places created now will become part of Northumberland's heritage  and legacy  in the 
future.  
 
Design  
 
8.4 Delivering high quality design is not only about creating an aesthetically pleasing  built 
environment. The s ocial, environmental and economic benefits of good  design  are 
well documented. A well -designed building or place can contribute to the  economic 
vitality of a community and reduce operating and maintenance costs.  General 
wellbeing of individuals and communi ties can also be enhanced by high  quality 
inclusive spaces and buildings which encourage healthier lifestyles, welcome 
diversity and improve general amenity. Incorporating natural features within the  
design of developments, allows daily exposure to nature with its health benefits  and 
addresses health inequalities. In terms of the environment, good design can  
contribute towards lessening and mitigating the effects of climate change, promoting 
efficient  use of finite  natural  resources  and enhancing  the natura l environment.  
 
8.5 Buildings  and spaces  should  therefore  function  properly,  both individually  but also to 
create integrated places and local areas. Incremental additions or changes to  
Northumberland through new development must be designed to respond to the 
existing and anticipated physical, social, economic and environmental context, both  
locally  and in terms  the wider  perspective.  
 
8.6 Policy  QOP1  sets out design  principles  which  must  underpin  the design  of any new 
proposed development in Northumberland. The design principles seek to ensure  that 
development contributes positively to the people, places and natural  environment  
that define  Northumberland.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  8.7 The assessment of design against Policy QOP 1 should be proportionate, taking into 
accou nt the type, scale and context of the development. A supplementary planning 
document, the Northumberland Design Guide, will be prepared which will include 
more guidance on the requirements of the design principles and other design -related 
policies within t he Local Plan65. Once the SPD has been adopted, it should be read 
alongside Policy QOP 1. In the interim, applicants should refer to further guidance set 
out in the National Design Guide.

Design  principles  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. In determining planning applications, design will be assessed against the following 
design principles, where relevant, having regard to the Northumberland Design 
Guide.  Development proposals should:  
 
a. Make a positive contribution to local character and dist inctiveness and 
contribute to a positive relationship between built and natural features, 
including landform and topography;  
 
b. Create or contribute to a strong sense of place and integrate the built form of 
the development with the site overall, and the wid er local area, having 
particular regard to:  
 
i. Building heights;   
ii. The form, scale and massing, prevailing around the site;   
iii. The framework of routes and spaces connecting locally and more widely;   
iv. The pattern of any neighbouring or local regular plot and b uilding widths, 
and where appropriate, follow existing building lines;   
v. the need to provide active frontages to the public realm; and   
vi. distinctive local architectural styles, detailing and materials;  
 
c. Be visually attractive and incorporate high quality materials and detailing;  
 
d. Respect and enhance the natural, developed and historic environment, 
including heritage, environmental and ecological assets, and any significant 
views or landscape setting;  
 
e. Ensure that buildings and spaces are functional and adaptable for future uses;  
 
f. Facilitate an inclusive, comfortable, user -friendly and legible environment;  
 
g. Support health and wellbeing and enhance quality of life;

including measures where relevant to reduce the risk of crime and the fear of 
crime;  
 
i. Not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of existing and future occupiers of 
the site and its surroundings;  
 
j. Incorporate, where possible, green infrastructure and opp ortunities to support 
wildlife, while minimising impact on biodiversity and contributing to 
environmental net gains;  
 
k. Make provision for efficient use of resources;  
 
l. Respond to the climatic conditions of the location and avoid the creation of 
adverse local  climatic conditions;  
 
m. Mitigate climate change, and be adaptable to a changing climate; and  
 
n. Ensure the longevity of the buildings and spaces, and secure the social, 
economic and environmental benefits over the lifetime of the development.  
 
2. Great weight will be given to proposals which demonstrate outstanding or 
innovative design, in line with the requirements set out in national policy and having 
regard to the relevant guidance in the N orthumberland  Design  Guide.  
 
 
 
Amenity  
 
8.8 Amenity is not comprehensively defined in any planning legislation or national 
planning policy but the term is commonly used to refer to the quality or character of 
an area and elements that contribute towards the enjoyment of an area. In terms of 
managing development, a menity is related to how people experience a place, 
building or space and how this is impacted upon by the type and design of new 
development. Development can affect the amenity of the people that come into 
contact with it, whether they use the development  itself, adjacent buildings and 
spaces or the wider local area.  
 
8.9 The way in which development impacts upon amenity may be related to the uses and 
character of land and how they relate to each other. For example, a new industrial 
development will potentiall y have a different impact on amenity if it is located next to 
a residential area rather than another industrial use. Similarly, a large poster -
hoarding may have a different impact on amenity in a small historical centre than a 
large commercial urban centre . The design of a development proposal, including 
aspects such as its massing, materials, landscaping, fenestration and the 
incorporation of green infrastructure, can have a significant impact on amenity 
generally, and affect how acceptable it may be to ne ighbouring land uses.  
 
8.10 Features or conditions that could be considered to be of amenity value will be 
specific to the details of each individual proposal. They may include but are not 8. Quality  of Place   
153 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  necessarily limited to:  
• character  and visual  quality ; 
• existing land use or features, including amenity space and vegetation ; 
•  privacy ; 
• outlook ; 
• air, sound,  light and temperature conditions ; 
•  tranquility  or freedom  from disturbance ; 
• freedom  from unpleasant  or harmful  gases  and substances.  
 
8.11 The Plan seeks to deliver high quality development and support the health and 
wellbeing of the residents, workforce and visitors of Northumberland.  Therefore, 
Policy QOP 2 seeks to ensure that new development has a positive impact on 
amenity. The assessment of amenity against Policy QOP  2 should be proportionate 
and criteria should be met where applicable, considering the context of how 
buildings, spaces and places are used and their setting. For example, overlooking will 
be more likely to have an unacceptable adverse impact on a dwellin g or a school 
than a public amenity green space, where the surveillance provided by overlooking 
helps with a sense of safety for users.  
 
8.12 The cumulative impact of the development, in relation to the effects of other nearby 
development, may be a relevant co nsideration when assessing a proposal against 
the criteria set out in Policy QOP 2 (part 3). Cumulative impacts are those which 
result from incremental changes caused by other existing or committed 
developments, together with the proposed development. In p ractice, this means that 
the development may have an acceptable impact in isolation but when combined with 
the effects of other development, the total impact may be unacceptable. Cumulative 
impact may be particularly relevant in terms of the effects of pol lutants, disturbances 
and other harmful effects on the users of neighbouring development identified in 
criterion f of Policy QOP 2 (part 2). Visual impact, in relation to criterion a of Policy 
QOP 2 (part 2) is another example of where cumulative effects m ay be particularly 
relevant, for example, in relation to the placement and design of advertisements.  
 
8.13 In order to ensure that development meets the requirements of Policy QOP 2, any 
mitigation measures needed to preserve the amenity of neighbouring uses should be 
incorporated into proposals. Where the operation of an existing development could 
have an adverse impact on the proposed development, the applicant, or ‘agent of 
change’ will be required to provide suitable mitigation.  
 
8.14 Where Po licy QOP 2 (part 2) refers to ‘habitable’ areas, this relates to places that are 
regularly or continually occupied by people. Part 2(d) of the policy seeks to ensure 
that the environmental conditions of habitable areas within the development are 
healthy an d comfortable and that adverse impacts resulting from the development 
are avoided. Habitable areas within development proposals should provide adequate 
ventilation, and design should take account of the potential effects of temperature 
extremes in summer a nd winter, for example by managing solar gain. Sound pollution 
should be minimised, through site selection, layout and building design. The Building 
Research Establishment (BRE) document ‘Site Layout Planning for Daylight and 
Sunlight: A Guide to Good Prac tice’ provides useful guidance around achieving 
adequate light levels.  8. Quality  of Place

Policy  QOP  2 
 
Good  design  and amenity  
 
1. Development will be required to provide a high standard of amenity for existing and 
future users of the development itself and not cause unacceptable harm to the 
amenity of those living in, working in or visiting the local area.  
 
2. Development proposals will  need to ensure that the following criteria are met where 
applicable, taking into account any relevant cumulative effects and possible 
mitigation measures:  
 
a. The physical presence and design of the development preserves the character 
of the area and does no t have a visually obtrusive or overbearing impact on 
neighbouring uses, while outlook from habitable areas of the development is 
not oppressive and the best outcomes for outlook are achieved wherever 
possible;  
 
b. Trees, other green and blue infrastructure and soft landscaping of amenity 
value are retained where appropriate and are introduced or replaced where 
they would enhance amenity of the development;  
 
c. The appropriate levels of privacy, according to the use of buildings and spaces, 
are in corporated into the design of the new development and are not 
unacceptably harmed in existing neighbouring development;  
 
d. Air, temperature, sound and light conditions of habitable areas within the 
development, or resulting from the development, are of an ap propriate 
standard; and  
 
e. Neighbouring uses are compatible and that there are no unacceptable adverse 
impacts from noise, disturbances, odour, gases, other emissions and any other 
harmful effects , resulting  from either  the development  or from neighbouring  
uses on the development.  
 
 
 
Design  of the public  realm  
 
8.16 The public realm is the network of streets, spaces, buildings and structures that  the 
public have access to. Public areas enable people to move between places,  provide  
the setting  for civic life and facilitate  social  activities  and recreation.  As the public  
realm  is shared  by different  people  and may be used  for different  purposes,  it is 
important  that public  places  are designed  to be flexible,  functional  for all, easy  to 
understand  and promote  positive  social  interaction.  8. Quality  of Place   
155 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  8.17 Policy  QOP  3 sets out the requirements  for new development  that incorporates   public  
buildings  and spaces . Policy QOP 3 should be read alongside the more detailed 
guidance set out in the Northumberland Design Guide SPD.  
 
 
 
Policy  QOP  3 
 
Public  realm  design  principles  
 
1. In addition  to the overarching  design  principles  set out in Policy  QOP  1, where 
relevant, the design  of the public  realm  will be expected  to: 
 
a. Create diverse, vibrant buildings and spaces which contribute to supporting a 
range of public activity;  
b. Be physically and socially accessible and inclusive;  
c. Be clearly defined from private spaces;  
d. Have a clear hierarchy of routes and spaces, which are faced by active 
frontages and maximise natural surveillance;  
e. Prioritise pedestrian and cycle movement and facilitate access to public 
transport wherever possible;  
f. Avoid dominance of vehicles and ensure that parking, where included, is 
sensitively integrated;  
g. Maximise urban greening, including the use o f street trees and other vegetation 
as appropriate;  
h. Respond to opportunities to incorporate public art where possible; and 
i. Incorporate  appropriate  street  furniture,  lighting  and surface  materials.  
 
 
 
Landscaping  and trees  
 
8.18 The way in which development changes the exterior environment can have a 
significant impact on amenity, health, wellbeing, ecology and the natural 
environment. To ensure the delivery of well -designed places which preserve and 
enhance the exterior environment, the way in wh ich development proposals respond 
to existing exterior areas and features of a site, and the design of exterior spaces that 
will form part of the development site need to be considered.  
 
8.19 Sites may include valuable characteristics and features, which could be sensitively 
integrated into the design of development, or may have little existing value and can 
be enhanced by landscaping. Where exterior spaces will form part of a new 
development, well -designed landscaping can create valuable spaces and features 
that can deliver benefits for people, wildlife and the environment.  
 
8.20 Policy QOP 4 seeks to ensure that high quality exterior environments are achieved 
through an appropriate approach to the existing characteristics of a site,  well-
designed landscaping and the protection and enhancement of trees and other green 
and blue infrastructure. This includes ensuring that the benefits of well -designed 
outdoor spaces will continue to be experienced long after developments are 8. Quality  of Place

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  completed. T herefore, where schemes are granted planning permission, the Council 
will seek to ensure that provision is made for the long term maintenance of new 
landscaped areas through conditions or legal agreements, as necessary.  
 
8.21 Policy QOP 4 should be read alongsi de the more detailed guidance set out in the 
Northumberland Design Guide SPD.  
 
Trees  
 
8.22 Trees and other vegetation are important elements of Green Infrastructure. They 
make a valuable contribution towards the environment, benefiting amenity, health, 
wellbein g, wildlife and climate, in addition to improving resilience to adverse weather 
conditions and regulating micro -climates. The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 
places a duty on planning authorities to ensure that adequate provision is made for 
the preserv ation or planting of trees in response to development proposals. The Act 
further allows authorities to make Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) to protect trees 
'in the interests of amenity' and provides separate protection powers for trees in 
Conservation Are as. 
 
8.23 The NPPF recognises the importance of trees, seeks net environmental gain from 
development and prevents the loss of any ancient woodland and ancient or veteran 
trees except in wholly exceptional circumstances66. The Council will seek to ensure 
that, wherever possible, new development does  not result in the loss of any trees 
which are valuable to people and the environment and will seek to maximise 
appropriate tree cover in new development. This includes protecting trees and other 
vegetation from  damage during construction through the use of  conditions. The 
Council will also protect trees in accordance with its statutory powers, through the 
use of TPOs and planning conditions.  Any vegetation which is already protected, 
including trees within Conse rvation Areas, trees with Tree Preservation Orders 
(TPOs), protected habitats and important hedgerows, will be preserved in 
accordance with the relevant national legislation, policy and guidance. Where the 
loss of a protected tree is granted permission, re placement compensatory planting 
will be sought.  
 
8.24 All trees are considered to provide benefits. Therefore, wherever possible trees 
should be retained as part of development, or where this is not possible, replacement 
planting should be provided. Large and m ature trees are considered to deliver 
increased benefits and particular care is needed in terms providing adequate space 
to secure their future survival and maintenance. Where there are trees on or adjacent 
a development site, tree surveys should be undert aken, and advice from  
arboriculturalists sought, and practice guidance considered67. 
 
  
 
66  The Government's  25 year Plan to improve  the Environment  (2018)  and its Tree Health  Resilience   Strategy 
(2018) set out why it is important to preserve and plant trees and make a commitment to  improve  the 
extent,  connectivity,  diversity  and condition  of trees.  
67  British  Standard  BS5837:2012  'Trees  in relation  to design,  demolition  and construction'  provides  good  
practice  guidance  in terms  of how to identify  and manage  trees  as part of the design  and construction  
process.  8. Quality  of Place

Landscaping  and trees  
 
1. Where  relevant,  new development  will be expected  to incorporate  well-designed  
landscaping  and respond  appropriately  to any existing  landscape  features.  
 
2. Development  proposals  should  ensure  that: 
 
a. Landscaping design is of a high quality, in accordance with the principles set  
out in Policy  QOP  1; 
 
b. Existing features which contribute towards the character of the area, or 
amenity, are retained wherever possible and sympathetically incorporated into  
the overall  design  of the scheme;  
 
c. Any hard or soft landscaping is appropriate, functional and well -integrated into  
the design  of the development;  
 
d. Trees, and other spaces and features that provide green and blue 
infrastructure, are preserved, enhanced and introduced into the landscaping  
scheme  wherever  possible;  
 
e. There is no loss of existing trees which are valuable in terms of amenity, 
biodiversity or the landscape, except where this would be unavoidable and:  
 
i. considerations in favour of the development would outweigh any harm 
resulting from the loss of trees; and  
ii. the loss can be adequately mitigated through measures such as 
replacement planting wher e possible;  
 
f. Planting schemes are compatible and appropriate to the site and its use; 
species that may damage other vegetation or wildlife should be avoided . 
 
3. Development resulting in the loss or deterioration of ancient woodland and ancient 
or veteran trees will not be permitted unless wholly exceptional reasons exist to 
justify any loss or deterioration and a suitable compensatory strategy has been 
proposed.  
 
 
 
Sustainable  design  and construction  
 
8.25 The sustainable design and construction of new development has an important role 
to play in terms of ensuring prudent use of natural resources and responding 
proactively to climate change. Consideration of how to minimise demand on 
resources, such as energ y and water, as part of the design process is important for 
reducing running costs and improving efficiency. Improving the sustainability of 
building construction and use, and supporting small scale renewable and low carbon 8. Quality  of Place   
158  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  energy generation provides an op portunity to deliver the objectives of addressing 
climate change and managing natural resources.  
 
8.26 Whilst Building Regulations address technical standards in buildings, the Local Plan 
seeks to ensure that development is environmentally sustainable and as su ch 
applications will need to demonstrate that considerations set out in Policy QOP 5 
have guided the design process. This includes consideration of opportunities to 
incorporate passive design measures, for example the potential for solar gain and 
natural v entilation through the siting, orientation and layout of a development. Other 
key considerations include the potential to connect to or incorporate district energy 
systems, renewable energy, water recycling and waste reduction.  
 
8.27 The selection of materials, the type of construction and the layout of spaces can 
influence how efficiently resources are used and how much embodied carbon 
development contains. Prioritising the use of locally sourced, recycled and energy 
efficient building materials is on e way in which development can reduce resource 
requirements and embodied carbon. Therefore, applicants should demonstrate within 
their Design and Access Statement that, wherever possible, they have given first 
consideration to materials that can be sourced  closest to the development site, those 
which are recycled or constitute surplus/waste construction products and those which 
have high thermal or solar performance.  
 
8.28 District energy networks distribute energy from one or more central sources to 
buildings, through underground pipes and cables. Such networks can range in scale 
from those covering large urban areas, incorporating heat recovered from  industry , 
and urban infrastructure, to those generating heat and providing it to two or more 
buildings. Heat net works are particularly efficient and cost effective when used to 
cover large areas, where heat recovery gains may be greatest and there is a mix of 
uses which balance energy demand. However, smaller networks can also be 
effective, particularly in rural are as, where housing developments may need to occur 
off-grid, using a central renewable energy source such as a biomass boiler. 
Opportunities may also arise in the future, such as government incentives or 
technological advancements which improve the feasibili ty and viability of smaller 
district heat networks. Developers should consider whether there is an existing 
district energy network which would be feasible and viable to connect new 
developments to and assess the potential to incorporate new district netwo rks where 
there are clear opportunities.  
 
8.29 Another important way in which design can minimise resource use and carbon 
emissions is by ensuring that development can facilitate adaptation, conversion and 
extension in the future. The re -use and adaptation of e xisting buildings and spaces 
minimises the need for future rebuild or extensive alterations and therefore reduces 
the consumption of resources. In designing schemes, consideration should be given 
to aspects including: the layout, shape and dimensions of ro oms and how these 
could support multi -functionality; the ease in which interior partitions could be altered 
or removed; and whether internal fittings and building services can be accessed and 
altered. In order to comply with the requirements of part h of P olicy QOP 5, 
applicants should set out within their Design and Access Statements the ways in 
which the lifespan of the development has been taken into account and if there are 
any necessary elements of a scheme which may prevent future modifications. 8. Quality  of Place

Sustainable  design  and construction  
 
1. In order to mi nimise resource use, mitigate climate change, and ensure 
development proposals are adaptable to a changing climate, proposals will be 
supported if they, where feasible:  
 
a. Incorporate passive design measures which respond to exist ing and 
anticipated climatic conditions and improve the efficiency of heating, cooling, 
ventilation and lighting;  
 
b. Prioritise the use of locally sourced, recycled and energy efficient building 
materials;  
 
c. Incorporate or connect to small -scale renewable and  low carbon energy 
systems which contribute towards the supply of energy to the development, 
unless this would not be viable;  
 
d. Connect to an existing or approved district energy scheme where viable and in 
the case of major development proposals consider op portunities to incorporate 
a district energy network;  
 
e. Facilitate the efficient use of water ; measures such as water recycling systems 
will be encouraged;  
 
f. Incorporate measures to reduce waste generated during construction, including 
the recovery of materi als on -site, and ensure there is appropriate provision for 
recyclable and non -recyclable waste;  
 
g. Minimise vulnerability to flooding in areas at risk of flooding from all sources, or 
where the development may increase flood risk elsewhere,  through use of 
materials, green and blue infrastructure and other design features as 
appropriate; and  
 
h. Are flexible to allow for future modification, refurbishment and retrofitting.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Delivering  well-designed  places  
 
8.31 The design process should grow from a robust analysis of both the immediate 
context and the wider locality. How a design evolves and the way in which the 
designer has responded to the key considerations set out in local design 
requirements should be demonstrated within a Design and Access Statement as part 
of a planning application. Clarification of th e design process, using drawings, models 
and written description, is vital to the assessment of a development proposal as it 
demonstrates how key design principles have been considered. Although Design and 
Access statements are not a requirement of all pla nning applications, the local design 
requirements set out in the Local Plan and the Northumberland Design Guide, should 
inform the design process of all developments and should be embodied in the final 
proposal. Where applicable, locally -specific design re quirements in a neighbourhood 
plan should also inform the design process, while local character assessments 
should be considered.  
 
8.32 The Council will encourage the use of design processes and tools which can be 
valuable in improving the quality of a development proposal. In particular, the use of 
master planning, design briefs, frameworks and codes, and design review will be 
supported. Early discussions and consultation in relation to the design of any 
proposed development will be regarded as extremely valuable to achieving the best 
possible design outcomes and will be encouraged.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9. Connectivity  and Movement  
 
Introduction  
 
9.1 The Local Plan seeks to create a sustainable pattern of development which will result 
in a reduction in the need to travel, with the majority of development focused in the 
most sustainable locations. Living closer to jobs, education, services and amenities 
and making the most of communication technologies can lead to more sustainable 
travel, reduced carbon emissions and more sustainable and enduring communities in 
the long term.  
 
9.2 The alignment of improvements  to transport and connectivity with development  and 
economic growth supported by investment in infrastructure is a key objective  of the 
plan.  Removing  the need  for motorised  travel  and improving  the design  and 
implementation  of accessible  transport  systems  supports  positive  health  and 
wellbeing. Creating public spaces that are open and accessible, green spaces/routes 
and designing our systems to improve accessibility all play a role in what people do 
and encourage active travel.  
 
9.3 The critical  importance  of ensuring  connectivity  is fully recognised.  The Local  Plan 
seeks  to maintain  and support  a local transport  system  and Information  and 
Communications Technology (ICT) connections that are resilient and responsive to 
changing needs. There are a number of emerging technologies that have the 
potential to become mainstream and the Local Plan should enable such 
enhancements to come forward.  
 
9.4 Northumberland is the most sparsely populated county in England; there are  
challenges of connecting remote rur al communities, and sometimes unavoidable  
reliance upon car based travel. Northumberland is interdependent with neighbouring 
areas, including the city regional economies of both Tyne and Wear and Edinburgh. 
These factors present specific issues for ensurin g the mobility of knowledge, people, 
goods and services. Effective connections across boundaries will remain crucial  to 
the County’s  success.  
 
Regional  and local  transport  strategies,  plans  and policies  
 
9.5 The Local  Plan is one of a range  of strategies  and plans  that address  connectivity  
and access  matters.  Regional  and Local  Transport  Bodies  and Strategies  include:  
• Transport  for the North  - A sub -national statutory body with a strategic 
investment framework;  
• North East Local Enterprise Partnership - Have produced a Strategic 
Economic Plan for the North East which sets out the strategic ambitions for the 
region;  
• North of Tyne Combined Authority  - The emerging North of Tyne Combined 
Authority will report through  a joint transport committee (with the North East 
Combined Authority (NECA) ) having responsibility for strategic transport in the 
region and covers the local authority areas of Northumberland, Newcastle and  
North Tyneside. Its transport role will be critic al in supporting a growing economy;  
 9. Connectivity  and Movement   
163 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • Local  Transport  Plan  and accompanying  Implementation  Plan produced  by 
Northumberland  County  Council  sets out the priorities;  and 
• Northumberland  Economic  Strategy  produced by Northumberland County 
Council and accompanying delivery framework.  
 
9.6 The strategic context of these plans has been addressed through the development of 
Northumberland’s Local Plan and key policies developed which address:  
• Sustainable connections within and beyond development;   
• Core  Strategi c and Local  Road  Network  connections;  
• Parking within development ; 
• Safeguarding existing and future rail infrastructure;  
• the Airport; and  
• Ports  and Harbours.  
 
Promoting  sustainable  connections  
 
9.7 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) highlights that the Local Plan 
should support a range of transport modes with priority given to walking, cycling and 
public transport and consideration of access for people with disabilities.  
 
9.8 The environmental impact of transport choices affects public he alth. Poor air quality, 
early mortality and climate change are less obvious impacts and the focus of policy is 
often on economic growth and safety. Patterns of development that locate jobs, 
housing and recreation in close proximity increase the potential f or walking, cycling 
and public transport and associated improvements to air quality.  
 
9.9 Well designed and safe access routes encourage walking. Streets and public spaces 
play an important part as areas for social interaction. Within the hierarchy of 
sustaina ble modes, pedestrians are a priority and developing links and facilities  into 
the existing networks is a key consideration for all development through the plan 
period. There is a need to protect and enhance networks for everyday walking, 
cycling and horse riding but also the recreational networks that form an important 
component of the visitor and tourism economy.  
 
9.10 Northumberland has an extensive public rights of way network along with more  
informal routes. This network provides access for walking, cy cling and horse riding. 
Cycling infrastructure includes cycle routes which are not public rights of way. The 
Council will look to protect and enhance the coverage, standards and safety of these 
networks in accordance with the Council's Rights of Way Improv ement Plan.  
 
9.11 Through the development of Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans  
(LCWIP), the Council will work with partners to create and develop the strategic 
cycling network across the County. Cycle hubs to support tourism and leisure use will 
be positively supported. Cycle parking will be required at key destinations, rail 
stations and at new developments  to facilitate sustainable choices.  
 9. Connectivity  and Movement   
164  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9.12 Northumberland currently hosts car club facilities across the County. Electric vehicle 
charging is available at a variety of locations across the County and the Council is 
working towards increasing the amount of charge points. Electric and ultra -low 
emiss ion vehicles can play a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Charging cars at home overnight using a dedicated chargepoint is generally cheaper 
and more convenient for consumers and is expected to be central to the future 
charging ecosystem.  Early in the design process for residential development, 
developers should identify a route by which any relevant cabling could be run in the 
future to facilitate the installation of electric vehicle charging points at safe, accessible 
and convenient poin ts, including within garages (where these meet or exceed 
minimum sizes to count as a parking space (Appendix E), on external walls 
accessible for parked cars, and also outwith the curtilage of properties where parking 
is to be provided in a shared private car park. This should serve to minimise 
disruptive retrofitting, which damages the building fabric. In addition, for all other 
development types, where parking is provided in a car park, consideration should be 
given to ensuring the future routing of cabli ng and installation of electric vehicle 
charging points does not negatively affect pedestrian amenity, and should ideally 
facilitate installation of charging points off the footway.  
 
9.13 Opportunities to maximise connectivity by bus inevitably vary between urb an and 
rural areas. The timetabling and funding of public transport services, use of public 
rights of way and the cycle route network lie outside the scope of the planning 
system, however the Local Plan provides a positive planning policy framework for the  
improvement of facilities and networks. Developments should provide accessibility to 
public transport and, in more rural areas, where this may not be economically viable, 
then more flexible services / community transport should be considered.  
 
 
  
9. Connectivity  and Movement   
165 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9.14 Behavioural change by enabling people to make smarter choices to walk, cycle or 
use public transport more for journeys to work, home, school and leisure 
destinations, especially in the towns within the County, is a priority for the Council. 
The important l ink between health and wellbeing and transport should be recognised 
and considered from a development site to a strategic level.  
 
9.15 Travel information, road safety and demand management measures also play a vital 
part alongside traditional infrastructure imp rovements to support sustainable modes. 
The Council will support the introduction of these measures.  
 
 
Promoting  sustainable  connections  commitments  
 
To promote sustainable connections, the Council will work collaboratively to:  
 
1. Reduce  the need  to travel;  
2. Support a range of transport modes with priority given to walking, cycling and 
public transport; and  
3. Support a local transport system and network that is resilient and responsive to 
changing needs.  
 
The Council will support the development of car c lubs and Electric Vehicle charging 
facilities in the County in partnership with other organisations, service providers and 
developers.  
 
The Council recognises the need to support the provision and management of 
appropriate levels of public car parking, par ticularly to serve town centres. The Council 
will continue to work with landowners and partners to support the best use of parking 
space within town centres and will work to improve and enhance those areas through 
development opportunities as they arise.  
 
The Council will work collaboratively to support the delivery and upgrading of high -
quality digital infrastructure, providing access to services from a range of providers.

Connections  with Northumberland's  transport  network  
 
9.16 A comprehensive  system  of local highways  is essential  for connecting  
Northumberland's communities, residents, services and jobs. To ensure a network 
suitable for the plan period and beyond is developed, the Local Plan seeks to 
prioritise the opportunities for non -car trips and a reduction in carbon emissions, 
however, it has to be recognised that there will still be a need to facilitate motorised 
transport journeys, including as a result of new development.  
 
9.17 The Council will require Travel  Plans  to manage  uses  with significant  associated trip  
generation68.

The effects  of development  on the transport  network  
 
1. All developments affecting the transport network will be required to:  
 
a. Provide effective and safe access and egress to the existing transport network;  
 
b. Include appropriate measures to avoid, mitigate and manage any significant 
impacts on highway capacity, congestion or on highway safety including any 
contribution to cumulative impacts;  
 
c. Minimise conflict between different modes of transport, including measures for 
network, t raffic and parking management where necessary;  
 
d. Facilitate the safe use of the network, including suitable crossing points, 
footways and dedicated provision for cyclists and equestrian users where 
necessary;  
 
e. Suitably accommodate the delivery of goods and supplies, access for 
maintenance and refuse collection where necessary; and  
 
f. Minimise any adverse impact on communities and the environment , including 
noise and air quality.

168  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9.19 Northumberland's core road network plays an important economic role in facilitating 
the movement of people and freight across Northumberland whilst providing  
connections to the neighbouring authorities and the wider region. It is therefore  
critical  that the network  is fit for purpose.  
 
9.20 Future  improvements  to the Strategic  Road Network currently include 13 miles of 
upgrade to dual carriageway linking Morpeth and Alnwick bypasses with the dual 
carriageway near Ellingham. This will create a continuous, high -quality dual 
carriageway from Newcastle to Ellingham enabling greater access to and from 
Northumberland. Enhancements to the performance and safety of the A1 North of 
Ellingham have recently been completed with the long -term vision to upgrade the full 
A1 to Expressway standard.  
 
9.21 The Council will continue to work with Highways England on the further assessment, 
development and implementation of Strategic Road Network schemes, and to 
determine the necessary phasing of the improvements and how these will coinci de 
with the delivery and phasing of the Plan's developments. The work has helped to 
identify appropriate means and mitigation to address the impacts of development 
including the A19 North of Newcastle junction works.  
 
9.22 Highways England, through their Road I nvestment Strategy, will identify measures 
along those corridors of the Strategic Road Network. In addition to this the Council 
will need to explore the opportunities related to the emerging DfT  and Transport for 
the North Major Road Networks which covers the road network with sub regional 
significance including access to the County’s main ports.  
 
9.23 The Countywide Transport Assessment69 has assessed key parts of the local 
highway network, and has i dentified where future development may give rise to 
issues on the local network. Similarly to the analysis of the core road network, it has 
helped to identify appropriate means of mitigation to address the impacts of 
development both individually (for pote ntial significant scale future developments) 
and cumulatively70. This includes opportunities for removing non -essential traffic from 
the highway network, shifting to more sustainable modes, physical measures to 
address movement and capacity constraints, in cluding effective traffic management 
and signage.  
 
9.24 A review of the need for new schemes in the form of settlement bypasses or link 
roads has been undertaken. A number of schemes identified by the former District 
Councils have been re -appraised to consider their appropriateness, feasibility and 
deliverability. Strategic Regional and Local Transport policies combined with the 
need to prioritise infrastructure investment result in a number of County priorities.  
 
9.25 It is recognised that routes for local road improvement schemes cross areas in 
private ownership, and may impact upon activities in these locations. In some 
instances, the construction of new roads may necessitate the relocation and the 
provision of new buildings and facilities. The future delivery and design of the routes 
will take into account the requirements of all road users.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9.26 A Strategic Outline Business Case71 was completed for the proposed Blyth Relief 
Road , including the following potential route alignments:  
• A new link road from Princess Loui se Road to the existing A192 /  A189  "Three  
Horseshoes"  interchange;  
• A new link road from Plessey  Road  to the existing  A192  / A189   "Three  
Horseshoes"  interchange;  and 
• Dualling  of the existing  A1061  Laverock  Hall route.  
 
9.27 Work is on -going, following consultation, with a view to identifying a preferred route 
for detailed design and bid for future funding opportunities.  
 
9.28 As the local economy develops, new freight movement patterns may emerge  
including that of abnormal loads, which the Local Core Road ne tworks must be 
flexible enough to accommodate. The Council will work with partners in the region, 
including freight management groups, throughout the plan period.  
 
9.29 Strengthening links to neighbouring authorities beyond the North East region, 
Scotland and Cumbria, including access to freight facilities is important to support 
economic development in the north. Drivers making long -distance journeys need 
access to safe and secure parking facilities, with suitable catering and sanitation 
provision . 
 
9.30 The Countywide Transport Assessment72 has helped to appraise the individual and 
cumulative impacts of development on the Local Road network. The work has 
informed the Northumberland Infrastructure Delivery Plan and its prioritisation of 
infrastructure i nvestments, including in the Core Road network.  This will inform 
initiatives to secure required funding. Where appropriate and necessary, planning 
conditions, planning obligations and Section 278 agreements may be used to 
address the highway impacts, direc tly related to a development.

Car parking  
 
9.31 National planning policy allows local planning authorities to set local parking  
standards for residential and non -residential development. Car parking needs to  be 
considered as an important part of any scheme. National planning policy requires 
that car parking provision is at an appropriate level, in safe, accessible and  
convenient  locations,  taking  account  of: 
• The accessibility of the development;  
• The type,  mix and use of development;  
• The availability of and opportunities for public transport;  
• Local car ownership  levels;  and 
• The need  to ensure  an adequate  provision  of spaces  for charging  plug-in and 
other  ultra-low emission  vehicles.  
 
9.32 The need for adequate car parking to serve all development must be an integral  
element  of the design  process.  It is expected  that opportunities  will be taken  at an 
early stage in the design process to limit any adverse visual or other impacts  arising  
from the need  to provide  adequate  parking  space  to serve  developments.  
 
9.33 Where planning for car parking to serve residential development, it is recognised that 
car ownership varies most directly in relation to dwelling size. This is reflected in the 
Council's parking standards for residential development which require variable 
provision based on the number of bedrooms in the dwelling.

172  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9.34 Policy TRA 4 sets out the Council's expectations for off -street car parking in new 
development and requires adherence to parking standards set out at Appendix E, or 
other standards which may be c reated through policies in made neighbourhood 
plans, unless it can be demonstrated that an alternative level of provision, or no 
provision, is more appropriate. In relation to non -residential development, the 
standards are not expressed as either a maximum  or a minimum. Instead, they 
provide an indication of the appropriate level of parking for different uses. With regard 
to residential development, parking requirements are expressed as the minimum 
level that would normally be required.

Parking  provision  in new development  
 
1. An appropriate amount of off -street vehicle parking sufficient to serve new  
development shall be made available in safe, accessible and convenient locations 
prior to the development, as a whole or in part, being brought into use. Vehicle 
parking should normally be provided in accordance with the parking standards set 
out in Appen dix E of the Local Plan, or other such local standards set out in made 
neighbourhood plans which will be given priority in determining the appropriate 
amount of parking required.  
 
2. Where provision is not made in accordance with the relevant standards, it mu st be 
demonstrated how the amount of parking proposed to serve the development 
takes into account:  
 
a. The scale,  type,  mix and use of the development;  
 
b. The proximity and accessibility of the development to services and facilities 
reasonably  required  by users  or occupiers  of the development;  
 
c. The availability  of and opportunities  for access  to and from the development by  
public  transport,  walking  and cycling;  
 
d. The potential for road safety and environmental problems as a result of 
increased  parking  demand  in the area;  and 
 
e. The extent and nature of any parking restrictions in force on highways in the  
area.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Safeguarding  existing  and future  potential  rail infrastructure  
 
9.35 Rail lines can have major positive benefits for the local economy and the 
environment. As well as reducing transport -related emissions, railway lines can also 
provide wildlife corridors and valuable habitats for plants and wildlife. Across 
Northumberland there are a number of rail routes providing both local and longer 
distance services for passengers and/or freight. Many of the local services are 
operating at capacity during peak periods with continuing increasing demands for 
travel. Existing rail services between Newcastle and Carlisle and Newcastle and 
Edinburgh serve a number  of settlements in Northumberland. The Council also 
recognises the benefits of rail services to the most remote communities.  
 
9.36 The road network in Northumberland crosses the rail network at grade in many 
locations. These level crossings present opportunitie s for conflict between trains, 
motor vehicles and people. Public safety at level crossings is a legitimate planning 
consideration and for this reason, Network Rail are a statutory consultee on any 
planning applications in close proximity to their network a nd on development that has 
the potential to impact on safety at level crossings. Policy TRA 5 seeks to resist the 
creation of new level crossings, thereby limiting the opportunity for additional points 
of conflict to be created on the road and rail network s; and seeks to ensure the 
impact of development on level crossings is addressed in dealing with relevant 
planning applications.  
 
9.37 The South East Northumberland corridor from the Seaton Valley to Ashington 
currently does not have rail passenger services. A key priority of the Council is the 
reintroduction of passenger services on the Northumberland Line (formerly known as 
the Ashington, Blyth, Tyne Line). This will help facilitate development growth across 
the South East Delivery Area. The line has significa nt potential to improve links 
between the towns, encourage access to employment  opportunities, and incentivise 
employers to locate in South East Northumberland, in addition to its current freight 
transport role. Significant steps have been made in taking l ong held aspirations for 
the line forward. This includes progressing plans through a Network Rail Governance 
for Railway Investment Projects (GRIP) study and assembling funding bid packages. 
Various options have been appraised, including for station locati ons, service 
frequency and the infrastructure that would be required to support the development 
and operation of the line. This includes any infrastructure requirements at level 
crossings to ensure safe operation of the rail network and minimise delay on t he 
surrounding road network. Subject to the outcome of consultation, further detailed 
work such as ground investigations, securing necessary funding and approvals, the 
line could be operational in winter 2023.  
 
9.38 A further opportunity may be available in the  long term, to link Ponteland to the Tyne 
and Wear Metro system. A dismantled railway alignment73 suggests a possibility for 
extension of the existing Metro network beyond its existing terminus at Newcastle 
Airport. Such potential would need to be subject to further investigation.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9.39 In addition , there are other rail lines which are partly operational, or which benefit 
from active projects and initiatives to facilitate reopening. The Plan aims to support 
these lines, as well as the potential reopening of Main Line stations. These lines and 
stations are:  
• The South Tynedale Railway which is operational as a recreational railway and 
visitor attraction;  
• The Aln Valley Railway, which would not only provide a new visitor attraction but 
would also op en a transport corridor between Alnwick and the East Coast Main 
Line at Alnmouth;  
• The potential reopening of Belford Station on the East Coast Main Line and 
Gilsland Station on the Tyne Valley Line.  
 
9.40 A much wider network of disused railway lines provides v aluable leisure routes for 
walking, cycling and horse riding across Northumberland. The plan seeks to retain 
these routes for leisure purposes, though it is recognised that they may also provide 
opportunities for the re -introduction of rail services at som e point in the future.  
 
9.41 In order to maximise opportunities for the movement of goods, minerals and waste by 
rail there is a need to safeguard existing rail freight interchanges in Northumberland. 
Identified potential sites include an additional rail facility near West Sleekburn f or the 
transport of waste. Existing freight facilities at the former Rio Tinto Alcan aluminium 
smelter are also a valuable asset. Some rail freight facilities are privately owned 
and/or operated. There is a need to ensure that the infrastructure is safegua rded for 
future use.  
 
 
 
Rail transport  and safeguarding  facilities  commitments  
 
The Northumberland Line - A key priority of the Council is to secure the future 
reintroduction of passenger rail services on the existing line between Benton Junction 
and Woodhorn ('The Northumberland Line'), provided that any significant adverse 
impact on the environment and communities can be mitigated.  
 
Rail Transport and Facilities - The Council will work with rail and public transport  
operators and local communities to  maintain and develop existing rail services and  
connections including along  the East Coast  Main  Line and promote  the development  
of public transport interchanges at key locations along the main East Coast Main  Line,  
Tyne  Valley  rail line and the Northumberland  Line.

supported. Proposals which jeopardise public safety at level crossings will not be 
supported. Measures to improve public safety at level crossings will be supported. 
Improvement, alteration or closure of level crossings, or appropriate contributions 
towards the implementation of such works, may be secured through the grant of 
planning permission for development where it can be demonstrated, to the 
satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, that those works are directly rel ated to 
the impact that development may have on the level crossing and they are 
necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms.  
 
 
 
Newcastle  International  Airport  
 
9.42 Newcastle International Airport is an important economic driver for investment and 
jobs in the North East, including Northumberland, and an international gateway for 
business and tourism, as well as freight. Part of the northern side of the operational 
area of the Airport is within Northumberland and the Development Plan h as long 
protected around 25 hectares within the County - partly developed and partly still 
open land - for airport uses. This will be taken forward in this Local Plan.  
 9. Connectivity  and Movement   
177 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  9.43 Improving links to Newcastle Airport and strategic connectivity supports the Airport, 
economic growth and UK competitiveness, whilst multimodal connections support 
businesses and customers.  Primary road access to the Airport is via the A696 which 
is the responsibility of Highways England. The capacity of the A696 roundabout 
which provides ac cess to the Airport has been tested, taking into account planned 
levels of growth in the Northumberland Local Plan (including the nearby employment 
land allocations), planned growth in the Newcastle  upon  Tyne Local Plan, and the 
growth aspirations of the a irport. The assessment identifies that there is more than 
sufficient capacity to accommodate this growth. However, in order to safeguard the 
capacity of the junction, planning applications on the allocated employment sites will 
require the submission of a transport assessment to ensure that traffic generated 
from specific proposals, can be accommodated, and any development not allocated 
within this Plan seeking planning permission which may increase traffic flows in this 
location, will need to demonstrate t hat they do not adversely impact upon the growth 
aspirations of the Airport, in respect to capacity at the A696 access roundabout, and 
to the satisfaction of Highways England.  
 
9.44 The continued protection of the land around the northern site of the Airport is  in line 
with the options for airport development identified in the Airport Master Plan and the 
Newcastle Gateshead Local Plan.

2. The important contribution of land within Northumberland to the functioning and 
growth of the Airport will be recognised through the allocation, for airport related 
uses, of ar ound 25 hectares of land north of the County boundary. This land will 
accommodate possible growth for passenger or freight facilities and activities

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Aerodrome  safeguarding  
 
9.45 Aerodrome safeguarding is the process used to ensure the safety of aircraft while 
taking off and landing, or in flying in the vicinity of aerodromes. Aerodrome 
Safeguarding Areas are defined around particular civil aerodromes which are  
identified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as important to the national air 
transport system74. They are neither the responsibility, nor the proposal of the Local 
Planning Authority. Parts of the Aerodrome Safeguarding Areas for Newcastle 
International Airport (NIA) and Carlisle Lake District Airport fall within 
Northumberland, and are shown on the policies map. Safeguarding authorities are 
statutory consultees for p lanning applications which could impact on the safe 
operation of aerodromes.  
 
9.46 A further non -officially safeguarded Aerodrome Safeguarding Zone is shown on the 
Policies Map relating to Eshott Airfield. The Airfield, located midway between 
Morpeth and Alnwic k, is used by recreational microlights and small light aircraft.  The 
safety of aircraft, gliders and associated operations are similarly safeguarded. The 
zone is similarly neither the responsibility, nor the proposal of the Local Planning 
Authority.  
 
9.47 The purpose of Aerodrome Safeguarding Areas is to ensure the safe operation and 
development of airports. Development is not necessarily prohibited within Aerodrome 
Safeguarding Areas; however, the Council must consult the relevant airport operator 
on planning applications for certain development types within them. If the Council 
proposes to grant planning permission contrary to the advice of the relevant airport 
operator, the Secretary of State may call the application in for determination.  
 
9.48 The types of develo pment which trigger the requirement for consultation with the 
relevant airport operator have the potential to affect the safe operation of 
aerodromes. This can be due to effects on navigational systems, pilot safety, or an 
increased risk of aircraft bird s trikes.  
 
9.49 Broadly, the Aerodrome Safeguarding Areas for Newcastle International Airport and 
Carlisle Lake District Airport contain two distinct areas. The inner safeguarding area, 
which extends approximately 13 to 15 kilometres in all directions from the ru nway, in 
which a range of development types will trigger the consultation requirement as set 
out in Policy TRA 7. There are also areas of high ground beyond 13 kilometres where 
there is the potential for navigation systems to be impacted by transient and 
permanent tall structures. There is an outer safeguarding area, which extends 30 
kilometres in all directions from the runway centreline, in which development 
proposals involving the erection of one or more wind turbines trigger the requirement 
for consulta tion. The extent of the inner and outer zone of both Aerodrome 
Safeguarding Areas are shown on the Policies Map.  
 
9.50 Eshott  aerodrome (non -official) safeguarding area, as shown on the policies map, 
extends to approximately 7 kilometres in all directions and is split into 4 different 
zones relating to the heights of buildings above ground level (AGL). Development 
 
74  Officially  safeguarded  aerodromes  are identified  in the town  and country  planning  (safeguarded  
aerodromes,  technical  sites and military  storage  areas)  direction  2002.  9. Connectivity  and Movement

airport operator for all development proposals that would trigger the nee d for 
consultation at the planning application stage.

Aerodrome  Safeguarding  Areas  
 
1. Officially safeguarded aerodromes have been established for Carlisle Lake District 
Airport and Newcastle International Airport. An unofficial safeguarded aerodrome 
has been established for Eshott Airfield. The following planning applications will be 
the su bject of consultation with the operator of the respective aerodromes and 
there may be restrictions on the height or detailed design of buildings, or on 
development which might create a bird hazard:  
 
a. All development proposals falling within the Carlisle Lak e District Airport 
Aerodrome Safeguarding Area inner zone.  
 
b. Development proposals falling within the Newcastle International Airport 
Aerodrome Safeguarding Area inner zone which include, or may include, the 
following:  
 
i. all buildings, structures, erections and works exceeding the height 
threshold specified on the Policies Map;  
ii. development using highly reflective materials such as glazed roofs or 
photovoltaic cells;  
iii. landscaping schemes, the development of open water, and building 
design which could encourage wildlife habitats and may lead to increased 
risk of an aircraft encountering a bird strike;  
iv. lighting which has the potential to cause distraction or glare for pilots, or 
could imitate airfield lighting; or  
v. induced turbulence from buildings, through heat em issions etc.  
 
c. Development proposals involving wind turbines falling within the defined 
Aerodrome Safeguarding Areas outer zones as shown on the Policies Map.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Ports,  harbours  and beach  launch  facilities  
 
9.52 Northumberland has three ports, each of which has a significant role to play in 
supporting different parts of the Northumberland economy. Although ports are subject 
to a separate national policy statement, the Local Plan is required to take acc ount of 
their role within the County. The Port of Blyth is the main functioning port in 
Northumberland, capable of handling large freight vessels. It is significant in the 
context of proposals to promote strategic economic uses around the Blyth Estuary, 
including in respect of renewable and offshore industries, for which the Port has 
already established its reputation. Handling up to 2 million tonnes of cargo per 
annum with particular expertise in the energy, project cargo, container, dry bulk and 
break bul k. High quality warehousing is also available for shipping and non shipping 
uses. The Port of Blyth is planning for further expansion in its capacity over the 
coming years. Development that supports the Port including opportunities at Blyth 
Estuary, Ashwoo d Business Park and Lynefield Park will be supported as set out in 
the Economic Development Chapter.  
 
9.53 The port of Berwick -upon -Tweed is an important small commercial port supporting 
the wider area and it is capable of handling larger freight vessels and ha s an 
important role in increasing exports and catering to the visitor economy.  
 
9.54 It is expected that both ports will continue to play a key role in the County's economy 
including in facilitating the sustainable transport of freight.  
 
9.55 Northumberland’s third port is at Amble, which is its most important fishing centre. In 
addition to the ports, Northumberland benefits from numerous harbours and beach 
launch facilities which support the fishing, and the leisure and tourism sectors each of 
which is of great impo rtance locally and to the County as a whole.  
 
9.56 While the ports, harbours and beach launch facilities are important to the economy, 
development in these areas needs to be managed to ensure the environment and 
communities are not adversely affected. Much of N orthumberland's coastline, 
estuaries and inshore waters carry international, national and local designations, 
acknowledging the importance of their landscapes, rivers and seas and the 
biodiversity which they support. A number of ports and harbours are also  of historic 
significance. The development of port, harbour and beach launch facilities takes 
place within and adjacent to, and must therefore be sensitive to, conserve and 
enhance , sites of ecological importance,  designated and non -designated heritage 
assets.  
 
9.57 A number of coastal areas are at risk of flooding from the sea. Development 
proposals should not increase the risk of flooding and ensure that there is no adverse 
impact upon water quality during construction and the operation of facilities. The 
nature of operations at ports in particular can have an adverse impact upon the 
amenity of adjacent uses and users. Developments will need to ensure unacceptable 
adverse impacts are avoided or mitigated.  
 
9.58 While other policies in the plan address a number of these matters, in addition to 
supporting development of ports, harbours and beach launch facilities, Policy TRA 8 9. Connectivity  and Movement   
182  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  seeks to ensure that potential adverse impacts, specific to developments in these

England where appropriate, and will have regard to the requirements of the Marine 
Policy Statement.  
 
 
 Ports,  harbours  and beach  launch  facilities  commitments  
 
The Council will continue  to work  with Harbour  Commissions,  Trust  Ports,  the Marine

Policy  TRA 8 
 
Ports,  harbours  and beach  launch  facilities  (Strategic  Policy)   
1. Development proposals will be supported that provide for  the expansion of port

and new freight movement patterns and suitable vehicular routes, to allow for the 
growth in sustainable sea -based freight movement.  
 
2. Proposals for the devel opment of harbour and beach launch facilities to maintain 
and sustainably grow the fishing industry will be supported.  
 
3. Appropriate leisure and tourism developments will be supported provided that they 
will not adversely impact on the functioning of comme rcial port and harbour 
activities, including the fishing industry.  
 
4. Development of port, harbour and beach launch facilities will be planned and 
implemented, taking full account of the interaction between communities, the local 
economy and the environment.  Proposals will be required to demonstrate that:  
 
a. The development would not result in a net loss of inter -tidal or sub -tidal 
habitat;  
 
b. The development would not impact on bird migration, fish migration or 
cetaceans;  
 
c. Any harm to, or loss of significance of historic ports and harbours will meet the 
relevant criteria in Policy ENV  7; and

Digital  connectivity  
 
9.60 The Council supports the extension and enhancement of electronic communications 
infrastructure across the County, provided that it will not have significant adverse  
impacts  on the environment  or local communities  which  would  otherwise  outweigh  its 
social  and economic  benefits.  
 
Planning  for high  quality  communications  infrastructure  
 
9.61 High quality communications  infrastructure  provides  a host of social,  economic  and 
environmental benefits to residents and businesses throughout Northumberland.  It is 
becoming increasingly essential for business, communities and individuals  alike.  
 
9.62 The government is clear that local authorities should not impose a ban on new  
telecommunications development in certain areas, nor should they insist on  minimum 
distances between new telecommunications development and existing development. 
Whilst  perceived  health  concerns  can be a material  planning  consideration,  the 
government has advised75 that the planning system is not the appropriate place for 
prescribing health safeguards. For this reason, Policy ICT 1 does not deal with health 
concerns, nor does it introduce health safeguards which differ from those  guidelines76 
set out by the Internat ional Commission on Non -Ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP).

work -life balance. Electronic communications infrastructure which is up -to-date and fit 
for purpose is essential to meet the changing needs of business and individual  users. 
It will be needed to  support the economic growth of the County and, as online social  
networking  becomes  an accepted  part of everyday  life, will also play an increasingly 
important role in supporting communities, facilitating community cohesion and 
reducing the need to travel.  There is still, however, a need to ensure that any 
potential adverse impacts of such infrastructure on the environment and local 
communities are minimised.  
 
9.64 Policy ICT 1 establishes criteria to be used in the determination of proposals to 
provide infrastructure for wireless telecommunications and for the extension and 
enhancement of the broadband network across Northumberland including public and 
private wirel ess broadband networks for the high speed transmission of data, 
telecommunications masts and other apparatus for mobile phone operators, and 
communications technology needed to serve particular business sectors. Wireless 
telecommunications infrastructure i ncludes: the cellular network (3G, 4G and 5G); 
fixed wireless (such as microwave); low power Internet of Things (IoT) technologies; 
and WiFi, as well as future technologies.

demonstrated  that it is not feasible  to share  existing  structures,  buildings,  sites,  
masts or other structures, new apparatus will be supported provided that the  
following  criteria  are met: 
 
a. The siting and appearance of the proposed apparatus, infrastructure and  any 
associated structures and access routes are located and designed to  minimise 
their impact on the accessibility  and visual  amenity,  character  and appearance  
of the surrounding  area;  
 
b. Where  apparatus,  infrastructure  and any associated  structures  are located  on 
a building, they should be sited and designed to minimise their impact  on the 
external  appearance  of the host building;  and 
 
c. The proposal is certified to be in conformity with the latest national guidelines 
on radiation  exposure.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  New development  and infrastructure  alignment  
 
9.66 The ability to access information and services through wireless and broadband 
facilities is an imp ortant part of modern life. Digital connectivity can add to the overall 
sustainability of a development proposal. The ability for occupiers, visitors and 
residents in new development to connect to a digital network is an important material 
planning conside ration in this context.  
 
9.67 Ensuring the facilitation of access to broadband services through the integration of 
infrastructure in new development as well as during the construction of new  roads 
and other transport corridors is therefore important to Northumb erland's communities, 
visitors and the economy. The Council will prioritise full fibre connections to existing 
and new developments as these connections will, in almost all cases, provide the 
optimum solution.  
 
9.68 The construction of new roads and other trans port corridors provides opportunities to 
deliver infrastructure, such as ducting for broadband and telecommunications, to 
support and help facilitate the delivery of those services. Policy ICT 2 seeks t o 
ensure that opportunities to align infrastructure pr ovision are not missed in the 
interest of securing efficient and timely provision of services. Such an approach will 
help to improve the viability of the delivery of  high quality  communications 
infrastructure.

New developments   
 
1. All new dwellings  and business  premises  should  be provided  with  the infrastructure 
necessary to allow the development to be served by high  quality  communications  
infrastructure.  Where possible, this should provide access to services from a 
range of suppliers. This should include full fibre broadband connections as these 
connections will, in almost all cases, provide the optimum solution. Alternative 
broadband solutions may be appropriate, where these can be justified. Where no 
broadband provision is included, developers will be required to demonstrate, 
including through consultation with broadband providers, that connections are not 
deliverable, and /or viable.  10. Environment   
186  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  10. Environment  
 
Introduction  
 
10.1 Northumberland's environment is distinctive and valued; it is a significant asset. The 
sweeping landscapes and seascapes, important wildlife habitats, iconic landmarks 
and characteristic towns and villages within the County are hugely valued, not just by 
local inhabitants, but also by th e many visitors from across the region and beyond.  
 
10.2 The natural environment of Northumberland is distinguished by a unique pattern  of 
geology, natural landforms, river systems and soils. While these strongly influence 
the landscape  and wildlife,  much  of what is valued  can be attributed  to human  
influence. Many of the most attractive landscapes and much of the wildlife reflect the 
turbulent social and economic history, agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining,  
manufacturing, commerce, the building and expansion of communities and, most 
recently, tourism.  
 
10.3 The County's rich cultural heritage has left a diverse legacy of well -preserved  
archaeological  sites,  buildings  and other  assets.  In terms  of the built environment,  
many of the County's main historic l andmarks, as well as the distinctive character  of 
traditional market towns, villages, hamlets and farmsteads have their origin in  the 
ancient, mediaeval and pre -industrial history. The more recent past has also  created  
distinctive  buildings,  structures  and townscapes,  which  continue  to evolve.  
 
10.4 The biodiversity  elements  of the landscape  and the architectural  and historic  fabric  
which they support can be fragile and require protection. One of the Strategic  
Objectives of the Local Plan seeks to conserve and e nhance Northumberland's  
distinctive environment. This will have wider benefits to the community, through  
positive  effects  on physical  and mental  health,  and for the local economy,  through  
continuing  to attract  visitors  and investment  to the County.  
 
10.5 The conservation  and enhancement  of Northumberland's  environment  requires  an 
ecosystem approach which looks beyond designated sites and protected species  to 
consider  natural  systems  as a whole  and fully recognise  the value  of Natural  Capital 
(the stock of mine rals, soils, air, water and species that exist around us) in terms of 
the ecosystem services that it provides. Ecosystem services are the things that 
nature does for us such as pollination of crops, storage of carbon in wood and peat, 
the regulation of flo oding in wetlands and the health and wellbeing benefits that 
people derive from contact with nature. The ecosystem approach, adopted within the 
Local Plan, aims to integrate plan -making and development management into the 
management of natural systems acro ss wide areas. This will, in turn, contribute to 
informing the levels of protection to be given to sites and species.  10. Environment   
187 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
Environment  commitments  
 
In the context of the ecosystem approach, and recognising the health, social and 
economic benefits derived from the enjoyment of Northumberland's rich natural, 
historic and built environment, the Council will work with relevant lead authorities, land 
and property owners, local communities and groups, developers, adjoining local 
planning authorities and Local Nature Partnerships to:  
 
• Identify opportunities for appropriate environmental enhancements, including:  
 
i. Habitat  improvement,  restoration  and creation;  
ii. Enhancement  of landscape  quality  in accordance  with valued  characteristics;  and 
iii. Restoring,  enhancing  and, where  appropriate,  bringing  into viable  use  heritage  
assets.  
 
• Gather, record and update evidence to advance understanding of the significance 
of Northumberland's natural and historic environment and heritage assets; and  
 
• Identif y opportunities to make information on assets widely accessible and 
promote the enjoyment of the physical and cultural components of these assets.  
 
 
 
Designated  areas  
 
10.6 The County contains large numbers of designated areas both in terms of the natural 
and historic environment. The main designations are summarised in Table 10.1, 
which in turn cross refers to Appendix F that lists those individual designations that 
cover an  area but are not always easy to distinguish on the Policies Map. 
Designations vary in importance from having international recognition through to local 
designations. It is important to bear in mind that the position of an asset in the 
hierarchy does not a lways give the full picture on its importance. For example, 
ancient woodlands are often not covered by a statutory designation but are 
nevertheless irreplaceable; likewise many heritage assets of archaeological interest 
are not designated but are demonstra bly of equivalent significance to scheduled 
monuments.  
 
10.7 Indirect impacts on designated sites can be as significant as direct effects. This 
would include a marked increase in the numbers of people residing close to or 
visiting the vicinity of key designated areas or assets.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10. Environment   
188  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  10.8 There is a particular approach that must be applied when looking at impacts on the 
historic environment:  
• The potential scale of loss or harm caused by development, must be measured 
against the significance of the assets affected. The total loss or substantial harm 
to assets of the highest significance should be wholly exceptional. In other cases 
substantial harm or loss should be resisted unless outweighed by  substantial 
public benefit77. The incremental loss of de signated assets will be guarded 
against.  
• In order to decide what would constitute a substantial public benefit, 
consideration will be given to the degree to which the proposal would benefit the 
public at large, in terms of their community their local econo my and/or their local 
environment, rather than just being a private benefit. Public benefits may include 
heritage benefits such as securing the optimum viable use of a heritage asset in 
support of its long term conservation - e.g. where an alteration to it  is the only 
means of bringing the property into use and removing risks to it.  
 
 
 
  
 
77  In the case of designated heritage assets, Government policy is very clear at NPPF paragraphs 201 and 
202 (July 2021)  - i.e. that substantial harm to (or total loss of significance of) a designated heritage asset  
should be wholly exceptional and only grant ed if substantial public benefits outweigh the substantial  harm  
or loss. If this cannot  be achieved,  all of the following  must  apply:  (a) The nature  of the heritage   asset would 
prevent all reasonable uses of the site; and (b) no viable use of the heritage  asset itself  could  be found  in 
the medium  term through  appropriate  marketing  that would  enable  its conservation ; and (c) a funded 
solution could not be secured; and (d) the harm or loss would be outweighed by  bringing the site back into 
use. Where a development proposal would lead to less than substantial  harm  to the significance  of the 
designated  heritage  asset,  this harm  would  need  to be weighed  agains t the public  benefits  of the proposal  
including,  where  appropriate,  securing  its optimum  viable  use.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  An overarching approach for the Northumber land environment  
 
10.9 The Council wishes to ensure that its planning approach to environmental issues is 
truly integrated. Such an approach is central to a sustainably planned 
Northumberland, contributing to the County’s economic success and the wellbeing of 
its communities. Policy ENV 1 sets out such an approach, covering everything about 
the Northumberland landscape, its natural and its built heritage. Subsequent policies 
set more specific criteria for biodiversity (Policy ENV 2); the landscape, tranquillity 
and designated areas (Policies ENV 3 to 6); and built heritage (Policies ENV 7 to 9).  
 
 
 
Policy  ENV 1 
Approaches  to assessing  the impact  of development  on the natural,  histori c and 
built  environment  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. The character and/or significance of Northumberland's distinctive and valued 
natural, historic and built environments, will be conserved, protected and 
enhanced by:  
 
a. Giving appropriate weight to the statutory purposes and special qualities of the 
hierarchy of international, na tional and local designated and non -designated 
nature and historic conservation assets or sites and their settings, and, in 
particular, giving great weight to:  
 
i. Conserving and enhancing the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 
accordance with Policies E NV 5 and ENV 6, and Northumberland 
National Park ; 
ii. The conservation of designated heritage assets, with the impact of 
proposed development on their significance being assessed in 
accordance with Policy ENV 7.  
 
b. Protecting Northumberland's most important landscapes and applying a 
character -based approach to , as appropriate, manage, protect or plan 
landscape across the whole County.  
 
2. In applying part (a) above, recognising that:  
 
a. Assets or sites with a lower designation or non -designated, can still be 
irreplaceable, may be nationally important and/or have qua litative attributes 
that warrant giving these the appropriate protection in -situ; 
 
b. Development and associated activity outwith designations can have indirect 
impacts on the designated assets or sites;  
 
3. An ecosystem approach will be taken that demonstrates an understanding of the 
significance and sensitivity of the natural resource. This should result in a neutral 
impact on, or net benefit for those ecosystems and the ecosystem services that 
they provide.  10. Environment   
192  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Biodiversity  and geodiversity  
 
10.10  The NPPF recognises that moving from a net loss of biodiversity to achieving net 
gains is central to sustainable development and that contributing to conserving and 
enhancing the natural environment is a  core planning principle.  
 
Impacts  on internationally  protected  sites  
 
10.11  Internationally protected sites (SPAs, SACs and Ramsar Sites) are strictly protected, 
and the NPPF states that the presumption in favour of sustainable development does 
not apply to dev elopments that may affect such sites. Where such sites could be 
affected by development, the impact of this must be assessed in accordance with the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017. Nationally important sites 
are also strictly protecte d, with the NPPF advising that developments that are likely to 
affect SSSIs should normally be refused.  
 
10.12  Adverse impacts on these key sites can be indirect as well as direct. For example 
increased foul water discharges to rivers and coastal streams can lea d to adverse 
impacts on coastal SACs and SPAs caused by elevated nutrient levels. Coastal sites, 
designated for their important bird communities, can also be adversely affected by 
increased levels of recreational disturbance from the additional population arising 
from new development.  
 
10.13  Increased recreation -related disturbance on the coast is a particular concern because 
the whole of the Northumberland coast, except for a few hundred metres at 
Lynemouth, is designated as SSSI because of its nationally important bird 
populations; and much of it is also designated as SPA and 'Ramsar Site' because of 
the international importance of some of these populations. In order to ensure that 
effective migration can be provided to address this problem, the Council is 
introducing the Northumberland Coast al Mitigation Service. This is a developer -
funded wardening service that will provide a presence within the designated sites to 
educate and advise recreational users such as dog walkers, joggers, horse riders 
and sea anglers as to how they can enjoy the co ast without causing excessive 
disturbance to important bird populations. Where necessary they will also develop a 
control programme for pirri -pirri bur within the SSSI and SAC dune grasslands78. 
 
10.14  Mitigation for these impacts on coastal designated sites is required for development 
that will cause a net increase in housing numbers or tourism accommodation within 
10 kilometres of the coast. This zone of influence was identified by gathering 
evidence c oncerning the point of origin of dog -walkers on the coast, and is explained 
in more detail in the Coastal Mitigation Service  Strategy Document. It is shown on the 
Local Plan Policies Map. A steering  group, comprising representatives of NCC. 
Natural England , RSPB and the Northumberland Coast AONB Partnership, is being 
established to oversee the work of the Service and to monitor its effectiveness.  
 
 
 
 
78  The pirri -pirri bur is a non -native invasive species is spread primarily by people and dogs via its very   sticky  
seed  burs,  and damages  dune  grassland  plant  communities  by displacing  native  vegetation.  10. Environment   
193 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  10.15  Currently, contributions to the Coastal Mitigation Service for major developments  vary 
for sites within  7 kilometres  of the coast  and sites 7 to 10 kilometres  from the coast, 
while minor developments contribute within 7 kilometres of the coast and  are exempt 
beyond that. These bands have been established to ensure that a  proportionate 
approach is taken, as eviden ce shows that about 75% of dog -walking visits  originate  
within  7 kilometres  and a further  15% from 7 to 10 kilometres  of the coast79. 
 
Regional  and local  biodiversity  considerations  
 
10.16  Local Wildlife and Geological Sites are non -statutory sites containing habitats or  
populations of species of at least local importance, although their importance can  be 
considerably greater. These, together with legally protected species and habitats all 
contribute  to the very important  ecological  resources  that occur outside  of sites 
receiving statutory protection and are important material considerations in the  
determination  of planning  applications.  
 
10.17  The government encourages a wide range of people to be involved in how decisions 
are made about the natural environment in their local area. Northumberland currently 
includes two Local Nature Partnerships (LNPs): the Northern Upland Chain LNP,  
including No rthumberland National Park and the North Pennines AONB; and the  
North -East England  LNP,  comprising  a wide coastal  and lowland  area in 
Northumberland, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Gateshead, South Tyneside, 
Sunderland and Durham.  
 
10.18  A key initiative  led by these LNPs  is Nature  Improvement  Areas  (NIAs).  These  are 
intended  to bring  about  measurable  improvements  in nature  conservation  over widely 
defined areas. Currently within Northumberland, these are:  
• The Northumberland Coalfield NIA , which aims to tackle the lack of  
connectivity  between  wildlife  areas  over a 41,000  hectare  area,  straddling  the 
boundaries between Northumberland, Newcastle and North Tyneside. The  area 
presents many opportunities for significant improvements to be achieved,  
especially through hab itat creation linked to existing networks of subsidence  
wetlands, wet grassland, neutral grasslands, ancient woodlands and coastal  
habitats. Because of the high human population in this area, there are valuable  
opportunities  to increase  people's  experience  of the natural  world;  and  
• The Border  Uplands  NIA, which covers an area of approximately 100,000 
hectares in west Northumberland with just over half in the  Northumberland 
National Park, straddling the two current LNP areas. It contains significant 
forestr y and includes much of the catchment of the Rivers Rede and North Tyne, 
rivers which support important species and economically important  fisheries.  
Important  features  include  species -rich grassland,  broadleaved woodland,  upland  
heath  and blanket  bog. There  are substantial  opportunities  to improve ecological 
networks through enhanced management and expansion of a number  of 
moorland  related  habitat  types.  
 
 
 
79  Further detail on the Coastal Mitigation Service can be found in the Coastal Mitigation Service Strategy 
Document. Further information on the level of developer contributions required in relation to the Coastal 
Mitigation Service can be found in Appendix H4 on developer contributions.  10. Environment   
194  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  10.19  Development proposals within the Northumberland Coalfield NIA in particular can 
contribute to the restoration and enhancement of important habitats. For example, 
there are over one hundred subsidence wetlands in south east Northumberland 
formed by the collapse of old mine workings. These are blighted in terms of their 
development pote ntial due to ground instability and are too wet to farm. However 
they provide valuable foci for habitat creation being important for a range of wetland 
wildlife. South east Northumberland also has important corridors of ancient woodland 
running along its r iver valleys but these tend to be very narrow with abrupt transition 
to developed land or intensive agriculture. Providing opportunities for expansion of 
these woodlands through natural regeneration would similarly be very valuable. 
Isolated but important fragments of species -rich neutral grassland also survive in this 
area; securing appropriate management and expanding these areas is also a priority.  
 
10.20  In order to help tackle the fragmentation and isolation of important habitats within this 
area, the Counci l has also developed the South East Northumberland Wildlife 
Network. This takes the form of a map showing existing areas of semi -natural 
vegetation; areas where semi -natural vegetation forms an important component in a 
mosaic of other land uses; and areas where there is a commitment to develop 
ecologically valuable land uses, such as on restored surface mines. The purpose of 
recording such features on a map is to show : 
• where networks of semi -natural vegetation are strong and where the functioning 
of the net work should therefore be protected;  
• where they are weaker and the functioning can be made more robust through the 
creation of new habitats adjacent to them; and  
• where areas of important habitats exist in isolation, and so need appropriate 
habitats to be created to link them into the functioning of the network.  
The planning process can play an important role in delivering all of these 
requirements, so that valuable ecological features are protected and enhanced, and 
so that people living in the most dense ly populated part of the county have better 
access to wildlife -rich areas. The network also identifies the key links into important 
wildlife corridors in Newcastle and North Tyneside, which must be safeguarded in 
order to prevent the further isolation of i mportant wildlife areas within the Tyneside 
conurbation.

Biodiversity  and geodiversity  
 
1. Development prop osals affecting biodiversity and geodiversity, including 
designated sites, protected species, and habitats and species of principal 
importance in England (also called priority habitats and species), will:  
 
a. Minimise their impact, avoiding significant harm through location and/or 
design. Where significant harm cannot be avoided, applicants will be required 
to demonstrate that a dverse impacts will be adequately mitigated or, as a last 
resort compensated for;  
 
b. Secure a net gain for biodiversity as calculated, to reflect latest Government 
policy and advice, through planning conditions or planning obligations.  
 
2. Where sites are desig nated for their biodiversity or geodiversity, planning 
decisions will reflect the hierarchical approach set out in Policy ENV 1.  
 
3. In the case of Local Wildlife and Geological Sites and Local Nature Reserves:  
 
a. If significant harm to biodiversity value cannot be avoided (through locating on 
an alternative site with less harmful impacts) adequately mitigated, or, as a last 
resort, compensated for, then planning permission will be refused.  
 
b. Geological value and soils within these sites will be protected an d enhanced in 
a manner commensurate with the identified quality.  
 
c. Where permission can be granted in accordance with (3)  (a) or (b) above, 
planning conditions or obligations will be used to protect the site’s remaining 
nature conservation or geological int erest and to provide appropriate 
compensatory measures for the harm caused.  
 
4. The Council expects the ecosystem approach to be applied in development 
through  the following measures, individually or in combination:  
 
a. The conservation, restoration , enhancement, creation and/or (where 
appropriate) the re -creation of priority habitats and the habitats of priority 
species;  
 
b. The protection and enhancement of the ecological resilience and proper 
functioning of all ecological networks and links to promote migration, dispersal 
and genetic exchange, including the South East Northumberland Wildlife 
Network, as shown on the Policies Map, including its linkages with Newcastle 
and North Tyneside; where disruption to these networks cannot be avoided, 
adequate miti gation or, as a last resort, compensatory measures that relate to 
the integrity of the network will be sought;

c. Measures that will buffer or extend existing sites of ecological value, support 
the development of the Border Uplands Nature Improvement A rea and

d. Minimising any adverse effects on habitats and species caused by the wider 
impacts of development and its associated activities including:  
 
i. Disturbance; or  
ii. The inadvertent introduction of non -native species: or  
iii. Reductions in water quality; or  
iv. Other forms of pollution that would adversely affect wildlife;  
 
The above to be achieved through precautionary measures including 
appropriat e buffer zones and developer contributions to the Coastal Mitigation 
Service within zones shown on the Policies Map;  
 
e. Maximising opportunities to incorporate biodiversity , and ecological 
enhancement for species of conservation concern, through additional b uilt-in 
or planted features; and  
 
f. Securing  the continued  management  of those  ecological  features  created,  
restored  or enhanced  as a result  of development.

appropriate,  opportunities  for public  access  to those  features  will be provided.  
 
 
 
Landscape  
 
10.21  Northumberland's landscape is rightly considered a jewel in its crown. It has huge 
variety and great drama. It contains a spectrum of character from the rugged to the 
picturesque. It derives from the interaction between nature and people. A rich 
geodiversity, modified by rivers and climate, underpins this landscape. Human 
activity, from early forest clearance and cultivation through to modern housing and 
industry, has c hanged the visible landscape almost beyond recognition from what 
would have been there in prehistoric times. Today, expansive upland moors and 
forests sweep into Cumbria and the Scottish Borders. Rolling farmland intersperses 
with country estates, parkland  and wooded valleys. The other great influence, the 
sea, meets the geology of the land in a spectacular coastline characterised by rocky 
headlands, islands and sandy bays backed with dunes.  
 
10.22  Northumberland's settlements have distinctive architecture using local building 
stones. The more densely populated, south east area occupies a landscape 
associated with deep and opencast coal mining, and industries which led to the 
expansion of fishing villages into larger coastal towns. Early mining restoration led to 
the creation of some relatively featureless agricultural land across the coastal plain 
but, through the planning process, recent projects have included more sensitive 
landscape restoration, improved public access and land art.  10. Environment   
197 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Landscape  character  
 
10.23  Landscap e protection, management and planning is promoted by the European  
Landscape Convention (ELC), which takes a holistic approach to the landscape  
recognising that "landscape can exist at any scale from parks, gardens and  
streetscape to extensive tracts of lan d". The NPPF requires that all England's  diverse  
landscapes  are valued  and well looked  after,  providing  a sense  of place  and identity 
relevant to people’s lives, and that their complex ecosystems function well.  
 
10.24  Local  Plans  are able to embrace  this holistic  approach  by considering  what  is 
important about the character of any landscape, i.e. what gives it its sense of place, 
rather than confining the consideration of landscape to defined areas.  
 
10.25  The starting point for the defining landscape character in the County is National  
Character  Area  (NCA)  profiling  carried  out by Natural  England.  Nine of the defined  
NCAs fall fully or partly in Northumberland80. The Northumberland Landscape 
Character Assessment81 sub-divided the nine NCAs into 44 local Landscape  
Character Types (LCTs) and 108 Landscape Character Areas (LCAs). Each of the 
108 LCAs has a detailed profile. In addition, each of the 44 LCTs has, defined for it, 
key qualities, forces for change and acco mpanying guidance on how to treat 
proposals which may  impact on these positively or  negatively. Each LCT has,  
assigned  to it one of three  overarching  guiding  principles,  as follows:  
• Protect - where conservation of landscape character is required in the fac e of 
pressures  for change;  or 
• Manage - where some change can be absorbed but changes arising from  social,  
economic  and environmental  processes  need  to be managed;  or 
• Plan - where  important  landscape  character  has been  eroded  and strong  action  is 
needed  to enhance  or restore  it. 
 
10.26  The LCTs and their guiding, and more  detailed  principles  provide  general  guidance  
on landscape character. Any given LCT covers a relatively large expanse of land  
within which there will be local variations. More detailed assessments of local  
landscapes exist for some areas - notably within the two AONB management plans.  
A detailed, locally focussed character assessment will need to be carried out in  
association  with proposals  for certain  types  of development.  
 
10.27  Also of significance in assessing the landscape surrounding a development is the  
Historic Landscape Characterisation, which identifies and interprets the varying  
historic character within an area, adding to the understanding of how the landscape  
as a whole  has evolved.

Landscape  
 
1. The contribution of the landscape to Northumberland's environment, economy  and 
communities will be recognised in assessing development proposals, as  follows:  
 
a. Proposals affecting the character of the landscape will be expected to  
conserve  and enhance  important  elements  of that character;  in such  cases,  
design  and access  statements  should  refer,  as appropriate,  to Northumberland 
Landscape Character Assessment and other relevant studies, guidance or 
management plans;  
 
b. Great weight will be given to the conservation and enhancement of the  special 
qualities and the statutory purposes of the Northumberland National  Park,  the 
North  Pennines  Area  of Outstanding  Natural  Beauty  and the Northumberland 
Coast Ar ea of Outstanding Natural Beauty;  
 
c. Within those parts of the North Northumberland Heritage Coast, which are not 
part of the Northumberland Coast AONB, consideration will be given to the 
special character of the area and the importance of its conservation;  
 
d. Where applicable, the contribution of the Northumberland landscape to the 
understanding and enjoyment of heritage assets will be taken into account;  
 
e. In assessing  development  proposals  in relation  to landscape  character:  
 
i. It will be considered whether sufficient regard has been had to the 
guiding principles and other relevant guidelines set out in the 
Northumberland Landscape Character Assessment;  
ii. A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) will be required 
where the development is considered likely to have a significant impact 
on the surrounding landscape, townscape or seascape character of the 
site and/or visual amenity and/or the special qualities of an AONB ;  
iii. The impact on the setting and surroundings of the County's historic tow ns 
and villages will be assessed, ensuring that new development on the 
edge of settlements does not harm the landscape character of the 
settlement edge and, where possible that it has a net positive impact;  
iv. Regard will be had , to the Historic Landscape Cha racterisation;  
v. The potential impact that small scale development can have on the 
landscape in sensitive rural settings will be assessed; and  
vi. Any net negative cumulative impacts of development on landscape 
character will be assessed.  
 
f. Where it is considered  that landscape  character  may be adversely  affected,  or 
aspects of this character that warrant protection would be degraded as  a result 
of a proposed development, the weight given to the harm caused will be in 
accordance with the importance of the designat ion, taking account of 1(b) and 
1(c) above and/or the assessed key landscape qualities.  
 10. Environment   
199 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Tranquillity  and dark  skies  
 
10.28  Northumberland was ranked first out of 87 authorities in terms of tranquillity, 
according to a Campaign to Protect Rural England study undertaken in 2006. The 
Council recognises tranquillity as a distinctive characteristic of Northumberland’s 
countryside. While the County contains the Northumberland National Park, and the 
North Pennines and Northumberland Coast AONBs, much of the County, outside of 
these designated areas is also rural, and tranquil in nature, and is characterised by 
its open countryside, sm all villages and hamlets. The Council seeks to ensure that 
the quiet enjoyment of the landscape is maintained by avoiding urbanising effects in 
these areas. This will largely be achieved through the landscape character approach 
outlined in Policy ENV 3, wh ich seeks to retain key rural qualities found in many 
landscape character areas and avoid the gradual creep of urban paraphernalia into 
remote areas. Other policies such as Policy POL 2 on pollution and Policy QOP 2 on 
good design and amenity will also hel p with the aim. However, a dedicated policy is 
needed to safeguard Northumberland’s very rural character from particular threats to 
tranquillity.  
 
10.29  A key feature of tranquillity  that can be experienced across much of the 
Northumberland, is that of dark skie s. In the open countryside, away from the larger 
settlements and the more urban areas of the County close to the Tyneside 
conurbation, starry nights can often be experienced, and are increasingly a draw for 
tourists. Seeking a reversal of the trend for inc reased night time brightness through 
decisions on development can help to maintain the quality of life in the County and 
strengthen the economy.  
 
10.30  In recognition of the significance of a particularly large expanse of dark skies,  
Northumberland National Park, along with Kielder Water and Forest Park has been 
designated as Northumberland International Dark Sky Park. At 1,481 square 
kilometres it is also Europe’s largest area of protected night sky, and the fourth  
largest in the world. Due to its pristine skies it was awarded gold tier designation by 
the International Dark Sky Association, making it officially the best place in England 
for people to go to enjoy the heavens. In order to safeguard the dark skies in the 
Park, as well as those experienc ed in the North Pennines AONB, which actively 
promotes dark sky tourism through initiatives such as 'dark sky discovery sites', and 
the Northumberland Coast AONB, development proposals which involve outside 
lighting which may impact upon the dark skies in these areas should have regard to 
the latest guidance. The use of this guidance will be encouraged elsewhere in the 
County where dark skies can be experienced.

Tranquillity,  dark  skies  and a sense  of rurality  
 
1. Development proposals located within the Northumberland Coast AONB, the 
North Pennines AONB, the Northumberland Dark Sky Park, the Northumberland 
Heritage Coast, the Frontiers of the Roman Empire - Hadrian’s Wall World 
Heritage Site or elsewhere in the open countrysid e, and those which may 
otherwise by virtue of their scale, nature or siting add to the urbanising effects, or 
reduce overall tranquillity of these areas, will be required, as appropriate, to 
reduce these impacts by:  
 
a. Minimising the level of noise, traffic and light generated as a result of the 
development during construction and thereafter;  
b. Minimising the introduction of intrusive external features, such as hard 
surfaces, car parking and urban -style boundary treatments;  
 
2. During construction and thereafter, development that would bring additional light 
sources into the Northumberland Dark Sky Park, the Northumberland Coast AONB 
and the North Pennines AONB, and areas of the open countryside where dark 
skies can be experienced, should not result in a net advers e impact on the level of 
dark skies and, where appropriate, improvements should be sought.  
 
3. Exterior lighting on developments, which has the potential to impact upon the 
Northumberland International Dark Sky Park, the North Pennines AONB, the 
Northumberlan d Coast AONB should be designed having regard to the Good 
Practice Guide for Outside Lighting in Northumberland International Dark Sky Park 
and/or the latest relevant guidance. Appropriate elements of this guidance may 
also be applied in other locations re ferred to in part (2) above, where the integrity 
of dark skies may be compromised by new development.  
 
 
 
National  landscape  designations  
 
10.31  There are three areas wholly or partly within Northumberland which are nationally 
important designated landscapes. The Northumberland National Park and the 
Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) are wholly within 
the County. The North Pennines AONB straddles the boundaries of Northumberland, 
Cumbria and Durham. The Northumberland Nat ional Park, while entirely within 
Northumberland, is a separate planning authority with its own planning policies.  
 
10.32  The strong landscape and ecosystem connections between the National Park and 
the rest of Northumberland mean that great importance must be a ttached to the 
County Council’s statutory responsibility to only allow development outside the 
boundaries of the National Park that does not impact on its special qualities and 
statutory purposes. The National Park has a management plan, as well as its own  
Local Plan, natural environment vision and landscape guidance policy documents. 
Under its statutory duties, the County Council will have full regard to the implications 
of these documents when making decisions on planning applications.  10. Environment   
201 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Areas  of Outstandin g Natural  Beauty  
 
10.33  There are two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, (AONBs) in Northumberland, the 
Northumberland Coast and North Pennines. The NPPF states that, within AONBs 
great weight should be given to conserving and enhancing landscape and natural 
beauty, as they, alongside National Parks, have the highest status of protection in 
relation to their special qualities. It is clear that planning applications for major 
developments in AONBs should be refused where they would adversely impact on 
these spec ial qualities, except in exceptional circumstances and where it can be 
demonstrated that they are in the public interest, and subject to three tests:  
• The need for the development, including in terms of any national considerations 
and the impact of permitti ng or refusing it upon the local economy;  
• The cost of, and scope for, developing elsewhere outside the AONB or meeting 
the need in some other way; and  
• Any detrimental effect on the environment, the landscape and recreational 
opportunities, and the extent t o which these could be moderated.  
 
10.34  Although there is a national definition of 'major development'  82, the Council has 
discretion, within AONBs, to vary this. Therefore, as set out in Planning Practice 
Guidance, whether a proposed development in an AONB should be treated as a 
major development will be a matter for the Planning Authority, taking into account the 
proposal in question and the local context.  In addition, for a wide range of 
development types, including quite small -scale new building proposals, it is important 
that the supporting information accompanying the application is sufficiently detailed 
to allow the likely impact on the special qualities of the AONB to be judged. In such 
cases, the Council will require the submission of detaile d plans.  
 
 
10.35  To assist in the conservation and enhancement of the AONBs, AONB partnerships 
have been formed comprising local authorities, statutory agencies, voluntary or 
community organisations and interest groups and local people. The partnerships 
prepare and keep under review a statutory AONB Management Plan for each area, 
and prepare guidance documents. The Management Plans inform the policy of 
Councils towards the AONBs within their boundaries , including defining and 
explaining the special qualities of e ach AONB.  
 
Northumberland  Coast  AONB  
 
10.36  The Northumberland Coast AONB comprises a narrow strip of coast between Spittal 
and the Coquet Estuary, and covers a distance of 64 kilometres. However, it is only 
around 4 kilometres wide at its widest point and cover s just 138 square kilometres. It 
is best known for its sweeping sandy beaches, rolling dunes, rocky headlands  and 
isolated islands, and contains numerous nationally and internationally important 
designated sites. The landscape contains scattered settlement s, imposing castles 
and extensive sea and inland views.  
 
 
82  The definition of major development used generally comprises, for housing, 10 or more homes or a  site of 
0.5 hectares  or more;  for other  development,  an additional  1,000  square  metres  of floor spac e or 1 hectare  
or more . 10. Environment   
202  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  10.37  The area has a population of around 12,500; it contains a string of living, working 
communities, including North Sunderland / Seahouses, Longhoughton, Lesbury/ 
Alnmouth, Bamburgh, Beadnell, Embleton,  Craster and Warkworth, as well as 
several smaller villages and hamlets. Traditional agriculture and fishing often sits 
alongside more recent employment types, many of which are connected with tourism. 
Communities and businesses within the area have links with Berwick -upon -Tweed, 
Amble, Alnwick, Belford, as well as places further afield.  
 
10.38  Visitor numbers, in particular, place considerable pressure on the key components of 
the AONB's special qualities. Without a careful, sustainable management approach, 
conflict could easily result, so threatening the unique environment and possibly the 
functioning of the local coastal economy and communities.  
 
10.39  An important local issue within the AONB is the proliferation of second and holiday 
homes, which while providing som e economic benefits, also contribute to settlements 
along the coast losing their sense of community, as a large number of properties 
become unoccupied and services do not operate at certain times of the year.  
Recognising this issue, the North Northumberlan d Coast Neighbourhood Plan 
restricts the use of new market housing to ensure that each new dwelling is occupied 
only as a principal residence.  
 
 
 
Policy  ENV 5 
 
Northumberland  Coast  Area  of Outstanding  Natural  Beauty  
 
1. The special qualities of the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty will be conserved and enhanced, having regard to the current AONB 
Management Plan and locally specific design guidance.  
 
2. When assessing development proposals affecting the AONB particular 
consideratio ns will include:  
 
a. The sensitivity  of local landscapes  and their capacity  to accommodate  new 
development, including temporary structures such as caravans and chalets;  
 
b. Intervisibility  between  the AONB,  the seascape  and the landscape  beyond,  
including  the Kyloe  and Cheviot  Hills;  
 
c. Interdependency between the special qualities of the landscape and the  
marine and coastal environment, including the internationally and nationally 
important nature conservation sites and associated ecosystems, geolo gy, 
species  and habitats;  and 
 
  10. Environment   
203 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
d. The need  to sustain  and, where  appropriate,  enhance:  
 
i. The significance of heritage assets, including any contribution made   by 
their setting;  
ii. A sense  of remoteness,  wildness  and open  views  and dark skies;  
iii. The natural  functioning  of the coastline;  and 
iv. A clear  distinction  between  settlements  and open  countryside.  
 
3. As far as possible,  it will be recognised  that the AONB  is a living,  working  area by 
allowing small scale development where it does not impact on the AONB's  special 
qualities including those in criteria (2) a. to d. above. In particular, in  assessing 
development proposals, consideration will be given to the extent to  which  the 
development:  
 
a. Adds  to the availability  of permanently  occupied  and afford able housing  to 
meet  local need s; 
 
b. Supports the growth and diversification of the rural economy through the 
expansion of existing businesses and the development of new  businesses; 
and 
 
c. Supports the tourism aims set out in part 1 of Policy ECN 15, within th e 
constraints set out in part 2 of that Policy.  
 
4. The conversion of redundant farm buildings to appropriate uses will be supported, 
but the scale and form of the farm steading will be protected and new built 
development will not normally be supported.  
 
5. In accordance with national planning policy, major development will not be 
supported except in exceptional circumstances and where it can be demonstrated 
to be in the public interest;  
 
6. Where new building or engineering works are proposed, the Council will req uire 
the submission of detailed plans and will not grant outline planning permission, 
unless they contain sufficient supporting information by which the impact of the 
proposed development on the special qualities of the AONB can be judged.  
 
 
 
North  Pennines  AONB  
 
10.40  The North Pennines AONB covers an area of 1,983 square kilometres. 
Approximately a third of the AONB is within the County, the remainder in the counties 
of Durham and Cumbria, and North Yorkshire. The North Pennines landscape has a 
highly di stinctive character which has been shaped by early settlers who cleared the 
forests, followed by generations of farming, a long history of mining for lead and other 
minerals, quarrying, moorland management and more recent development. Part of its 
unique qu ality reflects the retention of a sense of wildness, remoteness and 
tranquillity. The significance of the geology of the AONB, reflected, in part, in its 
UNESCO Global Geopark status, is another key element of the landscape character.  10. Environment   
204  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  10.41  The area has an open character, including significant areas of open moorland, which 
in the context of the rest of England can be considered relatively remote, tranquil and 
free from large scale visual intrusion. This sense of wildness and  remoteness gives 
the area much of its character. The settlements are found in the valleys of the 
Derwent, the East and West Allen and the South Tyne, with only  isolated hamlets 
and scattered farmsteads elsewhere. The landscape is the result partly of the 
underlying geology but also of the inte raction between people and nature over 
thousands of years – deforestation, hill farming and a long history of mining for lead 
and other minerals which brought enclosure of the land as well as creating a legacy 
of buildings, structures and landscape feature s such as hushes. Other special 
qualities of the area include truly dark night skies, species rich hay meadows, and 
internationally important birdlife.  
 
10.42  There is a not a high level of development pressure within the Northumberland part of 
the North Pennine s AONB. Indeed the population of the Allen Valleys was much 
higher in the past than it is now. It is important however to seek to sustain the local 
population, while recognising that even a single development which is out of scale or 
character with the are a, including those beyond the AONB boundary, can have a 
widespread impact due to the open character of much of the AONB.  
 
10.43  The visitor economy is key to sustaining the AONB area. Accessing moorland areas 
is clearly an integral part of such visits with activ ities ranging from traditional grouse 
shooting to many new walking, riding and cycling opportunities. Clearly, the proper 
management of impacts of these activities on the landscape and wildlife is vital, 
avoiding heavy concentrations of these activities ca n lead to structures such as stone 
roads being put in place in remote locations and, without careful planning, these 
could damage the special landscape qualities of the AONB.  
 
 
 
Policy  ENV 6 
 
North  Pennines  Area  of Outstanding  Natural  Beauty  
 
1. The special qualities of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
will be conserved and enhanced, having regard to the current AONB Management 
Plan and locally specific guidance.  
 
2. When assessing development proposals affecting the AONB particu lar 
considerations will include:  
 
a. The openness  of the landscape  and its sensitivity  to development;  
b. Inter-visibility  between  the AONB  and areas  to its north  and east;  
c. Interdependency between the landscape quality and the natural functioning of 
the environment taking into account internationally and nationally important 
nature conservation sites and associated species and habitats, and the 
geodiversity;  
d. The need to sustain and enhance the significance of heritage assets, including 
any contribution ma de by their setting; and  
e. A sense of remoteness, wildness, tranquillity and dark skies.  10. Environment   
205 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
3. Small scale development will be supported where it does not impact on the 
AONB's special qualities, including those in criteria 2 a to e above. In particular, in 
assessing development proposals, consideration will be given to the extent to 
which the development:  
 
a. Adds to the availability of permanently occupied and affordable housing to 
meet local needs;  
b. Supports the growth and diversification of the rural economy through the 
expansion of existing businesses and the development of new businesses;  
c. Supports the tourism aims set out in part 1 of Policy ECN 15, within the 
constraints set out in part 2 of that Policy;  
d. Reuses redundant buildings that contribute to  the character of the area; and  
e. Applies the most up to date design guidance, recognising that a variety of 
materials, including timber, have their place in the local vernacular and could 
contribute to lower cost, more energy efficient buildings.  
 
4. In accord ance with national planning policy, major development will not be 
supported except in exceptional circumstances and where it can be demonstrated 
to be in the public interest;  
 
5. Where new building or engineering works are proposed, the Council will require 
the submission of detailed plans and will not grant outline planning permission, 
unless they contain sufficient supporting information by which the impact of the 
proposed development on the special qualities of the AONB can be judged.  
 
6. Development proposal s should avoid any urbanising effects on the qualities of 
remoteness and tranquillity that characterise the North Pennines AONB, by 
avoiding bright lighting or noise -generating uses, unless there are other strong 
planning reasons to do so and it can be dem onstrated that all possible measures 
have been taken to minimise these effects.  
 
7. Stone tracks across moorland, for non -agricultural purposes, will not be approved 
on deep peat areas that are or have the potential to be blanket bog. New or 
upgraded tracks e lsewhere involving moorland may be supported if:  
 
a. it will result in net biodiversity or landscape gain; and  
b. there is no alternative existing track or potential route that is less harmful or 
visually intrusive; and  
c. the least environmentally damaging construction methods are used; and  
d. maximum potential recreational benefits are accrued.  10. Environment   
206  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Historic  and built  environment  
 
10.44  The NPPF looks to Local Plans to set out a positive strategy for the conservation and 
enjoyment of the historic environment, including sustaining and enhancing the 
significance of heritage assets, while also looking more widely at the social, cultural, 
economic and environmental benefits that conservation of the historic environment 
can bring, taking full a ccount of local character and distinctiveness.  
 
10.45  Northumberland's historic environment has been shaped by a combination of factors, 
which include the economic value of its agriculture, fishing, minerals and other 
natural resources; its position as a nationa l and maritime frontier; its importance for 
north -south communication between England and Scotland; and its remoteness.  
 
10.46  Northumberland's historic legacy is the setting for people's lives; it is where they live, 
work, shop and enjoy leisure and recreation activities. It is also an important draw for 
tourists. Many of the County's heritage assets are iconic symbols of Northumberland. 
They have intrinsically shaped and defined the historic character of North East 
England.  
 
10.47  Northumberland's physical and cultur al heritage is manifest in well -preserved historic 
towns, buildings, archaeological sites, battlefields, designed and historic landscapes, 
many of international importance. Designated assets include the Frontiers of the 
Roman Empire: Hadrian's Wall World H eritage Site, Registered Parks and Gardens, 
Registered Battlefields, Scheduled Monuments, Conservation Areas and Listed 
Buildings. All recorded heritage assets are included on the Historic Environment 
Record, which is supplemented by a range of local studi es and resources, including 
those locally important non -designated heritage assets. Some locally important 
assets have been identified through local lists. The County is also rich in 
undesignated archaeological sites. It is not always possible to understan d the 
significance of heritage assets, particularly archaeological sites, without furth er 
investigation. Where potential heritage assets have not been included on a local list, 
they will be assessed according to the criteria set out for local listing in Hi storic 
England's Guidance Note 'Local Heritage Listing: Historic England Advice Note 7’, or 
subsequent national guidance.  
 
10.48  In order to assess the significance of a non -designated asset, in the vast majority of 
cases, information will be readily available via the Historic Environment Record (the 
HER). This will allow a judgement to be made of the effect of the development on that 
significance. Where further information is required to assess the extent or 
significance of an asset, or the impact of a proposal on it, this will be required through 
further assessment, as set out in parts 2 and 3 of Policy ENV 7. Occasionally, a new, 
undesignated asset - usually archaeological - will be found in the course of 
investigating a site or preparing it for deve lopment. In these cases, a new 
assessment of significance will be needed and, in some cases, may be assigned a 
significance equivalent to that of a scheduled monument. However, this would only 
occur on the relatively rare occasions where the discovery is e ntirely new or when a 
known site is evaluated and is then found to have that level of significance.  
 
 10. Environment   
207 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  10.49  Currently there are over 150 items, which are drawn from Grade I and II* Listed 
Buildings, Historic Parks and Gardens and structural Scheduled Monuments, on 
Historic England’s current Heritage at Risk Register in Northumberland. Historic 
England assesses whether assets should be included on the basis of condition and, 
where applicable, occupancy (or use). They are removed from the Register when 
they have be en brought into a stable condition, their future secured, and where 
appropriate, occupied or in use. There is no comprehensive information on Grade II 
Listed Buildings or Structures at risk. However, given the much greater numbers of 
buildings and structur es falling within this category, it follows that there will be 
substantially greater numbers of them 'at risk'.  
 
 
 
Policy  ENV 7 
 
Historic  environment  and heritage  assets  
 
1. Development proposals will be assessed and decisions made that ensure the  
conservation  and enhancement  of the significance,  quality  and integrity  of 
Northumberland’s heritage assets and their settings.  
 
2. Decisions affecting a heritage asset will be based on a sound understanding of the 
significance of that asset and the impact of any proposal upon that significance.  
Applicants will be required to provide a heritage statement; describing the 
significance of the asset and any contribution made to this significance by its 
setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the asset’s importance, but 
should make use of the Historic Environment Record, the Historic Landscape 
Characterisation Study, any relevant character appraisals or design guides, and/or 
other relevant records.  
 
3. Development proposals, which will affect a  site of archaeological interest, or a site 
which has the potential to be of archaeological interest, will require an appropriate 
desk -based assessment and, where necessary, a field evaluation.  
 
4. Development proposals that would result in substantial harm t o or total loss of the 
significance of designated heritage assets will not be supported unless it can be 
demonstrated that the substantial harm or total loss is necessary to achieve 
substantial public benefits that would outweigh that harm or loss, or all of the 
following apply:  
 
a. The nature of the heritage asset would prevent all reasonable uses of the site; 
and 
b. No viable use of the asset itself could be found in the medium term through 
appropriate marketing that would enable its conservation; and  
c. Conservat ion by grant -funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or 
public ownership would demonstrably not be possible; and  
d. The harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into 
use. 
 
 
 10. Environment   
208  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
5. Where development proposals would cause less than substantial harm to the 
significance of designated heritage asset, this will be weighed against the public 
benefits of the proposal, including securing the optimum use that is viable and 
justifiable.  
 
6. Development proposals that affect the s ignificance of non -designated heritage 
assets shall require a balanced judgement, taking into account the scale of any 
harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset. In the case of a non -
designated heritage asset of archaeological interest, the s ignificance of which is 
demonstrably equivalent to that of a scheduled monument, the policy approach for 
designated heritage assets will be applied if it:  
 
a. Has not formally been assessed for designation; or  
b. Has been assessed as capable of designation, but not designated by the 
relevant Government agency; or  
c. Is not capable of designation under the Ancient Monuments and 
Archaeological Areas Act because of its physical nature.  
 
7. If, following the above assessment, a decision is made that will result in the loss  of 
all or any part of a heritage asset, or a reduction it its significance, developers will 
be required to record and advance understanding of the significance of the asset 
(wholly or in part) in a manner proportionate to its importance and the impact, 
through appropriate compensatory measures. The results of such measures 
should be made publicly accessible through appropriate archiving and publication. 
The ability to create full records in this way should not, in itself, be a factor in 
deciding whether su ch loss should be supported.  
 
8. Development proposals that affect heritage assets at risk (national or local) should 
demonstrate how they will be brought into repair, or appropriately conserved, and 
the decline halted (and preferably reversed) in a timely manner. Where the asset 
at risk is a vacant building of permanent and substantial construction (i.e. not a 
ruin that should remain so), the proposal should secure its reuse in a manner 
consistent with its conservation.   
 
9. Decisions affecting historic places and sites should take account o f the individual 
and cumulative effect on the wider historic environment including from small scale 
changes which may gradually erode the historic character and/or the settings of 
key assets, the visitor economy, the vitality of the area and the quality of  place.  
 
10. In cases where development is proposed that will conflict with planning policies, 
but which would act as enabling development to secure the future conservation of 
a heritage asset, consideration will be given to whether the  benefits outweigh the 
disbenefits of departing from the policies concerned.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Frontiers  of the Roman  Empire:  Hadrian's  Wall World  Heritage  Site 
 
10.50  World Heritage Sites are places of 'Outstanding Universal Value' (OUV), recognised 
as such under the terms of the 1972 World Heritage Convention. The trans -national 
Frontiers of the Roman Empire - Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site (WHS) was  
inscribed on the List of World Heritage by UNESCO in 1987. The section of the WHS 
that falls within Northumberland, the National Park, and indeed England, is only part 
of the far larger trans -national WHS.  
 
10.51  The NPPF regards World Heritage Sites as being of the highest significance and that 
substantial harm or loss to that significance should be wholly exceptional.  
 
10.52  Hadrian's Wall, with a total length of 118 kilometres, was built around the year 122 
AD on the orders of the Emperor Hadrian, at the northernmost limits of the Roman 
province of Britannia. It constituted the main element in a controlled military zone 
across northern Britain. The  Wall was supplemented by the ditch and banks,  
including the Vallum to the south of the Wall, supporting forts, camps and other 
features in a wide area to the north and south, linked by an extensive road network  
 
10.53  While a WHS is an international designation , it is the responsibility of national 
governments to ensure that the Outstanding Universal Value is maintained. However 
the designation itself brings no additional statutory controls over and above those 
afforded through the planning system and through ot her designations that cover 
elements of the WHS. Much of the length of the Wall and its associated forts and 
surrounding settlements are however scheduled monuments, and protected as such. 
The planning controls that apply to these assets are an important p art of the 
recognition and protection of the OUV of the World Heritage Site. There are 
remaining elements, however (often the less obvious surface features) which, while 
being part of the Roman frontier, are not scheduled or part of the WHS.  They rely for 
their protection on the application of criteria -based policies and a precautionary 
approach applied  across the WHS  itself and its setting. A Management Plan83 
informs such decisions, as well as the day to day management of the whole extent of 
the Frontier and its setting.  
 
10.54  The key objective within the Hadrian’s Wall Management Plan, is to secure the 
identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future  
generations of the Outstanding Universal Value of the WHS. The OUV is described in 
an agreed statement and covers matters such as the historic (Roman archaeological) 
significance and the group value of features within the WHS. The Management Plan 
also covers the educational and recreational benefits associated with the Wall and its 
associated assets.  
 
10.55  In order to protect and conserve the OUV of the WHS, heritage impact assessments 
of the effect on the OUV of development proposals, within or adjacent to the site and 
its wider setting, may be required. These should follow ICOMO S Guidance on  
Heritage Impact Assessments for Cultural World Heritage Properties84, and advice 
should be sought from expert bodies, as necessary.

Policy  ENV 8 
 
Frontiers  of the Roman  Empire  - Hadrian's  Wall World  Heritage  Site 
 
1. The Council supports measures to protect and enhance Hadrian's Wall in  
accordance with the Scheduled  Monument  designation  of much  of its length  and 
associated  assets.  Development  that would  result  in substantial  harm  or loss of 
the significance of the WHS or assets wi thin it will not be supported unless the  
exceptional  circumstances  set out in Policy  ENV 7 apply.  
 
2. Development proposals throughout the extent of the Frontiers of the Roman  
Empire: Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site (WHS ), its setting , or defined Buffer 
Zone, should, where possible, seek op portunities  to sustain  and better  reveal  the 
significance  of its Outstanding Universal Value as set out in the adopted Statement 
of OUV and informed by World Heritage Site Management Plan, including s eeking 
to protect and, where appropriate, enhance:  
 
a. Evidence of the scale and complexity of the Wall and its associated frontier 
features;   
b. The group value of features, including features beyond the World Heritage 
Site;  
c. The setting; and  
d. Communal values in cluding educational and recreational.  
 
 
 
Conservation  Areas  
 
10.56  Conservation areas are ‘areas of special architectural or historic interest, the 
character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance’ (Planning 
(Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, s.72. They are designated by 
the local planning authority using local criteria. Under s.69 of the same Act, the  
Council must, from time to time, review which parts of the County are worthy of 
conservation designation.  
 
10.57  Conserv ation area designation remains the principal means by which local authorities 
can apply conservation policies to a particular area. The Council has a duty, in 
exercising its planning powers, to pay special attention to the desirability of 
preserving or enh ancing the character and appearance of conservation areas. In 
considering these factors, the main sources of information will be conservation area 
character appraisals and any design guidance relevant to the conservation of the 
local historic environment. The Council also has a duty, from time to time, to draw up 
and publish proposals for the preservation and enhancement of conservation areas, 
and consult local people on them.  
 
10.58  Given that conservation areas are located predominantly in towns and villages, t heir 
well-being can be significantly harmed if the condition of their building stock 
deteriorates. The management of development in conservation areas, and affecting 
their settings, acts as a means of protecting and enhancing the intrinsic qualities of 
Northumberland’s towns and villages.  10. Environment

1. Within a conservation area, or where its setting may be affected:  
 
a. It will be ensured that development enhances and reinforces the local 
distinctiveness of the conservation area, while, wherever possible, better 
revealing its significance ; 
 
b. Development that would lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of 
significance of) any aspect of a Conservation Area that contributes to the 
reasons that it was so designated, will not be sup ported unless the exceptional 
circumstances set out in Policy ENV 7(4) apply; if the harm is less than 
substantial, this will be weighed against any public benefit that the same 
development may make to part 1(a) above, applying Policy ENV 7 (5);  
 
c. Developme nt must respect existing architectural and historic character and 
cultural associations, by having regard to:  
 
i. Historic plot boundaries, layouts, densities and patterns of development; 
and 
ii. The design, positioning, grouping, form, massing, scale, features, detailing 
and the use of materials in existing buildings and structures; and  
iii. The contribution made by the public realm, private spaces and other open 
areas, including hard and soft landscape features, trees, hedges, walls, 
fences, watercourses and surfacin g. 
 
2. Development on public and private open spaces that are integral to the special 
character of a conservation area or form part of its setting, will be assessed in 
accordance with part 1b of this policy. Such spaces include those which:  
 
a. Contribute to the area's special historic interest;  
b. Are important spatially and visually to the landscape or townscape qualities of 
the conservation area;  
c. Provide views or vistas into, out of or within the conservation area.  
 
3. Development involving the demo lition of buildings or structures in a conservation 
area will be granted consent if they do not make a positive contribution to the 
conservation area's special interest. Where they do make such a contribution:  
 
a. It must be demonstrated that the structural c ondition of the building or 
structure is beyond reasonable economic repair; and  
b. There should be approved detailed plans for the redevelopment of the site and 
a contract should have been entered into for the implementation of that 
redevelopment.  
 
4. In orde r to determine the effect of proposed building and engineering works in 
Conservation Areas, the Council will require the submission of detailed plans and 
will not grant outline planning permission, unless they contain sufficient supporting 
information by w hich the impact of the proposed development on the character 
and appearance of the Conservation Area can be judged.  10. Environment

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Supporting  the conservation  of heritage  assets  
 
10.59  In order to support the positive strategy for the historic environment, when assessing 
development proposals, the Council will pro -actively conserve and enhance heritage 
assets throughout the County. Assets that are characteristic of (or even unique to) 
Northumberland, in the context of its history, cultural development or landscap e, will 
not necessarily be limited to those that are nationally Listed or formally designated, 
but may be identified locally.  
 
10.60  A key priority will be the removal from Historic England's at Risk Register  of any 
Grade I, Grade II* buildings and structures or  Scheduled Monuments identified 
therein, while avoiding assets falling into the risk category.  
 
 
 
Supporting  the conservation  of heritage  assets  commitments  
 
This will be achieved  through  a Council  commitment  to work  with partners,  including  
the owners  of assets,  Historic  England  and communities  and could  also help secure  
external funding. Such partnership working could also help identify other heritage  
assets vulnerable to becoming at risk including those that are nationally listed at  Grade  
II or locally  identified  assets.  
 
The Council will also work with developers if their proposals will impact on the  
significance of heritage assets, not only to avoid and mitigate any negative impact,  but 
also to ensure that the development sympathetically integ rates with, and responds 
positively to, established character, where possible reinforcing local distinctiveness  
through  the quality  of its design  and the use of materials.  
 
In addition to the above, the Council will, as appropriate, work in partnership wit h 
Historic  England,  other  stakeholders  and communities  to direct  resources  towards:  
 
a. Preparing, updating and acting on Conservation Character Appraisals and  
Conservation  Area  Management  Plans;  
b. Designating  additional  Conversation  Areas,  where  justified;  
c. Protecting areas within Conservation Areas, if evidence shows that permitted  
development  rights  are causing  cumulative  harm,  through  Article  4 Directions;  
d. Assisting local groups in compiling local lists of heritage assets of local  
significance;  
e. Preparing  or supporting  master  plans  or design  briefs  covering  areas  of major 
change  that will affect  heritage  assets;  
f. Promoting  and supporting  bids for external  funding  to conserve  and enhance  the 
historic  fabric  of towns  or villages.  11. Water  Environment

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  11. Water  Environment  
 
Introduction  
 
11.1 Water systems have shaped the topography, landscape and ecology of 
Northumberland. The same systems supply water to the County’s homes and 
business and the same systems need to be able to cope with outflows of waste water 
from these homes and businesses.  
 
11.2 The natural  water  environment,  comprises  the water  table,  springs,  river systems,  
inland water bodies and the sea. All subject to pressures from human activity and  
associated development. This includes demands on water supply and drainage,  
modifications  to watercourses,  the effects  of pollution  on water  quality  and water -
based ecosystems, flood risk, erosion and the results of climate change.  
 
11.3 Therefore,  as with all aspects  of the environment,  sustainable  planning  and design  
must always consider the demands and effects of development on the water  
environment.  The water  environment  policies  reflect  the increasing  attention  given  to 
ensuring:  
• The protection  of water  supply  and quality;  
• The protection  and where  appropriate  the restoration  of the natural  form and 
function  of the river environment;  and 
• That there  is maximum  resistance  and resilience  to flood  risk. 
 
11.4 The policies  on the water  environment  will deliver  a number  of the plan’s  strategic  
objectives, particularly those that seek to protect the environment, mitigate the  effects 
of climate change, and prudently manage the natural resources. Good water quality, 
water supply and sewerage facilities are vital to maintaining and creating  sustaina ble 
communities.  
 
11.5 The Council  has worked  closely  with all relevant  agencies  and water  authorities  to 
achieve  agreement  on the policies  below.  They  also seek  to take on board  the wider 
concerns of residents and businesses regarding flooding in particular.  
 
Water  quality  
 
11.6 Northumberland  has some  of the only few 'high status'  surface  water  bodies  in 
England85. They support protected species like the Freshwater Pearl Mussel that rely 
on the exceptional water quality to exist at all. The Council and relevant statutory 
bodies would resist any proposed development affecting the high status of these 
water bodies. This Local Plan sets out policies which will: protect the water 
environment from pollution; maintain quality; and improve water resources, syst ems,  
natural processes and environments, which do not currently meet European and 
national standards. The impacts of new development need to be managed to avoid 
compromising the quality of river and coastal systems, thereby protecting 
 
85  Water  bodies  include  ground  waters,  as well as all surface  water  bodies,  including  lakes,  streams , rivers,  
ponds,  wetlands  and artificial  features  such  as reservoirs.  The precise  definition  of what constitutes  a water  
body  revolves  around  its hydrological  function  within  the water  environment. Advice on  this will be sought  
from the Environment  Agency  where  necessary . 11. Water  Environment   
214  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  communities from the risk and effects of water pollution and environmental 
deterioration.  
 
11.7 The European Water Framework Directive 2000 seeks to ensure that all water bodies 
achieve ‘good status’. In line with this, the Environment Agency is aiming to achieve 
good status in at least 60% of waters by 2021 and in as many waters as possible by 
2027. The Directive also established the requirement for river basin  management 
plans86. It seeks a common, consistent approach to the management of the water 
environment. Under the Directive each country has to:  
• Prevent deterioration  in the status of  aquatic  ecosystems,  protect them  and 
improve the ecological condition of waters;  
• Aim to achi eve at least good status for all water bodies by set deadlines;  
• Meet the requirements of Water Framework Directive Protected Areas;  
• Promote sustainable use of water as a natural resource;  
• Conserve habitats and species that depend directly on water;  
• Progr essively reduce or phase out the release of individual pollutants or groups of 
pollutants that present a significant threat to the aquatic environment;  
• Progressively reduce the pollution of groundwater and prevent or limit the entry of 
pollutants; and  
• Contribute to mitigating the effects of floods and droughts.  
 
11.8 The Council has a major contributory role in relation to the above national aims, 
through the policies in this Plan and its decisions on individual development 
proposals. The complexity of the wate r environment in the County means that 
assessing existing issues, measuring progress towards eliminating them or achieving 
enhancements, and gauging how the wider ecosystem may be affected, can be 
difficult:  
• All areas of water that are above ground are req uired to have "good ecological 
status" and "good chemical status". Given the huge variations in water bodies, 
measuring these is complex, reflecting differing 'hydromorphology' – how the 
bodies of water move and flow in the context of the rocks, sediments etc. that are 
present. There will be areas where higher standards can and must be set, than 
others. This would be the case, for example, where drinking water comes straight 
from the water body or where there is a risk that sensitive areas will be flooded.  
• In the  case of groundwater,  the presumption  is that it should  not be polluted at all. 
This means that the EU imposes a prohibition on direct discharges to groundwater, 
and (to cover indirect discharges) a requirement to monitor groundwater bodies for 
chang es in chemical composition.  
• The directive also sees the extraction of water as reducing the quality if it reaches 
the point where reduction adversely affects ecosystems.  
 
11.9 By 2012, just under half of the inland water bodies in Northumberland were achieving 
‘good’ status. Where meeting the (originally set) 2015 target has not been possible 
under Cycle 1 of the Directive, it does allow, subject to certain criteria, the revised 
(Cycle 2) target date of 2021 to be used or at the very latest 2027. River  Basin  
 
86  River  Basin  Management  Plans  are produced  by the Environment Agency  and the Scottish  Environment 
Protection  Agency.  Northumberland  is covered  by the Northumbria  River  Basin  Management  Plan and the  
Solway  Tweed  River  Basin  Management  Plan.  11. Water  Environment   
215 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Management Plans action plans have been assisting in bringing the remaining water 
bodies up to standard and seeking to achieve this by the 2021 target.  
 
11.10  This Local Plan recognises agriculture as a major contributor to the Northumberland 
economy. It covers extensive areas of the County and straddles innumerable water 
bodies. Inevitably, therefore, agriculture is one of the main sources of water pollution, 
reflecting its infrastructure and practices. For this reason, when agricultural 
development requi res planning permission, every effort will be made to ensure that 
the development does not result in a deterioration in the quality of water in affected 
rivers, streams, ponds or underground water sources. Where possible improvements 
will be sought.  
 
11.11  Relat ed to the overall issue of water quality is the quality of bathing waters – i.e. 
beaches, lakes or ponds that are used by a large number of bathers. A separate EU 
Directive on Bathing Water requires Members States to monitor and assess the 
bathing water an d inform the public about bathing water quality. In  Northumberland, 
there are 12 designated Bathing Waters, where standards, set out in the revised 
Bathing Water Directive, must be achieved by the end of the decade. Planning 
decisions must therefore make s ure that the network of sewerage facilities and 
pumping stations associated with new development have sufficient capacity and will 
not exacerbate any outflows (whether from normal conditions or storm event) 
affecting these Bathing Waters. Sustainable Drain age Systems (SuDS) can help with 
this and also contribute to enhancements of Bathing Waters.  
 
11.12  Water quality is not just about water for drinking or bathing, it is about maintaining 
water bodies as valuable habitats. The effective management of the water 
environment is therefore integral to the ecosystem approach advocated across  
Northumberland’s natural environment and, by implication, to the provision and 
maintenance of strategic and local green infrastructure.  
 
11.13  Within Northumberland, it is recognised that  abandoned coal mining has resulted in 
poor quality water (minewater) which could potentially impact on ground and surface 
waters. Within the minerals section of the Local Plan Policy MIN 1 deals with ground 
and surface water quality, flow and water abstra ction issues, requiring applicants to 
consider the potential for the proposal to affect the flow, quality and quantity of 
ground and surface water supplies and include measures to prevent water pollution.  
 
11.14  The challenge for the policies within the Local Pl an and development management 
process is to maintain current water quality, in all its aspects, and improve areas that 
are not currently meeting required European and national standards. It is vital that 
discharges from new developments do not compromise t he quality of river and 
coastal waters, nor should development be put at risk from water pollution. Other 
policies within the plan will also contribute to this aim – not least Policy WAT 3, which 
seeks to minimise surface water run -off and the risk of sewe r flooding.  
 
11.15  It is also important to recognise that, under the Water Framework Directive, any 
development schemes where impact on a water environment is a possibility must 
result in improvements.

Water  quality  
 
1. In assessing  development  proposals,  the Council  will seek  to ensure  that all water 
bodies achieve 'good status' by 2021 in terms of their ecological balance and other 
relevant factors, preventing any deterioration in that status. This will be achieved in 
line with the Water Framework Directive and/or the Bathing Water Directive, 
having regard to local river basin management plans and the findings of the 
Northumberland Water Cycle Study, applying the ecosystem approach, through:  
 
a. Supporting  development  and/or  landscape  measures  that maintain,  or may 
result  in enhanced  water  quality,  including  bathing  water;  
 
b. Ensuring where possible that development will bring about an improvement to 
the water environment ; 
 
c. Not supporting development if it would have an adverse impact on water  
quality in surface water bodies or it could disrupt the ground water movement 
or affect its chemical balance, including any wider impacts, taking full  account,  
where  appropriate,  of the presence  of minewater;  
 
d. Avoiding any reduction in the ‘high status’ of certain surface water bodies  in 
the County, giving very close  scrutiny  to any development  that may affect  
them;  and 
 
e. Assessing  the effects  of development  on designated  Bathing  Waters.

217 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Water  supply  and sewerage  
 
11.16  In accordance with national planning policy, there is a need to ensure that the 
expected level and distribution of proposed development is deliverable and will not 
result in water supply and sewerage infrastructure issues that cannot be resolved.  
 
11.17  In terms of water supply , Northumberland is identified as an area of predominantly  
'low water stress'  87 and most of the river catchments in Northumberland are 
classified as having 'water available'. There are exceptions to this, mentioned below.  
 
11.18  The supply of water in Northumberland is split into two 'water resource zones' 
(WRZs), shown in Figure 11.1:  
• The Kielder WRZ  serves the vast majority of Northumberland. Most development 
coming forward in this zone would be capable of being supplied without problem, 
although, within the area, the rivers Coquet and Font have been identified as 
experiencing so me water resource availability issues.  
• The Berwick and Fowberry WRZ  serves the far north of Northumberland and 
whilst there is generally an adequate water supply, shortages have been 
experienced during periods of high demand. Work has been undertaken by 
Northumbrian Water to improve this situation and ensure adequate supplies for 
existing users and new development, as well as protecting the sources 
themselves. Further action may include improving infrastructure, demand 
management and leakage control. Northu mbrian Water's Water Resources 
Management Plan includes the current position and future plans to ensure that 
there is a sustainable water resource for the Berwick -upon -Tweed area88. 
 
11.19  The importance of maintaining the quality of groundwater has been emphasi sed 
above. Apart from the ecological implications of not doing so, this is important 
because groundwater is a significant contributor to household water supply in 
Northumberland. The Fell Sandstone outcrop, which extends from Berwick -upon -
Tweed in the nort h, south to Wooler and Rothbury, and then to the south -west of 
Kielder Reservoir, is a designated Principal Aquifer which supports a number of 
important licensed groundwater abstractions in the Berwick -upon -Tweed and Wooler 
areas. These groundwater abstrac tions are a source of water supply within the 
Berwick and Fowberry WRZ. There are also a number of Secondary Aquifers, such 
as the Carboniferous Limestone and Millstone Grit, which are capable of supporting 
water supplies at a local scale, including Abbey Well in Morpeth. Given the rural 
nature of the County both the Principal and Secondary Aquifers support a significant 
number of private water supplies. It is important that these water resources are 
protected.  
 
 
87  Water  stress  occurs  when  the demand  for water  exceeds  the available  amount  during  a certain  perio d or 
when  poor quality  restricts  its use. See Environment  Agency,  Water  Stressed  Areas  - Final Classification,

219 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  11.20  In terms of the foul water sewerage system  as with any infrastructure, an important 
principle of sustainable planning is to make best use of existing capacity. Through the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan, associated with this Local Plan, necessary new or 
upgraded capacity in wastewater treatment work s must be shown to be deliverable in 
a timely manner. Some of these will be capable of accommodating wastewater from 
new development through the plan period. Others have limited capacity and will 
require investment in the medium term. However, certain trea tment works do not 
have any remaining capacity, meaning that there are areas of the County where little 
or no additional development could be accommodated until new capacity is installed. 
Allowing new development in advance of such works could compromise w ater 
quality.  
 
11.21  Some wastewater, from parts of the County close to its boundary with Tyne and 
Wear, is treated at the Howdon Wastewater Treatment Works in North Tyneside, 
along with wastewater from neighbouring authorities. There are potential future 
capaci ty issues relating to these treatment works. A large part of the Howdon 
catchment is served by combined sewers and there is often no option but to accept 
both foul and surface water from development, leading to unnecessary treatment of 
surface water. To en sure wastewater from future new development can be 
accommodated at the treatment works, there has been joint working between the 
Council, other local authorities, Northumbrian Water and the Environment Agency on 
the development of a strategic policy to red uce the amount of surface water run -off 
from new developments, and separate it from the sewerage system. Northumbrian 
Water has now delivered the agreed Surface Water Separation schemes.  
 
11.22  Parts of the County, mainly in rural areas are not served by mains sewerage. This 
results in the use of non -mains systems such as package treatment plants and septic 
tanks. The proliferation of some small scale non -mains drainage proposals has 
contributed towards water bodies failing to meet the Water Framework Directive 
within the County, reflecting systems being poorly positioned and/or having 
insufficient capacity and/or being adequately maintained, causing spillages and 
adverse impacts on water bodies a nd the ecosystem generally. Therefore:  
• Foul flows from all new development that is located in sewered areas should be 
directed to the public sewer system.  
• Where remoteness dictates that this is not possible, other methods of disposal 
must meet stringent st andards in their positioning, capacity and maintenance 
regimes.  
 
11.23  The capacity for existing sewerage infrastructure to cope with new development in 
the County was examined, at a high level, in the Northumberland Outline Water 
Cycle Study (WCS)89, followed b y the Detailed WCS90. This helped inform the 
detailed site allocations and also the Infrastructure Delivery Plan which accompanies 
the Local Plan.

The Council will work with Northumbrian Water, prospective developers and key 
stakeholders to identify where strategic solutions to water -related infrastructure  
investment may be required in order to support the strategic aims and expectations of 
this Plan. This will mostly relate to the provision or u pgrading of waste water treatment 
works, but it will also apply to assurances over the supply of water in certain areas 
where there are issues in its guaranteed continuity.  
 
 
 
 
Policy  WAT  2 
 
Water  supply  and sewerage  
 
1. The satisfactory provision of adequate water supply and sewerage infrastructure 
will be maintained or secured, having regard to the findings of the Northumberland 
Water Cycle Study, as follows:  
 
a. Making the best use of existing infrastructure while ensuring  that new or 
upgraded infrastructure is provided where and when needed, taking into 
account phasing plans if necessary, by directing development:  
 
i. In terms  of the supply  of water;  
• To areas  where  an adequate  supply  can be guaranteed;  
• Within  the Berwick  and Fowberry  Water  Resource  Zones,  ensurin g the 
adequate protection of existing abstraction sources; and  
• Obtaining an assurance from the water provider that a supply is  
available  to support  the development  before  the proposal  is agreed ; 
 
ii. In terms of the sewerage network and treatment works, primarily to areas 
where the necessary capacity already exists  or is capable of being 
upgraded, and only then to areas where the required capacity is planned, 
having regard to:  
• The infrastructure  providers'  Drainage and Wastewater Management  
and  Strategic  Business  Plans;  and 
• The findings  of the Northumberland  Water  Cycle  Study.  
 
b. Ensuring that, where new water -related infrastructure is needed to serve 
development , that the provision does not have a harmful impact on existing 
ecosystems, sites of international, European, national or local importance for 
biodiversity, the natural or built environment, archaeology, or the amenity of 
local residents;  
 
c. Ensuring that new or improved water and sewage treatment facilities, including 
fluvial and coastal outfalls, contribute towards improvement in water quality 
and demonstrate no significant adverse impact upon the natural environment, 
including the coastal and marine environment ; 
 11. Water  Environment   
221 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
d. Where new or upgraded water related infrastructure is required to meet urgent 
or essential operational needs, granting permission except where any adverse 
impact outweighs the need; and  
 
e. Retaining an appropriate buffer between development and sewage treatment 
works, sufficient to allow for operational needs, including any planned 
expansion of the works, and in order to avoid any odour or noise issues for 
sensitive neighbouring uses.  
 
2. Non-mains drainage systems, such as package treatment plants should only be 
employed where the development is sufficiently remote from sewered areas. In 
such locations, septic tanks should only be employed, in very exceptional 
circumstances, where on -site treatment is totally unfeasible. Where non -mains 
drainage systems meet these criteria and are the only solution, careful 
consideration of their precise siting and design will be required to ensure that there 
is no adverse impact upon groundwater, water qua lity or existing ecosystems.  
 
3. The construction of infrastructure must be to the British Standard BS EN 12566, or 
any future issues of that standard.  
 
 
 
Flood  risk 
 
11.24  Flood risk is critical when assessing the location of development. There is strong  
evidence that flood risk is increasing because of climate change. National policy  
therefore  requires  that Local  Plans  should  minimise  the risk of flood  damage  by 
locating development away from areas of highest risk of flooding.  
 
11.25  The main sources of flood r isk within Northumberland are from rivers and  
watercourses (fluvial), the sea (tidal), surface water run -off and sewers. Groundwater 
flooding  is localised  in nature.  
 
11.26  Fluvial and tidal flood risk maps have existed for many years. While these assist 
accurat e planning of where different types of buildings should or should not be sited 
according to their vulnerability, not all potential sources can be identified in this way. 
Therefore, it is important that possible flood risk from all sources are identified an d 
taken into account in the design of development.  
 
11.27  National guidance sets out a 'sequential test' to be used to steer vulnerable buildings 
towards  areas  of low risk from all forms of flooding.  The Strategic  Flood  Risk 
Assessment  (SFRA) for Northumberland, the Northumberland Water Cycle Study 
and the Environment Agency Flood Maps provide a more detailed picture of areas 
susceptible to different types of flooding and identifies risks across the County.  
 
  11. Water  Environment   
222  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Resilience  and resistance  to flooding  
 
11.28  Not all flooding  is as predictable  as fluvial,  in either  location  or frequency.  Planning  
policies and decisions must concentrate on minimising risk. This can be greatly  
assisted  by adopting  a 'blue -green  infrastructure'  approach,  whereby  development  
including the design of buildings and landscaping, as well as any other infrastructure 
improvements,  seek  to replicate  a natural  water  cycle  and contribute  to amenity  by 
bringing  water  management  and green  infrastructure  together.  
 
Sewer  floodi ng 
 
11.29  Flooding from sewers is increasingly recognised as an issue in areas that are not  
necessarily  at risk from fluvial  flooding  – whereby  rainfall  events,  sometimes  away  
from the area concerned,  cause  major  surface  water  run-off to enter  the sewerage  
system.  In places,  the network  does  not have  the capacity  to accommodate  these  
peak flows, causing wastewater  to discharge  from the network  to surrounding  land,  
housing  and commercial  property.  
 
11.30  Northumbrian Water invest in sewerage infrastructure projects, specifically targeted 
to reduce the incidence of sewer  flooding,  including  the separation  of surface  water  
from combined  sewerage  systems.  However,  future  investment  in sewerage  
infrastructure must also address increased sewage disposal resulting from future 
development. A collaborative approach between the County Council as the Lead 
Local Flood Authority and Northumbrian Water will deliver sustainable surface water 
management, di recting it from conventional systems to Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SuDS - see below). This will prevent excess surface water run -off entering 
the sewer system. Other benefits of such an approach will include a much reduced 
risk to water quality. A numbe r of Drainage Area Studies, undertaken by 
Northumbrian Water, will, through detailed sewer capacity information, help prioritise 
the location of development in relation to sewer flood risk.  
 
Design  and flooding  
 
11.31  Sometimes a development scheme that includes  highly vulnerable uses, may 
encroach into areas at risk from flooding, including those areas prone to surface 
water flooding, in which case opportunities will be sought to reduce the overall level 
of risk through the layout, mix and/or form of the develop ment, as well as the 
appropriate application of a blue -green infrastructure approach, incorporating SuDS 
(see below).  
 
11.32  Where floodwaters are likely to affect buildings and it has been demonstrated that 
development may be acceptable in the particular locati on, the design can build in 
resistance to water penetration ('dry proofing'), or, if this cannot be achieved, 
resilience to the entry of water ('wet proofing'). Resilience can also be designed into a 
building’s internal layout, fixtures and fittings so tha t, in the event of a flood incident, 
there will be, for example, easy access to safer upper floors and the opportunity for 
quick reoccupation afterwards. The SFRA has identified a number of resistance and 
resilience measures for consideration in the assess ment of development proposals.

223 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  The guidance covers building materials, foundations, floors, walls, doors and 
windows, fittings and utilities91. 
 
Surface  water  
 
11.33  Relatively small changes in hard surfacing and surface gradients can result in surface 
water flooding becoming more frequent92. Reusing brownfield land can be beneficial 
insofar as development is likely to increase rather than reduce their permeability.  
 
11.34  National guidance sets out a hierarchy of acceptable surface water discharge 
solutions w ith discharge into the ground being the most preferred solution and 
connection to sewers the least preferred solution. The emphasis of the guidance is 
that surface water run -off entering the sewerage system should be kept to an 
absolute minimum.  
 
11.35  Surface w ater flooding is an issue in parts of Northumberland and there is a need for 
surface water management to reduce the risk of flooding from new  development. The 
large scale prevention of water draining into sewers, (see  above), is a key part of this. 
Sustain able Drainage Systems (SuDS) are integral to dealing with this issue at a 
whole range of scales - see below.  
 
11.36  The provision of green infrastructure (explained in Chapter 4) can also play a less 
direct but important role in the management and mitigation of surface water flooding, 
including preventing pollution by filtering surface water run -off, thereby maintaining or 
improving the quality of water in the environment in line with legislation.  
 
11.37  The issue of whether minewater is present in the water table in t he vicinity of 
proposed developments will be a key consideration , in discussion with the 
Environment Agency and the Coal Authority, in terms of the type of surface water 
drainage solution that is employed. An incorrect solution could exacerbate the 
minewat er problem  and/or detrimentally affect the effectiveness of any sustainable 
drainage feature . 
 
Flood  alleviation  
 
11.38  There are a number of existing flood defences and other flood management 
structures across Northumberland. These are mostly on rivers close to  low-lying 
populated areas or other vulnerable land uses. There are still communities affected 
by flooding, where there will be a need to plan for additional flood defence and  
management schemes. Following the 2008 flood at Morpeth, work has now been 
compl eted on a major flood alleviation scheme involving raised flood defences and 
the storage of floodwater upstream.

Policy  WAT  3 
 
Flooding  
 
1. In assessing  development  proposals  the potential  for both on and off-site flood  risk 
from all potential sources will be measured, taking into account the policy  
approach contained within: the relevant Catchment Flood Management Plan;  the 
Northumberland Local Flood Risk Management Strategy; the Northumberland 
Outline  Water  Cycle  Study;  and the findings  of Drainage  Area  Studies.  
 
2. Development proposals will be required to demonstrate how they will minimise  
flood  risk to people,  property  and infrastructure  from all potential  sources  by: 
 
a. Avoiding inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding and directing 
the development away from areas at highest risk. Where development is 
necessary in such areas, the development should be made safe for its lifetime 
without increasing flood risk elsewhere . The Sequential Test and, if necessary, 
the Exceptions Tes t, will be applied (subject to minor development and change 
of use exemptions) in accordance with national policy and the Northumberland 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment.  Site Specific Flood Risk Assessments will 
be required for:  
 
i. All development in Flood Zones 2 and 3; and  
ii. In Flood Zone 1, for all proposals involving:  
• sites of 1 hectare or more;  
• land which has been identified by the Environment Agency as having 
critical drainage problems;  
• land identified in a strategic flood risk assessment as being at 
increased flood risk in future; or  
• land that may be subject to other sources of flooding, where its 
development would introduce a more vulnerable use.  
 
b. For developments where (2a) above applies, it will be ensured that:  
 
i. The impact of the development proposal  on existing sewerage 
infrastructure and flood risk management infrastructure is assessed, 
including whether there is a need to reinforce such infrastructure or 
provide new infrastructure in consultation with the relevant water 
authority;  
ii. The development t akes into account climate change and the vulnerability 
of its users;  
iii. The site is configured so that the most vulnerable development is located 
in areas of lowest flood risk, unless there are overriding reasons to prefer 
a different location;  
iv. The developmen t is made resistant and resilient, in terms of its layout, 
mix and/or building design, in accordance with national policy and the 
findings and recommendations of the Northumberland Strategic Flood 
Risk Assessment;  
 
 11. Water  Environment   
225 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
v. Sustainable drainage systems are incorporated as appropriate, in 
accordance with Policy WAT 4;  
vi. Any residual flood risk can be safely managed; and  
vii. Safe access and escape routes are incorporated, where appropriate, as 
part of an agreed emergency plan.  
 
c. Pursuing the full separation of foul a nd surface water flows as follows:   
 
i. A requirement that all development provides such separation within the  
development;  and 
ii. Where combined sewers remain, the Council will work with statutory  
sewerage providers to progress the separation of surface water from  foul; 
 
d. Ensuring that built development proposals, including new roads, separate, 
minimise and control surface water run -off, using Sustainable Drainage 
Systems, modified as necessary where minewater is present; in relation to 
this: 
 
i. Surface water should be managed at source wherever possible, so that 
there is no net increase in surface water run -off for the lifetime of the 
development;  
ii. Surface water should be disposed of in accordance with the following 
hierarchy for surface water run -off: 
• To a soakaway  system,  unless  it can be demonstrated  that this is not 
feasible due to poor infiltration with the underlying ground  conditions 
and/or high groundwater levels;  
• To a watercourse,  unless  there  is no alternative  or suitabl e receiving  
watercourse  available;  
• To a surface  water  sewer;  
• As a last resort, once all other methods have been explored ,  disposal  
to combined  sewers;  
iii. Where greenfield sites are to be developed, the surface water run -off rates 
should not exceed, and where possible sh ould reduce, the existing run -off 
rates;   
iv. Where previously developed sites are to be developed:  
• The peak surface run -off rate from the development to any drain,  
sewer  or surface  water  body  for any given  rainfall  event  should  be  as 
close as reasonably prac ticable to the greenfield run -off rate  for the 
same event, so long as this does not exceed the previous  rate of 
discharge  on the site for that same  event;  or 
• Where  it is demonstrated  that the greenfield  run-off rate cannot be 
achieved, then surface run-off rate should be reduced wherever 
possible by a  minimum  of 50% of the existing  site run-off rate; 
 
e. Full consideration should be given to solutions within the wider catchment  
area, including blue -green infrastructure based solutions and those providin g 
ecosystem services, with wider solutions especially applied if local solutions  
could  be harmful  to biodiversity,  landscape  or built heritage;  
  11. Water  Environment   
226  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
3. In relation  to flood  alleviation  schemes:  
 
a. The early implementation of approved schemes will be supported through 
development decisions;  
 
b. Any proposal for additional schemes should demonstrate that they represent 
the most sustainable solution and that their social, economic and 
environmental benefits outweigh any adverse environmental impacts caused 
by new structure(s), including increasing the risk of flooding elsewhere.  
 
4. Any works  relating  to the above,  which  impact  on natural  water  systems,  should  
consider the wider ecological implications, applying the ecosystem approach,  and 
link into green  infrastructure  initiatives  wherever  practicable.  
 
 
 
Sustainable  Drainage  Systems  
 
11.39  National planning policy requires that when determining planning applications, local 
planning authorities should ensure flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Due to  
increased pressure on the sewerage system, including greater numbers of connected 
properties and increased level and intensity of winter precipitation, Sustainable 
Drainage Systems (SuDS) should always be used to address surface water drainage 
within devel opments, unless there is clear evidence that this would be inappropriate.  
 
11.40  In contrast to traditional piped sewerage systems, which struggle with sudden 
influxes of rainwater, SuDS features such as ponds, porous road surfaces and 
shallow drainage channels (swales) are designed to absorb rainwater where it falls or 
slow water down to reduce the levels entering the drainage system. Fast run -off from 
hard surfaces results in flash floods from rainwater trying to enter the drainage 
system within a short period of time. By slowing down and separating out run -off, the 
highest peak levels of water entering the drainage system are reduced and flooding 
limited. The issue of flash flooding due to extreme weather events has affected 
certain parts of the County quite ba dly in recent years and needs to be addressed in 
a way which reflects a coordinated approach and the benefits of which accumulate 
over time.  
 
11.41  The Government expects local planning policies and decisions on major 
developments (10 dwellings or more or equiva lent non -residential or mixed 
development) to put sustainable drainage systems in place, unless demonstrated to 
be inappropriat e which would only be in a minority of locations. With regard to 
housing, given that many housing development sites in Northumber land are for less 
than 10 dwellings, developments of this size cumulatively contribute to flood risk 
across the local and wider vicinity. As such, it is imperative to ensure SuDS are 
included within these smaller sites, unless clearly demonstrated to be in appropriate.  
 
  11. Water  Environment   
227 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  11.43  Different situations will call for different types of SuDS, according to their 
effectiveness and efficiency and taking into account what is reasonable and 
practicable. In terms of design, construction and maintenance costs, SuDS that 
provid e surface features such as swales and ponds can be comparable in cost 
(including those associated with the additional land take) with the cost of 
conventional, piped sewerage systems, while delivering additional environmental and 
social ‘multi -user’ benefi ts. Such benefits are over and above those typically 
associated with SuDS. There can, for example be net positive impacts on air quality, 
carbon reduction, recreation, education and other elements of community health and 
wellbeing. As mentioned in relation  to general flood prevention measures, SuDS 
measures can combine with green infrastructure (as ‘blue -green infrastructure’) to 
make a meaningful contribution to climate change adaptation. The use of SuDS, 
which incorporate multi -user will be encouraged.  
 
11.44  SuDS should be embedded as early as possible in the design process to benefit from 
cost efficiencies, to maximise and integrate social and environmental benefits and to 
ensure maintenance and operation requirements are economically proportionate. In 
additio n to managing surface water run -off volumes, in designing SuDS, it is 
important that surface water leaving the development does not detrimentally affect 
the water quality of any receiving water body or sewer. All schemes should ensure an 
appropriate level of treatment before leaving the development. Where possible, 
consideration should be given to improving water quality for example by filtering out 
harmful pollutants from road surfaces.  
 
11.45  Occasionally particular types of SuDS will not be appropriate (e.g. b ecause they will 
bring more birds close to airport runways or otherwise cause a hazard, ground 
conditions are unstable, there is (or could in the future be) minewater present, or the 
development is on a steep slope). However, with regard to major developme nt the 
onus is on the applicant to provide evidence if their view is that SuDS are 
inappropriate.  
 
 
11. Water  Environment   
228  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  11.46  The Government requires that through the use of planning conditions or planning 
obligations there are clear arrangements in place for ongoing maintenance over the 
lifetime of the development. With regard to design, implementation and lifetime 
maintenance, the Council is working with other Local Planning Authorities and Lead 
Local Flood Authorities across the North East to achieve consensus on su b-regional 
SuDS guidance.  
 
11.47  Consideration will be given to using the Community Infrastructure Levy towards the 
promotion of sustainable drainage.  
 
 
 
Policy  WAT  4 
 
Sustainable  Drainage  Systems  
 
1. Water sensitive urban design, including Sustainable Drainage Sy stems (SuDS) will 
be incorporated into developments whenever necessary, in order to separate, 
minimise and control surface water run -off, in accordance with national standards 
and any future local guidance.  
 
2. SuDS will be a requirement for any development w here it is necessary to manage 
surface water drainage unless it can be clearly demonstrated:  
 
a. That SuDS are not technically, operationally or financially deliverable or viable 
and that any surface water drainage issues resulting from the development 
can be alternatively mitigated; or  
 
b. That the SuDS scheme will itself adversely affect the environment or safety, 
including where ponds could increase the risk of bird strike close to the airport 
or where existing minewater problems could be exacerbated.  
 
3. SuDS or other water sensitive urban d esign schemes should be devised to take 
account of predicted future conditions and, where appropriate, efforts should be 
made to link them into wider initiatives to enhance the green infrastructure,  
improve water quality, benefit wildlife and/or contribute  to the provision of an 
ecosystem service.  
 
4. Arrangements must be put in place for the management and maintenance of 
SuDS over the lifetime of the development, with such arrangements taking 
account of the cumulative effectiveness of SuDs in the area concern ed.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Coastal  change  
 
11.48  Along with Northumberland's river systems, the sea is the other element of the water 
environment which most shapes the County's environment. The  Northumberland 
coastline is approximately 130 kilometres in length and stretches from the Scottish 
Border in the north to Seaton Sluice in the south east of the  County. Large parts of 
the coastline have important natural and built assets; its land and seascapes are 
particularly distinctive. It comprises a series of dune syste ms and wide, sandy bays 
separated by lengths of cliffs and small islands (Holy Island, the Farne Islands and 
Coquet Island). It also includes a number of towns and villages including: Berwick -
upon -Tweed, Bamburgh, Seahouses, Beadnell, Craster, Alnmouth, Am ble, 
Cresswell, Newbiggin -by-the-Sea, Cambois, Blyth and Seaton Sluice. These are 
important communities in social and economic terms and many retain connections 
with the sea for employment and commerce. Only a  small  proportion of the coastline 
is protected  by man -made defences, most notably in the more urban areas.  
 
11.49  In its role as the Coast Protection Authority, the Council has powers to carry out 
coast protection works, while the prevention and mitigation of coastal flooding sits 
with the Environment Agenc y. The Northumberland and North Tyneside Shoreline 
Management Plan 2  93 provides a large -scale assessment of the risks from coastal 
erosion and sea flooding to places, people and the historic and natural environment. 
It presents a policy framework to manag e these risks over 20, 50 and 100 years. 
There are areas of the Northumberland Coast where there is the need to address the 
issue of coastal erosion and coastal change to protect commercial, economic and 
residential areas. Key challenges posed by the Shore line Management Plan include 
the possible need to relocate caravan parks and golf courses and realign sections of 
roads in certain areas, as well as specific issues of eroding colliery spoil in the 
Lynemouth area and sea flooding at Blyth.

230  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  11.50  The management of coastal change and its attendant processes requires an 
integrated approach and the Council is working closely with its partners and 
neighbouring authorities to promote a coherent planning strategy along the 
Northumberland Coast and beyond. In  line with national policy, the Council will 
continue to work with the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) under the Duty to 
Cooperate to ensure integration of land -use and marine planning, taking into account 
the requirements of the UK Marine Policy Stat ement and the forthcoming marine plan 
for the north east94. 
 
11.51  National planning policy is clear that the planning system should reduce the risk from 
coastal change by avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas or adding 
to the impacts of physica l changes to the coast. The Local Plan has a role to play in 
overseeing and planning for coastal change over time and directing development 
accordingly.  
 
11.52  The policy below sets criteria on coastal erosion and Coastal Change Management 
Areas (CCMAs), setting  out the type of development which would not be appropriate 
within them, the circumstances in which development may be permissible and the 
circumstances where a Vulnerability Assessment will be required. The zone within 
which the CCMA policy criteria will be applied, as shown on the Policies Map, is 
defined as the area between the shoreline and the worst case erosion estimate for 
the 100 year horizon informed by the shoreline management plan, plus a 30 metre 
buffer.

b. There will be no significant adverse impacts on the co astal environment, 
including ecological landscape and heritage assets and designations; and  
 
c. Where required, a programme of mitigation can be agreed.  
 
4. Within the Coastal Change Management Area (CCMA), as shown on the Policies 
Map, development will only be supported, where:  
 
a. It can be demonstrated that it would not result in adverse changes to the coast 
taking account of any impacts on landform, land stability, the ecology or 
biodiversity; and  
 
b. It can be demonstrated that it would need to be located withi n the zone, as 
opposed to further inland, by virtue of being concerned with a coastal activity 
that has a direct environmental, community or economic benefit; and  
 
c. It will not increase  coastal  erosion  as a result  of changes  in surface  water   run-
off. 
 
d. In exceptional circumstances, where it is necessary to reduce a potentially 
unacceptable level of future risk to people and the development, structures 
may be required to be small scale, and/or of a temporary form of construction, 
and/or granted for a tempora ry period.  
 
e. If, applying  the above  criteria,  the Coast  Protection  Authority  identifies  that

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  12. Pollution  and Land  Quality  
 
Introduction  
 
12.1 This chapter includes policies to assist in the consideration of the acceptability of 
development proposals; on land where there are stability or contamination issues; 
where development may be affected by or could cause pollution to air, water and 
land and where development proposals have implications for soil and agricultural 
land quality.  
 
12.2 The policies will help deliver the Local Plan objective to conserve and enhance the 
natural, historic, water and built environment of Northumberland by:  
• Preventing  new and existing  development  from contributing  to or being  put at 
unacceptable  risk from,  or being  adversely  affected  by unacceptable  levels of soil, 
air, water  or noise  pollution  or land instability;  
• Remediating and mitigating despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated an d 
unstable  land,  where  appropriate;  
• Using areas of poorer quality agricultural land in preference to land of highe r 
agricultural  quality;  and 
• Minimising  adverse  impacts  on local communities  and the environment.  
 
Contaminated  and unstable  land 
 
12.3 Land instability and contamination have the potential to cause harm to human health 
and the wider environment as well as damage to property and infrastructure.  
 
12.4 In accordance with the Environmental Protection Act 1990: Part 2A, contaminated 
land is that which is in such a condition by reason of substances in, on or under the 
land, that it can cause a risk to human health, property or the wider environment, or 
that it can cause significant pollution of controlled waters.  
 
12.5 Northumberland has a considerable legacy of land contamination and land instability, 
much of which originates from past coal mining and industrial activities, concentrated 
in the south east of the County. Land contamination can, however, also be caused by 
naturally occurring sources, agricultural activities and other smaller scale uses such 
as fuel filling stations. Similarly land instability can be caused by natural geological 
features and the action of water. Some contaminated, or unstable land, may be of 
historic or archaeological interest.  
 
12.6 The Local Plan has an important role with respect to minimising the risks and effects 
of land instability an d contamination issues by:  
• Ensuring  that various  types  of development  are not allowed  in locations  affecte d by 
land instability or contamination without the appropriate precautions, which 
includes ensuring that the location and internal layout of development proposals 
avoid unacceptable risks from land instability and contamination; and   
• Providing  opportunities  to address  and reduce  land instability  and contamination  
where  remediation  can form part of the overall  development  proposal.  
 12. Pollution and Land Quality   
233 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  12.7 When dealing with land that may be affected by contamination, the planning system 
works alongside a number of other regulatory regimes, and judgements relating to 
contaminated land will normally be made by officers in the Council's Public Protection 
team. Responsibility lies with the developer to ensure that land contamination is 
appropriately addressed, that necessary remediation takes place and that the site is 
cleaned up to a level appropriate for the proposed end use. It is important that new 
developmen t recognises any problems and takes a positive approach to addressing 
them in a manner that will allow the development to take place safely.  New 
development with a sensitive end use (such as new dwellings, allotments, schools, 
nurseries, playgrounds, hospi tals and care homes) will require a preliminary land 
contamination risk assessment in support of a planning application. This will 
determine whether further site investigations are required. Where significant 
contamination is known or is likely to be prese nt, it may be necessary to carry out 
some site investigations before the submission of an application, as the presence of 
this contamination may limit the allowable land uses and may also affect the viability 
of the development.  
 
12.8 A land stability assessmen t should be provided in support of proposals where land 
stability issues are known or suspected and pose a risk to new development. 
Potential land stability issues can be associated with slopes, cliffs, quarries, artificial 
ground or some natural geologica l features. In Northumberland there are specific 
issues arising from historic underground coal mining. The Coal Authority have 
identified 'Coal Mining High Risk Areas' where past coal mining activities mean there 
is a higher likelihood of land instability issues. In these areas, for most types of 
development, applicants will be required to submit a Coal Mining Risk Assessment in 
support of their application. The Coal Mining Risk Assessment should identify the site 
specific coal mining risks, the risks these  pose to new development, the mitigation 
measures required and how coal mining issues have influenced the proposed 
development scheme. In the ‘Low Risk Areas’ there is no requirement to provide a 
Coal Mining Risk Assessment but the relevant standing advice  from The Coal 
Authority will be applicable.  
 
12.9 Further details of the information required to support a planning application and the 
circumstances when this information is required is set out in the Council’s planning 
application validation checklist. The C ouncil will require that proposals on land which 
is known or suspected to be contaminated or unstable, or for uses that would be 
vulnerable to contamination or instability are supported by sufficient information to 
fully assess the contamination and instab ility risks.

Policy  POL 1 
 
Unstable  and contaminated  land 
 
1. Development proposals will be supported where it can be demonstrated that 
unacceptable risks from land instability and contamination will be prevented by 
ensuring the development is appropriately located and that measures can be 
taken to effectively mitigate the impacts.  
 
2. Planning applications for proposals on land that is potentially unstable or 
contaminated shall be accompanied by an assessment showing:  
 
a. The nature and extent of contamination or instability issues and the possible 
effects this may have on the development and its future users; and  
 
b. The remedial measures needed to allow the development to go ahead safely 
giving consideration to the potential end  users, including, as appropriate:  
 
i. Removing  the contamination;  
ii. Treating  the contamination;  
iii. Protecting  and/or  separating  the development  from the effects  of 
contamination;  and 
iv. Addressing  land instability;  and 
 
c. That the benefits of any proposed remediation measures are not outweighed 
by any harm to the natural, built and historic environment caused by the 
remediation works themselves.  
 
3. Where remedial measures are needed to allow the development to go ahead 
safely, these will be required as a condition of planning permission.  
 
4. Support will be given to development proposals that allow for the beneficial 
remediation of contamination or unstable land.  
 
  
 
Pollution  
 
12.10  Pollution can affect health, undermine quality of life and affect natural habitats . 
Alongside other consent regimes and processes, the planning system plays an 
important role in preventing and limiting the impact of polluting emissions such as 
noise, light, fumes, chemicals and noxious and hazardous substances.  
 
12.11  The Local Plan aims to protect new and existing development from contributing to or 
being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by, unacceptable 
levels of pollution. The Council requires development to comply with national air and 
water quality standards and  adopt techniques to prevent, minimise or render 
harmless polluting substances. When national standards become more stringent, 
efforts must be made to enhance the quality of the air, water and/or soils.  12. Pollution and Land Quality   
235 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  12.12  In Northumberland special consideration should be giv en to:  
• Protecting  and enhancing:  
o the high quality  of the water  environment;  
o the tranquil  nature  of the County’s  countryside;  
o the special qualities of the Northumberland International Dark Sky Park;  
o the important  qualities  of the coastline  and the communities  and habitats  it 
serves.  
• The need to improve the natural environment in the two Nature Improvement 
Areas;  
• The need to limit the effects of air, noise and light pollution along major routes 
(i.e. road, rail and aircraft from Newcastle Internatio nal Airport).  
 
Air Quality  
 
12.13  Poor air quality, caused by harmful pollutants, can have a significant negative impact 
on public health and biodiversity, and can contain greenhouse gases. Air quality in 
Northumberland is generally good and there are currently no Air Quality Management 
Areas in the County. However, air quality issues are particularly likely to arise from 
developments that may generate significant levels of traffic, introduce a new source 
of air pollution or expose people to existing so urces of air pollution. Proposals for 
development which may have a detrimental effect upon air quality will need to be 
accompanied by an air quality assessment as part of the application and provide 
mitigation measures. The cumulative effects of a developm ent upon air quality should 
be considered in context of existing and permitted development.  
 
12.14  Examples of the circumstances where air quality assessments may be required to 
support a planning application relate to proposals involving significant vehicle 
movements, industrial processes where there are direct emissions to the air, new 
minerals sites or extensions to existing sites, significant changes to highways 
infrastructure, development in excess of 100 dwellings and development involving 
more than 10,000 square metres of floor space. The air quality assessment should 
show the likely changes in air quality or exposure to air pollutants as a result of a 
proposed development. It should assess the existing air quality in the study area, 
predict the future air quality without the development in place, and predict the future 
air quality with the development in place.  
 
Noise  
 
12.15  Noise is an important consideration for developments either for uses which are 
sensitive to noise or for uses which generate noise, and for any development in 
proximity of an existing source of noise. Noise assessments, which should set out 
mitigation meas ures, and have regard to the Noise Policy Statement for England, will 
be required for any application for a development that will introduce a noise source or 
that will create a sensitive receptor to existing noise source. Assessing noise impacts 
can be com plex, and regard must be given to the prevailing ambient conditions, and 
the cumulative impacts that may arise from multiple sources. In determining the 
significance and acceptability of the likely impacts, good practice guidance from the 
World Health Orga nisation will be a key factor.  
 12. Pollution and  Land Quality   
236  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  12.16  A noise assessment will be required to support proposals that raise issues of 
disturbance, or are considered to be noise sensitive developments. They should 
outline the potential sources of noise generation, how these may h ave a negative 
effect on local amenity and environmental receptors, and detail what mitigation is 
intended to overcome these issues. Examples of proposals where a noise impact 
assessment may be required are new residential development adjacent to classifie d 
roads, adjacent to railway lines, the airport, or existing industrial uses; new residential 
development near to licensed premises and cultural venues; new industrial 
development close to existing residential development; minerals and waste 
development; d evelopment related to energy generation; and development involving 
changes of use to eating or drinking establishments, entertainment facilities, 
community facilities, and indoor and outdoor sports and leisure facilities.  
 
12.17  Aircraft movements associated wit h Newcastle International Airport (NIA) represent a 
significant existing noise source in the County. The noise impact of NIA's current and 
future forecast air traffic movements have been mapped as 'noise contours' by the 
Civil Aviation Authority. In order to ensure that new development is not significantly 
adversely affected, NIA's current and forecast noise contours will be the starting point 
for any noise assessments made in relation to the noise impacts of NIA.  
 
Lighting  
 
12.18  Artificial lighting provides valuable benefits, but can also be a significant source of 
annoyance to people, harmful to wildlife, undermine enjoyment of the countryside or 
detract from enjoyment of the night sky. The effects of artificial lighting can also  
damage the percepti on of a heritage asset, especially if the asset is experienced at 
night or is floodlit. A lighting assessment will be used to understand the impact of a 
development proposal's lighting on local amenity, intrinsically dark landscapes and 
nature conservation . Development proposals whose lighting may have an effect on 
open countryside, natural habitats and the settings of historic or cultural assets 
should have regard to Policy ENV 4 Tranquility, dark skies and a sense of rurality.  
 
12.19  The circumstances where a l ighting assessment may be required as part of a 
development proposal will often depend upon the scale of the proposal and the 
sensitivity of the surrounding area, including whether the site is located within a Dark 
Skies area. Proposals involving external lighting located in the countryside, within or 
adjacent to conservation areas, or affecting a listed building will normally need to be 
accompanied by a lighting assessment. A lighting assessment may also be required 
when there may be an adverse effect on b iodiversity or which are in close proximity 
to residential dwellings that could result in an adverse effect on amenity. All 
proposals involving major floodlighting schemes should be accompanied by a lighting 
assessment.  
 
12.20  More detail on the  circumstances wh ere an air quality, lighting or noise assessment is 
required, and what information should be contained in such assessments is set out in 
the Council’s planning application validation checklist.  
 
  12. Pollution and Land Quality   
237 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Soil quality  
 
12.21  Soil is a vital element of the environment that requires protection from loss and 
degradation, and improvement where degradation may already have occurred. Due 
to its extremely slow process of formation, soil is considered as a non -renewable 
resource, having a vital role within ecosyste ms - storing and filtering water and  
nutrients and acting as the biggest global carbon store. In addition, soil is a key 
element in the production of food, determining the quality of agricultural  land. It is 
therefore important that the soil resources are appropriately protected and used 
sustainably.  
 
 
 
Policy  POL 2 
 
Pollution  and air, soil and water  quality  
 
1. Development proposals in locations where they would cause, or be put at  
unacceptable risk of harm from, or be adversely affected by pollution by virtue  of 
the emissions  of fumes,  particles,  effluent,  radiation,  smell,  heat,  light,  noise  or 
noxious  substances  will not be supported.  
 
2. Development  proposals  that may cause  pollution  of water,  air or soil, either  
individually or cumulatively, are required to incorporate measures to prevent or 
reduce their pollution so as not to cause nuisance or unacceptable impacts on the 
environment, people or biodiversity.  
 
3. Development  proposed  where  pollution  levels  are unacceptable,  and unabl e to be 
mitigated  to acceptable  levels,  will not be supported.  
 
4. Where  the operation  of an existing  business  or community  facility  could  have  a 
significant adverse effect on a development proposal, the development proposal 
will be required  to provide  suitable  mitigation.  
 
5. Development  will be required  to help:  
 
a. Maintain  soil quality  standards  and protect  the quality  of any displaced  soil 
through  sustainable  use by following  the most  up to date guidance  from the 
Government95; 
 
b. Improve water quality standards in line with the requirements of Policy  WAT  1; 
and 
 
c. Maintain air quality standards and support improvements in any identified  Air 
Quality Management Areas consistent with any local air quality action  plans.  
 
6. Advice  on the storage  and handling  of hazardous  substances  will be taken  from 
the Health  and Safety  Executive.

238  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Agricultural  land quality  
 
12.22  The quality of agricultural land is classified by Defra and Natural England using the 
Agricultural Land Classification (ALC). The ALC system classifies land into five 
grades, with grade 3 subdivided into sub -grades 3a and 3b. The best and most 
versatile la nd is defined as Grades 1, 2 and 3a in the NPPF. This is the land which is 
most flexible, productive and efficient in response to inputs and which can best 
deliver future crops for food and non food uses such as biomass, fibres and 
pharmaceuticals.  
 
12.23  The majority of agricultural land in Northumberland is classified as grade 3, with 
some small areas of grade 2 land in the north of the County, and some areas of 
grades 4 and 5 land in the west of the County.  
 
 
 
Policy  POL 3 
 
Best and most versatile agricultural land  
 
1. Regard will be had , to the wider economic and other benefits of the best and most 
versatile agricultural land when considering any irreversible loss in accordance 
with national policy.  Where significant development of such land is demonstrated 
to be necessary, areas of poor er quality land should be preferred to those of 
higher quality.  
 
2. Temporary or reversible development on best and most versatile agricultural land 
will be supported where the land would be reinstated to its pre -development 
quality.  
 
 
13. Managing Natural Resources   
239 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13. Managing  Natural  Resources  
 
Introduction  to minerals  
 
13.1 Minerals are important resources; they are the raw materials which are necessary to 
provide the infrastructure, buildings, goods and energy that both society and the 
economy needs, therefore supporting sustainable economic growth.  
 
13.2 The most significant minerals in Northumberland are:  
• Carboniferous limestone, igneous rock and sand and gravel for aggregate   uses;  
• Coal for use in energy generation;   
• Sandstone  for use as building  stone;  and 
• Brick -making  clays  (including  fireclays,  coal measures  mudstones,  brick  shales   and 
glacial  clay).  
 
13.3 There are also other mineral resources found in Northumberland, which are not 
currently extracted. These include fluorspar, witherite and barite, which occur in veins 
with lead and zinc ores and conventional hydrocarbons, shale gas and gas from coal 
seams and workings.  
 
13.4 The policies within the Local Plan aim to deliver the strategic objective to manage the 
prudent use of Northumberland's natural resources , which includes minerals, while 
minimising the adverse impacts of their extraction and transportation on both 
communities and the environment by seeking to ensure that:  
• These  finite  resources  are not unnecessarily  sterilised;  
• Existing,  planned  and potenti al infrastructure  associated  with the transportation,  
handling  and processing  of minerals  are safeguarded;  
• High quality  restoration  and aftercare  is provided  for at the earliest  opportunity;  
• Land is made available to ensure a steady and adequate supply of minerals;   and 
• Extraction,  as well as the associated  processing  and transportation,  does  not  
have  unacceptable  adverse  impacts  on the environment  and local communities.  
 
Environmental  criteria  for assessing  minerals  developments  
 
13.5 The potential for unacceptable adverse impacts on residential amenity and the  local 
environment as a result of minerals extraction, processing and transportation is a 
major concern for communities. Notwithstanding this the environmental effects 
arising from mi nerals development are not always negative and minerals 
developments can bring environmental benefits, particularly through high quality 
restoration and after -use. 
 
13.6 The NPPF states that Local Plans should set out environmental criteria against which 
planni ng applications for minerals extraction will be assessed so as to ensure that 
proposals do not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the natural and  historic 
environment and on human health. Policy MIN1, therefore, sets out the policy criteria 
to support the consideration of the environmental acceptability of  minerals proposals 
in Northumberland and will be used to support the assessment of the environmental 
effects in conjunction with the policy criteria detailed in the  resource based policies 
for mineral s development (i.e. Policies MIN 7 to MIN 1 4). 13. Managing Natural Resources   
240  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.7 Applicants will be required to provide sufficient information in support of their planning 
application to ensure a full and robust assessment can be made of the  likely 
environmental effects of the proposals. I nformation should also be provided on the 
control, mitigation and monitoring measures that will be utilised to address the effects 
identified.  
 
 
 
Policy  MIN 1 
Environmental  criteria  for assessing  minerals  proposals  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. Proposals for mineral extraction will be supported where the applicant can 
demonstrate that any adverse effects on local communities and the environment 
are acceptable.  
 
2. In considering applications, appropriate weight will be given to potential effects on:  
 
a. Local amenit y – applicants will be required to demonstrate that there is 
appropriate separation between the site and dwellings and other sensitive 
uses, to prevent unacceptable levels of noise, dust, vibration, air pollution and 
harmful visual impact;  
 
b. Landscape chara cter and sensitivity – applicants will be required to 
demonstrate that the proposal can be effectively and appropriately integrated 
with its surroundings and the character of the landscape, particularly as a 
result of changes to landform and topography bot h during and after extraction;  
 
c. The conservation and enhancement of nature conservation and geological 
sites, including internationally, nationally and locally designated sites, priority 
habitats and protected and priority species – applicants will be required to 
demonstrate that their proposal will deliver a net gain for biodiversity where 
possible through the creation of priority habitats and by contributing to the 
creation of a coherent and resilient ecological network and that there will be no 
unacc eptable adverse effects on national or international nature conservation 
designations or irreplaceable habitats;  
 
d. The North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Northumberland 
Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the adjoining Northumberla nd 
National Park and their settings – applicants will be required to demonstrate 
that the proposals do not have  unacceptable adverse effects on the special 
qualities and the statutory purposes of these designations;  
 
e. Cultural heritage, including known and unknown archaeological features, 
designated and undesignated heritage assets and their settings – applicants 
will be required to demonstrate that the proposals will not result in 
unacceptable harm to heritage assets;  
 
f. Soils and agricultural land quali ty – applicants will be required to demonstrate 
that the soil resource is managed in a sustainable way and where proposals 
affect best and most versatile agricultural land applicants should demonstrate 
there is no suitable alternative of lower quality agri cultural land that provides  13. Managing Natural Resources   
241 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.

the same benefits in terms of other environmental considerations, the land 
could be restored to its previous agricultural land quality or there is an 
overriding need for the development;  
 
g. The capacity and suitability of the transport network, including numbers of 
movements, site access arrangements, and impacts on non -motorised users – 
The transport of minerals using rail and water is encouraged and where road 
transport is proposed applicants will be required to demonstrate t hat transport 
by rail or water is not practicable or feasible;  
 
h. The use of public rights of way – where disruption to a public right of way is 
unavoidable applicants will be required to demonstrate how the proposals 
make provision for the diversion of rout es or for the creation of an alternative 
route during both minerals extraction and restoration that are convenient and 
safe and, wherever possible, take opportunities to enhance public rights of 
way; 
 
i. Flood risk – applicants will be required to demonstrate  that the proposals do 
not have an unacceptable adverse impact on flood flows or storage capacity 
and do not increase the risk of flooding at other locations;  
 
j. Ground and surface water quality, flow and water abstraction – applicants will 
be required to co nsider the potential for the proposal to affect the flow, quality 
and quantity of ground and surface water supplies and include measures to 
prevent water pollution;  
 
k. Light pollution – applicants will be required to demonstrate the proposals 
incorporate mea sures to control light pollution;  
 
l. Land stability – applicants should demonstrate that the operation and 
restoration of the site does not create land instability and the quarry slopes 
and storage mounds are designed so as not to create instability ; 
 
m. Aviation safety – where proposals are within aerodrome safeguarding zones, 
applicants will be required to demonstrate that the proposals do not give rise 
to new or increased hazards to aviation ; and  
 
n. Climate change - applicants will be required to demonstr ate how the proposal 
impacts on climate change and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
and, where appropriate, propose d mitigation and adaptation measures.  
 
3. The criteria listed above should be considered both individually and cumulatively. 
In assess ing cumulative impact, particular regard will be had to:  
 
a. The combination of effects from an individual site;  
 
b. The combination of effects from one or more sites in a locality; and  
 
c. The effects over an extended period of time either from an individual site or a 
number of sites in a locality, whilst recognising that mineral resources can only 
be extracted where they occur, the benefits from extending existing  sites 
rather  than opening  up new areas  to working  and the desirability  of 
comprehensi vely working  resources  in an area to avoid  sterilisation.  13. Managing Natural Resources   
242  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Benefits  of minerals  developments  
 
13.8 The NPPF highlights that minerals are essential to support sustainable economic 
growth and quality of life and goes on to state great weight should be given to these 
benefits when determining planning applications. Such benefits can be both national 
and local and include, amongst other things:  
• Supplying  materials  to provide  the infrastructure,  buildings,  energy  and good s the 
country  needs;  
• Economic  benefits  by contributing  to high and stable  levels  of economic  growt h and 
by providing  employment  opportunities;  
• Environmental  enhancements  through  appropriate site restoration, including 
habitat creation, new green infrastructure and improved flood storage capacity;  
• Opportunities  to deal with areas  of contaminated  or derelict  land and areas  of 
unstable ground, particularly those resulting from the legacy of underground  coal 
mining;  and 
• Opportunities to recover a resource that would otherwise be sterilised by   non-
mineral  development.  
 
13.9 Policy MIN 2 identifies the benefits that will be given weight when determining 
planning applications in Northumberland for minerals developments. The criteria in  
Policy MIN 2 are not intended to be an exhaustive list of the be nefits of minerals 
extraction but seek to identify the key matters. Other benefits that are material 
planning considerations and that are not listed in Policy MIN 2 will be considered 
where applicants outline these in an application.  
 
13.10  The benefits need to be given great weight in the decision making process (except in 
relation to proposals for coal extraction) and balanced against the environmental 
effects (see Policy MIN 1) arising from the mineral extraction, transportation and 
proces sing. When considering proposals for coal extraction, the weight to be 
attached to any potential benefits will be determined on a case -by-case basis in the 
context Policy MIN 10.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
Policy  MIN 2 
Criteria  for assessing  the benefits  of minerals  proposals  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. When determining proposals for minerals extraction, great weight will be given to 
the benefits of minerals extraction except where the proposal relates to coal 
extraction.  
 
2. In assessing the benefits of individual proposals for minerals extraction including 
coal extraction, the following matters will be considered:  
 
a. The economic benefits of the proposal both nationally and locally, including 
contribution to the wider economy and the maintenance of employment and 
the creation of new employment opportunities;  
 
b. The contribution the extraction of the mineral will make to a steady and 
adequate supply of that material both locally  and nationally;  
 
c. Environmental enhancements, including those delivered through the 
restoration of the site following extraction and the after -use of the site and 
outside of the operational area;  
 
d. The avoidance of a mineral resource being sterilised by non -mineral 
development;  
 
e. In the case of prior extraction, the contribution this can make to enabling a 
non-mineral development taking place;  
 
f. The contribution towards the reclamation of areas of derelict or contaminated 
land and/or the remediation of undergr ound coal mining legacy issues;  
 
g. The use of rail transport, water transport, conveyors and pipelines where these 
methods are used instead of road transport; and  
 
h. The benefits of assisting the UK in meeting its binding carbon budgets and 
targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
3. Other benefits that are material planning considerations and that are not listed in 
(2) above will be considered where applicants provide evidence of these in support 
of a planning application.  
 
 
 
Mineral  and landfill  site restoration,  aftercare  and after -use 
 
13.11  It is essential that mineral and landfill sites are properly restored at the earliest  
opportunity  and the after-use is appropriate  to the site concerned.  The restoration,  
aftercare  and after-use of minera ls sites are, therefore,  an important  consideration  in 
assessing the acceptability of proposals for mineral extraction or landfill.  Applicants 
should address site restoration and after -use at an early stage in the  planning 13. Managing Natural Resources   
244  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  process and are encouraged to engage with the Council and local  communities  prior 
to applications  being  submitted.  
 
13.12  Appropriate site restoration and aftercare has the potential to enhance the 
environment and contribute to the achievement of wider policy objectives. The po licy 
for site restoration, aftercare and after -use seeks to deliver environmental and 
community benefits by providing environmental enhancements that maximise 
opportunities for nature conservation, landscape enhancements and informal outdoor 
recreation.  
 
13.13  In considering whether the proposed restoration is appropriate, the characteristics of 
the site and the surrounding area and the opportunities and constraints will be 
important factors. Such opportunities include net gains for biodiversity and 
improvements  to green infrastructure as identified in Policy MIN 3.  
 
13.14  For some mineral site restorations, it may be appropriate for waste materials to be 
imported as part of the site restoration. Such circumstances may include site specific 
considerations where potenti al long -term health and safety issues could arise as a 
result of a deep void and areas of deep water being created following extraction. In 
line with wider objectives to increase waste reduction, re -use and recycling and 
minimise disposal by landfill, wher e site restoration involving the importation of inert 
wastes is proposed it should involve the lowest amount of inert waste deposition 
required to achieve an appropriate restoration. In circumstances where mineral 
extraction is proposed on best and most ve rsatile agricultural land, proposals should 
also seek where practicable to minimise its loss and retain its longer term capability 
unless the benefits of an alternative restoration outweighs its loss.  
 
13.15  It may not be possible  to deliver  all aspirations  in all circumstances  and this will be 
assessed on a case -by-case basis having regard to the constraints, the  
characteristics  of the site and surrounding  area,  the use of the site prior to working,  
local community  aspirations  and opportunities,  including  opportunities  to link to wider 
area enhancements or initiative. It is, however, recognised that the majority of 
minerals sites in Northumberland lie in the open countryside and acceptable after -
uses will, therefore, be restricted to agriculture, forestry, informal recreation and 
nature conservation in most circumstances. After -use proposals involving built 
development, such as housing and business uses, will be assessed against the  
relevant policies in the development plan. These types of after -uses may be 
particularly relevant on sites well -related to existing settlements and where the  
mineral extraction has supported the remediation of derelict and/or contaminated 
land.  
 
13.16  All proposals  are required  to make  provision  for the after-care and maintena nce of 
the restored site for a period of not less than five years. However, it will be  
appropriate to extend the period for after -care and maintenance in circumstances  
where a period of more than five years is required for the after -use to become  
establish ed or a particularly innovative restoration and after -use is proposed. For  
example, if wildlife habitats are created they can take much longer than the standard 
five-year after-care period  to become  established  and provision  for the longer -term 
after-care and management of these habitats will be important in these  
circumstances.

Mineral  and landfill  site restoration,  aftercare  and after -use (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. Proposals  for minerals  extraction  will be supported  where  provision  has been  
made for  the appropriate restoration and aftercare of the proposed site at the 
earliest opportunity.  
 
2. Proposals for the restoration, aftercare and after -use of mineral extraction and

a. Deliver net -gains for biodiversity following restoration by contributing to priority 
habitat creation and local ecological networks, having particular regard to the 
biodiversity action plan and the biodiversity strategy for England;  
 
b. Deliver improved public access and/or public  open space, including links to the 
surrounding green infrastructure and expansion of the public rights of way 
network, whilst taking great care to minimise disturbance to wildlife and 
ensuring opportunities for access for all user groups;  
 
c. Protect soil resources by ensuring that they are retained, conserved and 
handled in line with best practice during site extraction operations and during 
restoration;  
 
d. When creating wetland habitats, take account of the requirement to manage 
the risk of birds strik ing aircraft when within Aerodrome Safeguarding Zones 
and include elements to assist in flood alleviation;  
 
e. Include provision for the phased working and restoration of the site, unless it 
can be demonstrated that this is not practicable or feasible as a re sult of the 
site characteristics and constraints;  
 
f. Include sufficient detail to demonstrate that the proposed restoration and after -
use scheme is practically achievable and includes details of the final proposed 
landform, the proposed after -use and how the  soil resource and overburden 
will be managed;  
 
g. Make provision for the aftercare of the restored site, or a relevant part of the 
site where a site is subject to progressive restoration, for a period of five years 
to ensure the land is capable of sustaining  the approved after -use or after -
uses. The aftercare period may be extended by legal agreement beyond five 
years where it is required for the after-use to become established or a 
particularly  innovative  restoration  and after-use is proposed;  and 
 
h. Include sufficient safeguards to ensure the adequate restoration and  aftercare 
of the site from the commencement of development until completion of 
restoration and aftercare. In exceptional circumstances, such as long -term 
schemes where no progressive rest oration is proposed, proposals where  
innovative techniques are to be used, or where there is reliable evidence  of 
financial failure, a financial bond or other financial guarantee shall be  sought.  13. Managing Natural Resources   
246  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Mineral  resource  safeguarding  
 
13.17  The NPPF advocates that known  minerals resources should not be needlessly 
sterilised by development either above the resource or near to it. Local plans are 
therefore required to define 'Minerals Safeguarding Areas' (MSAs), MSA designation 
does not convey any presumption that working will take place. MSAs are defined 
around the following mineral resources:  
• Carboniferous  limestone;  
• Clay (including  brick  clay, brick  shale  and fireclay);   
• Coal;  
• Igneous  rock;  
• Sandstone; and   
• Sand  and gravel.  
 
13.18  In line with advice on best practice, the MSAs for Northumberland will cover the 
whole of the resource area, include known mineral resources beneath existing 
settlements and overlap with other planning and environmental designations. The 
MSAs also extend b eyond the boundary of the resource to create a buffer thereby 
protecting the potential extraction of the mineral from development near the resource.  
 
13.19  New development located close to existing quarries could be sensitive to the effects 
arising from the operation of a mineral extraction site and its associated 
infrastructure, which could impact upon the amenity of the occupiers and users of the 
new development. In line with the ‘agent of change’ principle, Policy MIN 4 requires 
applicants for new developm ent in the vicinity of an existing or permitted mineral 
extraction site to demonstrate that the new development will not prevent or prejudice 
the current or future use of the site. Where an existing or permitted mineral extraction 
site would have an advers e effect on a proposed new development, the applicant will 
be required to provide suitable mitigation to ensure that there are no unacceptable 
adverse effects on any occupiers and users of the new development proposed.  
 
13.20  Proposals for non -mineral developmen t located within a MSA will be assessed 
against the requirements of Policy MIN 4. There are some types of development 
within MSAs that will not pose a threat to mineral safeguarding due to the minor 
nature of these developments and as a result these develo pment types (identified in 
Part 3 (f) of Policy MIN 4) are exempt from the safeguarding provisions under Policy 
MIN 4. Where a proposal is a non -exempt development, applicants will be required to 
provide sufficient information with their application to ena ble consideration of the 
potential effects of the proposal on mineral safeguarding and the potential for prior 
extraction. Such information should be in the form of a minerals resource 
assessment that should provide the following information96: 
• Type of min eral resources thought to be present;  
• The potential extent of sterilisation which could occur as a result of the 
development in terms of tonnage;  
• Economic value and viability of the mineral (i.e. the market interest);  
• Site specific considerations that may affect feasibility or acceptability of extraction 
from the site;

Prior extraction of minerals  
 
1. Where a proposed non -mineral development would lead to the sterilisation of an 
identified mineral resource, the prior extraction of this mineral resource is 
encouraged where this would be practicable and environmentally acceptable.  
 
2. Applications for non -mineral development in a MSA ar e required to consider the 
possibility of prior extraction ahead of the proposed non -mineral development 
being implemented. An assessment of the feasibility of prior extraction should take 
account of:  
 
a. Whether the environmental conditions are suitable to s upport extraction 
operations to ensure no unacceptable effects on local communities and the 
environment;  
b. Whether prior extraction is achievable within an acceptable timescale;  
c. Markets for the mineral; and  
d. The effect of extraction on the viability of the pr oposal overall.  
 
3. Provision should be made to ensure the site can be adequately restored in the 
event that the subsequent proposed non -mineral development is delayed or does 
not proceed.  
 
 
 
Mineral  infrastructure  safeguarding  
 
13.22  The NPPF  requires  Local  Plans  to safeguard  existing,  planned  and potential  sites for 
important  minerals  related  infrastructure.  This includes:  
• Minerals  transportation  infrastructure,  such  as rail heads,  rail links to quarries,  
wharfage and associated storage, handling and processing facilities for the  bulk 
transport  of minerals  by rail, sea or inland  waterways;  
• Sites  for concrete  batching  and the manufacture  of other  concrete  products;   
• Sites  for the manufacture  of coated  materials;  and 
• Sites  for the handling,  processing  and distribution  of substitute,  recycled  and  
secondary  aggregate  material.  
 
13.23  The most strategically important sites to safeguard in the context of Northumberland 
are the sites that are used, or have the potential to be used, to support the  
trans portation of minerals by rail and water. Unlike the other types of site listed  
above, the potential location for these facilities is more limited and there is less  
flexibility in terms of where these sites can be located due to their need to be  
connected t o the existing rail network and navigable waterways, usually at ports  and 
harbours.  The safeguarding  of these  sites is also particularly  important  as the use of 
rail and water  for the sustainable  transportation  of minerals  is encouraged.  
 
 
 13. Managing Natural Resources   
250  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.24  The introduction  of some  other  types  of development  in close  proximity  to sites can 
also raise important safeguarding issues. For example, if housing and business  uses 
that require a high quality local environment are located close to sites used  for the 
transp ortation, handling and processing of minerals it can lead to conflict.  This is as a 
result  of the potential  environmental  effects  arising  from the operation  of the site, 
such  as noise,  vibration  and impacts  from vehicle  movements;  that can impact on 
local amenity . In line with the ‘agent of change’ principle, Policy MIN 6 therefore 
requires applicants of development proposals in the vicinity of the safeguarded sites 
to demonstrate that they will not prevent or prejudice the current or futur e use of the 
site. Where an existing operation would have an adverse effect on a proposed new 
development, the applicant will be required to provide suitable mitigation to ensure 
that there are no unacceptable adverse effects on any occupiers and users of the 
new development proposed.  
 
13.25  Proposals within or in the vicinity of safeguarded mineral infrastructure sites should 
be supported by a Minerals Infrastructure Assessment97. This should provide 
sufficient evidence to enable the decision -maker to assess whe ther the proposed 
development is likely to have an adverse effect on the facility including its capacity. 
The assessments should identify the potential sensitivities of the proposed 
development and demonstrate that the proposed non -mineral development will  not 
be sensitive to effects arising  from the operation of the infrastructure. Mitigation 
measures may be  incorporated into the design and layout of the development, 
reflecting the ‘agent of change’ principle. Where a facility is likely to be adversely 
affected, either through its partial or total loss or by constraining its capacity, the 
ability to provide equivalent replacement capacity elsewhere or the lack of need for 
the facility will need to be demonstrated.  
 
13.26  Details  of the safeguarded  minerals  infrastructure  is identified  in Table  13.1 below.  
The boundaries  of the safeguarded  sites are also shown  on the Policies  Map.

Aggregate  minerals  
 
13.27  Aggregates are hard, granular materials used either on their own or with other 
materials for concrete, mortar, roadstone, asphalt, railway ballast, drainage courses 
and bulk fill. The principal aggregate minerals in Northumberland are Carboniferous 
limesto ne, igneous rock, and sand and gravel. Aggregates can also be produced 
from recycled material, typically recycled road planings and construction and 
demolition waste, and from secondary materials, which arise as a by -product of an 
industrial process or oth er quarrying operations.  
 
13.28  The key igneous rock resource is the Whin Sill, located around Belford and Alnwick 
and to the north of Hexham. The Carboniferous limestone resources are associated 
with the Whin Sill and are also principally found in the south and  west of the County 
to the north east of Hexham. The principal sand and gravel resources are found 
along the Tyne Valley and in the Coquet, Breamish, Glen and Till valleys. Quarries 
with planning permission for the extraction sand and gravel and crushed ro ck for 
aggregates uses are listed in Table 13.2.

1. The reserve figure for crushed rock has been calculated by subtracting estimated reserves at sites  within  
the Northumberland  Local  Plan area from total Northumberland  sales,  which  additionally  includes  reserves  at a 
quarry  within  Northumberland  National  Park.  
 
 
13.29  The NPPF requires the preparation of an annual Local Aggregate Assessment (LAA) 
to assess the demand for aggregates and the options for their supply. The LAA for 
Northumberland has been prepared jointly with Durham County Co uncil, 
Northumberland National Park Authority and the five Tyne and Wear authorities.  
 
13.30  The Local Aggregates Assessment recommends that a three year sales average, 
which covers the period 2015 to 2017, is used to calculate demand for both crushed 
rock and s and and gravel from Northumberland. The LAA considers that the three 
year sales average is most representative of demand and would be more 
representative of demand in future years. This is because the ten year sales period 
includes a period of depressed sa les over the period from 2009 to 2013 as a result of 
the economic downturn, which in turn saw a significantly reduced demand for 
aggregates from the construction sector. The three year period reflects a time period 
where the level of housing completions ar e comparable with those levels being 
planned for over the plan period. In addition, the future infrastructure projects that 
could result in a demand for aggregates from Northumberland are not likely to result 
in a level of demand that is not reflected in t he three year sales average. This due to 
the comparable nature of the planned projects with those that were taking place in 
the three year period which were placing a demand on supplies from 
Northumberland.  
 
13.31  In terms of sand and g ravel, the LAA forecasts a n annual demand of 420,000 tonnes 
that should be supplied from Northumberland. As summarised in Table 13.3, there 13. Managing Natural Resources   
254  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  would be a shortfall in permitted reserves to meet the forecast demand to the end of 
the plan period and to provide a landbank of at least sev en years at the end of the 
plan period. In addition to this the productive capacity (i.e. the expected amount of 
mineral each site can produce each year under normal working conditions) of the 
current sites with planning permission would fall below the for ecast annual demand of 
420,000 tonnes in the early part of the plan period mainly because the number of 
sites that are currently active is expected to decrease as the permitted reserves 
contained within these sites are exhausted. There would, therefore, be  a shortfall in 
supply to meet the annual demand from Northumberland during the plan period 
without the identification of further sites.  
 
13.32  To meet this identified shortfall in supply to meet forecast demand, the following site 
allocations have been identifi ed in this plan (and shown on the Policies Map) to 
ensure that an adequate landbank of at least 7 years is maintained and to ensure 
that productive capacity can meet annual demand:  
• Anick Grange Haugh, located to the east of Hexham (5.8 million tonnes) . 
• Ebchester Quarry, located to the north of Newlands (2.2 million tonnes) . 
• Wooperton Quarry east extension, located to the north east of Wooperton 
Sawmills (1 million tonnes) .

13.33  In terms of crushed rock , the LAA forecasts an annual demand of 1,650,000 tonnes 
that should be supplied from Northumberland. As summarised in the calculations 
Table 13.4, there would be no shortfall in the permitted reserves to meet the forecast 
demand up to the end of the plan period and to also maintain a landbank of at least 
ten years at the end of the plan period. It has, however, been identified that the 
productive capacity (i.e. the expected amount of mineral each site can produce each 
year under normal working conditions) of the current active sites with planning 
permission would fall below the forecast annual demand of 1,650,000 tonnes during 
the plan period. This is because the number of sites that are currently active is 
expected to decrease as permitted reserves contain ed within some of these sites are 
exhausted and there is uncertainty regarding the availability of the capacity to 13. Managing Natural Resources   
255 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  contribute to supply at those sites that have not been operational for a significant 
period of time. This issue is identified in the LAA, whi ch recommends that some 
flexibility is required in terms of the policy approach to ensure additional land to 
supply crushed rock for aggregates uses is available over the plan period. This is to 
maintain productive capacity, avoid large landbanks in a limi ted number of sites 
stifling competition and provide a balance in supply between quarries in the north and 
east of Northumberland and those in the south and west of Northumberland in light of 
the following:  
• The current planning permissions for five of the quarries producing crushed  rock 
in Northumberland  expire  before  the end of the plan period;  
• The reserves with planning permissions for extraction within a number of the 
quarries  are projected  to be exhauste d by the end of the plan period;   
• A proportion of permitted reserves (estimated to be 17.5% at the end of 
December 2017) are contained in sites that are inactive and which have not been 
worked for a number of years; and  
• A large proportion of the permitted reserves are contained within a single site 
(estimated to be 58.8% at the end of December 2017).

13.34  The following site allocations have, therefore, been identified in this plan (and shown 
on the Policies Map) in order to maintain a steady and adequate supply over the plan 
period and to ensure that productive capacity can meet annual demand.  
• Belford Quarry extension, located east of Belford (5 million tonnes) . 
• Divethill Quarry north and east extensions, located to the south west of Great 
Bavington (6.6 million tonnes) . 
• Longhoughton Quarry east extens ion, located west of Longhoughton (1.75 million 
tonnes) . 
• Northside, located south west of Kirkwhelpington (4 million tonnes) . 
• Shiel Dykes, located to the north west of Newton on the Moor (3 million tonnes) . 
 13. Managing Natural Resources   
256  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.35  Harden Quarry, which is located in the Northumberland National Park and therefore 
outside the area covered by the Northumberland Local Plan, contributes to the 
supply of crushed rock for aggregate uses from Northumberland as a whole. The 
Local Plan seeks to support the maintenance of the landba nk of crushed rock for 
aggregate uses provision for Northumberland as a whole from outside of the 
Northumberland National Park. However, it is recognised that the resource at Harden 
Quarry is valued for its red colour and because the resource is not found elsewhere 
in Northumberland it cannot be supplied from alternative sites outside of the 
Northumberland National Park.  
 
13.36  The NPPF encourages the use of recycled and secondary aggregates in order to 
contribute to the overall supply of aggregate minerals and n ationally it is estimated 
that 28% of aggregates supply is from these materials. In Northumberland, recycled 
aggregates are produced from construction and demolition projects, whilst secondary 
aggregates are produced from industrial  by-products including a sh derived from 
Lynemouth Power Station. Policy MIN 7 supports the contribution that recycled and 
secondary aggregates can make to overall supply, but other policies in the plan also 
have a role in supporting the contribution that recycled and secondary ag gregates 
are capable of making to the overall supply of materials for aggregate uses and their 
sustainability. The Local Plan supports and encourages the use of secondary and 
recycled aggregates by the following means:  
• Providing positive policy criteria fo r proposals for new or enhanced aggregates 
recycling operations and recognising that aggregates quarries also provide 
opportunities for recycled aggregates and the inclusion of these materials in the 
supply chain (See Policy WAS 1);  
• Safeguarding sites used for the handling, processing and transport of recycled 
and secondary aggregates to protect their operating capacity from incompatible 
non-minerals development (see Policy MIN 6); 
• Supporting the use of recycled materials in construct ion and sustainable 
construction practices (see Policy QOP 5); and  
• Seeking to minimise the landfilling of materials that may be suitable for use as a 
recycled aggregate and supporting its positive use (see Policy WAS 3).  
 
13.37  Due to the current limitations in relation to the data on the supply of recycled and 
secondary aggregates, it is not considered to be appropriate to provide a figure for 
these materials in the plan. Instead the approach seeks to support the provision of 
supply from these materials and maxi mise their usage in recognition of the 
sustainability benefits versus the equivalent supply being sourced from primary 
aggregates.  
 
13.38  Policy  MIN 7 provides  policy  for assessing  proposals  involving  aggregate  minerals  
and include criteria to consider proposals  for borrow pits. Borrow pits are temporary  
aggregate mineral extraction sites that serve major construction projects, such as  
road schemes. Borrow pits can help to meet peaks in demand for aggregates  
associated with these projects as well as reducing vehi cle movements and the  
distances aggregates are transported. Proposals for borrow pits will be assessed  in 
the same way as proposals for other aggregates extraction and proposals for  borrow 
pits would be required to demonstrate the materials cannot be reaso nably  supplied  
from existing  quarries  or available  waste  materials,  it is well related  to the 
construction  project  it is supplying  and the material  extracted  is only for use in the 
specified  project.  13. Managing Natural Resources

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.39  For the reasons set out above, Policy MIN 8 and Policy MIN 9 allocate sites for the 
extraction of sand and gravel and crushed rock for aggregate uses respectively. 
Proposals in these areas are supported in principle but the acceptability of the 
detailed proposals for the design, working, proposed mitigation measure s and 
restoration of these allocated sites will be subject to detailed assessment at the

would be preceded by a request for pre -application advice, which will provide more  
detailed advice on the requirements that should be addressed in a planning 
application.  The acceptability of proposals will be assessed against the relevant 
policies in the Local Plan. The most relevant policies are Policy MIN 1 (Environmental 
criteria fo r assessing minerals proposals) and Policy MIN 3 (Site restoration, 
aftercare and after -use), which will be used to assess environmental acceptability of 
the proposals and whether provision has been made for the appropriate restoration

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Coal  
 
13.40  Northumberland has a long history of coal extraction and the surface mines in the 
County have made a significant contribution to meeting national demand for coal in 
recent years. The demand for coal has, however, reduced significantly in recent 
years as a result of government policies to address climate change and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions through encouraging the replacement of coal fired power 
stations with lower carbon alternatives by the mid -2020s. Future demand for coal in 
the UK is likely to come  from the industrial sector, including steel and cement 
manufacture. The Local Plan provides a policy to assess the acceptability of 
proposals for coal extraction, particularly in terms of potential adverse effects of the 
extraction operations on local com munities and the environment. The effects arising 
from the use of coal following extraction is outside of the remit of the Local Plan 
policy.  
 
13.41  The coal resource in Northumberland is found across extensive areas of the County 
and is shown in Figure 13.1. Th e resource has been divided into 'principal resource  
areas' 98 and 'subsidiary resource areas' 99. The principal resource areas represent 
the most important resource areas in Northumberland due to the closely -spaced 
nature of the coal seams and the quality of the coal found in these areas.  During the 
plan period, it is expected that proposals for coal  extraction will come forward from 
within the principal resource areas identified.  
 
13.42  All proposals for coal extraction in Northumberland will be assessed against the 
overarching policy test for coal extraction, which is set out in Policy MIN  10. The 
criteri a in Policy MIN 1 (Environmental criteria for assessing minerals proposals) will 
be used to assess environmental acceptability of the proposals. If it is determined 
that the proposal is not environmentally acceptable, consideration will be given as to 
whet her there are any national, local or community benefits that clearly outweigh the 
impacts of the proposal. Policy MIN 2 identifies the benefits arising from the 
proposals that will be given consideration.  The weight to be attached to any potential 
benefits  will be determined on a case -by-case basis in the context Policy MIN 10. 
 
13.43  In addition, Policy MIN 10 divides the principal resource areas into sub -areas, 
recognising the characteristics of these sub -areas and the specific issues associated  
with coal extra ction in these areas100, and identifies the key environmental issues 
within the principal resource areas that are particularly relevant to assessing 
acceptability of proposals for coal extraction in these areas.  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
98  The 'Principal  resource  areas'  comprise  closely -spaced  coals  within  the Coal Measures.  
99  The 'Subsidiary  resource areas'  comprise  much  more  widely -spaced  coals  in Lower  Carboniferous.  
100 The key matters identified have been informed by the Landscape Character Assessment, the Key   Land 
Use Impact Study, the Environmental Considerations and Mineral Resources Study a nd the   criteria  in the 
existing  policies  in the Minerals  Local  Plan (2000).  13. Managing Natural Resources

3. Proposals for coal extraction should, where practicable, include provision for the 
extraction of brick clays (which includes fireclays and brick shales) and other 
ancillary minerals.  
 
 
 
Clays  
 
13.44  The clay resources that are found in Northumberland include fireclays, coal 
measures mudstone , brick shale and glacial clays.  When making reference to brick -
making clays, this includes these aforementioned resources. These resources have 
principally been extracted for use as a raw material in the manufacture of bricks, 
pipes and tiles.  
 
13.45  Fireclay i s particularly valued for its use in the manufacture of buff -coloured bricks 
and the extent of this mineral largely coincides with the coal resource. Fireclay 
deposits in Northumberland are relatively thin, which means that extraction on its own 
is not eco nomically viable and it is extracted concurrently with coal at surface coal 
sites. The Local Plan will allow for the continuation of supply of fireclay to brickworks 
by supporting its extraction and recovery concurrently with coal. Given the economics 
asso ciated with extraction and the relationship with coal, it is not possible to identify a 
landbank as required by the NPPF across Northumberland.  13. Managing Natural Resources   
263 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.46  Glacial clay has previously been extracted from the Thrunton Brickworks site but has 
now ceased, along with the manufacture of bricks at the adjacent brickworks. 
Significant reserves of clay with planning permission for extraction remain at the site 
and it is proposed to safeguard this resource through Policy MIN 1 1. 
 
13.47  Where clay is extracted as an ancillary mineral,  any proposals for the stockpiling of 
material that cannot be used by brickworks at the time of extraction will be 
considered favourably where they comply with the criteria set out in Policies MIN 1 
and MIN 2 and it does not delay site restoration.  
 
13.48  It is not considered appropriate to identify a landbank of permitted reserves of clay for 
Northumberland within the Local Plan. This is because in Northumberland brick clays 
(including fireclay and brick shale) are extracted as an ancillary mineral to coal  and it 
is not economically viable to extract these resources on their own. Supply of these 
brick clays is, therefore, dependent on its extraction concurrently with coal. This 
dependency on extraction concurrently with coal makes it difficult to quantify a nd 
maintain a recognised landbank of permitted reserves, as demand does not 
necessarily match the rate of coal extraction and the timescales associated with 
these sites. Furthermore, there are no brick manufacturing plants in Northumberland 
or active dedic ated clay extraction pits. The active brick manufacturing plants across 
the North East region, which includes Throckley Brickworks in Newcastle, can 
demonstrate a sufficient landbank of permitted reserves.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Natural  building  and roofing  stone  
 
13.49  Sandstone from Northumberland is mainly used as a building material and has  been 
quarried in the County for many years. Its use makes an important contribution to 
defining the character and appearance of the County’s towns, villages, castles,  
country houses and farm steadings. Its influence also extends further afield, including 
Edinburgh  for example.  Many  of the building  stone  quarries  in Northumberland  are 
small -scale and are only worked intermittently, responding  to demand  from specific  
building or restoration projects where the material with those characteristics is  
specified. It is therefore difficult to predict future demand for building stone and  
consequent quarrying activity over the plan period as most of the demand arises  from 
specifi c building or restoration projects. The Local Plan will however seek to  ensure  
that a steady,  adequate  and diverse  supply  of building  stone  is maintained  over the 
plan period  whilst  ensuring  that the environmental  effects  from proposals  are 
acceptable.  
 
13.50  The strategy for natural building and roofing stone is that existing quarries will 
primarily meet demand during the plan period, with proposals for extensions to 
existing quarries (including historic quarries which do not have a current planni ng 
permission), and for new quarries, being permitted where this would help maintain a 
steady, adequate and diverse supply of materials and complies with the 
environmental safeguards set out in Policy MIN 1.

i. circumstances where the extraction would provide material for 
development that is required to maintain the character of a particular 
settlement; or  
ii. would provide material specifically for the repair of identified heritage 
assets; and  
 
b. The extraction would be primarily for building and roofing stone uses rather 
than for aggregate uses.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Conventional  and unconventional  oil and gas 
 
13.51  The policy for oil and gas extraction covers both conventional and unconventional 
hydrocarbons. Conventional oil and gas is where the reservoir is sandstone or  
limestone and unconventional hydrocarbons refers to  oil and gas that comes from 
sources such as shale or coal seams which act as the reservoirs.  
 
13.52  In terms of conventional oil and gas, the Carboniferous rocks in Northumberland are 
identified as having energy generating potential but this potential has not b een 
realised during previous exploration for a viable resource. There are currently no 
licences for exploration, appraisal or production in Northumberland.  
 
13.53  Northumberland also has potential for the recovery of gas from coal seams and coal 
mines and underg round coal gasification. The prospects for exploiting these 
technologies within Northumberland are currently considered to be poor, due to the 
extensive previous working of the coal resource, and the methane content is 
considered to be too low to support c ommercial extraction. There is, however, the 
potential for underground coal gasification off the South East Northumberland coast, 
which is outside the area covered by this plan. This could result in proposals for 
onshore infrastructure to support the produ ction boreholes offshore.  
 
13.54  The geology of Northumberland has also been identified as having the potential for 
shale gas, which is able to be extracted using hydraulic fracturing (commonly referred 
to as 'fracking'). This potential resource is currently unt ested and it is not known 
whether an extractable resource is present in Northumberland.  
 
13.55  The exploration, appraisal or production phase of oil and gas extraction can only take 
place in areas where the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy  
have first issued a license. An operator must then obtain planning permission from 
the County Council as Mineral Planning Authority. However, a number of matters 
related to oil and gas development are regulated by other agencies, such as the 
Environment A gency and Health and Safety Executive.  Mineral Planning Authorities 
should not duplicate other regulatory regimes and should assume that these 
regulatory regimes operate as intended, however, it is recognised that there are 
matters covered by other regulatory regimes that may be relevant to Mineral Planning 
Authorities. The policies for oil and gas therefore focus on those matters of relevance 
to planning.  
 
13.56  The policy for oil and gas extraction provides policy criteria to assess proposals  
which may c ome forward during the plan period. This is considered appropriate  given  
the uncertainties  regarding  the future  prospects  for oil and gas extraction  in 
Northumberland. Many of the planning issues associated with oil and gas  
development, such as potential p ollution of land, air and water, disturbance from  
noise,  visual  impact  and transportation  issues,  are similar to the environmental issues 
that proposals for other types of minerals raise and these matters will be  assessed 
against the requirements of Policy  MIN 1. Nonetheless, there are some  specific 
planning matters that are relevant to oil and gas development proposals,  including 
the need for exploration, appraisal and production phases of hydrocarbon 
development,  which  are covered  in Policy  MIN 13. This includes, for example, 
impacts on the underlying integrity of the geological structure and induced seismicity 13. Managing Natural Resources

Peat  
 
13.57  Peat has traditionally been extracted from Northumberland for use in horticulture and 
as a fuel. The NPPF is clear that local plans should neither identify new sites nor 
extensions to existing sites for extraction. This is in line with wider Government 
policy, which seeks to protect peat habitats because of their nature conservation 
importance and their carbon storage role.

267 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.58  In line with the NPPF the approach is not to allow new sites for peat extraction and

Vein  minerals  
 
13.59  The North Pennine Orefield extends into the south west of Northumberland. The  
industrial minerals, fluorspar, witherite and barite occur in veins with lead and zinc 
ores, and have been the principal minerals produced across the wider North 
Pennines in the latter part of the twentieth century. There has been no recent 
extraction in Northumberland.  
 
13.60  Given that the occurrence of these resources in Northumberland overlaps with the 
North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which extends into the 
neighbouring areas of County Durham and Cumbria, the proposed strategy for  
metalliferous and vein minerals is to consider proposals against the overarching 
policy for the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the tests for 
major de velopment within this area. The overlap of the resource with nationally and 
internationally important nature conservation designations in the North Pennines 
means that the effects on these designations will also be a key consideration in 
determining the ac ceptability of proposals. Proposals will also be guided by the 
overarching policies for minerals.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Introduction  to waste  
 
13.61  Waste is defined as material or an object which is no longer wanted and requires 
management. However, these materials are recognised as being important and 
valuable resources rather than being something that needs to be disposed of . The 
waste policies in t he Local Plan will help to support sustainable waste management 
and deliver the Local Plan objective to manage the prudent use of Northumberland’s 
natural resources while producing less waste and minimising impacts on local 
communities and the environment by: 
• Helping to drive waste management up the waste hierarchy (see Figure 13.2) by 
providing opportunities for new or enhanced waste management facilities that 
support the re -use, recycling and recovery of waste, whilst minimising the role of 
landfill;  
• Providing opportunities for waste to be managed locally and close to the source 
of arisings, in line with the proximity principle;  
• Providing opportunities for waste management facilities that would help 
Northumberland meet its own needs (whilst r ecognising there are cross -boundary 
flows of waste) in line with the principle of net self -sufficiency;  
• Helping to ensure waste management facilities are designed and managed in a 
way that will not harm the environment, endanger human health or have 
unacce ptable adverse effects on residential amenity; and  
• Ensuring proposals for non -waste related development do not have an 
unacceptable impact on existing waste management facilities and do not 
prejudice the implementation of the waste hierarchy and/or the eff icient operation 
of such facilities.  
 
13.62  The waste management sector also provides important opportunities for economic 
growth and employment through the development of new and enhanced facilities for 
waste re -use, recycling and recovery.  
 
 
Figure  13.2 Waste  Hierarchy  
 
 
 
13.63  The management and disposal of waste is regulated by other public agencies and it 
is assumed that these regulatory regimes operate as intended. The policies relating 
to waste management and disposal facilities therefore focus on those matters  of 
relevance to planning.  
13. Managing Natural Resources   
269 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Waste prevention and minimisation  
 
13.64  Waste prevention and minimisation is at the top of the waste hierarchy and if 
achieved will reduce the amount of waste that requires processing and/or disposal. 
There are a number of ways the amount of waste produced can be reduced, however 
many of the tools to do this are outside of the planning system and cannot be 
influenced by Local Plan policy. One way the Local Plan can help is to ensure that 
waste associated with the construction and occ upation of new development is 
reduced as much as possible. Policy QOP 5 Sustainable design and construction 
encourages waste generated during construction to be minimised and space to be 
provided within developments to allow waste to be separated for re -use and 
recycling.  
 
Waste arisings and capacity to manage this waste  
 
13.65  Households, businesses and other institutions produce a range of wastes that require 
management and it is important to understand the amount of waste generated and 
requiring management as well as the capacity of waste management facilities to 
manage this waste. Tables 13.5  and 13.6  set out the tonnages of municipal waste 
(local authority collected waste) and commercial and industrial waste that are 
forecast to arise over the plan period and  how these are likely to be managed.  
 
13.66  It is recognised that the amount of municipal waste (local authority collected waste) 
currently collected is less than forecast and that this pattern of reduction is likely to 
continue over the plan period.  
 
13.67  The foreca sts show some increase in the waste arisings over the plan period. This is 
due to a projected increase in the number of households in Northumberland over this 
period, which in turn is projected to result in an overall increase in total arisings 
despite a d ecrease in the waste produced per household. Similarly, there is a 
projected rise in commercial and industrial waste arisings due to forecast economic 
growth and increased economic activity. It is projected that 8% of local authority 
collected waste will b e managed by landfill throughout the plan period. This is a 
significant reduction from that managed by landfill prior to 2009, which was in excess 
of 100,000 tonnes per year. The proportion is assumed to remain at this level 
because it represents the minim um amount of waste that is either unable to be 
managed using alternative methods or that has to be managed in this way, for 
example, because the recovery facility is temporarily unavailable for maintenance 
purposes. Notwithstanding this, the recovery of lo cal authority collected waste is 
therefore estimated to be around 92% over the plan period.

271 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.68  To manage these forecast arisings of waste, Northumberland has significant waste 
management capacity available through an existing and well -established network of 
facilities. Table 13.8 provides a summary of capacity by facility type in 
Northumberland and it is considered that the se provide sufficient capacity to manage 
the forecast arisings of waste for re -use, recycling and recovery when compared with 
the projected arisings. The forecasts of local authority collected waste (shown in 
Table 13.5) and commercial and industrial waste  arisings (shown in Table 13.6) 
indicate combined arisings of 449,000 tonnes by 2036. A combined 171,000 tonnes 
of waste for recycling would be produced in 2036, 42,000 tonnes of organic waste 
would be produced for recycling through composting, anaerobic d igestion or other 
biological treatment and a further 170,000 tonnes of residual waste would be 
produced for other recovery and treatment. Table 13.8 shows there is a materials 
recycling, sorting, transfer and recovery facilities capacity of 739,000 tonnes per 
annum to deal with these waste streams and 184,700 tonnes of organic waste 
recycling capacity. For the management of the residual element of the local authority 
collected waste stream, Northumberland is reliant on dedicated capacity outside of 
the Coun ty at an energy from waste facility on Teesside. The dedicated capacity 
available for Northumberland at this facility is 136,000 tonnes per annum and it is 
forecast that up to 123,000 tonnes of local authority collected waste from 
Northumberland would be m anaged at this facility by 2036. In terms of the hazardous 
waste stream, Northumberland is forecast to have arisings of 19,000 tonnes per 
annum by 2036 (Table 13.7). Due to the relatively small quantities of these wastes 
produced in Northumberland and the specialist nature of facilities needed to manage 
these wastes, there is currently a reliance on specialist facilities outside of the County 
for recycling, recovery and treatment and this is likely to continue during the plan 
period. The capacity included i n the recycling, sorting and transfer facilities category 
in Table 13.8 supports the sorting and processing of this waste stream before it is 
transported for further treatment outside of Northumberland although these wastes 
are often collected directly fro m the producer and transported straight to the recycler 
rather than passing through a transfer or materials recycling facility in 
Northumberland.

  13. Managing Natural Resources   
272  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.69  In terms of the capacity available to manage local authority collected waste, the 
facilities required as part of the municipal waste management contract for 
Northumberland have been constructed and are operational. These facilities have 
spare capacity to manage additional wastes volumes, which is in part, a 
consequence of arisings being lower than those forecast in the waste contract. This 
means that there are no issues with capacity in relation to the l evel of growth planned 
for in the Local Plan and therefore no need for additional facilities to be allocated in 
the Plan.  
 
13.70  The Municipal Waste Management Strategy identifies a long -term aspiration to 
provide household waste recovery centres to serve the Co quet valley, North Tyne 
valley and Amble areas, where access to facilities is currently poor due to the 
distances to the nearest facility. The Municipal Waste Management Strategy also 
identifies a need to replace the Seghill facility (which has now closed)  in the 
Cramlington area. Funding to deliver these facilities is unlikely to become available 
but it remains an aspiration to improve the provision of household waste recovery 
centres. This aspiration is about enhancing the network and improving access to 
these facilities rather than there being a deficit in available capacity to manage the 
waste generated.  
 
Cross boundary movements, proximity principle and net self -sufficiency  
 
13.71  In line with the self -sufficiency and proximity principles, the Local Plan seek s to 
provide a policy framework to ensure Northumberland has capacity to manage the 
quantum of waste arising in Northumberland and manage it as close to where it is 
generated as possible. This is reflected in the policy criteria in Policies WAS 1 and 
WAS 3 . Notwithstanding this, it is recognised that there are currently movements of 
waste both into and out of Northumberland and movements of this nature are likely to 
continue over the plan period due to these being outside of the direct control of the 
Local Plan. This is typically because of the nature of how waste management 
companies operate commercially and some facilities needing to operate over wider 
catchment areas in order to make them viable, particularly where some wastes are 
produced in small quanti ties in each waste planning authority area.  
 
13.72  As part of the contract to manage local authority collected waste from 
Northumberland, the element of the waste that is not sent for re -use, composting or 
recycling is transported to an energy from waste facilit y on Teesside to be burned 
and used to generate electricity. This is a strategic facility that manages waste from a 
number of the local authorities in North East England with one line at this facility 
being an asset of the Northumberland Waste Management P FI. This line has 
capacity to manage 136,000 tonnes of waste each year and it is forecast that up to 
123,000 tonnes of local authority collected waste from Northumberland would be 
managed at this facility by 2036. As a result there is the capacity at this facility to 
manage this element of waste from Northumberland during the plan period.  
 
13.73  In addition, there are a number of other cross boundary waste movements that occur 
as a result of commercial contracts to collect and manage waste generated beyond 
the wa ste planning authority area where the facilities are located. This includes some 
wastes that are exported from Northumberland for management because there are 
more specialist facilities that exist outside of the County that are able to manage 13. Managing Natural Resources   
273 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  these materia ls and which because of their specialist nature operate over large 
catchment areas that are sometimes at a national scale.  
 
13.74  Work has been undertaken in partnership with Durham County Council and four of 
the Tyne and Wear authorities to gather information on the generation of low level 
radioactive wastes in Northumberland. The study found that relatively low  volumes of 
such wastes are generated in Northumberland, particularly compared with the 
volumes generated nationally. As the majority of suc h material can be  managed 
alongside municipal, commercial and industrial waste the study  recommended that 
local provision of specialist facilities for this waste stream is not required. The low 
level of local arisings is also unlikely to reach a critical m ass upon which the 
development of specialist local facilities would be required.  
 
Provision for waste re -use, recycling and recovery capacity  
13.75  It is recognised that Northumberland already has a well -established and appropriately 
distributed network of wast e management facilities with significant capacity. These 
provide sufficient capacity to manage the forecast arisings of waste for re -use, 
recycling and recovery over the plan period. Given there are no deficits in the amount 
of capacity available it is not  considered to be appropriate to allocate specific sites for 
new or enhanced waste management facilities in the Local Plan. Notwithstanding 
this, Policy WAS 1 provides a degree of flexibility to allow new or enhanced waste 
management facilities to come for ward over the plan period. This will support the aim 
of continuing to move waste management up the waste hierarchy by, for example, 
allowing more materials to be separated and recovered and thereby improving 
recycling and recovery rates. Policy WAS 1 provi des policy criteria to guide the 
location of any future sites of this nature and it is not considered appropriate to 
allocate specific sites in the Local Plan due to significant uncertainty about whether 
proposals will come forward over the plan period.  
 
13.76  The policy for the provision of new or enhanced waste recycling and recovery 
facilities is to focus provision on Northumberland's Main Towns and Service Centres. 
These locations represent the principal sources of waste generation in the County, 
given the si ze of their populations, their critical mass of commercial and industrial 
activity and focus for new development. This approach provides opportunities for 
waste to be managed locally and close to the source of arisings, in line with the 
proximity principle  and the principle of self -sufficiency. Because o f a concentration of 
existing facilities and good transport links, including rail links, West Sleekburn area is  
recognised as a strategically important location for waste management.  
 
13.77  The development of wast e recycling and recovery facilities outside these locations, in 
smaller settlements, will generally be smaller -scale facilities (in a Northumberland 
context a small -scale facility is considered to have an annual capacity of less than 
10,000 tonnes), which will be supported where it can be demonstrated that they are 
located reasonably close to the source of the waste; and/or are to manage  waste 
arising in a local catchment; and the transport network is adequate to accommodate 
the proposed import and export o f material from the site.  
 
  13. Managing Natural Resources   
274  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.78  Reflecting the proximity principle and the principle of self -sufficiency, the policy also 
sets out a sequential approach to selecting sites with the on -site management of 
wastes and the co-location with existing uses preferred ahead of other locations and 
greenfield sites the least preferred location. The policy recognises that sites identified 
for employment uses in the plan will be suitable for new or enhanced waste 
management facilities where the design is compatible with its  location, is enclosed 
within a building, the proposal addresses any potential transport impacts and there 
are no unacceptable adverse effects on amenity or the natural and historic 
environment. The policy does not designate industrial estates in recogniti on that the 
individual industrial estates in Northumberland are not homogenous, which means a 
proposal may be acceptable on one part of a particular industrial estate but not 
acceptable on another part of the same estate depending on the type and 
character istics of the development proposals.  
 
13.79  On-farm locations will be most appropriate for the treatment of organic and 
agricultural wastes, including anaerobic digestion and composting. In addition, some 
waste management techniques, such as open windrow compost ing, can operate in 
an outdoor location and this is recognised in the policy.

b. The facility is fully contained within buildings or enclosed structures, unless it  
can be demonstrated  that any unacceptable  adverse  environmental  effects  
can be effectively mitigated and/or it is a f acility that genuinely requires an 
outdoor  location;  
 
c. The proposal is well related to the transport network and, where practical,

transport is  proposed  the applicant  shall demonstrate  that there  would  be no 
unacceptable  adverse effects on the surrounding highway network and 
infrastructure capacity, or such  effects  can be suitably  mitigated;  
 
d. The proposal helps to support a reduction in the distance waste is transported  
for management,  whilst  recognising  the economics  may mean  facilities  have  to 
operate  over large  catchments;  
 
e. The proposal  would  not result  in unacceptable  adverse  effects  on the natural  
or historic environment, sensitive receptors or residential amenity as a r esult of

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Waste  disposal  
 
13.80  In accordance with the waste hierarchy, waste disposal is viewed as the last option 
for managing waste. However, waste disposal will remain necessary over the plan 
period to manage waste which is not currently recyclable, including residues 
remaining after  recycling and recovery has occurred. The projections of the tonnages 
of residual wastes requiring disposal over the plan period are presented in Table 13.5 
and 13.6. The quantities of materials that will be required to be managed by means 
of disposal is e xpected to continue to reduce over the plan period through ongoing 
legislative, policy and fiscal drivers as well as increasing opportunities for the 
management of materials higher up the waste hierarchy.  
 
13.81  Landfill sites are split into three distinct categ ories: non -hazardous landfill, hazardous 
landfill and inert landfill. In Northumberland there is one non -hazardous landfill site at 
Ellington Road near Ashington. This site is recognised as a strategically important 
site for the disposal of residual waste arising in Northumberland, Newcastle and 
North Tyneside. The strategic role of this site will continue during the plan period due 
to its remaining capacity.  
 
13.82  The preferred approach for waste disposal is to seek to minimise the volumes of 
waste disposed in this way, maximise the levels of recycling and recovery and plan 
for a reducing amount of disposal. For non -hazardous landfill capacity, the preferred 
approach r ecognises the strategic role of the Ellington Road landfill site and sets 
criteria to assess pr oposals which come forward over the plan period. For inert waste 
disposal, the preferred policy approach is to maximise construction and demolition 
waste recycling and where this is not feasible to encourage the positive use of 
material for the restoration  of mineral extraction sites or for land reclamation and 
improvement schemes.  
 
13.83  The Ellington Road Landfill Site currently has planning permission for the tipping of 
waste until 2039. The remaining capacity at this site is sufficient to manage residual 
waste from Northumberland over the plan period but it is anticipated that the 
remaining permitted capacity will be utilised in the early part of the plan period based 
on the levels of current inputs to this site. As a result, proposals for additional waste 
disposal capacity could come forward over the plan period. Policy WAS 3 therefore 
includes policy criteria to guide and assess proposals.  
 
13.84  No new sites for waste disposal have been put forward for consideration during the 
preparation of the Local Plan. It is,  therefore, considered that the approach under 
Policy WAS 3 is the most appropriate one in this context and will help to support the 
role of landfill being minimised. Policy WAS 3 additionally recognises that there are 
potential opportunities to provide ad ditional capacity at the existing Ellington Road 
Landfill Site taking into account settlement rates on parts of the site where tipping has 
previously taken place and through the reprofiling of the final landform.

1. The strategy  for hazardous  and non-hazardous  waste  disposal  is to: 
 
a. Seek to minimise waste managed by landfill and maximise the use of  solutions  
higher  up the waste  hierarchy;  
 
b. Focus disposal and any further disposal capacity o ver the plan period at  
Ellington  Road  Landfill  Site. Alternative  locations  will be considered  where  it 
can demonstrated that these are more sustainable, particularly in terms  of 
their proximity to the main sources of waste arisings, their transport

c. The proposal would not result in the creation of excessive capacity which  
would lead to the unnecessary import of waste from outside Northumberland, 
whilst recognising that the economics and the specialist nature of some  
facilities  may mean  they operate  over larger  than local catchments;  
 
d. The proposal is well related to the tra nsport network and, where practical,

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Safeguarding  waste  management  facilities  
 
13.85  Waste management facilities are important elements of Northumberland's  
infrastructure and are crucial for the sustainable management of waste in line with 
the waste hierarchy. It is, therefore, important to safeguard them to ensure their 
continued availability and to avoid the capacity they provide being lost unnecessarily.  
 
13.86  The introduction of other types of development, suc h as housing and business uses 
that require a high quality local environment, in close proximity to waste management 
facilities can lead to conflict as a result of the potential effects on amenity arising from 
the operation of the facility.  
 
13.87  The Local Plan  will safeguard these facilities to ensure the need to maintain waste 
management infrastructure is considered during the determination of planning 
applications for development in their vicinity. Appendix G provides details on the 
waste management facilitie s to be safeguarded.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Introduction  to renewable  and low carbon  energy  
 
13.88  Increasing  the amount  of energy  from renewable  and low carbon  technologies  will 
help to ensure the UK has a secure energy supply, reduce greenhouse gas  
emissions  to slow down  climate  change  and stimulate  investment  in new jobs and 
businesses.  The planning  process  has an important  role in the delivery  of new 
renewable and low carbon energy infrastructure by supporting development in 
locations where the local environmental impact is acceptable.  
 
13.89  In Northumberland  there  is potential  to generate  renewable  energy  from a number  of 
sources,  such  as anaerobic  digestion,  biomass,  heat pumps,  hydro,  onshore  wind 
and solar.  
 
13.90  To help increase the use and supply of renewable  and low carbon  energy  and heat,  
the NPPF identifies that plans should provide a positive strategy for energy from  
these sources, that maximises the potential for suitable development, while ensuring 
that adverse  impacts  are addressed  satisfactorily  (including  cumulative  landscape  
and visual impacts)101. The Planning Practice Guidance recognises that whilst local 
autho rities should design their policies to maximise renewable and low carbon energy 
development, there is no quota which the Local Plan has to deliver and the need for 
renewable and low carbon energy does not automatically override environmental 
considerations , such as landscape, heritage and local amenity, and  the planning 
concerns of local communities102. The Local Plan and subsequent planning decisions 
therefore need to balance the generation of renewable and low carbon energy with 
the need to protect Northum berland's environment, communities and businesses 
from any adverse impacts associated with development.  
 
Renewable  and low carbon  energy  development  and associated  energy  storage  
 
13.91  Policy REN 1 is applicable to all renewable and low carbon energy developmen t 
(including anaerobic digestion, biomass, heat pumps, hydro, onshore wind and  solar 
photovoltaics) and energy  storage  associated  with renewable  and low carbon  energy 
developments. Additional policy requirements applicable to onshore wind  energy 
development are set out at Policy REN 2 in line with national policy and  guidance.  
 
13.92  Policy REN 1 sets out that renewable and low carbon energy proposals will be  
supported if applicants are able to demonstrate that its effects are acceptable or  can 
be made acceptable. The policy also supports proposals for energy storage,  where 
they are associated with an existing or proposed renewable or low carbon  energy 
development, if applicants can demonstrate that the effects are, or can be  made, 
acceptable. Polic y REN 1 includes criteria against which the acceptability  of 
proposed developments will be assessed, alongside other policies in the plan,  
especially those relating to landscape and the natural, built and historic environment. 
The criteria within the polic y seek to protect those environmental and cultural assets 
that are important to Northumberland, its communities, economy and visitors. The 
matters in the policy will be applicable to all relevant proposals but the level of  
information required in support o f a planning application will be proportionate to the 
 
101 National  Planning  Policy  Framework,  July 2021 , paragraph  155.

sensitivities of its location.  
 
13.93  It is recognised that energy production from some forms of renewable energy, wind 
and solar f or example, can fluctuate depending on the availability of the resource. 
Energy storage can increase their efficiency by storing excess energy during peak 
production and releasing it according to demand, thus creating a smoother supply 
and reducing the dem and on the rest of the electricity network. The technology and 
markets for energy storage are evolving but given the potential benefits Policy REN 1 
supports proposals where they are associated with a renewable and low carbon 
energy developments and the ef fects of the proposal are considered to be 
acceptable having regard to the policy criteria in Policy REN 1.  
 
13.94  All applicants need to consider the cumulative impacts arising from their proposal in 
combination with relevant existing developments, developments  with planning 
permission, and development proposals going through the planning application 
process. Policy REN  1 requires applicants to submit an assessment of cumulative 
impacts. Considerations should include the direct and indirect effects as well as 
temporary and permanent impacts.  
 
13.95  Most renewable and low carbon energy developments have a limited lifespan after 
which they will need to be decommissioned. By way of example, wind turbines have 
a typical lifespan of 25 years. It is, therefore, important tha t provision is made for 
decommissioning and the removal of temporary operations when they have ceased 
as part of the proposal and this is reflected in Policy REN 1. The planning 
permissions associated with these types of development are typically temporary  and 
planning conditions will be used to control the length of time that the operations are 
permitted and for decommissioning to take place.  
 
13.96  The NPPF advises Local Planning Authorities to consider identifying areas for 
renewable and low carbon energy deve lopment where this would help secure 
development of such resources. However, a criteria -based policy has been  
developed and is considered to be the most appropriate approach to help guide and 
assess proposals for renewable energy developments other than on shore wind 
energy development that may come forward over the plan period.  
 
13.97  To provide additional detail on Policy REN 1 and how the policy criteria apply to 
different renewable energy technologies, a supplementary planning document will be 
developed. It is  intended that this document will provide guidance on best practice 
and on how applicants would be expected to address the criteria in the policy in order 
to make successful planning applications.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Onshore  wind  energy  development  
 
13.98  Onshore wind energy is now an established and common technology for generating 
renewable  energy  in the UK. The availability  of this technology  for deployment,  the 
previous  availability  of financial  incentives  and the presence  of a wind resource  in 
Northumb erland has resulted in considerable development pressure for onshore  wind 
turbine  development  in the County  in recent  years.  Pressure for renewable energy 
development is unlikely to decrease as the battle against climate change intensifies 
to meet the government’s target for the UK to cut its carbon emissions to ‘net zero’ by 
2050.  
 
13.99  The NPPF  sets out that when  determining  planning  applications  for wind energy  
development involving one or more wind turbines, except for the repowering of  
existing wind tur bines, local planning authorities should not consider them to be  
acceptable  unless:  
• They are in an area identified  as suitable  for wind energy  development  in the 
development  plan;  and 
• Following  consultation,  it can be demonstrated  that the planning  impacts 
identified  by the affected  local community  have  been  fully addressed  and the 
proposal  has their backing.  
 
Potentially  suitable  areas  for onshore  wind  energy  development  
 
13.100  In line with the NPPF, the Planning Practice Guidance sets out that suitable areas for 
wind energy development will need to have been clearly identified in a Local Plan or 
Neighbourhood Plan. To understand whether it is appropriate to identify suitable 
areas in Northumberland an exercise was undertaken to map a number of identifiable 
environmental and planning constraints to wind turbine development103.  This 
included mapping constraints relating to residential amenity, physical  infrastructure,  
designations  relating  to nature  conservation,  geology  and the historic   environment,  
landscape  sensitivity,  natural  features,  Green  Belt and wind speed. Some other 
matters were not included in the mapping exercise due to technical or other 
limitations but all relevant considerations will be assessed and taken into account at 
the detailed planning application stage.  
 
13.101  Landscape sensitivity is an important consideration in assessing the impacts of 
proposals for wind energy development. Landscape sensitivity may be regarded as a 
measure of the resilience, or robustness, of a landscape to withstand specified 
change arising from the development types or land management practices, without 
undue negative effects on the landscape and visual baseline and their value104. It is 
based on a range of considerations including the physical nature of the landscape, 
visual, perceptual, qualitative, historic and cultural, and contextual considerations 
including the cumulative effects with othe r development. The mapping exercise 
referred to above was informed by a study105 that assessed the relative overall 
 
103 Further  details  of the mapping  exercise  can be found  in the accompanying  technical  paper  -

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  sensitivity of each of the Landscape Character Areas in Northumberland to wind 
energy development using the following five different wind tur bine typologies, which 
are based on their height of the turbine to the tip of the blade:  
• Under  25 metres;  
• 26 to 40 metres;  
• 41 to 65 metres;  
• 66 to 100 metres;  and 
• 101 to 135 metres.  
 
13.102  This study used as a baseline a Landscape Character Assessment undertaken in 
2010 that was informed by public consultation. For each landscape character area 
the assessment in the sensitivity study noted above, categorises the overall 
sensitivity to each of the five wind turbine typologies as either 'high', 'moderate -high', 
'mod erate', 'low -moderate' or 'low'. Where a character area was assessed as having 
a 'high' landscape sensitivity or a 'moderate -high' landscape sensitivity to a particular 
scale of wind turbine development, those areas are considered to be ‘unsuitable’ or 
‘unsuitable in principle’, respectively, to wind energy development and therefore a 
strategic constraint to development in policy terms. Where a landscape character 
area was assessed as a potential strategic constraint, it has been identified as such 
in the w ider mapping exercise. The mapping exercise also uses the wind turbine 
typologies above recognising that wind turbine height has a major influence on the 
scale and extent of effect, which, in turn, affects the potential suitability of areas for 
development . However, the use of turbine height is for the sake of simplification since 
landscape and visual impacts are not directly proportional to turbine height. All the 
factors  that underlie the nature of an effect including turbine numbers, design,  layout, 
ancillary infrastructure requirements such as grid numbers, design, layout, ancillary 
infrastructure requirements such as grid connections and access tracks, scale and 
cumulative impact are important considerations in wind turbine siting and design and 
will ne ed to be assessed on a case -by-case basis.  
 
13.103  Some other matters were excluded from the mapping exercise due to technical or 
other limitations . The result of the mapping exercise was the identification of areas 
where there are identified strategic constraints to wind energy development of the 
heights of turbine considered. Areas without identified constraints at this strategic 
scale are  considered to be potentially suitable for wind turbine development of the 
specified height and are shown on the Po licies Map. Potentially suitable areas are 
identified across relatively large parts of Northumberland for smaller wind turbines 
with a height of less than 25 metres and 26 to 40 metres in height.  However, at the 
strategic scale at which it is undertaken th e Council’s approach cannot be 
prescriptive at the level of individual sites as these are matters for detailed 
assessment and mitigation at a site specific level. These will be assessed at the 
planning application stage. The potentially suitable areas show n on the Policies Map 
maps do not purport to provide guidance on the acceptability of any particular  
proposal in any given location, but they provide a starting point for the consideration 
of individual proposals for wind energy development.  
 
13.104  The evidence shows that there are not any significant sized areas in the County 
without identifiable constraints to larger scale wind turbines (those over 40 metres in 
height in this context) and so it has not been possible to identify areas as potentially 
suitable in the Local Plan. Applications for turbines over 40 metres in height will 13. Managing Natural Resources   
285 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  therefore not be supported unless they involve proposals for repowering. Proposals 
for these larger scale wind turbines would therefore only potentially be permitted 
where it involves the repowering of existing wind turbines and where the impacts of 
such development, including cumulative effects, are considered acceptable. This 
provides a positive policy approach to smaller scale wind turbine development of the 
type that helps individua l homes and businesses meet their energy needs through 
decentralised, renewable energy. It also supports smaller scale community -led 
proposals of this nature that may come forward in Northumberland over the plan 
period.  
 
13.105  It is important to recognise that t he identification and mapping of areas potentially 
suitable for wind energy development is informed by evidence at a strategic  
landscape character area scale, across the whole of the local plan area. It is also 
recognised that landscape character, and thus  landscape sensitivity, does not 
change abruptly as there is usually a gradual transition from one area to another.  
 
13.106  The acceptability of individual proposals within an identified potentially suitable area 
will be subject to detailed assessment. This asse ssment will include consideration of 
those factors not included in the mapping exercise used to identify the potentially 
suitable areas and the effects at a local scale in accordance with the development 
plan, its evidence base and recognised guidance. The  identification of potentially 
suitable areas does not infer that any individual proposal would be acceptable if 
located within one of these areas. The policy criteria in Policy REN 1 and Policy REN 
2 will support this assessment and further information on  the assessment of 
individual proposals is provided below.  
 
13.107  Therefore, under Policy REN 2 if a proposal for a wind turbine is received outside of a 
Potentially Suitable Area, is over 40 metres in height and not for repowering or is not 
in an area identifie d in a neighbourhood plan then it will not be supported and 
planning permission would be refused by the Council. If a proposal is received within 
a Potentially Suitable Area, or for repowering, or within an area identified in a 
neighbourhood plan then the detailed considerations set out in Policies REN 1 and 
REN 2 will be used to assess its acceptability.  
 
Assessing  proposals  for onshore  wind  energy  development,  including  impacts  on 
affected  local  communities  
 
13.108  Policy REN 2 reflects the policy tests in the NPPF, including the requirement for new 
wind turbine development proposals, except in the case of proposals for repowering, 
to be located within an area identified as being potentially suitable for wind energy 
development and that following consultation, it can be demonstrated that the 
planning impacts identified by the affected local community have been fully 
addressed and the proposal has their backing.  
 
13.109  As described above, areas identified as potentially suit able for wind turbine 
development in Northumberland as shown on the Policies Map (and which may 
additionally be identified in Neighbourhood Plans) but whether they can successfully 
accommodate wind energy development will depend upon detailed assessment at  
the local scale. Being within a potentially suitable area is the first consideration for a 
proposal involving one or more wind turbines but the criteria in Policy REN 1 and 
Policy REN 2 must also be addressed as well as any other material considerations.  13. Managing Natural Resources   
286  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.

287 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  13.110  Applications for on -shore wind energy development will therefore be expected to 
demonstrate clearly how all criteria within Policies REN 1 and REN 2 (as applicable 
to a particular proposal) have been addressed and satisfied before planning 
permission can be granted. Particular importance will be applied to the assessment 
of local landscape effects as set out in Policy REN 2 (Part 2g, 2h, 2i, 2j and 2k). In 
meeting this expectation, applicants are expected to demonstrate how the proposals 
would relate to the landscape and visual sensitivities of the landscape character 
areas affected (including the host landscape and the wider area where approp riate), 
as identified within the wind energy landscape sensitivity study for Northumberland106 
used to inform the approach to wind energy development in the Local Plan. In doing 
so, landscape assessments supporting the application would be expected to descr ibe 
at the local level how the proposals would impact upon the specific physical, visual, 
perceptual, qualitative, historic and cultural and contextual sensitivities identified 
within the study in response to the specific proposals, and as appropriate, how  
impacts would be satisfactorily mitigated. This should take into consideration the 
supporting narrative for each landscape character area as well as the summary 
tables of sensitivity within the study’s landscape character area profiles. Cumulative 
effects  and effects on landscapes and views demonstrated to be of value at the local 
and community level must also be considered.  
 
13.111  The approach to engagement with the affected local communities and understanding 
their backing for onshore wind turbine proposals wi ll be in line with the relevant 
national planning policy and guidance in place at the time.  For wind turbine 
proposals involving more than two turbines or where the hub height of a wind turbine 
exceeds 15 metres there is a current requirement for the appl icant to undertake 
consultation with the local community prior to submitting a planning application107. 
However, it is good practice for all prospective applicants to undertake some pre -
application consultation and discuss the proposals with neighbours to h elp to 
establish the planning impacts identified by the affected local community and whether 
the proposal has their backing.   
 
13.112  The consultation exercise should demonstrate how the views of the local community 
have been determined and how their views have been taken into account. Prior to 
the consultation exercise being undertaken, the prospective applicant should prepare 
a consultation strategy that sets out the proposed approach to the consultation 
including methods and who will be consulted. The con sultation strategy should 
evolve through meaningful engagement with the Local Planning Authority and the 
relevant Town and Parish Councils on its scope and methodology. When undertaking 
pre-application consultation the prospective applicant will be expecte d to: 
• Publicise the proposal in such a way that would bring it to the attention of a 
majority of residents and businesses in the vicinity of the site that are most likely 
to be directly affected as well as the relevant Town and Parish Councils (i.e. 
those whose constituents include the most directly affected residents and 
businesses). This could involve contacting them by post with details of the 
proposal, how they can find out more about the proposal, and how they can 
provide comments.

288  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  • Provide the local co mmunity with suitable opportunities to view the proposals and 
contact the prospective applicant regarding the proposals. This could involve 
holding at least one consultation event to which the above parties are invited and 
making the relevant information a vailable electronically.  
• Provide sufficient time and information so that people wishing to provide 
comments may do so in an informed manner and within good time. This should 
include information about the potential impacts and the benefits of the proposals.  
• Undertake further consultation if there are significant changes to the proposal.  
 
13.113  If the applicant decides to proceed with an application for planning permission, the 
application should explain how the local community has been consulted prior to the 
appli cation being submitted and how regard has been had to any responses received 
in finalising the application. The planning application documentation should include 
raw and synopsis results of the pre -application consultation, including details of those 
consu lted with, and analysis of how any concerns expressed by the local community 
have been overcome in the proposals submitted. It is advised that applicants should 
only proceed with an application for planning permission where it can be clearly 
demonstrated t hat the proposal has the backing of the affected local community.  
 
13.114  Planning Practice Guidance is clear that whether a proposal has community backing 
is a planning judgement for the local planning authority108, so it will therefore be 
necessary for the local  planning authority to assess whether the balance of opinion in 
the affected local community is in favour of the proposal. In exercising this judgement 
it is not appropriate for the local planning authority to substitute its views for those of 
the local co mmunity.  
 
13.115  There will be a number of factors involved in ascertaining whether a residential 
dwelling or business is affected by a proposal for wind energy development with the 
scale (i.e. the height of turbine and number of turbines proposed) of the propose d 
development being important in understanding the geographical reach of any 
impacts.  
 
13.116  Community backing will be judged based upon the balance of views from the affected 
local community that have been evidenced at the pre -application stage and have 
been pr ovided to the local planning authority during the determination of the planning 
application. In assessing this, the emphasis will be on understanding the planning 
impacts on the affected local communities that would potentially be directly affected 
by the proposals in the vicinity of the proposal rather than the impacts on those who 
are more geographically distant. The views of the relevant Town and Parish Councils 
will be considered in judging the balance of views from the local community. In 
addition, the  relevant policies in a neighbourhood plan and whether they provide 
policy support to the proposal will be taken into account.  
 
13.117  When determining a planning application for wind energy development, the Council 
will clearly set out the concerns that have bee n expressed by the affected local 
community and how the application has overcome these or not. The Council will need 
to be able to conclude that the proposal has the backing of the relevant affected 
community. The Council will also be clear about how it ha s reached its conclusion on 
the judgement on whether the proposal has the backing of the affected local

satisfied that there is clear majority support within the relevant commu nity. 
 
13.118  As explained in paragraph 13. 97, a supplementary planning document on renewable 
energy will be prepared to provide guidance on how prospective applicants would be 
expected to address the requirements of Policy REN 1 and Policy REN 2 at the site 
specific level. This supplementary plannin g document will include guidance on best 
practice in relation to consultation with the local communities likely to be affected by 
proposals, including the scope and extent of the consultation exercise that will be 
appropriate for different types and scales  of wind energy development. It will also 
include guidance on how the affected local community should be identified and what 
information should be included in a planning application with regard to the pre -
application consultation undertaken. Some consultat ion has previously taken place 
on the scope of this supplementary planning document and work on the production of 
the document itself has commence d. 
 
13.119  Part 1 of Policy REN 2 reflects that the NPPF takes a different policy approach to the 
repowering of exist ing wind turbines109. Proposals for the repowering of wind turbines 
do not need to be located within an area identified as suitable for wind turbine 
development, or to demonstrate that the planning impacts identified by the affected 
local community have been fully addressed and that the proposal has their backing. 
Applications for the repowering of existing wind turbines will be assessed against the 
criteria in Policy REN 1 and Policy REN 2, and against other policies in the plan.  
 
13.120  One of the main concern s expressed with respect to proposals for the development 
of wind turbines in Northumberland through the planning application process has 
been in relation to their overall impact on the landscape of the County and beyond, 
which is recognised as an importan t asset to both residents and visitors. Onshore 
wind turbine development has been recognised as a potential significant force for 
change on the landscape of Northumberland and an independent study of the 
landscape and visual effects of the current operatio nal wind farms in Northumberland 
has been undertaken110. The conclusions of this study identify the importance of 
considering the effects on long and medium range views from and to iconic 
landscapes and heritage assets and the outlooks for heritage assets. This is 
recognised in Policy REN 2.  
 
13.121  Across Northumberland a significant amount of wind turbine development has either 
already taken place or been consented therefore cumulative effects are a key issue 
and this is a matter that will require careful conside ration. In considering cumulative 
effects, account should be taken of existing development, including development 
under construction; approved development awaiting implementation; and proposals 
submitted as planning applications awaiting determination.  
 
13.122  In relation to the decommissioning of the turbines and associated infrastructure and 
the restoration of the site once operations have ceased, details should be provided 
with the application in order to comply with Part 2 (f) of Policy REN 2. These 
requiremen ts would then be controlled through the use of relevant planning 
conditions.

Onshore  wind  energy  development  
 
1. Proposals for the development of one or more wind turbines, except for proposals 
for the repowering of existing wind turbines, will not be permitted unless:  
 
a. The development site is in an area identified as potentially suitable for wind 
energy development of the same scale as that proposed, as identified on the 
Local Plan Policies Map or in a Neighbourhood Plan; and  
 
b. Following consultation it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts 
identified by affected local communities have been fully addressed and the 
proposal has their backing.  
 
2. Where the criteria in Part 1 are met, or where proposals are for the repowering of 
existing wind turbines, proposals will be supported where the applicant can 
demonstrate that the planning impacts, both individually and cumulatively, are, or 
can be made, acceptable. The planning impacts will be assessed against the 
criteria in Policy REN 1 and the following criteria:  
 
a. There is sufficient separation from the proposed wind turbines to protect 
residential amenity as a result of noise, shadow flicker and visual intrusion. To 
protect visual amenity, there will be a presumption against devel opment within 
a distance of six times the turbine blade tip height of residential properties 
unless it can be demonstrated that the presence of turbines would not have an 
unacceptable impact upon living conditions;  
 
b. The proposals have addressed any potential adverse effects on the safety of 
aviation operations and navigational systems;  
 
c. Potential interference to television and/or radio reception and information and 
telecommunications systems will be avoided and/or mitigated;  
 
d. The proposed site access  arrangements and access routes will be suitable for 
the construction phase, including the delivery of turbine components and 
construction materials, the operational phase, and the decommissioning of the 
proposed wind farm;  
 
e. The proposed wind turbines are located appropriate distances from highways, 
and railway lines to provide a safe topple distance. A minimum topple distance 
of the turbine height plus 10% is recommended as a starting point;  
 
f. Provision has been made for the satisfactory decommissioning of the turbines 
and associated infrastructure once the operations have ceased and the site 
can be restored to a quality of at least its original condition;  
 
g. The proposal will not result in unacceptable harm to the character of the 
landscape or to landscape an d visual receptors;

without unacceptable negative effects on its character and qualities and how it 
is valued by communities likely to be affected;

viewpoints; and

and views from or to heritage assets where these are predominantly 
unaffected by harmful visual intrusion, taking into account the significance of 
the heritage asset and its setting.  14. Infrastructure  and Delivery   
292  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  14. Infrastructure  and Delivery  
 
Planning  for infrastructure  to support  sustainable  development  
 
14.1 Implementation of the Local Plan and its aspirations to  achieve sustainable 
development to maintain, enhance and grow communities across the County can 
only be achieved if growth can be supported by necessary infrastructure delivered in 
a timely manner. In the context of the planning system, infrastructure is defined 
generally in the Planning Act 2008 as meaning: roads and other transport facilities; 
flood defences; schools and other educational facilities; medical facilities; sporting 
and recreational facilities; and open spaces.  
 
14.2 The legislation confirms that  this is not an exhaustive list. There may be a range of 
other services and facilities of various types and scales that could constitute 
infrastructure that is needed to support the delivery of a particular development, or 
the implementation of policies in  the Local Plan.  
 
14.3 Infrastructure needed to support local communities, which may also be subject to 
controls exercised through the implementation of planning policy, can include those 
services and facilities provided through the open market to meet the day -to-day 
needs of communities. In the majority of circumstances the provision of such services 
and facilities will be left to the market and it would not normally be appropriate for 
intervention through the planning system. However, particularly in rural are as where 
national policy advocates support for a prosperous rural economy, provision exists for 
planning policy to promote the retention and development of local services in villages.  
 
14.4 This chapter sets out policies that:  
• seek to secure development related infrastructure which is reasonably   necessary  
to make  new development  sustainable;  
• guide other infrastructure planning and investment;   
• guard  against  the loss of important  infrastructure;  and 
• describe appropriate mechanisms for securing mitigation for the impact of 
development,  including  impacts  on infrastructure  provision.  
 
Infrastructure  Delivery  Plan  
 
14.5 The Council has been working collaboratively with a range of infrastructure providers, 
adjoining local authorities and other or ganisations to assess the quality and capacity 
of infrastructure across Northumberland, and the ability of that infrastructure to meet 
forecast demands arising from new development.  
 
14.6 Implementation of the Local Plan will depend on the provision, revision or 
improvement of infrastructure in a timely manner, particularly where any capacity 
constraints are identified. This in turn is reliant upon the coordinated activities and 
investment programmes of a number of agencies, organisations  and developer s. 
Preparation of the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) has been a mechanism for 
helping to define the infrastructure requirements needed to deliver the Local Plan. It 
is also one of the means by which the Council is seeking to enable and foster 
successfu l partnership working with those involved in the provision and management 14. Infrastructure  and Delivery   
293 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  of development related infrastructure. In creating an IDP, which supports the Local 
Plan, the Council has recorded known recent investment in infrastructure, and sought 
to define tha t infrastructure determined to be important in implementing the Local 
Plan.  
 
14.7 The IDP covers a range of types and scales of infrastructure and considers capacity 
and needs by reference to three general categories of infrastructure:  
• Social and community infr astructure including healthcare facilities,  community 
centres, places of worship, and sports and leisure facilities;   
• Physical infrastructure including transportation networks, energy supplies  and 
connections,  water,  drainage  and waste  provision,  and digital  and wireless  
communications  networks;  and 
• Green infrastructure which comprises the network of multi -functional open  and 
green  spaces,  including  formal  parks,  gardens,  sports  and playing  fields,  
woodland,  green  corridors,  waterways,  railways  and highway  verges.  
 
14.8 It should be noted that the IDP is a high level document, which is focused on the 
strategic infrastructure requirements of the County. It does not address all of the 
requirements of individual settlements, nor does it capture the invaluable n etwork of 
community led infrastructure, which is often at the heart of a community's sense of 
place and well -being. Such infrastructure is relevant in the determination of planning 
applications.  
 
14.9 Recognising that infrastructure investment planning is fluid and continually changing 
in light of varying priorities and the availability of funding, the IDP will be routinely 
reviewed and updated.  
 
 
 
Infrastructure  Delivery  Plan  commitments  
 
The Council will continue to work with organisations, agencies and developers, but 
also with local communities in the context of development proposals, and developing 
Neighbourhood Plans, to ensure that strategic and local infrastructure needs are 
considered and planned for properly.  
 
 
 
 
14. Infrastructure  and Delivery   
294  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Planning  and deliver ing infrastructure  
 
14.10  The Local Plan seeks to provide policies that describe and promote mechanisms 
available within the planning system for protecting and safeguarding against the loss 
of existing infrastructure, supporting the provision of additional infra structure that 
improves the health and well -being of communities and securing new infrastructure 
reasonably required to serve new development.  
 
 
Planning  and delivering  infrastructure  commitments  
 
Where  there  are known  infrastructure  capacity  constraints,  and infrastructure  
improvement opportunities, including those identified in the IDP, the Council will 
endeavour to work with partners to find solutions to ensure that development is 
delivered to meet the objectives and policies of the Local Pl an, thereby securing its 
implementation.  
 
The Council will also work with partners to promote shared use or joint delivery of 
infrastructure where this is appropriate.  
 
The Council will continue to explore the potential introduction of a Community 
Infrastr ucture Levy (CIL) and will pursue other infrastructure investment opportunities.  
 
 
 
Development  related  infrastructure  
 
14.11  New development will be expected to make best use of existing infrastructure where 
capacity exists to accommodate needs. Where improvements to existing 
infrastructure are required, new development will normally be expected to meet the 
costs of such infrastructure, along with providing any additional infrastructure 
requirements arising from the development.  
 
14.12  Policy INF 1 seeks to e nsure that such provision is secured at the time planning 
permission is granted and that all necessary infrastructure is provided and phased as 
appropriate, to serve development when it is needed. This will necessitate submitting 
suitable evidence in suppo rt of planning applications, which accounts for the IDP, the 
relevant business plans and programmes of infrastructure and service providers, and 
any local infrastructure issues, outwith the scope of the IDP. Evidence should 
demonstrate that existing or pla nned infrastructure is sufficient and sustainable over 
time both in functional and financial terms. In assessing proposals, the Council will 
also have regard to the cumulative impacts of development in the vicinity, across the 
County, and where relevant ac ross its borders, on infrastructure requirements.  
 
14.13  The provision or improvement of infrastructure needed to support development will 
usually be secured through the use of planning conditions attached to a planning 
permission or by planning obligation where the use of planning conditions is not 
appropriate. In the future infrastructure may also be secured via the Community 
Infrastructure Levy or any such similar tariff, pending any changes at a national level 
to the charging regime.  14. Infrastructure  and Delivery

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)   
Policy  INF 1 
 
Delivering  development  related  infrastructure  (Strategic  Policy)  
 
1. To ensure that development is acceptable in planning terms, and unacceptable 
impacts are properly mitigated, proposals must demonstrate that there is sufficient 
appropriate physical, community, social and green infrastructure capacity, both on 
and off -site, to support the needs arising from the development.  
 
2. Where infrastructure necessary to serve new development is not available, or 
where existing infrastructure requires imp rovement due to capacity or other 
constraints associated with the impact of that development, planning permission 
will only be granted where suitable enforceable measures are put in place to 
secure the provision and maintenance of that new or improved infr astructure in a 
timely manner, when it is required, in order to serve the development.  
 
 
 
Community  facilities  and services  
 
14.14  Having regard to national policy and guidance, the Local Plan seeks to support the 
provision of new and enhanced community infrastr ucture and to guard against the 
unnecessary loss of valued facilities and services, particularly where this would 
reduce the ability of local communities in Northumberland to meet their day -to-day 
needs.  
 
14.15  Given the important role of community infrastructure in supporting growing  
sustainable communities the Local Plan sets out the requirement for new  
development  to provide,  or make  reasonable  and necessary  contributions  towards  
the provision of, community facilities as part of the development. Such provision  
would  be required  through  Policy  INF 1. 
 
14.16  Separately, Policy INF 2 seeks to ensure  important  and valued  community  facilities  
that provide for the health and well -being, social, educational, spiritual, recreational, 
leisure and cu ltural needs of the community are protected and not lost to  
development unless it can be demonstrated that there is no longer need for the  
facility. It also supports the improvement of existing facilities and the provision of  new 
facilities,  particularly  where this would  address  deficiencies  in provision.  
 
Healthcare,  education  and leisure  services  
 
14.17  The provision of healthcare, education and leisure services are all essential 
community services requiring a range of facilities and built infrastructure.  
 
14.18  Area s of constrained capacity have been identified through joint working with service 
providers and representatives and are detailed in the IDP. There are areas where 
investment is likely to be necessary to ensure that development is adequately 
supported by su ch infrastructure, and can be made acceptable in planning terms. 
However, these should not be considered an exhaustive list. Providers, including 14. Infrastructure  and Delivery   
296  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  healthcare and education providers, may need to be consulted on planning 
applications to consider specific and  cumulative needs associated with development.  
 
14.19  The delivery of these types of infrastructure has seen significant changes over recent 
years, particularly through reorganisation and rationalisation of services. Notably, 
health infrastructure and care arrangements have evolved, with new larger GP 
practic es providing a wider range of primary and community care services. There 
have also been some key developments, including the Northumbria Specialist 
Emergency Care Hospital at Cramlington. School partnerships have similarly been 
subject to significant reorg anisation around the County, including moves from three 
tier provision of education to a two tier primary and secondary school system. Council 
provided leisure facilities have meanwhile been increasingly merged, through the 
development of new combined leis ure, library and customer contact facilities. 
Changes are expected to continue throughout the Local Plan period.

Community  services  and facilities  
 
1. The loss of community services and facilities, that provide for the health and  
wellbeing, social, educational, spiritual, recreational, leisure or cultural needs of 
the community will not be supported unless:  
 
a. appropriate alternative provision is made; or  
 
b. suitable and sufficient evidence can be provided to demonstrate that there is 
no longer a need for the facility to serve the community in its existing use or as 
an alternative community use; and  
 
c. suitable and sufficient evidence can be provided to demonstrate that its 
continued current use is no longer economically viable.  
 
2. Improvem ent in the quantity, quality, accessibility and range of community 
services and facilities, and the provision of new services and facilities where these 
will meet an identified need will be supported, subject to conformity with policies 
elsewhere in the Lo cal Plan, and any made neighbourhood plans, which seek to 
ensure any significant adverse effects on the environment, habitats, heritage 
assets and local amenity can be avoided through good design and siting of 
development or that those effects can be suita bly compensated for or mitigated.  
 
3. Where opportunities arise through new built development and changes of use, the 
shared use of facilities, including community use of educational facilities  where 
appropriate, will be supported and secured through planning conditions or 
planning obligations as appropriate.  14. Infrastructure  and Delivery   
297 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Local  village  convenience  shops  and public  houses  
 
14.20  Infrastructure needed to support local communities includes those services and  
facilities provided through the open market to meet the day -to-day needs of  
communities. Meeting those needs can be particularly challenging in more rural  
areas of Northumberland. National policy and guidance recognises that the planning 
system has a role to play in supportin g rural communities in particular by  
safeguarding and promoting the retention and development of local services in  
villages.  
 
14.21  In addition to supporting other community infrastructure, national planning policy  also 
promotes the retention of local shops and public houses. This is a matter of particular 
significance to communities in Northumberland where local village shops and pubs 
are at the heart of the community providing for people's day -to-day needs. The Local 
Plan therefore seeks to address this issue i n addition to matters concerning other 
physical, community and green infrastructure. Policy INF 3  creates the planning 
policy framework to ensure all available measures are taken to prevent the loss of 
valued  local village  shops  and public  houses.  
 
 
 
Policy INF 3 
 
Local  village  convenience  shops  and public  houses  
 
1. Proposals  that result  in the loss through  demolition,  redevelopment  or change  of 
use of local convenience shops and public houses in villages will not be  supported  
unless  it can be demonstrated  that: 
 
a. equivalent  accessible  provision  is available  locally;  or 
 
b. the continued  use of the shop  or public  house  for its current  use is no longer  
needed  to meet  community  needs;  or 
 
c. the continued  use of the shop  or public  house  for its current  use is no longer  
economically  viable.  
 
2. In applying  the tests  established  in this policy  regarding  the need  for, or viability  of 
the continued  use of the building  for its community  use it will be necessary  to 
demonstrate, with sufficient documentary evidence, to the satisfaction of the  Local 
Planning Authority that the building has been marketed at a price reflecting its 
current or last use for a period of not less than six months prior to the date  of 
submission of any planning application  for its demolition, redevelopment or  change 
of use, and that no reasonable offers have been received to continue  the current  
use of the building.  14. Infrastructure  and Delivery   
298  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Assets  of Community  Value  
 
14.22  Many communities across Northumberland have buildings and land that are valuable 
to them. It is recognised that buildings and land that accommodate community 
facilities often compete with other uses which can command a higher land value and 
are therefore subject to development pressures. This can pu t existing facilities under 
pressure and it is therefore necessary to have mechanisms to ensure that 
appropriate weight is given to the need to protect such community assets from loss 
when they are placed under threat. Guarding against the loss of such val ued 
community assets is a matter advocated through national policy and guidance.  
 
14.23  The Localism Act 2011 gives local communities the right to identify and protect 
facilities that are important to them from immediate disposal through local listing 
associated  with the Community Right to Bid process. Buildings, land or services 
included in the list are called ‘Assets of Community Value ’. Confirmation of listing of 
such assets introduces a moratorium on the disposal of listed land and buildings for a 
defined per iod of time. However, while the process allows community organisations 
the opportunity to bid to buy listed assets, there is no obligation on owners to sell 
their asset to a community organisation, and ultimately no control exists over who 
may take ownersh ip. 
 
14.24  The impact of any development proposal on a registered Asset of Community Value 
is a recognised material planning consideration. The purpose of Policy INF 4 is to 
ensure that, notwithstanding ownership, assets registered as being of particular value 
to local communities are safeguarded through the planning system to prevent their 
loss through demolition or redevelopment, or a change of use arising, unless steps 
are taken to demonstrate that there is no longer a need for the services provided by 
the ass et, or that their continued use is no longer viable. In fulfilling this requirement 
to demonstrate any lack of need, or that provision or retention of the asset is no 
longer viable, applicants will be required to provide sufficient reliable and verifiable 
documentary evidence showing that the asset has genuinely been made available on 
the open market at a price that reflects its current or last use providing community 
benefits for a reasonable period of time which should be not less than six months 
prior to  seeking planning permission for development.  
 
14.25  For the purpose of interpreting what constitutes a valued community facility in relation 
to Policy INF 4, only buildings listed as an Asset of Community Value in accordance 
with provisions created in the Local ism Act will be covered. The policy sets out how 
applications for demolition, redevelopment or change of use of Assets of Community 
Value will be assessed.

a. alternative equivalent provision of the services and facilities provided by the 
asset is secured to meet community needs; or  
 
b. it can be demonstrated that the continued use of the asset for its current use is 
no longer needed to meet community needs; or  
 
c. it can be demonstrated that the continued use of the asset for its current use is 
no longer  viable.

with sufficient documentary evidence, that the asset has been marketed at a price 
reflecting its current or last use as a registered Asset of Community Value for a 
period of not less than six months prior to the date of submission of any planning 
application for its demolition, redevelopment or change of use, and that no 
reasonable offers have been received to continue the current or last use of  the 
asset.  
 
 
 
 
Protection, provision and maintenance of open space, sport and recreation   
 
14.26  Good quality open spaces, sport and recreation (including amenity green space, 
natural and semi natural green space, parks and gardens, provision for children and 
young people including play facilities, and outdoor sports facilities) provide important 
benefits for communities. Among the many valuable roles of open spaces and sport 
and recreation provision are helping to promote social inclusion, engendering 
communit y cohesion, and improving health and well -being. Many open spaces also 
make an important contribution to the character and appearance of the built and 
natural environment and are important for biodiversity, including in the context of 
green networks. As such they are often an integral part of our towns and villages 
throughout Northumberland. Ensuring the protection, provision improvement and 
maintenance of open space, and provision for sport and recreation is, therefore, an 
important planning  consideration. It is appropriate to guard against the loss of 
existing valued open space, sport and recreation buildings and land and secure new 
provision and improvements to meet the needs of existing and future communities.  
 
14.27  Town and Parish Councils pro vide, manage and maintain many outdoor assets 
including children’s play areas; and in some cases they manage some larger outdoor 
facilities, such as playing fields, parks and cemeteries.  For this reason Town and 
Parish Councils are an important stakeholde r and the Council will ensure structured 
engagement and their close involvement, where appropriate, in decisions concerning 
the provision, maintenance and improvement of open space and facilities that affect 
their areas, including that provided to serve ne w development.  14. Infrastructure  and Delivery   
300  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Identifying current provision and future needs  
 
14.28  The Council's open space, sport and recreation studies111 provide assessments of 
the quantity, quality, accessibility and functionality of open space, sport and 
recreation buildings and land, across the County. These studies provide the basis for 
the designation of areas to be protected through the Local Plan. T hey have also 
underpinned standards of provision for new development, and will (alongside the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and other investment strategies) inform how developer 
contributions are prioritised and spent.  
 
Protecting open space, sports and rec reation provision  
 
14.29  National policy requires that we should guard against the loss of valued community 
facilities; and that existing open space, sports and recreational buildings and land, 
including playing fields, should not be built on.  National policy p rovides for only three 
exceptions to this clear instruction. These are that:  
a. an assessment has been undertaken which has clearly shown the open space, 
buildings or land to be surplus to requirements; or  
b. the loss resulting from the proposed development wo uld be replaced by 
equivalent or better provision in terms of quantity and quality in a suitable 
location; or  
c. the development is for alternative sports and recreational provision, the benefits 
of which clearly outweigh the loss of the current or former us e. 
 
14.30  The principle that open space should not be built upon underpins the Council’s 
approach to the protection of open space, including land used for sport and 
recreation, through Policy INF 5.  All of the open space designated for protection in 
the Local P lan sits within a recognised open space typology and serves at least one 
of the recognised functions of open space.  
 
14.31  These spaces are defined on the Policies Map. In addition to the designated open 
spaces there are remaining open spaces, sports and recrea tional land and buildings 
which fall outwith the defined typologies (for example, indoor sports facilities, historic 
sites, larger designated sites such as the County’s national nature reserves, Kielder 
Water or Kielder Forest, and some small incidental sp aces amongst housing). In 
accordance with national policy, there is a presumption that all existing open spaces, 
sports and recreational buildings and land should not be lost.  
 
14.32  The Council recognises, however, that there may be limited exceptional 
circums tances where the loss of open space, sports and recreational buildings and 
land is appropriate. Where the loss of open space, sport and recreational buildings or 
land is to result in the replacement of provision to an equivalent or better standard, or 
the development is for alternative sports and recreation provision (with benefits 
outweighing loss) a case must be put forward to demonstrate the benefits. In any 
other instance an independent assessment must be submitted alongside any 
planning application whi ch appraises, with equal weight, the quantity, quality, 
accessibility and functionality of open space, sports and recreation in the immediate 
locality. This must focus on the particular type of open space, building or land 
proposed to be lost. It must also  focus on the alternative provision within the

and then the wider Parish / Ward. It must also involve demonstrably meaningful 
engagement with the local community, to understand how the open space, building 
or land is used and valued by the community, and the implications of its loss.   
 
14.33  Playing fields are recognised as a crucially important resource for sport. Any 
application for development affecting a playing field will be subject to consultation 
with Sport England. Sport England has a Playing Fields Policy in place to help it 
assess su ch applications. The Council’s Playing Pitches Strategy and its Sport 
Facilities Strategy will also be used to help the assessment of planning applications 
which affect these facilities.  
 
14.34  The Council also recognises that the development of facilities on o pen space, such 
as changing facilities or sports pavilions, may enhance their use.  Where facilities are 
proposed on open space which are ancillary to the main use, these will be supported, 
subject to the criteria in Policy INF 5.  
 
Local Green Space  
 
14.35  The concept of local communities being able to protect green areas of particular local 
significance was first introduced into the planning system through the National 
Planning Policy Framework in 2012 which created the specific designation of 'Local 
Green Spa ce'. The intention of this designation is to provide locally important green 
areas a level of protection consistent with that given to the Green Belt, thereby 
preventing development other than in very special circumstances.  
 
14.36  Local Green Space may only be designated through policy created in a 
neighbourhood plan or a local plan, and it must be capable of enduring beyond the 
end of the plan period. National policy describes the circumstance in which it may be 
appropriate to use this designation which is limi ted to where the green space is: in 
reasonably close proximity to the community it serves; demonstrably special to a 
local community and holds a particular local significance, for example because of its 
beauty, historic significance, recreational value (in cluding as a playing field), 
tranquillity or richness of its wildlife; and local in character and is not an extensive 
tract of land.  
 
14.37  Many of the Town and Parish Councils across Northumberland involved in preparing 
neighbourhood plans have investigated th e opportunities presented by this potential 
designation. Most of the neighbourhood plans made to date have designated at least 
one area of Local Green Space. Whilst the opportunity to create Local Green Space 
through the Local Plan exists, the County Counc il considers that, given the need to 
show that any such designation is demonstrably special to a local community, the 
most appropriate mechanism for designating Local Green Space is at the parish or 
neighbourhood level through a neighbourhood plan. It is t herefore not proposed to 
designate any Local Green Space in the Northumberland Local Plan. The County 
Council will continue to advise and support Town and Parish Councils across 
Northumberland who are preparing neighbourhood plans and will support the 
designation of Local Green Space through those plans where it meets the tests 
established in national policy.

302  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  New and improved open space and provision for children and young people  
 
14.38  The Council recognises that new development creates new demands for additi onal 
open space and provision for children and young people and/or improvements to the 
quality, accessibility and functionality of existing open space and provision for 
children and young people.  The Local Plan therefore requires new development to 
be ade quately served by open space and provision for children and young people.  
This can involve direct provision both on and off site; or financial contributions to 
support provision off site; or financial contributions for improvement of existing open 
space a nd facilities; or a combination of each of these approaches.  The need for 
maintenance and the repair and replacement, as necessary, of facilities and 
associated infrastructure over a reasonable period of time must also be recognised 
and secured.  This wil l normally be achieved through planning obligations.  
 
14.39  The requirements for open space and provision for children and young people to 
serve new housing development will be determined in accordance with standards for 
provision established at Appendix H1 whic h supports the implementation of Policy 
INF 5. These standards have been set in such a way to meet the needs of 
communities whilst also being realistic and deliverable.  
 
 
 
Commitment to new assessment  
 
14.40  In order to provide a consistent approach to open space across the County, the 
areas allocated as Protected Open Space in the Local Plan, are those identified as 
falling within various typologies within the Northumberland PPG17 Open Space, 
Sport, and Recreation Assessment (2011). While the Council underto ok a partial 
update in 2018, it is recognised that the 2011 assessment is somewhat dated.  
 
14.41  Therefore, the Council commits to carry out a new assessment of open space, sport, 
and recreation facilities, and to subsequently undertake an early and partial upda te of 
the Plan in so far as it relates to open space, sport and recreation and sites allocated 
as Protected Open Space. Work on the new assessment will start immediately, with 
the update to the plan in relation to open space, sport and recreation facilitie s 
submitted within 18 months of the adoption date of this Local Plan, in accordance 
with the LDS.

where appropriate, in accordance with standards set out in Appendix H1.  
 
6. Where appropriate, agreement on community use of new and existing open 
spaces, sports and recreational land and buildings, where this is associated with 
the need to provide or improv e facilities arising from proposed residential 
development, will be secured by means of a planning obligation.  
 
7. The Council commits to undertake an early and partial update of the Plan in so far 
as it relates to open space, sport and recreation and sites allocated as Protected 
Open Space, with the update submitted within 18 months of the adoption date of 
this Local Plan.  
 
 
 
Planning  obligations  and viability  
 
14.42  The Council will attach planning conditions to a planning permission where these can 
enhance the quality of development and or mitigate the adverse effects of 
development which would otherwise make it necessary to refuse planning 
permission.  
 
14.43  In addition to the use of planning conditions, where it is appropriate, the Council will 
seek to e nter into planning obligations to prescribe, compensate, and/or mitigate the 
impacts of a development. Planning obligations will only be used where they meet 
the relevant statutory tests which require that they are necessary to make the 
development accepta ble in planning terms, directly related to the development, and 
fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind. Policy INF6 identifies the measures 
that may be required.  
 
14.44  Planning obligations will also be sought to secure ongoing management and 
maintenanc e arrangements where necessary.  
 
14.45  Appendices H -H4 provide further information on planning obligations and detailed 
guidance in respect of planning obligations for open space and provision for children 
and young people; education; healthcare and the Coastal Mitigation Service. 
Appendix D provides detailed guidance on how the Council will calculate planning 
obligations for off -site affordable housing provision. The Council will provide further 
detailed guidance in relation to affordable housing, and open space  and provision for 
children and young people through a Supplementary Planning Document or 
Documents, to support policies in the Local Plan .

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Development  viability  
 
14.46  The Local  Plan is supported  by a Whole  Plan Viability  Assessment112. The 
Assessment  has ensured  that all anticipated  development  related  costs,  including  
those associated with planning policies in the development plan, have been 
accounted for. The local and national planning policy requirements have been found 
to be realistic, both individual ly and collectively, and accordingly do not undermine 
the delivery of the Local Plan. The Assessment also considers the scope for 
additional requirements, notably the potential future introduction of a Community 
Infrastructure Levy  (CIL) . 
 
14.47  Development prop osals which are fully compliant with the Local Plan are assumed to 
be viable on the basis of the Assessment and its associated evidence. It is up an 
applicant to demonstrate whether particular circumstances justify the need for a 
viability assessment at th e planning application stage. The Council considers i t likely  
that applications for development of 300 dwellings or more will also be subject to 
viability assessment, at the planning application stage, unless they are fully policy 
compliant. This is in rec ognition of the different dynamics of sites of 300 dwellings or 
more, which could involve multiple housebuilders and, or different requirements in 
terms of infrastructure needs.  
 
14.48  Where a viability assessment is submitted to accompany a planning application  the 
assessment should follow the approach as set out in national Planning Practice 
Guidance including standardised inputs, and should be made publicly available. The 
assessment should also be based upon, and refer back to the Local Plan and CIL 
Viability Assessment and Addendum Reports, accounting for any site specific issues 
and, or changes in circumstances since that Assessment. The viability assessment of 
any such application will be independently verified by the Council, at the expense of 
the applicant . The weight to be given to any such viability assessment is a matter for 
the Council as the decision maker, having regard to all the circumstances in the case. 
Following the review of an independently verified viability assessment, if the Council 
is satis fied that there are overriding viability issues which prevent full compliance with 
policy requirements, the Council may grant planning permission subject to revised 
requirements, which should still ensure the mitigation of adverse effects of 
development.  
 
14.49  Where development is permitted which does not fully comply with policy 
requirements on the grounds of viability, periodic review mechanisms will be used, 
via legal agreement ensuring that, where viability improves over the course of 
development or after planning permission is granted, the fullest possible compliance 
with the Local Plan is secured.

Planning  obligations  
 
1. Where it is not possible to address any unacceptable impacts of development 
through the use of planning conditions, planning obligations will be secured to 
ensure that otherwise unacceptable development can be made acceptable.  
 
2. Planning obligations will be used, as necessary, to ensure that development meets 
relevant planning policy requirements set  out in the Local Plan and any made 
neighbourhood plans.  
 
3. Planning obligations will only be sought where they meet all of the following tests 
which require that they are:  
 
a. necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;  
b. directly related to  the development; and  
c. fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.  
 
4. Planning obligations may be used to secure the timely provision, and/or 
improvement and maintenance of any physical, social, community and green 
infrastructure and/o r any mitigation and/or compensatory measures reasonably 
necessary to make a development acceptable in planning terms. This may include 
all or any of the following and any other reasonable measures that meet statutory 
requirements:  
 
a. Affordable  housing (See Appendix D);  
b. Accessibility and Adaptability Standards;  
c. Measures  to address  highways,  traffic  and transportation  impacts;

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Future infrastructure funding opportunities   
 
Community  Infrastructure  Levy  
 
14.50  The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is a fixed rate tariff, charged per square  
metre  of new development.  CIL can be used  to fund a wide range  of infrastructure  
required to support development across the local authority area. It is not constrained 
in the way planning obligations that secure funding are limited by reference to a  
specific  development.  
 
14.51  CIL was devised and introduced into legislation in 2010 to impl ement successive 
government’s intentions to ensure that development contributes at least a reasonable 
proportion of funding towards of the cost of infrastructure needed to support  
implementation of Local Plans. In addition, legislation allows local communi ties to 
benefit directly from a share of any CIL charge received since a proportion of the 
Levy must be given to Town and Parish Councils in those locations where 
development occurs. That proportion increases in locations where a neighbourhood 
plan has bee n made.  
 
14.52  The Levy is viewed by the Council as a positive tool which could help support the  
delivery  of the Local  Plan and more  particularly  unlock  opportunities  for growth  by 
helping to fund infrastructure required to support sustainable development. It ca n 
offer a fair, fast and transparent system for developers by giving certainty about  
development  costs.  
 
14.53  The Infrastructure Delivery Plan identifies, where known, the funding required to  
deliver  certain  infrastructure  projects  including  those  necessary  to secure  
implementation of the Local Plan. Notwithstanding the projects and investments for 
which costs and likely available funding sources are unknown, it is apparent that 
there is a shortfall between the funding required to deliver infrastructure and t hat 
which is available, generally referred to as a 'funding gap'. It is a prerequisite to the 
introduction of CIL that a funding gap can be demonstrated.  
 
14.54  A provisional appraisal on the  possibility of introducing CIL has been included in the 
Whole Plan Viability  Assessment that supports the Local Plan. The Council will 
continue to investigate  the viability and benefit of introducing CIL and would 
anticipate progressing with  this matter  following  adoption  of the Local  Plan.  Should a 
CIL charge be introduc ed in Northumberland, it will not replace planning obligation 
agreements. In broad terms developer contributions secured via planning obligation 
agreements will continue to be used for site specific infrastructure and mitigation 
measures, while CIL would b e implemented to address the broader impacts of 
development. In any instance the Council will ensure that the funding requirements of 
developer contribution agreements are distinct from and would not duplicate any CIL.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Monitoring  
 
14.55  The Council is co mmitted to ensuring robust monitoring of the implementation of the 
Local Plan. The aim will be to ensure the successful and timely delivery of the plan 
and to instigate appropriate actions or measures to address any ineffective policies 
and proposals.  
 
14.56  The Local Plan has been devised in such a way to be flexible over the plan period. It 
can adjust to changes such as, the emergence of new neighbourhood plans, shifting 
demographics and variable economic conditions. However, there may be 
circumstances or unexp ected external factors that render certain policies less 
effective or out of date. Monitoring will help identify any such issues and appropriate 
actions. Actions could include adjusting the implementation of the policies or a partial 
or full review of the Local Plan or other supporting plans.  
 
Monitoring  and evaluation  implementation  framework  
 
14.57  A Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation Framework has been developed which 
identifies indicators and targets for the implementation of the Local Plan as a whole 
and to measure the implementation of specific policies. It also identifies triggers at 
which it is appropriate to address any issues emerging.  
 
14.58  The framework optimises the use of other monitoring systems the Local Planning 
Authority has such as planning application monitoring. It also seeks to make use of 
other Council departments and other organisations monitoring systems.  
 
14.59  The Council, in line with national policy, will review the policies in the Plan to assess 
whether they need updating at least on ce every five years and the policies will be 
updated as necessary.  
 Glossary   
309 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Glossary  
 
Active Ageing, principles of: Refers to the idea of a longer active life, including in work 
and recreational activities, as well as the opportunity to remain  in the same dwelling for 
longer.  
 
Active Frontage: Refers to street frontages where there is an active visual engagement 
between those in the street and internal areas of buildings facing the street, particularly at 
ground floor level where there are more public or lively activities, such as shop window 
displays or sales counters.  
 
Active street frontage: The high street frontage of a building that presents a window 
display, at least during opening hours, and an entrance way, and less than 25% blank wa ll. 
 
Affordable housing: (refer to the NPPF for the latest official definition)  
Housing  for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the market (including 
housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is for essential local 
workers); and which complies with one or more of the following definitions:  
a. Affordable ho using for rent:  meets all of the following conditions:  
(a) the rent is set in accordance with the Government’s rent policy for Social Rent or 
Affordable Rent, or is at least 20% below local market rents (including service 
charges where applicable);  
(b) the landlo rd is a registered provider, except where it is included as part of a Build  to 
Rent scheme (in which case the landlord need not be a registered provider); and  
(c) it includes provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households, 
or for th e subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.  
For Build to Rent schemes affordable housing for rent is expected to be the normal form 
of affordable housing provision (and, in this context, is known as Affordable Private 
Rent).  
b. Starter homes:  is as specified in Sections 2 and 3 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 
and any secondary legislation made under these sections. The definition of a starter 
home should reflect the meaning set out in statute and any such secondary legislation at 
the time of plan -preparation or decision -making. Where secondary legislation has the 
effect of limiting a household’s eligibility to purchase a starter home to those with a 
particular maximum level of household income, those restrictions should be used.  
c. Discounted market sales housing:  is that sold at a discount of at least 20% below local 
market value. Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local house 
prices. Provisions should be in place to ensure housing remains at a discount for future 
eligible households.  
d. Other affordable routes to home ownership:  is housing provided for sale that provides 
a route to ownership for those who could not achieve home ownership through the 
market. It includes shared ownership, relevant equity loans, o ther low cost homes for 
sale (at a price equivalent to at least 20% below local market value) and rent to buy 
(which includes a period of intermediate rent). Where public grant funding is provided, 
there should be provisions for the homes to remain at an a ffordable price for future 
eligible households, or for any receipts to be recycled for alternative affordable housing 
provision, or refunded to Government or the relevant authority specified in the funding 
agreement.  Glossary

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Wider employment -generating uses: Land uses generating permanent on -site 
employment:  
• May include certain 'non -residential institution' uses, where the scale or nature of the 
operation, or lack of  the need for regular public access would make a location in a town 
centre or central to where people live less necessary. Examples might include training 
facilities of various sorts (Class F.1), or some Class E uses that are not in the main 
employment use s category, such as some trade counter retail operations or leisure 
businesses that are not suited to town centres, creches that serve people working in the 
employment areas themselves or types of health clinics that provide for specialised 
needs and are o nly occasionally visited;  
• May include sui generis uses which typically operate from employment sites such car 
garages, taxi firms, or home recycling centres  
• Unless in a town centre location, they will exclude retail or leisure uses that fall within 
the cat egory of main town centre uses; retail use can sometimes form an ancillary part 
of an employment proposal - e.g. a factory shop - which may be acceptable subject to 
other considerations such as access and parking - see Policy ECN 9);  
• They would not include any of the C -Class residential -type uses.

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Housing Trajectory  Notes:  
 
The Local Plan Housing Trajectories set out housebuilding since the start of the plan period 
(1 April 2016) and forecasts future delivery over the plan period (up to 31 March 2036) 
based upon the latest evidence114. 
 
The delivery outlined in the trajectories includes that from the following categories of site:  
• Past Delivery – completions in the first four y ears of the plan period 2016/17 to 2019/20;  
• Permitted Sites at 31 March 2020 (of 5 units or more) – delivery is directly informed by 
that set out in the latest Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) and 
Five-Year Housing Land Supply of Deli verable Sites report;  
• ‘Minded to approve’ sites (of 5 units or more) without planning permission at 31 March 
2020.  
• Housing Allocations - sites allocated for housing in Policy HOU 4 of this Local Plan or 
allocated in 'made' Neighbourhood Plans;  
• Small Sites Windfall Allowance – delivery based on analysis of past trends using the 
methodology outlined in the latest SHLAA and Five Year Housing Land Supply of 
Deliverable Sites  report.  
• Brownfield Land Register and SHLAA - other potentially developable Local Plan -
compliant sites.  
 
The figures include all current delivery as set out in the above categories. Over the course 
of the plan period it is anticipated that sites not identified in any of the above categories will 
continue to come forward as 'windfall' sites. Should sites within the above categories not 
deliver as anticipated, there is considered to be sufficient capacity in the identified supply of 
land to enable delivery of the Plan's housing requirements on alternative sites if required.

333 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix  D: Affordable Housing  
 
Background  
 
D.1 The Local Plan seeks to extend housing choice across Northumberland and provide 
well designed homes to meet the diverse needs of Northumberland’s population, 
including affordable homes. Indeed supporting the deli very of affordable homes is a 
priority for the Council.  
 
D.2 In providing affordable housing, the presumption and preference is that it is delivered 
on the application site itself, in order to help meet local needs and promote social 
inclusion as part of a mix ed and balanced community. It is recognised that there may 
be exceptional circumstances where off -site provision is justified. Off -site provision 
may be in the form of a developer providing affordable homes on an alternative site 
to the development (or in some circumstances providing land for the development of 
affordable homes).  More typically off -site provision will be delivered through 
developer financial contributions.  
 
D.3 This appendix supplements Policy HOU 6 , which addresses affordable housing. 
Specifi cally it details how a financial contribution in lieu of on -site affordable housing 
provision will be calculated.  
 
D.4 The appendix also supplements Policy INF 6 , which relates to planning obligations 
and their use. Planning Obligation Agreements are the mecha nism by which both on 
and off -site affordable housing will be secured.  
 
Rationale  
 
D.5 Where it can be robustly justified that the provision of affordable housing on -site is 
not appropriate, it is appropriate, proportionate and reasonable that the cost to the 
developer of providing the affordable housing off -site, or more typically providing a 
financial contribution, is  broadly the equivalent value to providing the affordable 
housing on -site.  Thus a developer would be neither advantaged nor disadvantaged 
in respect of the costs, than if they were able to provide on -site affordable housing.  
 
Methodology  
 
D.6 The following sets out how the Council will calculate any off -site affordable housing 
contribution.  
 
Thresholds and Exemptions  
 
D.7 As set out in Policy HOU 6 only ‘major’ residential development proposals comprising 
10 or more units or 0.5 hectares or more (reflecting the legal planning definition of 
such development) will be required to provide on -site and/or off -site affordable 
housing.  
 
D.8 An exemption to this requirement will be applied to housing developments of up to 30 
dwellings in low and medium value areas (as defined on the Local Plan Policies 
Map). The Council will not seek any contribution for affordable housing from such 
schemes.  Appendix  D: Affordable Housing   
334 The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Affordable Housing Products / Tenures  
 
D.9 Policy HOU 6 sets out the tenures and dwelling types of required affordable homes 
as part of housing developments. It explains that the policy will, within reason, be 
flexibly applied on a site -by-site basis to ensure genuine af fordability and to reflect 
local housing needs, and taking into account local market conditions, the structure of 
the local housing market and interest from potential Registered Providers.  The 
expected general tenure split varies according to value areas,  the detail of which is 
set out in Policy HOU 6.  
 
D.10  The tenure of affordable homes influences their respective values, therefore the 
policy expectations regarding tenure will be accounted for in calculating any off -site 
contributions.  
 
Calculating contributi ons 
 
D.11  Where all or part of the required affordable housing quota is to be provided off -site, 
the following formula will be applied:  
 
(Market Value - Transfer Value)  
x (Affordable Housing Requirement [as set out in Policy HOU 6 ]  
x  Gross Internal Area [GIA]) 
 
D.12  The result when applying this formula will provide the expected financial contribution 
for affordable homes (or equivalent value of contribution, where for example land is 
being provided).  
 
D.13  The Market Value is the Average Market Value expressed as a rate per sq uare 
metre. This must be provided by the applicant with supporting independent evidence 
to justify their market values using credible evidence which should include 
information from local estate agents and RICS approved formal valu ation reports. If 
the Council is not satisfied with the evidence the Council will seek a second opinion 
from a suitably qualified independent person.  The full cost of this second opinion 
must be met by the applicant.  
 
D.14  The Transfer Value is the Average Tra nsfer Value of the affordable dwellings for that 
particular scheme, taking into account an appropriate affordable housing mix (as per 
Policy HOU 6) and expressed as a rate per square metre.  In arriving at the transfer 
values, unless more specific tangible  information is available, a ‘percentage’ of 
market value approach will be adopted as follows:  
• Affordable Housing for Rent - 50% of Market Value  
• Starter Homes / Discounted Market Sale - 80% of Market Value  
• Other affordable routes to home ownership includin g shared ownership, and rent 
to buy - 67.5% of Market Value  
 
D.15  The gross internal area (GIA) of the development is expressed in square metres.  
 
 
 Appendix D: Affordable Housing   
335 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  D.16  By way of example, for a development (of 10 or more dwellings) in a high value area, 
Policy HOU 6 requires 25% of the dwellings to be affordable. Therefore the off -site 
affordable housing contribution would be based on 25% of the GIA of the 
development.  T hen, assuming the general required tenure split in Policy HOU 6 was 
appropriate, 60% of that affordable housing GIA would be assumed to equate to 
homes to rent with a transfer value equivalent to 50% of the market value. The 
remaining 40% of the affordable  housing GIA would be for affordable home 
ownership, with a transfer value equivalent to 80% of the market value.  
 
D.17  Policy HOU 6 alongside all other policy requirements within the Local Plan has been 
subject to viability testing, which has adopted a cautio us approach. Planning 
applications that comply with the policy requirements are assumed to be viable. 
Planning applications that do not comply with the policy requirements established in 
the Local Plan will normally be refused.  
 
D.18  The Council recognises, however, that there may be exceptional site specific 
circumstances which impact on development viability, and mean a developer may not 
be able to meet all policy requirements. In those exceptional circumstances the 
Council may be willing to con sider a reduced requirement or contribution, if 
development is found to be otherwise acceptable; and it can be clearly 
demonstrated, having regard to requirements set out in the NPPF and Planning 
Practice Guidance, that all or a proportion of the policy co sts prejudice development 
viability.  
  Appendix  E: Parking Standards   
336 The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix  E: Parking  Standards  
 
E.1 This appendix provides further information and guidance to interpret and support 
Local Plan Policy TRA 4 and contains the standards that will apply to all development 
other than in the circumstances described in the policy.  
 
E.2 Advice on site -specific works that are necessary to facilitate access to the 
development are not included and th ese must be considered separately. These 
matters will be covered in the Highways and Transportation Design and Delivery 
Guidance Supplementary Planning Document. Consistency with these standards 
alone is not in itself, therefore, sufficient to demonstrate that a proposal is acceptable 
either in transportation or planning terms.  
 
Parking  design  
 
E.3 The scale, location and functionality of parking for occupiers, visitors, service and 
delivery vehicles is important to the safe and efficient use of any development . These 
factors must be an integral element of the design of all development and must be 
considered at the outset of the design process.  
 
E.4 It is expected that parking to serve occupiers and residents will normally be provided 
off-street. This will normally be within the curtilage of a dwelling for residential 
developments, or within the development site for other uses. Parking for visitors and 
other vehicles need not be provided within the curtilage of dwellings or within a 
development site, but must be acco unted for in the design of all schemes. This is 
reflected in the parking requirements described below.  
 
E.5 Developers should consider a range of approaches to car parking and will need to 
demonstrate that the most appropriate solution has been provided. Any o n-street 
parking should be laid out so that it does not obstruct or make access to private 
driveways difficult.  
 
Parking  space  dimensions  
 
E.6 A minimum standard car parking space will be 2.5 metres x 5.0 metres. For disabled 
car parking spaces, additional clearance of 1.2 metres will be required along all 
sides.  
 
Domestic  garages  
 
E.7 Domestic garages are often used for storage of cycles and various household 
articles. For garages to form part of the parking provision, they must have minimum 
internal  dimensions of:  
• 6.0 metres x 3.0 metres for a single garage; or  
• 6.0 metres x 6.0 metres for a double garage.  
 
E.8 These dimensions allow garages to accommodate the car and the storage of cycles 
and other items. Where these requirements are not met, the garage( s) will not be 
considered to form part of the parking provision for the purposes of assessing  
whether adequate provision is made.  Appendix E: Parking Standards   
337 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Driveways  
 
E.9 Driveways are short sections from the public road to the house. Driveways shall be at 
least 3.0 metres wide for a s ingle parking space or 3.3 metres if the driveway also 
provides the main pedestrian access or forms part of the wheelie bin route to the 
dwelling. Adjacent car parking spaces shall add 2.5 metres to these dimensions.  
 
E.10 For a standard 'up and over' garage door, the face of the garage should be a  
minimum of 5.6 metres from the back of the footway or from the edge of a shared 
footway. Driveways with gates should be 5.6 metres in length to enable the inward 
opening of gates. Driveways with no gates or g arage door considerations, or with 
garage doors of a roller shutter type, must be no less than 5.0 metres in length.  
 
Visitor  parking  
 
E.11 Public parking shall be independently accessible and be available in perpetuity.  
• Perpendicular  parking  bays  (90 degree  to aisle/road)  shall measure  2.5 metres   x 
5.0 metres  (6.0 metre  aisle width  or reversing  distance);  
• Inline parking bays (pays run parallel to aisle/kerb line) shall measure 2. 4 metres  
x 6.0 metres;  
• Echelon parking bays (bays run 45 degrees to aisle /road) shall measure 2.5  
metres  x 5.0 metres.  
 
Parking  standards  
 
E.12 Car parking needs to be considered as an important part of any scheme. The  Council 
will seek to ensure car parking provision is at an appropriate level to cater for the 
development and visitors, whilst taking into account the location, circumstances in the 
surrounding area, highway safety and the availability of public transport.  
 
E.13 The following minimum car parking standards apply to Class C3 dwellings houses 
development countywide:  
 
Class  C3 Dwelling  House s minimum  parking  requirements  
Number  of bedrooms  In-curtilage  parking  Visitor  parking  
1 1 1 per 4 units  
2/3 2 
4/5 3 
6+ 4 
 
 
E.14 The following  car parking  standards  for other  developments,  other  than Class  C3,  are 
an indication of appropriate parking levels for these developments, which will  then be 
considered  against  the policy  and on a site-by-site basis:

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix  H: Planning Conditions and Obligations  
 
Introduction  
 
H.1 The following appendices set out Northumberland County Council’s approach to 
assessing the impacts of new development on open space, education, healthcare 
and areas of the coast of national and international importance115; and determining 
any appropriate conditions to be attached to a planning permission, and, or 
developer contributions sought, towards meeting the infrastructure a nd, or mitigation 
needs arising from development. The appendices support a number of policies and 
objectives in the Local Plan, including Policy INF 6 Planning Obligations.  
 
H.2 The types of infrastructure and mitigation, and the means of securing them through  
planning conditions or planning obligations, addressed in the following appendices 
are not an exhaustive list of all infrastructure or measures that may be sought to 
ensure development meets the relevant statutory tests. The Council may wish to 
negotiate other forms of planning obligations depending on the individual 
circumstances of a site and proposal, where obligations are necessary, directly 
related to the development and fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the 
development in question.  A series of examples are cited in Policy INF 6 reflecting the 
types of obligations most typically expected.  
 
H.3 Planning obligations will be secured via a planning obligation agreement, often 
referred to as a Section 106. Contributions may be financial or ‘in  kind’ (where a 
developer builds or directly provides the infrastructure or mitigation necessary to fulfil 
the obligation) negotiated as part of planning applications.  The latter is most 
commonly applicable to open space, which may be provided wholly or p artly on site, 
as an integral feature of development.  
 
H.4 A Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) charge has not yet been introduced in 
Northumberland. However, the Levy is viewed by the Council as a positive tool, 
which could help to fund required infrastructu re to support sustainable development. 
It is possible that should a CIL charge be introduced in Northumberland, it is used in 
part towards the types of infrastructure identified in the appendices. In any instance, 
the Council will ensure that the funding r equirements of developer contribution 
agreements are distinct from any CIL.  
 
H.5 Notwithstanding the advice provided in this appendix, Northumberland County 
Council encourages early pre -application discussions to help identify the impacts of 
development and po tential mitigation measures, which may be necessary, including 
in respect of planning obligations and planning conditions. Prospective applicants are 
encouraged to liaise with Planning Services before applications are submitted, to 
ensure that the Council can coordinate consultation with relevant services and 
organisations responsible for open space, education, health and coastal mitigation 
respectively. This can prevent delays in the granting of planning permissions, which 
are  subject to the completion of  planning obligation agreements, and conditions.  
 
115 Areas of the coast of national importance for their bird populations or plant communities are protected 
through designation as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), and areas of international importance 
are also designated as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and Wetlands of International Import ance under 
the Ramsar Convention (Ramsar Sites). Dune grasslands of international importance are designated as 
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  Appendix H: Planning Conditions and Obligations   
349 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.6 All of the policy requirements within the Local Plan have been subject to viability 
testing, which has adopted a cautious approach. Planning applications that comply 
with the policy requirements are assumed to be viable. Planning applications that do 
not comply with the policy requirements established in the Local Plan will normally be 
refused.  The Council recognises, however, that there may be exceptional site 
specific circumstances which impact on developm ent viability, and mean a developer 
may not be able to meet all policy requirements. In those exceptional circumstances 
the Council may be willing to consider a reduced requirement or contribution116, if a 
development is found to be otherwise acceptable in planning terms; and it can be 
suitably demonstrated, in accordance with the NPPF and Planning Practice 
Guidance, that the policy costs prejudice development viability.  
 
Timing of Payments and Indexation  
 
H.7 The Council will usually seek all fina ncial contributions to be paid prior to the 
occupation of the first dwelling or according to an agreed payment schedule. Such 
schedules seek to ensure the delivery of the required measures at the time they are 
needed during the course of development. Where  a developer can demonstrate that 
a proposed payment schedule cannot be fulfilled on account of changes in 
development viability and/ or cash flow, the Council may negotiate an alternative 
phasing of payments. Payment profiles will vary according to the sp ecific 
circumstances of an application.  
 
H.8 The costs presented in the appendices reflect the cost at the time of writing. These 
costs will be routinely reviewed and will be linked to an appropriate index and 
reviewed at least annually.  The particular index that is used may vary according to 
the type of contribution.  
 
H.9 In addition, in  order to maintain the value of contributions from the date of a planning 
obligation agreement to the date that development is commenced, or an agreed 
alternative financial payme nt trigger is reached, all contributions will be amended in 
line with an appropriate cost index. This review mechanism will not allow for 
downward adjustments.  
 
Legal and Monitoring Fees  
 
H.10  Developers will be expected to meet all reasonable legal costs incur red by the 
County Council associated with drafting planning obligation agreements. Developers 
who enter into a planning obligation agreement will also be required to pay a Section 
106 monitoring fee, in order to mitigate additional costs  incurred by the Co uncil in the 
administration and monitoring of planning obligations. Details of the Council’s legal 
fees and monitoring fees for Planning Obligation Agreements can be found on the 
Council’s website or by contacting the Council’s Planning Services.  
 
H.11  The Coun cil can also assist applicants by signposting them to relevant guidance, 
advising on relevant consultation, and providing template / model agreements.  
 
 
116 Contributions to the Coastal Mitigation Service cannot be reduced because these are required to ensure 
development impacts on internationally important designated sites and species are properly mitigated in 
accordance with the appropriate assessment of the Local Plan which has been completed to meet the 
requirements of the Conservation of Habitats and Species  Regulations 2017 as amended.  Appendix H 1: Open Space   
350  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix H1: Open Space  
 
Background  
 
H.12  The Local Plan sets out the many benefits of good quality open spaces, including 
promoting social inclusion, community cohesion, opportunities for sport and play, 
general health and well -being and quality of life.  
 
H.13  Open spaces and facilities can also make an important contribution to the character 
and appearance of the built and natural environment and can have wider ecological 
and environmental benefits. Ensuring the right level and quality of provision is, 
therefore, an important planning consideration and a vital component of sustainable 
development. This is echoed in the National Planning Policy Framework which 
supports the creation of a well -designed and safe built environment having 
accessible services and open spaces that refl ect current and future needs and 
support communities’ health, social and cultural well -being. Planning Practice 
Guidance identifies open space as including all open space of public value and 
recognises that it can take many different forms.  
 
H.14  Whilst the nee d to retain existing open space is captured in Policy INF 5 , this 
appendix supplements parts 4 and 5 of the policy. It is about addressing the new 
demands placed on open space provision, as a result of new development.  Planning 
conditions and planning obl igation agreements will be used to secure such provision. 
This appendix therefore also supplements Policy INF 6 , which relates to planning 
obligations and their use. The appendix additionally supplements the following Local 
Plan policies:  
• Policy QOP 1  establishes design principles that ensure development supports 
health and wellbeing and enhances quality of life.  
• Policy QOP 2  addresses good design and amenity which includes landscaping 
of amenity value.  
• Policy QOP 4  requires new development to incorpor ate well -designed 
landscaping including ensuring it is functional and well -integrated into the design 
of the development.  
• Policy STP 3  elaborates on the principles of sustainable development in 
Northumberland to which development is expected to adhere. Thi s includes 
supporting and providing opportunities to improve health and wellbeing and 
providing the infrastructure which underpins quality of life. It also includes making 
best use of existing facilities and infrastructure, whilst making appropriate 
provis ion for new or additional infrastructure as required.  
• Policy STP 5  explicitly sets out the criteria development must satisfy to address 
health and wellbeing, which includes providing access to a range of facilities 
including for sport and play and green an d blue infrastructure.  
• Policy STP 6  requires development to protect, improve and extend 
Northumberland's green infrastructure.  
• Policy INF 1  relates to delivering development related infrastructure. It seeks to 
ensure that the needs arising from development  are supported by sufficient 
appropriate infrastructure both on and off -site. 
 Appendix H 1: Open Space   
351 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Rationale  
 
H.15  Northumberland County Council works alongside Town and Parish Councils and 
other organisations to provide and maintain the County’s vitally important open 
spaces.  
 
H.16  Open space and provision for children and young people (including play) varies 
greatly in Northumberland in terms of quantity, quality and accessibility. However, 
there are deficiencies of some form across the County.  Whilst some areas may have 
relatively good levels of provision of certain types of open space, those spaces may 
be of poor quality or suffer from access constraints. In other areas, there is a 
quantitative lack of provision.  
 
H.17  Improvements are continuously being sought to improve the quantity, quality, 
accessibility and functionality of open space, including directly through investment by 
the Council, and through the planning system.  
 
H.18  In respect of residential development, the basic principle applies that new housing 
places new demands  on open space provision.  Therefore, for the majority of 
development resulting in a net increase in the number of dwellings (including 
changes of use of existing buildings to residential), the Local Planning Authority will 
seek quantitative improvements t hrough new provision of open space and/or 
improvements to the quality and/or accessibility of existing provision. This may be 
provided on -site, as part of new development, and/or off -site. Where these 
requirements cannot be met, proposals for new housing m ay be determined not to 
represent sustainable development and the application may be refused.  
 
Methodology  
 
H.19  The following sets out which developments will be required to provide and/or 
contribute to the provision or improvement of open space, the local sta ndards of 
provision, and how any contributions will be calculated.  
 
Thresholds and Exemptions  
 
H.20  Only ‘major’ residential development proposals reflecting the legal planning definition 
of such development i.e. those with 10 or more dwellings or a site of 0.5  hectares or 
more will be required to provide open space, either on -site or off site or make a 
contribution to improve existing provision. Exceptions to this are as follows:  
• Housing for older people will not be required to provide for the children and 
youn g people provision component of open space, on account of not generating 
demand for such facilities  
 
Levels and standards of provision  
 
H.21  The requirements for open space will be assessed on the type and size of 
development. Table H1 below provides thresholds for the types of open space 
expected to be provided on -site and will be used in the decision making process.  
 Appendix H 1: Open Space   
352  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.22  Table H2 provides the loc al standards of open space provision in respect of quantity. 
Table H3 provides the associated accessibility and quality standards. These will be 
used to ensure the value to the communities served by any new or improved open 
space is maximised.  
 
H.23  The standar ds have been informed by the Northumberland PPG17 Open Space, 
Sport and Recreation Assessment (May 2011) and review and update in December 
2018, previous policy approaches in Northumberland, benchmarking, good practice 
and national guidance. They are also underpinned by a recognition that standards 
need to be realistic and deliverable.  
 
H.24  It should be noted that the Council proposes to prepare a Supplementary Planning 
Document, which will include further detailed guidance on the design and 
maintenance of open  space. Any provision of new open space should be provided by 
the developer to a design and specification first approved in writing by the Council. In 
addition the Council will need to approve a maintenance and management plan. This 
will usually be monitor ed through the Planning Obligation Agreement process.

• Positively managed taking account of 
the need for repair and replacement

• Provision of footpaths.  
• Designed so as to be free of the fear 
of ha rm or crime.   
 
 
H.25  The thresholds in Table H1 provide a guide to which most development should 
adhere. However, whether new open space is provided on -site will depend upon a 
number of considerations, including: site size and layout; accessibility of any existing 
open space and play provision; site constraints such as topography, urban design or 
townscape constraints associated with existing built character and current building 
densities; and built heritage constraints.  
 
H.26  Where provisio n on-site is not appropriate, or where standards can only partly be met 
on site, or where alternative provision or improvements are considered to better meet 
the needs of the new development, off -site provision will be sought.  Appendix H 1: Open Space   
354  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.27  Where off -site provision is r equired, a developer will either be required to deliver off -
site provision, subject to agreement with the Council or more typically will be required 
to make a financial contribution to deliver new open space, or improve existing 
provision. Investment using  financial contributions achieved in this way will be made 
in line with the latest Infrastructure Delivery Plan, and/or the priorities of the Council 
and Town and Parish Council’s and other organisations responsible for open space.  
 
H.28  It is important to note  that, irrespective of the requirement for open space, 
developments will still be required to provide appropriate landscaping for other 
purposes, including, in the interests of good design, for visual amenity, flood 
alleviation and biodiversity.  
 
Calculati ng requirements  
 
H.29  To calculate the precise amount of provision required from a residential development, 
the estimated population of the development (see Table H4) will be multiplied by 
each of the relevant categories of open space in Table H2. The formula can be 
summarised as follows:  
Square Metres of provision in each category (third column of Table H2) 
x 
the estimated population of the new housing development (see Table H4) 
= 
required provision of each open space type . 
 
H.30  Where financial contributions are deemed to be appropriate instead of on site 
provision, or in addition to on site provision, costs will be calculated by multiplying the 
required space provision by the typical cost of providing and/or improving each 
respective category of  open space. For off -site contributions, the same charges apply 
to both provision of new and the upgrading/improvement of existing facilities. This is 
because the costs have been consistently found by the Council to be the same.

Dwelling type  Average occupancy (number of people)*

* occupancy is an estimated average derived from 2011 Census data . 
 
 
  Appendix H 1: Open Space   
355 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.31  Table H5 provides a schedule of current costs (at the time of preparing the Local 
Plan). It also includes maintenance costs. Maintenance may be delivered by the 
Council, by a developer or by third party (including a Town or Parish Council or other 
organisation responsible for open space and/or provision for children and young 
people). Maintenance regimes will be monitored through the Planning Obligation 
Agreement.  
 
H.32  Costs will be reviewed periodically and adjusted in line with a relevant appropriate 
cost index or indices to ensure they remain up to date.  
 
H.33  When an application is received in ‘outline’, and the number and type of dwellings are 
unknown, the open space and provision for children and young people requirement 
will be estimated by applying a minimum density of 30 dwellings per hectare gross 
housing development and an assumed mix of 40% 2 beds, 40% 3 beds, 20% 4 beds. 
This will provide an initial guide to the likely requirements. The initial figure will be 
updated by a detailed calculation base d on the number of dwellings, once a reserved 
matters application is submitted. A review mechanism will be included in the planning 
obligation to ensure that the appropriate modified calculation, based on the number 
and size of dwellings permitted, can be undertaken to achieve the appropriate 
contribution.

Provision for children and young 
people  
 £75.00  £5.00  £25.00  
 
 
How contributions will be spent  
 
H.34  The expectation will generally be that off -site contributions for open space will be 
spent within the accessible distances for the respective provision of open space 
identified in Table H3 (accessibility standards).  
 
H.35  Where a contribution can be more appropriately spent outwith these parameters, a 
sequential approach will be applied to best meet community needs as follows:  
• In the settlement of the development;  
• Within the parish of the development;  
• In an adjoining settl ement, Parish or Ward of that in which the development 
occurs.  Appendix H 1: Open Space   
356  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.36  By way of example, off site provision or improvement of amenity green space and 
natural and semi natural green space will first be sought within 600m of the proposed 
development. Where this is not appropriate or desirable, alternative options will be 
considered starting within the settlement of the proposed development, then the 
parish of the development, or in an adjoining settlement, parish or ward.  
 
Commitment to new assessment  
 
H.37  As set out in  paragraphs 14. 40 and 14. 41 of the Plan, the Council is committed to 
carrying out a new assessment of open space, sport, and recreation facilities and a 
review of the sites allocated for Protected Open Space, and to subsequently 
undertake an early and part ial update of the Plan in this regard. Appendix H1 will be 
concurrently reviewed to consider whether the standards set out need to be updated 
in light of the new assessment and/or in view of emerging national policy and 
guidance.  
 
 Appendix H 2: Education   
357 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix H2: Education  
 
Background  
 
H.38  The provision of quality education is at the heart of sustainable communities and 
central to Northumberland County Council’s vision to ensure that children and young 
people achieve and realise their potential. It is also fundamental to the Local Plan’s 
vision, and as such is a key theme throughout the Plan. Objectives include ensuring 
the provision of essential infrastructure, such as high quality education, and 
continually improving education and skills.  
 
H.39  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) places an emphasis on the 
importance of ensuring that a sufficient choice of school places is available to meet 
the needs of existing and new communities. Local Planning Authorities should take a 
proactive, positive and collaborative approach to meeting this requirement, and to 
development that will widen choice in education. Northumberland County Council’s 
Planning Service works closely with Education Services to  fulfil this objective.  
 
H.40  This appendix relates to assessing the impacts of new housing development on 
education provision. Planning conditions and more typically planning obligation 
agreements will be used to secure such provision. This appendix therefore 
supplements Policy INF 6 , which relates to planning obligations and their use, 
including in the provision and/or improvement and maintenance of infrastructure, 
such as education. The appendix also supplements the following policies:  
• Policy STP 5  addresses health and wellbeing and recognises the value of 
ensuring development has access to a range of facilities, including education.  
• Policy ECN 13 sets out support for meeting rural employment needs. Subject to 
meeting relevant criteria, particular support is given to the further diversification 
and development of educational facilities, particularly those in relation to the 
County’s further and higher education offer.  
• Chapter 14 emphasises the need for sustainable growth to be supported by 
necessary infrastructure, definin g infrastructure as including schools and other 
educational facilities. Specifically, education is highlighted as representing 
essential community services. Policy INF 1  is about delivering development 
related infrastructure. It seeks to ensure that the ne eds arising from development 
are supported by sufficient appropriate infrastructure both on and off -site. 
• Policy INF 2  relates to community services and facilities and has a dual role. It is 
about protecting community services and facilities (including edu cation facilities) 
and supporting improvement in terms of quantity, quality and accessibility, where 
these will meet an identified need.  
 
Rationale  
 
H.41  Local authorities have a statutory duty under the Education and Inspections Act 1996 
to ensure there are a sufficient number of school places within its area and that within 
such provision, parental choice, diversity and fair access are promoted.  
 
H.42  The Council’s objective is to work towards ensuring that there are sufficient ‘good’ 
places (as defined by Ofsted) available for all children and young people resident in Appendix H2: Education   
358  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  the county within or as close as possible to their own communities. The School 
Organisation Plan for Northumberland demonstrates how the Council will fulfil this 
statutory duty.  
 
H.43  New housing resulting  in population growth in an area will increase the number of 
pupils, which will place additional demands on local schools and education facilities. 
Where these pupils cannot be accommodated within existing schools, it is necessary 
to ensure that additional  capacity is created through direct provision, or to collect 
capital funding through developer contributions to expand the capacity of schools and 
education facilities.  
 
H.44  Where the impacts of development on schools and education cannot be mitigated, 
new hou sing proposals may be determined not to represent sustainable development 
and any application may be refused.  
 
Methodology   
 
H.45  Developer contributions for education will only be sought for new housing 
development which creates additional demand for education infrastructure, in excess 
of what is available and accessible.  
 
H.46  The following sets out which developments will be assessed for their impacts on 
education provision, how those impacts will be appraised and how contributions will 
be calculated.  
 
Thresholds and exemptions  
 
H.47  Only ‘major’ residential development proposals reflecting the legal planning definition 
of such development will be assessed for their impact on education provision, i.e. 
those with 10 or more dwellings or a site of 0.5 hectares or  more.  
 
H.48  Northumberland County Council will monitor this de -minimis threshold to ensure it is 
effective and equitable across development. Small scale developments may not in 
themselves have an impact on education infrastructure, however collectively they do  
create additional demands.  
 
H.49  Non-residential developments would not be expected to have an impact on education 
provision, therefore are exempt from conditions and developer contributions for 
education.  Furthermore, the following residential developments w ould not be 
expected to yield any children and are therefore similarly exempt:  
• Student accommodation  
• Housing for Older People  
• Holiday Homes  
• Dwellings with one bedroom  
 
 
  Appendix H 2: Education   
359 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Identifying relevant schools / education provision  
 
H.50  In order to determine whether there is sufficient projected capacity in education 
infrastructure to accommodate the demands of new development, it is first necessary 
to identify which schools and education facilities are related to the development; and 
the number of vacant plac es available, or likely to be available, subject to a range of 
considerations.  
 
H.51  Schools which are considered to be directly related to a development will most often 
be schools within the relevant school catchment area. Catchment areas can be found 
on the C ouncil’s digital maps facility on the Council website.  
 
H.52  The Council uses catchment areas to ensure that local schools have viable intakes 
and to manage the Home to School Transport Policy fairly and equitably across the 
County. When a school is oversubscri bed priority of admission is given to children 
meeting certain criteria117.  Thereafter remaining applications are determined on the 
basis of an additional set of criteria, including whether or not a child is resident in the 
catchment area at the admissions  date.  
 
H.53  However, it should be recognised that different schools operate varying admissions 
policies, therefore the same criteria in terms of catchment areas may not apply. 
Furthermore, in some instances a particular school or schools may choose not to 
expa nd or there may be physical constraints to expansion. In such instances the 
creation of additional capacity at other schools may need to be considered.  
 
H.54  The schools identified as relevant to a development could also include those outwith 
the catchment area on account of them being more directly linked to a proposed 
development e.g. where a site is close to a catchment area boundary.  
 
H.55  In parts of Northumber land, particularly close to the boundary with Newcastle City 
Council, there are also known patterns of pupils attending Northumberland schools 
who reside in the adjoining authority areas. The Council will take into account these 
factors when determining th e relevant provision, directly related to a proposed 
development118. 
 
Determining capacity  
 
H.56  Planning conditions and developer contributions for education will only be sought 
where there is currently insufficient capacity to accommodate the additional pupils  
generated by the development, or where it is projected that there will be insufficient 
capacity within the foreseeable pupil place planning timeframe.  
 
H.57  Schools are not expected to operate at 100% of their capacity, and a small  surplus in 
places does not necessarily equate to there being sufficient capacity to 
accommodate additional pupils. The Audit Commission recommends that local 
 
117 Children with a Statement of Special Education needs or Education Health and Care (EHC) plan who have 
the specific school named in the plan; or Children who are “looked after” or have previously been “looked 
after”.  
118 Where appropriate the Council may seek planning contributions via an adjoining authority.  Appendix H2: Education   
360  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  authorities should plan for a 95% occupancy rate in schools. The 5% contingency is 
to allow for factors such as changing pare ntal preferences and changing birth rates.  
 
H.58  In practice, in Northumberland, the levels of occupancy vary considerably. In the 
most part, schools do not operate at 95% capacity and have surplus capacity. This is 
largely on account of the rural nature of muc h of the County and the need to protect 
rural schools from closure. However, there are schools with very limited capacity 
currently, or projected limited capacity. There are also areas in which capacity is 
significantly influenced by migration of pupils be tween catchment areas.  
 
H.59  The Council reviews and updates the net capacity of schools on an annual basis 
which underpins the Planned Admission Number.  Statistics gathered by the DfE 
indicate that Northumberland County Council continues to have a high degree  of 
accuracy with regard to pupil predictions.  
 
H.60  Given the long term nature of pupils generated by housing developments, as well as 
looking at capacity in terms of Planned Admission Numbers / current school places 
and actual pupil numbers, it is important t o consider potential longer term trends. Key 
influences in relation to this are:  
• Birth data: If there are significant variations in birth data particularly for the 
catchment area this may impact on pupil numbers.  
• Other housing developments: within a school catchment area or adjoining it there 
may be other schemes already under construction, or approved but not yet being 
built that will affect pupil numbers in future years. When assessing future demand 
for school places these elements will be considere d. 
• Pupil data:   Northumberland County Council receives a range of data in relation 
to education. Key to this is the school census data collected once a term.  
 
H.61  Northumberland’s Special Schools are at capacity, with pupil numbers showing 
significant growth i n recent years. Children are having to be placed in out of County 
schools, due to a lack of places. The Council is keen to educate as many children 
and young people with SEN requirements who reside in Northumberland, within the 
County. SEN provision does n ot conform with catchment areas in the way schools 
do.  While a child or young person who presents with SEN may live in one part of the 
County, the particular primary need with which they present may only be able to be 
addressed at a school in another part  of the County.  
 
H.62  The Department for Education has scaled up state -funded early years places. The 
take-up has been high, increasing demand for early years provision.  Many early 
years settings fall within the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) sector,  and are 
not always related to catchment areas. However, as the Council has a duty to ensure 
early years childcare provision, the capacity will similarly be appraised. This will 
typically be based on available capacity in school settings.  
 
H.63  Similarly there are a number of settings for post 16 education. However, the Council 
is also responsible for ensuring post 16 education.  As for early years, this will 
typically be appraised based on available capacity in school settings.  
 
 Appendix H 2: Education   
361 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.64  Where it is determined there i s insufficient capacity and schools and other education 
facilities cannot accommodate the anticipated number of new pupils, the Council will, 
in collaboration with the respective schools/facilities, consider whether the schools 
can be physically extended, or in rare instances if a new school is required.  
Provision to accommodate additional necessary capacity to support needs arising 
from new housing development will be secured through planning conditions or 
planning obligations, either by direct provision of buildings or facilities or through 
appropriate developer contributions.  
 
H.65  In view of SEN capacity issues, for development which will yield a single SEN pupil 
place (rounded to nearest whole figure) or more, developer contributions will be 
required for SE N provision.  
 
H.66  In exceptional circumstances planning conditions or other planning obligation 
agreements may be appropriate to secure other requirements, such as the provision 
of sufficient land, to allow for the delivery of additional school or education ca pacity 
necessary to serve the development.  
 
Calculating Developer Contributions  
 
H.67  To calculate the financial contribution required from a residential development, the 
following formula will be applied:  
Estimated pupil yield of the development (see Table H6) (less 3% SEN)  
x 
the average construction cost (per pupil)  
+ 
Estimated SEN pupil yield x average construction cost (per pupil)  
= 
financial contribution  
 
Table H6: Pupil yield  
 
 Pupil yield per dwelling  
Primary  0.18*  
Secondary  0.11**  
Special Education Needs (SEN)  3% of pupils  
*  0.02516 pupils per year group multiplied by 7no. years of provision . 
** 0.02384 pupils per year group multiplied by 5no. years of provision .

Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.68  The number of children or pupils likely to arise as a result of new housing 
development is often referred to as the pupil yield factor. In accordance with national 
guidance, Northumberland’s pupil yield factors for pupils of statutory school age 
(primary a nd secondary pupils) are presented in Table H6 and are based on up -to-
date evidence from recent local housing developments119. The evidence will be 
routinely reviewed to ensure it is up to date and accurate.  
 
H.69  On average it is anticipated that 3% of the pupi l yield figure will be assumed to have 
complex SEN requirements, as indicated by the requirement for an Education Health 
and Care (EHC) Plan.  
 
H.70  The Council does not anticipate any need for pre -school or post 16 education 
provision in the short term, however  this will be monitored. Any requirement will be 
underpinned by pupil yield data.  
 
H.71  The respective cost per pupil place (rounded to nearest whole figure) will be 
calculated by reference to the Department for Education Scorecards (which provide 
costs for pri mary and secondary school places) and any more up to date evidence of 
local delivery costs. Where national averages are used this will be adjusted, usually 
using BCIS location factors or any more relevant or up to date evidence.  
 
H.72  Special schools or alternative SEN provision can vary but require more space per 
pupil than mainstream schools. Developer contributions for special or alternative 
school pupil places will also be calculated using the scorecards but are typically 
based on four times the cost of mainstream places.  
 
H.73  In accordance with national guidance the per pupil cost of early years provision is 
assumed to be the same as for a primary school. Similarly, further education places 
provided within secondary school sixth forms are assumed to be th e same as a 
secondary school place.  
 
H.74  It should be noted that where developer contributions are to go to a particular project 
where the authority can evidence higher costs, such as on the basis of a bespoke 
feasibility study or known site abnormals, these m ay be used in preference to the 
averages from the national scorecards or other evidence of average costs.  
 
 
119 The evidence assessed the number of pupils to be generated by new housing developments at: Mark 
Bridge, Amble (265 dwellings) between 2016 and 2019; Crofton Grange, Blyth  (545 dwellings) between 
2015 -2019; and Broadoaks, Bedlington (96 dwellings) between 2018 -2019. This was benchmarked against 
previous evidence of pupil yields in Northumberland.  Appendix H 3: Health   
363 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix H3: Health  
 
Background  
 
H.75  Health is integral to the Local Plan’s vision, and as such is a key theme running 
throughout the Plan. As reflected in the National Planning Policy Framework, 
planning and health are inherently interlinked in terms of creating environments that 
support and encourage health and well -being  and identifying and securing the 
facilities needed for healthcare.  
 
H.76  A wide range of the Local Plan’s objectives and policies directly and indirectly seek to 
ensure Northumberland is a healthy place, supporting healthy communities, 
promoting social interac tion and reducing health inequalities. This appendix relates to 
positively identifying and securing services and facilities for health. Specifically, there 
is a commitment to seek contributions towards new or enhanced facilities from 
developers, where deve lopment results in a shortfall or worsening of provision.  
 
H.77  Planning conditions and more typically planning obligation agreements will be used 
to secure such provision. This appendix supplements Policy INF 6 , which relates to 
planning obligations and their use, including in the provision and or improvement and 
maintenance of infrastructure, such as primary healthcare. The appendix also 
supplements the following policies:  
• Policy STP 3  The policy elaborates on the principles of sustainable development 
in North umberland to which development is expected to adhere. This includes 
supporting and providing opportunities to improve health and wellbeing and 
providing the infrastructure which underpins quality of life.  
• Policy STP 5  The Policy explicitly sets out the cri teria development must satisfy 
to address health and wellbeing, which includes providing access to health 
services.  
• Policy INF 1  The Policy relates to delivering development related infrastructure. 
It seeks to ensure that the needs arising from development  are supported by 
sufficient appropriate infrastructure both on and off -site. 
 
Rationale  
 
H.78  Public health is a key responsibility of Northumberland County Council. The Council 
also works closely with the other organisations involved in ensuring the healthcare 
needs of Northumberland's communities are met. This includes working with the NHS 
Northumberland Clinical Commissioning Group. The role of the group is to plan and 
buy the majority of NHS hospital based and community health care services for 
people in Northumberland. The organisation works closely with all 41 family GP 
practices in Northumberland and with NHS England.  
 
H.79  In recent years pressures on healthcare in Northumberland have been increasing. It 
has been identified that in several areas of N orthumberland, GP practices are 
operating at their maximum capacity.  
 
H.80  New housing resulting in population growth in an area will increase the number of  
patients seeking to register with a GP. Where these patients cannot be Appendix H3: Health   
364  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  accommodated by existing healthc are provision, it is necessary to collect capital 
funding to expand the capacity and resilience of healthcare services.  
 
H.81  Where the impacts of development on healthcare services cannot be mitigated, 
development may be determined not to represent sustainable  development and any 
application may be refused.  
 
Methodology  
 
H.82  Developer contributions for healthcare will only be sought for new housing 
development where there is insufficient capacity in provision to absorb the projected 
number of new residents.  
 
H.83  The fo llowing sets out which developments will be assessed for their impacts on 
healthcare provision, how those impacts will be appraised and how developer 
contributions will be calculated.  
 
Threshold and exemptions  
 
H.84  Only ‘major’ residential development proposal s reflecting the legal planning definition 
of such development will be assessed for their impact on healthcare provision, i.e. 
those with 10 or more dwellings or a site of 0.5 hectares or more.  
 
H.85  There is a ‘de minimis’ financial level below which a develop er contribution would be 
of little real benefit in increasing the infrastructure capacity. However, there may also 
be specific circumstances where it is considered that smaller schemes result in an 
impact that requires appropriate mitigation, potentially i ncluding a developer 
contribution.  
 
H.86  Northumberland County Council and the NHS Northumberland Clinical 
Commissioning Group will monitor this threshold to ensure it is effective and 
equitable across development. Small scale developments may not in themselves  
have a significant  impact on healthcare infrastructure, however collectively they do 
create additional demands.  
 
H.87  Non-residential developments would not be expected to have an impact on 
healthcare provision, therefore are exempt from conditions and developer 
contributions for healthcare.  
 
Identifying capacity  
 
H.88  In order to determine whether there is sufficient projected capacity in healthcare 
services, the NHS Northumberland Clinical Commissioning Group will liaise with the 
GP practices which serve th e area of a development. Those practices will be asked 
what (if any) capacity they have to absorb residents of new developments.  
 
H.89  Where it is determined there is insufficient capacity and services cannot 
accommodate the anticipated number of new residents (this may be in relation to the 
impact of the development alone or taken in conjunction with other planned 
developments), the NHS Northumberland Clinical Commissioning Group will, in Appendix H 3: Health   
365 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  collaboration with the respective practices, consider whether the facilit ies can be 
physically extended, or if there are other measures which could increase the capacity 
of the practices. Where this is deemed possible a developer contribution(s) will be 
sought.  
 
H.90  In exceptional circumstances planning conditions or other planning  obligation 
agreements may be appropriate to secure the required healthcare provision. This 
could, for example, include providing land for healthcare services or healthcare 
services being constructed by a developer on behalf of the NHS Northumberland 
Clinical Commissioning Group.  
 
Calculating developer contributions  
 
H.91  To calculate the financial contribution required from a residential development, the 
following formula will usually be applied:  
 
Estimated population of the development (see Table H7) x the pro portion of GPs per person  
x 
the required floorspace per GP(sqm) x average construction cost (per sqm)  
= 
financial contribution  
 
Table H7: Population by dwelling type  
 
Dwelling type  Average occupancy (number of people)*  
1 bedroom  1.26 
2 bedrooms  1.80 
3 bedrooms  2.42 
4 or more bedrooms  2.90 
* occupancy is an estimated average derived from 2011 Census data . 
 
 
H.92  Based on a range of evidence it has been determined that a list size in 
Northumberland equates to around 1 ,500 patients per GP120. Accordingly, for every 
person 0.0006666 of a GP is required. A single GP requires approximately 150sq m 
of floorspace121. 
 
 
 
 
 
120 The average list size per GP in Northumberland has been assessed as between 1,167-1,435 patients (GP 
workforce census, Health and Social Care information centre).  The figure of 1 ,500 is thus a fairly 
conservative assumption for Northumberland. It is a higher number of patients than the actual measured 
range.  
121 This assumption is underpinned by the NHS England Primary Care - Business case Prioritisation and 
Approval Process. This includes a schedule of Size and Space Standards for Primary Medical Care 
Contractor premises which provides principles of best practice when  assessing size requirements to 
accommodate overall facility space common to all primary medical care premises.  Appendix H3: Health   
366  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.93  GP practice floorspace costs have been derived from average constructi on costs in 
Northumberland and at the time of writing equate to around £3,000 per sqm122. Costs 
will be periodically reviewed and modified in accordance with a relevant recognised 
build -cost index123. 
 
H.94  Where developer contributions are to go to a particular project and where the 
authority can evidence higher costs for that project on the basis of a feasibility study 
or known service specific issues (e.g. two storey premises with access constraints), 
and where it can be demonstrated to be viable to do so, these costs may be used to 
determine appropriate developer contributions in preference to the calculated general 
averages.  
 
H.95  When an application is received in ‘outline’ and the number and type of dwellings are 
unknown, the requirement for any health care contribution will be estimated by 
applying a minimum density of 30 dwellings per hectare gross housing development 
and an assumed mix of 40% 2 beds, 40% 3 beds, 20% 4 beds. This will provide an 
initial guide to the likely financial contribution. The i nitial figure will be updated by a 
detailed calculation based on the number of dwellings, once a reserved matters 
application is submitted. A review mechanism will be included in the planning 
obligation to ensure that the appropriate modified calculation, based on the number 
and size of dwellings permitted, can be undertaken to achieve the appropriate 
contribution.  
 
How contributions will be spent  
 
H.96  Contributions for healthcare will usually be spent on physically expanding a GP 
practice or practices which s erve a development.  In some circumstances a 
contribution can be more appropriately spent in alternative ways, in order to expand 
capacity. By way of example, this could include alteration of non -clinical rooms to 
clinical use, medical equipment solutions which would speed up consultations, 
telemedicine technology and other ICT solutions to improve capacity.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
122 Costs have been derived from a variety of sources including The Health Care Premises Cost Guide, 
benchmarking other local authority approaches , Independent North East based Quantity Surveyor advice 
and actual tendered costs in the North East.  
123 This will typically be the BCIS PUBSEC indices.  Appendix H 4: Coastal Mitigation   
367 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix H4: Coastal Mitigation  
 
Background  
 
H.97  The statutory purpose and sensitivity  of designated areas  is addressed in the Local 
Plan. Reflecting the  NPPF, internationally protected sites (SPAs, SACs, and Ramsar 
Sites) and nationally protected sites (SSSIs), all of which can be found in 
Northumberland’s coastal ar ea, are protected. Where these designated  sites could 
be adversely  affected by development, the impacts  must  be carefully assessed.  
Development may be refused,  or where appropriate, require mitigation measures.  
 
H.98  This appendix relates to mitigating the impa cts of new housing  and tourist 
accommodation  development  on specially protected  areas along Northumberland’s 
coast,  and the wildlife and habitats those areas  support.  More specifically,  this 
appendix  addresses  mitigation measures for the  disturbance to the  bird species  and 
the spread of a non -native invasive species, arising from increased recreational 
activity on the coast. It should be noted that a development may be subject 
to requirements for  additional  or alternative  mitigation measures to address any other 
potential  adverse effects  of development on these protected areas.  
 
H.99  Planning conditions and more typically planning obligation agreements will be used 
to secure such provision. This appendix therefore supplements  Policy INF 6 , which 
relates to Planni ng obligations and their use, including  for environmental 
improvement and mitigation schemes.  The appendix also supplements the following 
policies:  
• Policy  ENV 1  sets out the strategic approaches to assessing the impact of 
development on the natural, histor ic, and built environment.  It emphasises the 
weight to the afforded to the statutory purposes and special qualities of 
designated and non -designated nature assets  and sites including  international 
and national designations.  
• Policy ENV 2 relates to the effe cts of development on biodiversity and 
geodiversity. It addresses minimising adverse impacts, and maximising 
opportunities for biodiversity net gain. The policy specifically deals with 
addressing adverse effects on habitats and species, including through u sing 
developer contributions to the Coastal Mitigation Service (within zones shown on 
the Policies Map).  
• Policy INF 1  relates to delivering development related infrastructure. It seeks to 
ensure that the needs arising from development are supported by sufficient 
appropriate infrastructure both on and off -site. 
 
Rationale  
 
H.100  Adverse impacts can be indirect as well as direct. In respect of coastal sites, 
designated for their important bird communities, adverse impacts arise as a result of 
incre ased levels of recreational disturbance from the additional population from new 
development.  
 
 
 Appendix H4: Coastal Mitigation   
368  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  H.101  The whole of the Northumberland coast, except for a few hundred  metres  at 
Lynemouth, is designated as SSSI because of its nationally important bird 
populations; and much of it is also designated as SPA and Ramsar Site because of 
the international importance of some of these populations.  
 
H.102  In order to ensure that effective migration can be provided  for this area,  to address  
recreational  related disturba nce, the Council  has introduced  the Northumberland 
Coastal Mitigation Service. This is a developer -funded  wardening  service  that 
provides a presence within the designated sites to educate and advise recreational 
users such as dog walkers, joggers, horse ri ders and sea anglers as to how they can 
enjoy the coast without causing excessive disturbance to important bird  populations.  
Where  appropriate the service will also have  a control  programme  for pirri-pirri bur (a 
non-native invasive species)  within the SS SI and SAC dune grasslands.  
 
Methodology  
 
H.103  Developer contributions for the  Northumberland  Costal Mitigation Service will only be 
sought for developments that will  result in a net increase in  dwellings  or tourist  
accommodation, within 10  kilometres  of the Coast.   This zone of influence was 
identified by gathering evidence concerning the point of origin of dog -walkers on 
the coast and  is explained in more detail in the Coastal Mitigation Service Strategy 
Document. It is shown on the Local Plan Policies Map.  
 
H.104  The following sets out how developer contributions  within this zone  will be calculated.  
 
Thresholds and Exemptions   
 
H.105  Developments other than residential and tourism developments,  would typically not 
be expected to give rise to  additional  recreational use of the coast and  therefore  
are usually  exempt from  developer contributions for the Coastal Mitigation  Service.  
There may however be specific  circumstances  which warrant a contribution. As 
stated  above, separate m itigation may also be required for other impacts,  of any form 
of development.   
 
H.106  In order to ensure that a proportionate approach is taken, it is  recognised  that people 
living towards the inland edge of the 10km zone visit the coast less frequently than 
those living closer to the coast.  Therefore,  the 10km zone of influence is divided into 
two zones as follows:  
• 0 to 7 kilometres : Mitigation is required for all developments resulting in a net 
increase in dwellings, including holiday units.  
• 7 to 10 kilometres : Mitigation is required for all developments resulting in a net 
increase of 10 or more dwellings, including holiday units, with a 50% reduction in 
the unit cost.  
 
 
 
  Appendix H 4: Coastal Mitigation   
369 The Local Plan  should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Calculating Developer Contributions  
 
H.107  The level of payment into the Coastal Mitigation Service is derived from two  figures; 
the cost of providing a viable and effective service, divided by the anticipated annual 
delivery of new houses within the coastal zone.  
 
H.108  Based on current costs,  the resulting contribution  is as follow s: 
• £615  per unit within the 0 -7km zone; and  
• £307  per unit within the 7 -10km zone (i.e.  discounted by 50%)  
 
H.109  The contribution for tourism developments such as caravan parks will be adjusted to 
reflect closed seasons and evidence concerning occupancy rates. For  example, a  
two-month  closure during the winter would reduce the contribution by one  sixth,  from 
£615 to £513  per unit. Furthermore,  this figure may be proportionately reduced, 
where an applicant can provide robust evidence  (such as from Northumb erland 
Tourism) in respect of  average  occupancy rates in  the months a site is open 
(assuming less than 100% occupancy).  
 
How contributions will be spent  
 
H.110  The Coastal Mitigation Service  employs coastal rangers  who undertake a range of 
activities, with the a im of ensuring that further development within the coastal zone of 
influence does not increase recreational disturbance to SSSI or SPA birds or 
increase the spread  of pirri-pirri bur. In addition to a physical presence on the coast, 
the rangers use  a websi te and social media presence to keep promoting and 
reinforcing seasonally specific information such as the arrival of autumn migrants or 
the importance of winter high  tide roosts.  Contributions will also ensure robust 
monitoring protocols and governance ar rangements. Further details  can be 
found  in the Coastal Mitigation Service Strategy Document.  Appendix I: Monitoring and Implementation Framework   
370  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Proposals will be judged against all relevant policies.  
Northumberland Local Plan ( Adopted March 2022)  Appendix I: Monitoring and Implementation Framework  
 
Introduction  
 
I.1 The Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004  (as amended)124 and The Town & 
Country Planning (L ocal Planning) (England) Regulations 2012  (as amended)125, 
together with the National Planning Policy Framework  (NPPF)126 and Planning 
Practice Guidance  (PPG)127, require local authorities to monitor local plans and their 
policies on a regular (at least annual) basis. Furthermore, local authoriti es are legally 
required to formally review their local plans at least once every five years from the 
point of adoption to assess whether or not policies need updating, taking account of 
changing circumstances affecting the area (particularly any significan t changes in 
Local Housing Need that may affect relevant strategic policies) or any relevant 
changes in national policy. The PPG confirms that a local plan and its policies do not, 
however, automatically become out -of-date after five years.  
 
I.2 This Monitoring and Implementation Framework (MIF) sets out the principal 
measures and indicators that will be used to monitor the delivery and effectiveness of 
the sustainability objectives and planning policies of the Local Plan.  
 
I.3 The effects of some policies  are more suitably measured through contextual 
information and indicators (e.g. people in work), while others can be more precisely 
measured through developments undertaken (e.g. housebuilding completions and 
employment and retail floorspace created). The performance of other policies will be 
monitored through the granting or refusal of planning permissions.  
 
I.4 Some measures and indicators are suitable for frequent monitoring and reporting 
(e.g. where data is published annually), while others are less frequen t due to the 
nature of the data and the methods of collection (e.g. the national census every 10 
years which details a wide range of contextual socio -economic information about the 
County’s population).  
 
I.5 In line with PPG, the resources required for monitor ing the Local Plan nevertheless 
necessitate a proportionate approach. Hence, the overall assessment of how well the 
Plan’s vision and strategic objectives are being met and achieved will generally be 
undertaken on a five -yearly cycle to coincide with the r eview of the Plan itself, 
including a full range of contextual and specific development indicators.  
 
I.6 The Authority’s Monitoring Reports (AMR) and associated evidence base studies an d 
reports  provide a flexible means for monitoring over the plan period 2016 -2036, 
including progress with local plan preparation, policy implementation and delivery, 
activity relating to the Duty to Co -operate and information relating to indicators in the 
Plan. They can also cover measuring of the Housing Delivery Test and five -year 
supply of housing sites, as well as developer contributions gained and used (through 
Section 106 planning obligations and Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)). The 
AMR process c an therefore help to inform whether there is a likely need to undertake 
a partial or full update of the local plan through the at least five -yearly review.
