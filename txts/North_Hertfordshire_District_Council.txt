  SECTION ONE - INTRODUCTION AND 
CONTEXT  
1 Introduction 
1.1 Planning is about making important decisions affecting the environment and 
character of our towns, villages and countryside and ensuring that 
development happens in the right place at the right time. These decisions 
affect how we live and work and how we feel about places. 
1.2 The processes of preparing local plans and controlling development are firmly 
based within a legal framework set by the Government. The legislation and 
national planning advice state that all local authorities should have an up-to-
date local plan. The last District Local Plan was adopted in 1996. North 
Hertfordshire District Council’s new Local Plan directs where new 
development will take place across the plan area, describes what changes will 
occur and identifies how our towns and villages will be shaped in the future.  
1.3 This Local Plan seeks to address the key issues facing North Hertfordshire 
and will set a strategic vision and spatial strategy for the District over the 
period 2011 to 2031. The Local Plan contains five main sections, not including 
the appendices. A separate Local Plan Policies Map is published alongside 
the Local Plan to show the spatial implications of policies: 
 Section One: Introduction and Context  – This section explains the 
planning system and provides an overview of North Hertfordshire and the 
wider area. It also sets out the key challenges and issues facing the 
District. 
 Section Two: Spatial Strategy and Strategic Policies  – This section 
sets out the spatial strategy and vision for the future of the District and 
links this to the strategic policies which provide the guidance on the main 
issues that the Plan seeks to address. It sets out our overall approach to 
topics such as housing, employment, Green Belt and countryside. It also 
contains a separate policy for each of the Strategic Housing Sites (defined 
as sites of 500 or more homes) which will make a substantial contribution 
towards housing requirements over the plan period. 
 Section Three: Development Management Policies  – This section 
covers the detailed requirements that new development must meet to be 
granted planning permission. It includes issues such as open space, 
design and car parking.  
 Section Four: Communities  – This section sets out the site allocations 
for each community on a parish / town basis. It identifies the detailed site-
specific criteria for each local housing allocation. Retail and employment 
allocations are also identified.  
 Section Five: Implementation, Monitoring and Review  – This section 
sets out how the proposals in the Plan will be delivered. It identifies key 
supporting infrastructure and the partners that will help to deliver it. It sets 
out a monitoring framework that will be used to ensure that our vision and North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
10 
  strategic policies are being met and sets out an approach to a future 
review of the Plan. 
1.4 It is important to note that the policies and supporting text in this Plan are 
inter-related and need to be read together when considering a specific 
proposal or issue. This Local Plan supersedes the saved policies from the 
1996 North Hertfordshire District Local Plan No 2 (with Alterations). Appendix 
1 provides a list of policies that have been superseded. Appendix 2 provides a 
list of Local Plan designations as shown on the Policies Maps and where to 
view other designations which policies in the Local Plan refer. 
The Planning Framework 
National Policy and Guidance 
1.5 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)1 was first published in 2012 
and revised in 2018 and 2021. The NPPF sets out the Government’s planning 
policies for England and must be taken into account along with other national 
planning policy in the preparation of local and neighbourhood plans and in 
determining planning applications. The NPPF is supplemented by detailed 
Planning Practice Guidance (PPG), first released in 2014, which provides 
additional detail on certain topics. Local plans must be consistent with national 
planning policy to pass examination. This Local Plan has been prepared in 
accordance with the 2012 version of the NPPF. 
1.6 One of the key elements of the NPPF is the presumption in favour of 
sustainable development. Local plans must be based on and reflect the 
presumption and include clear policies setting out how the presumption 
should be applied locally. It also states that local plans should meet 
objectively assessed needs for housing, business and other requirements, 
with sufficient flexibility to adapt to rapid change, unless the adverse impacts 
of doing so would significantly outweigh the benefits or other specific policies 
in the NPPF indicate that development should be restricted.  
1.7 In relation to local plans, matters covered by the NPPF include (but are not 
limited to) requirements to: 
 Properly assess the need for new development (known as objectively 
assessed needs) and planning to meet these insofar as is consistent with 
the framework; 
 Where appropriate, carry out these assessments with regard to market 
areas which may cross administrative boundaries and ensuring that 
development needs across these wider areas are also met; 
 Protect existing Green Belt and only alter it in exceptional circumstances; 
 Identify what infrastructure will be required to support planned 
development;

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2  
 North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
11 
   Address issues such as climate change and ensure a positive approach to 
the conservation and enhancement of natural and historic environments; 
and 
 Where potential harm to relevant natural or historic assets may occur, 
consider this against the public benefits that may arise from any proposed 
development. 
Duty to co-operate 
1.8 Another important element of the National Planning Policy Framework is the 
Duty to Co-operate. The 'Duty-to-Co-operate' was introduced via the 2011 
Localism Act. Public bodies have a legal duty to co-operate on strategic 
planning issues that cross administrative boundaries, with local planning 
authorities working together to meet development requirements which cannot 
wholly be met within their own areas. Local planning authorities will be 
expected to demonstrate evidence of having effectively cooperated to plan for 
issues with cross-boundary impacts when their local plans are submitted for 
examination.  
1.9 The Council has sought to engage constructively and on an on-going basis 
with other neighbouring authorities and public bodies throughout the 
preparation of the Plan. This includes the joint commissioning and sharing of 
evidence base studies and the identification of infrastructure requirements. In 
particular, the Council has worked with Stevenage Borough Council, Luton 
Borough Council and Central Bedfordshire District Council in terms of 
addressing housing and employment requirements. The Council has also 
worked with Hertfordshire County Council and other national bodies in terms 
of transport and other infrastructure requirements.  
Relationship to Neighbourhood Plans 
1.10 Neighbourhood plans have been introduced by the Localism Act 2011 and 
enable local communities to shape development in their area. These are 
plans produced by a parish council or a neighbourhood forum. Towns and 
parishes also have the option of working together to prepare a joint 
neighbourhood plan. If a neighbourhood plan is prepared, independently 
examined, is supported by the Council and receives a majority vote in a 
referendum it becomes part of the statutory development plan for that 
neighbourhood and is used when determining planning applications, 
alongside the Local Plan.  
1.11 In order for a neighbourhood plan to become part of the statutory 
development plan for an area it must: 
 have appropriate regard to national policy and guidance; 
 contribute to the achievement of sustainable development; 
 be in general conformity with the strategic policies contained in the 
development plan for the area; and 
 not breach and be otherwise compatible with EU obligations. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
12 
  1.12 The first step in preparing a neighbourhood plan is to define a neighbourhood 
area. There are currently thirteen neighbourhood planning areas designated 
within the District with one further community considering preparing a 
neighbourhood plan. Four neighbourhood plans have been “made” and form 
part of the Development Plan; Pirton, Wymondley, Preston and the joint 
neighbourhood plan for Baldock, Bygrave & Clothall. Those plans under 
preparation include the parishes of Ashwell, Codicote, Barkway and 
Nuthampstead, Ickleford, Kimpton, Knebworth, St Ippolyts, St. Pauls Walden, 
and Wallington. In addition, a neighbourhood planning forum and planning 
area has been designated for the unparished area of Charlton.   
1.13 National policy makes it clear that once a neighbourhood plan has 
demonstrated its general conformity with the strategic policies of the relevant 
local plan, and has been brought into force, the policies it contains will take 
precedence over existing non-strategic policies in the local plan for that 
neighbourhood, where they are in conflict. 
1.14 This local plan clearly distinguishes between strategic and non-strategic 
policies to assist in the development and interpretation of Neighbourhood 
Plans. 
1.15 Local planning authorities have a general duty to support communities 
producing neighbourhood plans. The Council is committed to neighbourhood 
planning as a process and offers support and guidance to parish councils in 
preparation of their plans.  
Appraisals and Assessments 
1.16 The Local Plan must undergo a Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and a Strategic 
Environment Assessment (SEA) as part of its preparation. These are required 
under national law. SEA takes into consideration the likely impacts of the Plan 
on the environment. The SA appraises the likely significant environmental, 
social and economic effects of the proposed policies in the Plan and how 
these can be mitigated and controlled. These assessments are normally 
carried out as a single process and this approach has been taken. 
1.17 This Plan is accompanied by a sustainability appraisal report. The findings of 
the assessments have fed directly into the development of the policies. For 
the strategic policies reference is made in the Plan to the most important 
findings of the report. 
1.18 In preparing the Local Plan, we have also carried out a Habitat Regulations 
Screening Assessment to determine whether the Plan is likely to have any 
significant effects on known European wildlife habitat sites. This assessment 
concluded that, within the measures and safeguards included in this Plan, the North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
13 
  scale and type of development being proposed is unlikely to have a significant 
effect upon and European sites2. 
 
Statement of Community Involvement 
1.19 The Local Plan has been prepared following consultation with the local 
community in accordance with the Council's Statement of Community 
Involvement3 which sets out when the Council will consult the community in 
relation to the Local Plan, how the Council will engage with the community 
and who the Council will involve in that consultation. Consultation on the Local 
Plan has also been carried out in accordance with requirements set out in the 
Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012.  
Local Development Scheme 
1.20 The Local Plan has been prepared in accordance with the Council's Local 
Development Scheme4 which shows the programme for preparing this Local 
Plan and the timetable for its review. 
The Local Plan Evidence Base 
1.21 All local plans are required to have an evidence base to draw from during their 
preparation to ensure that accurate, robust and up-to-date information is 
available to formulate meaningful and effective policies. The Council has 
prepared a wide-ranging evidence base for the Local Plan. This is listed on 
the Council website and is updated on an ongoing basis.  
Previous Consultation 
1.22 The policies and proposals within this Local Plan have evolved through a 
number of previous consultation stages.  
1.23 Under new legislation in 2004 with the introduction of the Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act, the local plan process was renamed the ‘Local 
Development Framework’ (LDF). The contents of the LDF were guided by 
regional plans, formally known as Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS). These 
set out development targets and strategic policies for the local planning 
authorities in their area. North Hertfordshire was located within the East of 
England region and an RSS for this area was adopted in 2008.

  1.24 The Council published several consultation papers as part of the LDF 
between 2005-2009 to conform to the emerging and adopted proposals of the 
RSS, including: 
 Core Strategy and Development Policies Issues & Options (2005); 
 Core Strategy Preferred Options (2007); 
 Development Policies Preferred Options (2007); 
 Stevenage & North Herts Action Plan Issues and Options (2007, jointly 
with Stevenage Borough Council); 
 Land Allocations Issues & Options (2008); and 
 Land Allocations Additional Suggested Sites Issues & Options (2009) 
1.25 The publication of the NPPF in March 2012, followed by the eventual 
revocation of the East of England Plan in January 2013 effectively ‘reset the 
clock’ for North Hertfordshire’s Local Plan. A decision was made to merge the 
work on the emerging core strategy and the land allocations into a single local 
plan. As a consequence of these events, the Council became responsible for 
determining strategic planning matters formerly set out in the RSS, such as 
the setting of housing targets for the area.  
1.26 Since March 2012, the Council has carried out three public consultations on a 
new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire. Given the significant changes above, 
it is these consultations that are viewed as marking the formal preparation of 
this Plan. This was in response to the evidence work carried out in assessing 
the objectively assessed need for housing and requiring consultation on 
proposed housing sites. These included the:  
 Housing Options Growth Levels and Locations 2011-2031 (February 2013) 
 Housing Additional Local Options (July 2013); and 
 Local Plan Preferred Options (December 2014) 
1.27 All three of these consultations saw relatively strong responses from 
residents, businesses, organisations, elected representatives and other 
stakeholders. All representations have been assessed and summarised and 
have been key in shaping this document. The Statement of Consultation5 sets 
out how the Council has taken into account the comments it has received and 
forms part of the Council’s evidence base. 
1.28 Further consultation was undertaken on the Inspector’s Proposed Main 
Modifications in 2019 and 2021.

  2 A Picture of North Hertfordshire  
Figure 1: North Hertfordshire in Context: 
 
2.1 North Hertfordshire is a predominantly rural district covering approximately 
375 square kilometres of land and is the most northern district within the 
County of Hertfordshire. The District is bounded by eight local authority areas 
– Stevenage, East Hertfordshire, St. Albans and Welwyn Hatfield within 
Hertfordshire, but also Luton, Central Bedfordshire, South Cambridgeshire 
and Uttlesford (Essex). Stevenage and Luton are relatively small in size and 
primarily urban by nature. 
2.2 North Hertfordshire is characterised by a number of small to medium sized 
towns with a range of facilities and smaller settlements located within open 
countryside. The main settlements within North Hertfordshire are Hitchin, 
Baldock, Royston and the world’s first Garden City, Letchworth, each 
representing a significant focus for employment and housing. Most of the 
Great Ashby estate on the edge of Stevenage lies in North Hertfordshire. 
There are also about 40 villages and hamlets. Although there is no one 
dominant centre serving the District, there is a high degree of 
interdependency between the various towns and villages, as well as with 
surrounding larger towns like Stevenage, Luton, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, 
Welwyn Garden City and London. 
2.3 A large proportion of the rural area of the District is covered by Green Belt, 
with the remainder classified as rural area beyond the Green Belt. North 
Hertfordshire has two areas of Green Belt, the London Metropolitan Green 
Belt covering Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, Baldock, Stevenage and 
North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
16 
  nearby settlements, and the Luton Green Belt covering parts of the west of 
the District6.  
2.4 The District is strategically positioned with good rail and road connections. It is 
less than 40 miles from central London. The five railway stations within North 
Hertfordshire provide direct services north to Peterborough, north-east to 
Cambridge and King’s Lynn, and south to London and Hertford. There are 
also services to Stevenage that offers access to the North East and Scotland. 
However, no rail links from the District to the west exist, meaning towns like 
Luton and Milton Keynes are less accessible via public transport. 
2.5 The A1 linking London to the North also passes through the District, as does 
the A505 running from east to west. Other main roads serving the local 
authority area include the A600, A602 and A507, while the two airports of 
Stansted and Luton are also situated in close proximity to the District as 
shown on Figure 2 below.

  Demographic Profile7 
Population & Distribution 
2.6 North Hertfordshire is a diverse area. The total population figure for North 
Hertfordshire, from the 2019 Mid-Year Estimates, was 133,570 (males = 
65,382 and females = 68,188)8. Over 70% of the population live in the four 
main settlements of Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, Royston and Baldock. 
2.7 The District age profile shows that there is a lower proportion of 15-29 year 
olds than in Hertfordshire (North Hertfordshire 14.9% compared to 16.6% in 
the county). However, the proportion of people in the District in the 30 – 54 
age group mirrors the proportion in the county as a whole (North Hertfordshire 
35.1% compared to 34.9% for Hertfordshire)9. 
2.8 Official statistics indicate that the population is likely to increase over the next 
10 years by nearly 9,000 residents (population estimate at 2031 – 146,500)10. 
This is due to a combination of factors, including people living longer, changes 
in social patterns, and the attractiveness of the District as a place to live. This 
will put considerable pressure not just on our housing numbers but on vital 
social support mechanisms such as schools and GP surgeries as well as our 
transport infrastructure. 
Ethnicity 
2.9 The District has a diverse population, with a black and minority ethnic 
population comprising 10.5% of the total population, compared with 14.6% for 
England, and 9.2% for the East of England region.  
Economic Activity and Inactivity 
2.10 More than 8 in 10 (87.6%) of North Hertfordshire’s 16-64 year olds are 
economically active (in or seeking employment) compared to a national figure 
of 79% 11. The unemployment rate in North Hertfordshire is 2.8%; this is 
below the East of England figure (3.6%) and below the national rate (4.2%)12. 
Approximately 1 in 5 (12.4%) of North Hertfordshire’s 16-64 year olds are 
economically inactive13. 
 
7 Summary of the demographic profile of North Hertfordshire is based on data taken from nationally 
recognised sources such as the Office for National Statistics, NOMIS, Sport England and Experian.

Deprivation 
2.11 According to the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation, North Hertfordshire is 
relatively affluent compared to other local authority areas. The District ranks 
269th out of 317 local authority areas in England (1 being the most 
deprived)14. None of the District’s population lives in areas within the bottom 
10% of Super Output Areas (SOA) nationally, i.e. in the most deprived parts of 
the country. North Hertfordshire does however have five areas in the next two 
cohorts, i.e. those which are in the top 30% are seen as being most deprived, 
this includes one area in Hitchin and four in Letchworth Garden City.  
Health 
2.12 On the whole the quality of life in North Hertfordshire is good. Life expectancy 
in North Hertfordshire is similar to the national figure; the male rate is currently 
81 years compared to 79.8 years for England, and the female equivalent is 
84.3 years compared to 83.7 years nationally. Life expectancy is 4.7 years 
lower for men in the most deprived areas of North Hertfordshire than in the 
least deprived areas15. 
2.13 Projected population changes for North Hertfordshire to 2031 and beyond 
shows the impact that higher life expectancy has in regard to the age of the 
general population, with a higher proportion of our residents living between 
the 70 to 90+ age bands who will require differing degrees of support in terms 
of health and social care.  
2.14 Adult and child obesity rates in North Hertfordshire are below the national and 
regional averages. Adult obesity rates in the District at 2020 were 58.2% of all 
adults compared with a national rate of 62.3% which still presents a key 
challenge for the District16.  
Economy 
2.15 Like most areas North Hertfordshire did not escape the detrimental effects of 
the economic downturn in 2009 and many variables including unemployment 
and job growth figures suffered as result. Figures have only recently returned 
to pre-2008 levels and the local employment environment is improving and 
the figures are moving in the right direction. It is estimated that there are 
around 54,000 jobs17 in North Hertfordshire. 
2.16 There is a higher concentration of people working in the District employed in 
sectors such as manufacturing, construction, retail, motor trades, property, 
entertainment and recreation. Many higher skilled residents commute out of 
the District for employment. Nonetheless sectors such as finance & insurance

  and information & communication make a substantial contribution to the 
District’s overall economic output, although not employing a huge number of 
people. These represent opportunities for future expansion and 
development18. 
2.17 The District hosts a number of internationally important businesses in the 
environmental technologies, insurance and electronics, as well as companies 
in pharmaceutical technologies, advanced engineering. Information 
technology and in the service and business support sectors.  
2.18 The District has a working age population of 81,600 of which 76,700 are 
economically active. The majority of these are employees and work full-time 
but a small proportion of the population are self employed (10.5%).  
2.19 In 2020, the median gross pay for full time employees was £644.10 per week 
which compares favourably with the national average of £586.70. 
2.20 16.65% of the population do not have access to a car. This is much lower 
than the national figure (25.8%) and slightly lower than regionally (16.93%).  
Housing 
2.21 At the start of the plan period in 2011, there were approximately 55,000 
homes in North Hertfordshire. Almost one-quarter of homes in North 
Hertfordshire were detached houses. This proportion was slightly higher than 
both the Hertfordshire county and national figures. Conversely, the proportion 
of flats (including converted houses) was slightly lower19.  
2.22 House prices in the District are well above the regional and national averages, 
although slightly below the average for Hertfordshire which is skewed 
significantly upwards by prices in areas such as St Albans. The average cost 
of a home in the District is around £355,000, meaning prices are around 44% 
higher than the national average20. 
2.23 Plainly, these district-wide figures mask some fairly significant variations 
within and between North Hertfordshire’s towns and villages. 
2.24 In the ten-year period preceding this Plan, almost 5,500 new homes were 
built. The level of housing completions was highest over the period 2001-
2008. On average, more than 600 homes were built each year during this 
period, with more than 700 new homes built in both 2001/02 and 2007/08. 
However, the completion of work at Great Ashby coincided with the financial 
‘crash’ and general downturn in the property market. Since 2008, housing 
completion rates in the District have almost halved to around 330 new homes 
per year21.

  2.25 There are currently more than 2,100 households on the local authority 
housing register awaiting assistance with their housing needs22. 
Natural and Built Environment 
Natural environment 
2.26 The natural environment of North Hertfordshire contributes to its character 
and distinctiveness. North Hertfordshire has a diverse range of green 
infrastructure and environmental assets of local, regional and national 
importance. This includes Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Local 
Nature Reserves (LNRs), Wildlife Sites, protected trees and woodlands, 
extensive areas of agricultural land, minerals reserves, rivers, floodplains, and 
a comprehensive network of open space. 
2.27 North Hertfordshire comprises a broad band of attractive undulating 
countryside following the chalk escarpment of the Chiltern Hills. This ridge 
forms the watershed between the river basins of the Thames and The Wash. 
The highest point is Telegraph Hill at Lilley, at 184m above sea level and the 
lowest point of 32m above sea level is where the River Rhee leaves the 
District north of Ashwell. Most of the rural area is farmland, although there is 
some woodland, especially in the west of the District. Part of the District is 
within the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty located to the far 
north west, an area designated for its nationally significant landscape.  
2.28 The District contains a variety of habitats for wildlife and plants, including 
areas of high biodiversity - notably the chalk grasslands and chalky boulder 
clay woodlands and meadows in the east of the District, the oak and 
hornbeam woodlands in the west and the wet meadows and fens along the 
River Hiz and tributaries. 
2.29 North Hertfordshire is located at the head of both Great Ouse and Thames 
river catchments and as a result fluvial flooding is not a huge issue based on 
the size and flow of the watercourses. Of greater significance is surface and 
groundwater flooding associated with historic settlement pattern topography. 
Also of concern is the potential for pollution of watercourses linked to the lack 
of dilution in the river environment. Additionally, North Hertfordshire is 
identified as an area of water stress.  
2.30 Minerals such as sand, gravel, crushed rock, chalk and clay are an important 
natural resource locally. The southern part of the District falls within a sand 
and gravel belt which stretches across Hertfordshire from Bishops Stortford to 
Hemel Hempstead. This provides the raw minerals required for constructing 
and maintaining roads, buildings and other infrastructure. Hertfordshire 
County Council is responsible for minerals planning for Hertfordshire.

  Built Environment 
2.31 The settlements of Hitchin, Baldock and Royston are all historic market towns 
each with their own distinctive character. Letchworth Garden City is based on 
Ebenezer Howard’s original concept of a self-contained settlement combining 
both town and country living. Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and Baldock lie 
very close to each other and have strong relationships in terms of housing 
markets and job movements. All four towns are service centres with a range 
of shops, jobs and community facilities that serve their respective rural 
hinterlands. The District has 35 civil parishes and three unparished areas 
(Baldock, Hitchin and Letchworth Garden City). The Communities Chapter 
provides more detail on each of the towns and rural settlements across north 
Hertfordshire.  
2.32 All the towns and many of the villages have historic areas and buildings; there 
are 40 conservation areas and approximately 2750 listed buildings. There are 
also a number of registered historic parks and gardens. The District has a 
long history of human habitation and is crossed by the prehistoric Icknield 
Way. It also contains many ancient monuments, including the iron age 
Ravensburgh Castle at Hexton, the largest fort in south-east England. 
2.33 It is important for the Council to review and understand changes and trends in 
its economy and local population and associated pressures on its 
environment. The Spatial Strategy and policies in this Plan make provision for 
guiding development, improving and providing for facilities for the future, 
whilst protecting and enhancing the natural and historic environment. This 
cannot be done in isolation without understanding cross boundaries issues 
and working with key agencies.  
Relationship with Other Plans and Strategies 
2.34 In preparing this Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, we also need to consider 
how it relates to, and affects, the wider area and the plans of other local 
authorities and agencies, including taking into consideration our own district 
plans and strategies. 
Wider Area Plans and Strategies 
2.35 The plan has been developed in consultation with nearby councils and other 
bodies under the duty to co-operate. National policy is clear that development 
should be co-ordinated across wider 'market areas' for both housing and 
employment. These are zones that share similar characteristics in terms of 
house prices, commuting patterns or the costs of business premises. They will 
not necessarily follow administrative boundaries and authorities should work 
together to try and meet development needs across these areas.23  
 
23 Paragraphs 47, 159 and 160 of the 2012 NPPF. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
22 
  2.36 The evidence work that supports this Local Plan has defined both the Housing 
Market Areas24 and Functional Economic Market Area in which North 
Hertfordshire sits25. 
Housing Market Areas and Strategic Housing Market Assessment 
2.37 The District Council has worked collaboratively with six other authorities to 
identify Housing Market Areas in Bedfordshire and surrounding areas . This 
identifies that the substantial majority of North Hertfordshire (98.7%) lies in a 
housing market area stretching from Welwyn Garden City, through and across 
the District to the Cambridgeshire borders and into Bedfordshire. This covers 
all of Stevenage’s administrative area, smaller parts of Welwyn Hatfield, 
Central Bedfordshire and East Hertfordshire and a minimal area within South 
Cambridgeshire. This functional HMA has a population of around 350,000 and 
is referred to as the Stevenage HMA. This area is shown green in figure 3 
over the page.  
2.38 The small area to the west of the District, including Hexton, Lilley and 
Breachwood Green, lies within a different housing market area centred on 
Luton. This HMA covers all of Luton’s administrative area, a substantial area 
of Central Bedfordshire and a small area of Aylesbury Vale. This functional 
HMA has a population of around 323,000 and is referred to as the Luton 
HMA.  
2.39 The HMA geography informed the preparation of Strategic Housing Market 
Assessments (SHMA) which were completed on a ‘best fit’ basis by groups of 
local authorities. The Council prepared a joint SHMA26 with Stevenage which, 
at the time of the plan’s submission, identified an objectively assessed need 
(OAN) for 13,800 homes in North Hertfordshire and 7,600 homes within 
Stevenage over the period 2011-2031. Further Government household 
projections were released during the examination and a revised assessment 
for North Hertfordshire identified an OAN of 11,500 homes27. The plans of 
both authorities show that their individual housing needs can be 
accommodated in full within their administrative areas.  
2.40 The Council has also been involved in the SHMA prepared for Luton and 
Central Bedfordshire28. The identified need for housing in this area is 
significant.

  Figure 3: Housing Market Areas  
The majority of North Hertfordshire (outlined in red) falls within the Stevenage Housing Market Area 
(shown green). A small area to the west of the district falls within the Luton Housing Market Area 
(shown yellow) 
2.41 Luton’s plan and associated evidence base identifies a requirement for 
approximately 18,000 homes in the Borough but has capacity for just 8,500. 
The most recent projections for Luton did not lead to a meaningful change in 
the housing situation presented in Luton’s adopted Plan. The issue of unmet 
needs from Luton is therefore a significant matter to be considered under the 
Duty to Co-operate. 
2.42 The Council’s own evidence base establishes with sufficient certainty that 
there are sites within North Hertfordshire which could contribute towards 
these needs, and the approach proposed for our own Plan will maximise the 
amount of housing that can reasonably be accommodated within this part of 
the Luton HMA that falls within the District. 
Functional Economic Market Area 
2.43 The Functional Economic Market Area (FEMA) covers a similar area to the 
Stevenage HMA. Our evidence shows that Stevenage, North Hertfordshire 
and the eastern half of Central Bedfordshire form a clearly defined FEMA that 
North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
24 
  stretches along the A1 corridor29. 70% of people that work in this area, also 
live here. The economic profiles of the three areas are complementary while 
commercial property market data does not suggest that nearby commercial 
property markets, such as Luton, Bedford or Watford, extend this far). The 
FEMA is shown in figure 4 below. 
2.44 The FEMA considers the employment strategies of the associated authorities 
and the overall supply of jobs and employment land and future employment 
requirements that could arise from changes to future commuting patterns. It 
concludes that there will be a requirement for additional employment land to 
be provided within the FEMA to meet Stevenage’s growth which cannot be 
met within their own administrative boundary.

  Hertfordshire Plans and Strategies 
2.45 A number of key plans and strategies are produced at a county level to which 
the Council should have regard to in preparing the Local Plan. Key amongst 
these are the: 
 Strategic Economic Plan, 2017 - 2030 of the Hertfordshire Local 
Enterprise Partnership (LEP).  
 Hertfordshire Local Nature Partnership 
 Hertfordshire Waste and Minerals Local Plans 
 Hertfordshire Local Transport Plan 
Hertfordshire LEP 
2.46 In October 2013 the Hertfordshire LEP published their Strategic Economic Plan 
for the county which was refreshed in July 2017. This strategy sets out the 
LEPs vision, that by 2030, Hertfordshire will be the leading economy at the 
heart of the UKs Golden Triangle, which encompasses Cambridge, Oxford and 
London. To deliver the vision, the LEP has identified a number of priority 
areas, which represent major opportunities for Hertfordshire. These include: 
 Maintaining Hertfordshire's global excellence in science and technology;  
 Harnessing Hertfordshire's relationship with London (and elsewhere);  
 Re-invigorating Hertfordshire's places for the 21st Century; and 
 Building the wider foundations for growth across both businesses and 
people. 
2.47 The aim of the strategy is to promote growth in the county and ensure that 
Hertfordshire is perfectly placed for business. The plan focuses on three key 
growth corridors. North Hertfordshire lies within the A1 (M) corridor. 
2.48 The Hertfordshire LEP is responsible for bidding and prioritising infrastructure 
investment within the county.  
Hertfordshire Local Nature Partnership  
2.49 The purpose of the Hertfordshire LNP is to ensure the county's natural 
environment is fully considered and valued in local decision making and that it 
delivers benefits for wildlife, people, landscapes and the local economy. To this 
end the LNP has prepared a strategy covering the period from 2013 to 
2016, which identifies the following priorities for Hertfordshire: 
 Healthy and resilient ecological networks; 
 Delivering health and wellbeing through the natural environment;  
 Sustainable economic growth through the natural environment; and  
 Water for people and wildlife. 
2.50 Underpinning the strategy is the need to deliver new green infrastructure 
and to protect/ enhance existing green infrastructure. To support growth in North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
26 
  Hertfordshire local authorities will need to work together and with the LNP to 
achieve this. 
Hertfordshire Waste Local Plan 
2.51 The Hertfordshire Waste Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies Development Plan Document (DPD) adopted in 2012, covers the 
period from 2011 to 2026. These documents set out the spatial vision and 
strategic objectives for waste planning in Hertfordshire up to 2026 and also 
contain the policies needed to implement these objectives, along with 
detailed generic development management policies that will be used to make 
decisions on waste planning applications.  
2.52 This document is supported by the Waste Site Allocations (WSA) DPD 
which was adopted in 2014 and identifies sites for waste management 
facilities across the county. In addition to the Waste Local Plan, the County 
Council has produced Supplementary Planning Document for Employment Land 
Areas of Search for new waste management facilities, reflecting that designated 
Employment Land Areas are often an appropriate location for waste 
management uses.  
2.53 When planning for new growth in North Hertfordshire, it will be necessary to 
have regard to this document when considering the implications of new 
development on waste disposal. 
Hertfordshire Minerals Local Plan 
2.54 The Hertfordshire Minerals Local Plan adopted in 2007 covers the period 
2002 -2016. Policy 5 of that plan sets out the approach to minerals 
sterilisation. These have been taken into account in the selection of sites in 
this Plan. The County Council has commenced a review of the Minerals Local 
Plan.  
2.55 The County Council’s adopted Mineral Consultation Area Supplementary 
Planning Document identifies areas of the district where particular care is 
needed to prevent the unnecessary sterilisation of sand and gravel resources.  
2.56 In order to prevent sterilisation of mineral resources the council and 
developers will consider the effect of future development on mineral resources 
in these areas at an early stage and seek the advice of Hertfordshire County 
Council as the Mineral Planning Authority in accordance with the Minerals 
Consultation Area SPD (and any future revisions/successor). 
Hertfordshire Local Transport Plan 
2.57 The County Council is also the Highway Authority with responsibility for 
transport matters. This Plan supports key priorities and proposals from the 
Hertfordshire Local Transport Plan (LTP4) adopted in 2018. LTP4 sets out the 
transport strategy for Hertfordshire (over the period from 2018 to 2031), the 
goals and challenges to be met, and outlines a programme of transport North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
27 
  schemes and initiatives to be delivered subject to available funding. The LTP 
covers all modes of transport - including walking, cycling, public transport, 
car based travel and freight - and takes account of the effect of transport 
on wider aspects including the economy, environment, climate change and 
social inclusion. 
2.58 It will therefore be necessary to both have regard to this strategy and work 
with the Highway Authority when taking forward the development sites set out 
in the Local Plan.  
District Plans and Strategies 
2.59 The Local Plan is a key Council document. It is the spatial expression of the 
District’s priorities and development needs going forward. It provides the 
planning framework to support the priorities identified in other Council plans 
and programmes including the Council Plan 2022 – 2027, and other Council 
strategies covering economic development, housing, leisure, climate change, 
environment and waste.  
North Hertfordshire Council Plan 
2.60 The North Hertfordshire Council Plan 2022 – 2027 sets out the Council’s 
vision and corporate objectives for the District. The council’s vision set out in 
the Council Plan is: 
“We put people first and deliver sustainable services, to enable a brighter 
future together” 
2.61 The Council plan sets out the priorities that the Council will address over the 
next five years. The plan also lays out how North Hertfordshire District Council 
will achieve its aims for the district. 
2.62 The Council Plan explains the Council’s co-operative values and sets out 
three priorities: 
 People First  People make North Herts work. We value all our residents, 
businesses, staff, contractors, councillors, and other partners, and place 
them at the heart of everything we do.  
 Sustainability  We recognise the challenges our towns and district as a 
whole face and are committed to delivering services which are relevant 
and sustainable. In doing so we will place our environmental 
responsibilities, as well as sound financial planning, at the centre of our 
policy making.  
 A Brighter Future Together  We are far-sighted and plan for the long term 
to secure the best outcomes for our people, towns and villages, and the 
local economy, ensuring North Herts continues to thrive. 
 
 North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
28 
  North Hertfordshire Economic Development Strategy 
2.63 ‘Productive North Herts’ the Council’s economic development strategy 
adopted in September 2015 covers the period 2015 to 2025. The Strategy 
identifies a number of priorities that will provide a more coordinated and 
focussed approach to the needs of the local economy, and at the same time 
links to the Council’s corporate objective to promote sustainable growth within 
our District. The Strategy and its associated Action Plan seek to guide 
economic activities across the District whilst also providing the basis for 
greater connection with the business community and key stakeholders. It 
recognises the need to work in partnership with key stakeholders to support 
and grow new and existing businesses and to attract inward investment.  
Other relevant plans and Strategies 
2.64 The spatial implications of other plans and strategies have been taken into 
account in the preparation of this Local Plan. These include the investment 
plans of key infrastructure and utilities providers including Network Rail, 
Highways England and Thames Water, emerging local plans of neighbouring 
authorities, the public health strategy for Hertfordshire and relevant European 
directives and requirements that need to be incorporated. Of particular 
relevance to this Plan is the Water Framework Directive, which seeks to 
improve the quality of all water bodies as well as those directives relating the 
protection of key species and the environmental assessment of relevant plans 
and strategies. 
Key Challenges and Opportunities for North Hertfordshire  
2.65 There are a number of challenges facing North Hertfordshire over the next 15 
years which the Local Plan will need to address in terms of national policy and 
at the District and local level. There are also a number of opportunities 
associated with development which the Council should seek to utilise for the 
benefit of the District as a whole.  
2.66 The National Planning Policy Framework states that the purpose of the 
planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable 
development. It also identifies a need for the planning system to perform an 
economic role, a social role and an environmental role, if sustainable 
development is to be achieved30. These roles give rise to many issues and 
challenges for the District.  
2.67 The key challenges are: 
 Identifying and delivering the most sustainable forms and patterns of 
development around the District, 
 Providing the right type and level of growth to meet the needs of the 
District and considering the strategic needs of adjoining authorities, 
 
30 Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
29 
   Protecting and enhancing the environment and encouraging the prudent 
use of resources, and 
 Creating places where people want to live, work and spend their leisure 
time. 
2.68 In addressing these key challenges the following issues will need to be taken 
into account. 
2.69 Our evidence states that North Hertfordshire needs to provide a significant 
number of homes and jobs over the plan period. We also need to ensure that 
our Plan helps meet development requirements in market areas that cross our 
administrative boundaries.  Managing the growth of the economy, housing 
and meeting the needs of our existing communities, against a backdrop of 
financial constraint, are key issues for the District. 
2.70 Some of the sites to be developed will be substantial new communities. Each 
will need careful planning to ensure that the development is properly 
integrated into the surrounding area, has the appropriate level of facilities on 
site and mitigates its impact on the local area. The most appropriate way to 
achieve this is, is through the preparation of masterplans with relevant bodies 
and joint plans where sites are close to or straddle the district boundary with 
neighbouring authorities.  
2.71 The population is increasing, migration levels have been high in recent years, 
more people are living on their own, people are living longer and household 
sizes are becoming smaller all of which creates a high demand for housing 
and places additional pressure on community facilities. In addition the market 
cost of housing is increasingly out of reach for many households. There is 
also a need for more affordable housing.  
2.72 The District is generally prosperous with lower levels of unemployment than 
the national average, and some areas of North Hertfordshire are amongst the 
most deprived in Hertfordshire. There is a need for job growth to continue to 
support the local economy and meet the needs of a growing population. 
2.73 Recent changes in planning legislation and policy mean the Council does not 
have the same ability to protect the supply of employment land for the future.  
2.74 A number of our employment areas are tired and dated and are in need of 
investment. There are also access issues with some employment areas as 
well as infrastructure constraints across the District and wider area. 
2.75 There is a need to ensure that our town centres remain vibrant in a changing 
and volatile retail environment. The nature of our town centres has also 
transformed with changing shopping patterns and practices.  There is a need 
to be more flexible in our approach towards the changing needs of our town 
centres whilst ensuring that they retain their market share in supporting their 
local communities.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
30 
  2.76 Transport connections from north to south are strong with the main road and 
rail routes radiating from London. Links from east to west are generally less 
well developed placing pressures on local routes and rural roads are being 
used as cut-throughs, particularly in the western part of the District between 
Stevenage, Luton and Hitchin. 
2.77 The District has a considerable daily outflow of commuters, to highly skilled 
employment areas mainly in central London but also to the high tech and 
development industries which surround Cambridge. Working in partnership 
with the Local Enterprise Partnerships, the business sector, and other key 
stakeholders will help identify opportunities for inward investment to increase 
our employment base and encourage new enterprise. 
2.78 Improving physical and mental health is a key element of quality of life. The 
need to plan for new development creates the opportunity to build in the 
infrastructure and facilities for 'healthy living' from the start as well as 
providing opportunities to improve existing facilities, social networks and 
infrastructure.  
2.79 Infrastructure that may be needed to accommodate this growth across the 
District includes; schools, surgeries, community buildings and sports facilities 
as well as roads, energy and sewerage. This is likely to require considerable 
inward investment to overcome issues related to transportation, health care, 
education and the provision of more new homes. 
2.80 Inward investment can be secured through the planning system but only if it 
does not compromise the viability of new development. The Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan31 (IDP) prepared alongside this Plan identifies the infrastructure 
requirements, cost, timing, potential funding mechanisms and responsibilities 
for delivery. 
2.81 The quality of the District’s natural and historic environment, its open spaces 
and countryside are highly valued by its residents. Protecting these areas and 
assets for the future alongside balancing the needs for development and 
ensuring suitable mitigation measures are put in place to reduce their impact 
will need to be addressed through the policies in the Plan.  
2.82 Housing and economic growth is likely to lead to an increase in overall 
greenhouse gas emissions arising from domestic, transport and industrial 
sectors. It is also likely to lead to an increase in overall water consumption, 
and the associated need to treat waste water. 
2.83 Changes to legislation and national planning policy in 2015 and 2016 mean 
that the CO2 and water performance of new dwellings is now governed by 
Building Regulations L, with changes to the Building Regulations in 2022 and 
2025 expected to bring in tighter standards for CO2 emissions. 
 
31 North Hertfordshire Infrastructure Delivery Plan September 2016 (updated 2018) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
31 
  2.84 Any new development will need to be located in places which have good 
access to jobs, shops, services and public transport and also provide 
opportunities to travel by foot or on a bike. Provision of measures for water 
conservation, improved biodiversity, increasing energy efficiency of new 
development, and renewable energy can help to ensure that development is 
more sustainable.

  SECTION TWO - SPATIAL STRATEGY AND 
STRATEGIC POLICIES 
3 Spatial Strategy and Spatial Vision 
3.1 The spatial strategy sets out our overall approach for sustainable 
development and growth and how this will be distributed across the District. 
The key components of the strategy are meeting future housing needs and 
supporting economic growth as well as making provision for infrastructure and 
services whilst protecting the natural and historic environment. 
3.2 In preparing our spatial strategy a number of options have been considered 
through the SA/SEA32 process, this includes identifying policy options for how 
the District should develop, and in particular where development should 
happen, and how much development there should be.  
3.3 Our spatial strategy is one of promoting sustainable development by 
supporting the use of suitably located previously developed land and buildings 
and by focusing  the majority of development on our towns (including urban 
extensions) in order to make maximum use  of existing facilities, social 
networks and infrastructure, and maximise opportunities to deliver new 
infrastructure. It also allows for some growth of our villages in order to allow 
those communities to continue to thrive. 
3.4 Our vision for the District, strategic objectives and strategic policies together 
with their supporting text sets out our Spatial Strategy.  
Spatial Vision 
3.5 Having identified the main challenges facing North Hertfordshire, this section 
sets out the spatial vision for North Hertfordshire.  The vision is a statement of 
what North Hertfordshire will be like in 2031. 
3.6 In developing the vision we have had regard to the Council’s aspirations set 
out in its Corporate Plan, other organisations strategies and plans and to the 
views expressed by organisations and individuals to previous consultations on 
the preparation of this Plan. 
Vision 
 By 2031 North Hertfordshire will be an attractive and vibrant place where 
people will want to live, work and spend their leisure time. 
 A mixture of quality new homes including affordable houses with a 
choice of te nure catering for the needs of North Hertfordshire’s residents 
 
32 Sustainability Appraisal of the North Hertfordshire Local Plan (CAG, 2022) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
36 
  and, where appropriate, the wider housing market, will be provided in 
appropriate sustainable locations.   
 New development will have contributed to the creation of sustainable 
communities.  These are safe, attractive and inclusive; well-integrated 
into settlements; respect local distinctiveness; raise the standards of 
sustainable design and architectural quality; make a positive contribution 
to the local area; and ensure the protection, restoration and 
enhancement of valuable natural and historic resources. Strategic and 
significant sites will have been masterplanned in accordance with the 
guiding principles set out within this Plan. 
 New development will help to maintain and enhance the vibrancy of 
existing settlements, enabling the towns and villages to embrace their 
roles within the District’s settlement hierarchy and provide an enhanced 
variety of new housing, employment opportunities and essential 
infrastructure that is of benefit to existing and future residents.  
 North Hertfordshire will have a robust and prosperous economy 
(including sustainable tourism) with a greater mix of skilled jobs, focused 
in locations that best support the District’s growing population.  Local 
and smaller scale businesses will have had the opportunity to thrive and 
grow.  
 The vitality and viability of the towns of Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, 
Royston and Baldock are safeguarded in a way that takes account of 
their distinctive role. This will have been achieved through carefully 
planned development which meets the needs of these centres, retaining 
their market share in terms of their retail offer, whilst recognising the 
importance of preserving and enhancing their historic character. In local 
and village centres shopping facilities that meet local needs will be 
supported.  
 The District’s important natural and historic areas and buildings that help 
to create the distinctive identity of the District in both urban and rural 
areas will have been protected and enhanced where possible. The 
quality and attractiveness of the landscape of North Hertfordshire, which 
contributes to its distinctive character, will have been conserved and 
enhanced where possible. New green infrastructure will have enhanced 
the network of green corridors linking settlements to the open 
countryside, providing greater opportunities for healthy lifestyles.  
 The rich biodiversity and geodiversity of North Hertfordshire will have 
been protected and enhanced where possible. Where new development 
could potentially have an adverse impact on biodiversity and 
geodiversity, measures will have been taken to ensure that the impact 
was either avoided or mitigated.  
 North Hertfordshire will have a range of community, leisure, cultural and 
recreational facilities in locations that are accessible to the local 
population, creating cohesive communities that recognise the needs of 
the older population; and enhance the opportunities for children and 
young people. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
37 
   The District will play its part in addressing climate change by improving 
opportunities for travelling by public transport, walking and cycling, using 
natural resources more efficiently, reducing the demand for water, 
securing high quality sustainable design and managing the risk of 
flooding.  
 By working in partnership with service providers, government bodies, the 
Local Enterprise Partnership, developers, other local authorities and 
other key bodies we will ensure the timely delivery of necessary 
supporting infrastructure. 
 
Strategic Objectives 
3.7 The strategic objectives provide the link between our vision for the District and 
the strategic policies set out in the Local Plan.  
 Environmental: 
ENV1 Direct development towards the most sustainable locations 
which seek to maintain the existing settlement pattern. 
ENV2 Protect and enhance the historic character of North 
Hertfordshire’s towns, villages, hamlets and landscape by 
promoting good design that creates a distinctive sense of place. 
ENV3 Protect, maintain and enhance the District’s historic and natural 
environment, its cultural assets and network of open spaces, 
urban and rural landscapes. 
ENV4 Mitigate the effects of climate change by encouraging the use of 
sustainable construction techniques, the appropriate use of 
renewable energy technologies and reducing the risk of flooding.  
ENV5 Reduce water consumption, increase biodiversity and protect 
and enhance the quality of existing environmental assets by 
enhancing new green spaces and networks of green space for 
both recreation and wildlife.

retail roles of our town centres ensuring that they remain 
competitive and attractive for modern-day use. 
ECON5 Support and enhance local businesses, services and facilities in 
urban and rural areas through tourism. 
ECON6 Sustain the vitality of our villages and the rural economy in 
supporting rural diversification whilst ensuring development is of 
an appropriate scale and character.

encourage journeys to be made by sustainable means of 
transport to ease congestion, reduce carbon emissions and the 
impacts on air quality management areas.  
ECON8 Ensure all development is supported by the necessary provision 
of, or improvements to infrastructure, services and facilities in an 
effective and timely manner to make development sustainable 
and minimise its effect upon existing communities  
 Social: 
SOC1 Identify locations for a range of types and tenures of homes, 
including affordable homes, to meet identified needs and 
provide adequate housing for an increasing and ageing 
population.

  4 Strategic Policies 
Sustainable Development 
 
Policy SP1: Sustainable development in North Hertfordshire 
This Plan supports the principles of sustainable development within North 
Hertfordshire. We will: 
a) Maintain the role of key settlements within and adjoining the District 
as the main focus for housing, employment and new development 
making use of previously developed land where possible; 
b) Ensure the long-term vitality of the District’s villages by supporting 
growth which provides opportunities for existing and new residents 
and sustains key facilities; 
c) Grant planning permission for proposals that, individually or 
cumulatively: 
i. deliver an appropriate mix of homes, jobs and facilities that 
contribute towards the targets and aspirations in this Plan; 
ii. create high-quality developments that respect and improve 
their surroundings and provide opportunities for healthy 
lifestyle choices; 
iii. provide the necessary infrastructure required to support an 
increasing population; 
iv. protect key elements of North Hertfordshire’s environment 
including biodiversity, important landscapes, heritage assets 
and green infrastructure (including the water environment); 
and 
v. secure any necessary mitigation measures that reduce the 
impact of development, including on climate change; and 
d) Support neighbourhood plans and other local planning initiatives 
where they are in general conformity with the strategic policies of 
this Local Plan. 
4.1 Government policy is clear that the purpose of planning is to help achieve 
sustainable development. This means improving our lives today while not 
compromising our ability to do so in the future. It means supporting growth 
whilst protecting key elements of the natural and historic environment. 
4.2 In implementing this Plan, we will take a positive approach that ensures we 
can continue to permit the significant majority of planning applications for new 
development. 
4.3 Policy SP1 sets out guiding principles for planning in the District over the 
period to 2031. We will seek to grant permission wherever proposals support 
these strategic aims and meet the requirements set out in this Plan. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
41 
  4.4 These principles are already evident across the District. Letchworth has a 
global reputation as the world’s first garden city. Hitchin, Baldock and Royston 
are established market towns built around a historic core. Our villages provide 
highly valued environments in which to live away from the main towns, yet 
also have provided opportunities for sensitive growth over time. 
4.5 These settlements are located within a wider setting of which the District can 
be proud. North Hertfordshire has a rich and varied historic environment while 
high quality landscapes and areas of national importance surround our towns 
and villages. These factors help to maintain separate identities and also 
provide opportunities for residents to interact with the wider countryside 
around them. 
4.6 This Plan accommodates necessary growth whilst maintaining these 
characteristics. New development will integrate with its surrounds rather than 
being remote. We will make use of previously developed land where possible. 
Key protections will be respected. 
4.7 In setting a framework for growth, this Plan also recognises the value of local 
knowledge and the importance of local choice. A number of parishes within 
the District are already designated Neighbourhood Planning areas and our 
Local Plan is structured flexibly in response. This chapter contains the 
strategic policies and aspirations with which any neighbourhood plans, or 
other local planning initiatives, must be in general conformity. 
4.8 Beyond this, there remains scope for local interpretation. Local housing 
allocations and, beyond the Green Belt, village boundaries are examples of 
issues which are open to debate and change through the Neighbourhood 
Planning system. Local communities will be able to supplement the policies in 
this Plan or identify alternate approaches whilst adhering to the key principles 
we have set out. 
4.9 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that our policy provides an overarching 
expression of what sustainable development would look like in North 
Hertfordshire; it is strategic in nature and broadly covers sustainable 
development priorities.   
Policy SP2: Settlement Hierarchy and Spatial Distribution33 
Between 2011 and 2031, the plan makes provision for at least 13,000 new 
homes. 
Approximately 80% of the District’s housing development and the 
substantial majority of new employment, retail and other development will 
be located within the adjusted settlement boundaries of the following 
towns: 
 
33  The figures shown in this policy for individual settlements are the total of planned, permitted and 
completed development for the period 2011-2031. These figures are not a target and do not 
necessarily represent the maximum number of new homes that will be built. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
42 
   Baldock (2,198 homes); 
 Hitchin (1,842); 
 Letchworth Garden City 
(1,928);  Royston (1,899);  
 Stevenage (including Great 
Ashby)34 (1,705); and 
 Luton34 (1,485) 
Approximately 13% of housing, along with supporting infrastructure and 
facilities will be delivered within the adjusted settlement boundaries of the 
following five villages for the levels of development indicated: 
 Barkway (208) 
 Codicote (363) 
 Ickleford (235)   Knebworth (731) 
 Little Wymondley (312) 
The remaining development will be dispersed across the District as set out 
below. 
In Category A villages, general development will be allowed within the 
defined settlement boundaries: 
 Ashwell; 
 Barley; 
 Breachwood 
Green; 
 Cockernhoe & 
Mangrove 
Green; 
 Graveley;   Hexton; 
 Kimpton; 
 Lower 
Stondon34; 
 Oaklands34; 
 Offley; 
 Pirton 
 Preston  Reed; 
 Sandon; 
 St Ippolyts & 
Gosmore; 
 Therfield; 
 Weston; and  
 Whitwell. 
Infilling development which does not extend the built core of the village will 
be allowed in the Category B villages of: 
 Blackmore End; 
 Great 
Wymondley; 
 Hinxworth; 
 Holwell;  Kelshall; 
 Lilley; 
 Newnham; 
  Old Knebworth; 
 Rushden; 
 Wallington; and 
 Willian. 
Limited affordable housing and facilities for local community needs meeting 
the requirements of Policy CGB2 will be allowed in the Category C 
settlements of: 
 Bygrave; 
 Caldecote; 
 Clothall;   Langley; 
 Nuthampstead;  Peters Green; 
and 
 Radwell 
 
34  These settlements are (substantively) located outside of North Hertfordshire’s administrative area, 
but the urban areas adjoin, or already lie partially within, the District. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
43 
  Development outside of these locations or general parameters will be 
permitted where this is supported by an adopted Neighbourhood Plan. 
Under the provisions of national policy at the time of this Plan’s 
examination, Neighbourhood Plans cannot allocate sites in the Green Belt 
or amend Green Belt boundaries. 
4.10 North Hertfordshire includes a range of settlements, including isolated rural 
hamlets, numerous villages, the four towns of Hitchin, Letchworth Garden 
City, Baldock and Royston, and large parts of the Great Ashby estate on the 
edge of Stevenage. 
4.11 The Council wishes to focus the majority of new development on the towns 
(including urban extensions to existing towns) in order to make maximum use 
of existing facilities, social networks and infrastructure, and maximise 
opportunities to deliver new infrastructure. However, it is important to allow 
growth of the villages in order to allow those communities to continue to 
function.  
4.12 Based on the policies and allocations of this plan, it is anticipated that 
approximately four in every five new homes delivered over the plan period will 
be built within the adjusted settlement boundaries of the towns. These will 
remain the primary focus for employment, retail and other development. The 
balance of new development will be distributed across North Hertfordshire’s 
villages and the remainder of the District.  
4.13 Much of this growth will be delivered on sites allocated for development by 
this Plan. This will be supplemented by (often smaller) ‘windfall’ sites which 
come forward within the settlement boundaries and parameters identified in 
Policy SP2 as well as any further sites subsequently identified through 
Neighbourhood Plans. These schemes may include opportunities for self-build 
development. 
4.14 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) acknowledges sometimes 
development in one village may support services in other nearby villages. 
Although some communities may lack a full range of facilities themselves, 
they should not be barred from further development. In many of the District’s 
rural areas the average number of people per household is falling. Some of 
the villages have seen very little growth in recent years and their populations 
have actually fallen. Our evidence gives further consideration to these issues 
and explains how the settlement hierarchy has been developed35. For those 
areas within the Green Belt, we have additionally considered how villages 
contribute to openness36. 
4.15 Five villages have been identified that will support higher levels of new 
housing allocations than the Category A villages: 
 
35 Housing and Green Belt Background Paper (NHDC, 2016) 
36 Green Belt Review (NHDC, 2016 & 2018). Paragraph 86 of the 2012 NPPF explains how planning 
authorities should consider villages within the Green Belt when setting boundaries. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
44 
   Knebworth and Codicote are the two largest villages within North 
Hertfordshire and support a range of services, including a station at 
Knebworth; 
 Ickleford and Little Wymondley provide opportunities to accommodate 
further residential development in close proximity to neighbouring towns 
along with sustainable transport connections; and 
 Barkway as a focus for development in the rural east of the District. 
4.16 The Category A villages, normally containing primary schools, also have 
defined boundaries within which development will be allowed and sites have 
been allocated to meet the District’s overall housing requirement. These 
villages are excluded from the policy designation (either Green Belt or Rural 
Area Beyond the Green Belt – see Policy SP5) which affects the surrounding 
countryside. 
4.17 Category B villages are those with a lower level of facilities such as village 
halls and public houses. Category B villages will be allowed to accommodate 
limited infill development that does not expand the built core of the village into 
the surrounding countryside. 
4.18 Blackmore End has been excluded from the Green Belt because of its limited 
contribution to the openness and purposes of the Green Belt. For the 
remaining Category B villages, this Plan does not define a settlement 
boundary or the extent of the built core. The Council believes it should be 
possible to assess on a case-by-case basis whether a site is in the built core. 
However, that may be something that affected communities wish to explore 
through neighbourhood plans. 
4.19 The Category C settlements are  
 those which give their names to a parish that does not contain any 
category A or B villages; and / or 
 those with a modest level of facilities but which make an important 
contribution to the open character of the Green Belt.  
4.20 Within Category C settlements, a more restrictive approach will be taken. We 
will support limited affordable housing and schemes for community facilities 
which meet proven needs from that parish in line with the detailed policies of 
this Plan. 
4.21 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that our policy will have a range of positive 
effects in seeking to focus new development within or adjoining existing 
settlements. There may be some potential negative impacts in terms of 
interaction with exiting residential areas and environmental aspects due to 
development being on greenfield sites. However, these impacts can be 
mitigated and addressed through design and layout considerations and other 
policies in this Plan.

  Economy & Town Centres 
 
Policy SP3: Employment 
The Council will proactively encourage sustainable economic growth, 
support new and existing businesses and seek to build on the District’s 
strengths, location and offer. We will 
a) Allocate an adequate supply of employment land to meet the 
needs of the Functional Economic Market Area over the plan 
period to 2031. The allocations as shown on the Policies Map are: 
i. east of Baldock BA10 (19.6ha); and  
ii. west of Royston RY9 (10.9ha); 
b) Safeguard Employment Areas within the District’s main 
settlements, as shown on the Policies Map, to enhance and 
protect their employment potential; 
c) Work with landowners, developers and, for sites on the edge of the 
District, adjoining authorities to identify an appropriate amount of 
employment land to be included through the masterplanning 
process in strategic housing sites;  
d) Permit an appropriate range of offices, research and development, 
light industrial or B class employment uses within these areas; 
e) Promote and support the expansion of the knowledge-based 
economy in the District. Proposals for the redevelopment of 
existing employment sites and the development of new 
employment sites which increase the level of knowledge-intensive 
employment will be supported in principle. 
f) Support offices, research and development, light industrial and B-
class uses in appropriate locations outside of designated 
employment areas, including offices in main town centres and 
concentrations of these employment uses in certain villages; and 
g) Ensure relevant policies of this Plan recognise the contribution of 
sectors other than B Class uses and offices, research and 
development and light industrial uses, including tourism, to the 
provision of jobs. 
4.22 The Council wants to see sustainable economic growth within North 
Hertfordshire. Skills, housing and economic development should be 
appropriately balanced. This will be achieved, in part, by working with other 
partners and through delivery of the Council’s own economic development 
plans and projects. 
4.23 North Hertfordshire District Council is a member of the Hertfordshire Local 
Enterprise Partnership (LEP). The LEP will be an important stakeholder 
regarding how the North Hertfordshire economy grows and develops in the 
future. In particular the Hertfordshire LEP is seeking to regain the county’s North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
46 
  competitive edge by encouraging increased employment growth and 
enterprise. 
4.24 The employment strategy of this Plan is driven by three, interlinked priorities 
for the North Hertfordshire economy: 
 Increasing representation in high skilled and high value sectors; 
 Reducing out-commuting by providing greater opportunities for people to 
both live and work in the District; and 
 Aligning employment development with housing growth to promote 
sustainable patterns of development and access by non-car modes. 
4.25 Our evidence shows that, compared to national averages there is a higher 
concentration of people employed in sectors such as manufacturing, 
construction, retail, motor trades, property, entertainment and recreation in 
North Hertfordshire. Many higher skilled residents commute out of the District 
for employment. Nonetheless sectors such as finance & insurance and 
information & communication make a substantial contribution to the District’s 
overall economic output, although not employing a huge number of people. 
These represent opportunities for future expansion and development37. 
4.26 North Hertfordshire also fails to perform as well as some other Districts in 
Hertfordshire with regard to the knowledge economy. In partnership with key 
stakeholders, we will seek to increase the number of highly skilled jobs in the 
District. Economic growth sectors which are knowledge-intensive will be 
targeted. This includes research and development (R&D), life sciences, 
advanced manufacturing, computer-related activities, and other business 
activities in combination with growth of the low-carbon economy. With other 
stakeholders, the Council will: 
 encourage business start-ups in the knowledge economy;  
 help develop existing local businesses in the knowledge economy;  
 target knowledge-based businesses into North Herts; and 
 promote the take up of any new jobs by local people by promoting specific 
training and targeting recruitment at local residents. 
4.27 Due to the good levels of connectivity to other centres of employment, such 
as Stevenage, Welwyn Hatfield, and London it is unlikely that all the extra 
economically active population over the plan period will take up jobs within the 
District. In 2011, over a quarter of North Hertfordshire’s working population 
were employed in these three centres, within another quarter employed 
elsewhere outside the District38. 
4.28 Trend-based forecasts reflect these patterns and anticipate continued 
increases in out-commuting from North Hertfordshire over the plan period39. 
Unchecked, this would lead to increased pressure on transport infrastructure

47 
  that is already under strain at peak periods. This Plan therefore makes 
employment provision for offices, research and development, light industrial, 
general industry and storage and distribution at above modelled levels. 
4.29 The settlements of Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and Baldock are very 
close together. There is a significant amount of commuting between these 
settlements. However, Baldock presently has a relatively low amount of 
employment land per person. 
4.30 A significant employment allocation for certain E class uses (office, research 
and development, industrial processes), B2 (industrial) and B8 (storage and 
distribution) class uses will be developed out at the east of Baldock, 
supporting the proposed increase in residential development in the town (see 
Policy SP8). The allocation benefits from proximity to existing employment 
uses as well as existing and planned residential development. It has access to 
the strategic road network via the A505 Baldock Bypass. 
4.31 Economic activity is not contained by the District boundary and North 
Hertfordshire needs to be viewed within its wider Functional Economic Market 
Area (FEMA).  Joint work has identified a FEMA along the A1 (M) corridor. 
This area broadly covers North Hertfordshire, Stevenage and the eastern part 
of Central Bedfordshire40. The allocation at Baldock also takes account of the 
long-term needs which will arise within the wider FEMA. Stevenage, in 
particular, anticipates a shortfall of employment land against modelled 
requirements41. These models assume continued commuting from North 
Hertfordshire to Stevenage, yet there is insufficient land in Stevenage to cater 
for the resultant growth.  
4.32 Within Hitchin and Letchworth Garden City, employment area designations 
from the previous local plan will be broadly retained, with some modest 
releases of sustainable, brownfield sites for residential development. Within 
Letchworth, the former power station site at Works Road has been brought 
back into use for employment purposes.  
4.33 Royston is somewhat separate from the Hitchin / Letchworth Garden City / 
Baldock area, in geographical terms and in employment and labour market 
terms. The Royston economy is influenced by both Hertfordshire and 
Cambridgeshire economies. Consequently, the employment area has a low 
vacancy rate. The allocation of further land here as a planned extension to the 
York Way employment area is a sustainable approach that will enable 
flexibility in the long term, especially in conjunction with the additional 
residential growth allocated to this area. 
4.34 Over the plan period this approach will provide substantial opportunities to 
reduce commuting that occurs across and beyond the District, redressing the 
employment balance.

  4.35 Within these designated areas, an appropriate range of offices, research and 
development, light industrial, general industry and storage and distribution 
uses will be permitted in line with the detailed policies of this Plan. 
4.36 A number of employment premises are located outside of defined areas and 
these will continue to be supported where they are compatible with other 
surrounding uses. In particular, office uses will continue to be supported in the 
main town centres (see Policy SP4), in line with national planning policy. 
4.37 Beyond our main towns, there is a steady demand for rural employment land 
and premises. Owing to the size and extensive spread of rural settlements 
these types of development are best dealt with on a case-by-case basis rather 
than through allocations, although our general approach will be to direct 
concentrations of rural business to the larger villages. There are quite 
sizeable employment sites in villages such as Ashwell, Codicote, Kimpton, 
Little Wymondley and Weston which provide rural jobs and should be 
retained. 
4.38 Approximately 45% of all jobs fall within the office, research and development, 
light industrial sectors or into the B uses classes. The rest of the jobs in the 
local economy consist of services such as retail, health, education and 
leisure, or ‘footloose’ careers in sectors such as construction and the trades. 
The role of these sectors in the overall employment balance of the District is 
recognised and will continue to be supported where appropriate. 
4.39 Our Sustainability Appraisal says our policy provides strong support for 
employment growth and diversification in North Hertfordshire. 
 Policy SP4: Town Centres, Local Centres and Community Shops 
The Council will make provision for an appropriate range of retail and 
service facilities across the District and are committed to protecting the 
vitality and viability of all centres. We will: 
a) Promote, protect and enhance the provision of shops, financial and 
professional services, café or restaurants, pubs or drinking 
establishments or takeaways in the following centres in our retail 
hierarchy: 
i. the town centres of Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, Baldock 
and Royston; 
ii. 13 existing local centres consisting of: 
 village centres at Ashwell, Codicote and Knebworth; 
 seven centres in Hitchin 
 two centres in Letchworth Garden City; and 
 the centre at Great Ashby; and 
iii. 2 new local centres north of Baldock and East of Luton within 
the strategic housing sites identified in this Plan; North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
49 
  b) Support proposals for main town centre uses in these locations where 
they are appropriate to the size, scale, function, catchment area, 
historic and architectural character of the centre; 
c) Identify Primary Shopping Frontages within town centres where 
shops42 will be expected to concentrate; 
d) To ensure the District’s towns maintain their role and market share, 
make provision for up to 38,100 gross sq.m of additional floorspace 
over the plan period, comprising shops, café or restaurants, pubs or 
drinking establishments or takeaways including the re-occupation of 
vacant floorspace, consisting of: 
i. 22,500 gross sq.m comparison goods (e.g. clothes, shoes, 
furniture, carpets); 
ii. 8,600 gross sq.m convenience (e.g. food, drink, toiletries); and 
iii. 7,000 gross sq.m food and beverage outlets (e.g. restaurants, 
takeaways and bars). 
38,100 gross sq.m is a district wide retail capacity but it is principally derived 
from the retail capacity projections for the four town centres, as indicated 
below:

this approach and / or adapt to change. These will be used to inform 
the approach to retail at the time of the early review; and 
f) Support the retention and provision of shops outside of identified 
centres where they serve a local day-to-day need. 
4.40 In relation to Policy SP4, retail and service facilities refers to shops, cafes and 
restaurants (E class uses) along with pubs and drinking establishments and 
takeaways (sui generis). These were previously Class A uses. 
4.41 The District contains a range of retail and service centres, from medium sized 
towns to small village and neighbourhood centres. Each one performs a 
particular role to meet the needs of its catchment population and is part of a 
network of centres within the District. The Council is committed to protecting 
the vitality and viability of all centres.  
4.42 North Hertfordshire lies within complex shopping catchment areas, which 
include Cambridge as a regional centre and Bedford, Luton, Stevenage and 
Welwyn Garden City as major town centres. The District itself has four town 
centres: Hitchin is the largest, followed by Letchworth Garden City and then 
the smaller town centres of Royston and Baldock. There are also a number of 
local village and neighbourhood centres. 
4.43 The Local Plan strategy for town centre uses is to maintain the District’s 
market share. This means that across the district, the retail capacity will be 
met principally in the four town centres. This is to maintain the current retail 
hierarchy within the District and the wider catchment areas.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
51 
  4.44 However given that Baldock, Letchworth Garden City and Hitchin are in close 
proximity, leakage of the projected retail expenditure for each town is likely to 
occur. The most significant is leakage from Letchworth Garden City to Hitchin. 
4.45 In addition there is less physical capacity in Baldock and Hitchin to 
accommodate their projected retail capacities. The retail strategy for the 
District is therefore to direct the capacity to Letchworth Garden City over the 
plan period, which has greater potential for physical space and to recapture its 
leakage.  
4.46 We are committed to promoting the well-being of the town centres in the 
District. Town centre strategies have been produced for the main centres of 
Hitchin, Baldock, Letchworth Garden City, and Royston. These promote the 
vitality and viability of the centres and cover all those aspects of policy 
guidance with a spatial dimension relevant to town centres, including 
economic, environmental and social well-being and matters such as 
community safety, community facilities, traffic management, marketing and 
delivery. The strategies provide a method of keeping town centre 
development up-to-date and flexible to take account of ongoing changes in 
the retail environment and will inform whether it is necessary to review the 
retail strategy set out in this Plan.  Work on these town centre strategies will 
commence within 12 months of the adoption of this Plan.  They will be 
monitored and reviewed during the life of this Plan. 
4.47 Our detailed policies set out our approach to development applications, 
including for changes of use. In general terms, shops will be expected to 
concentrate within the defined primary frontages with related retail and service 
uses that are pubs or drinking establishments permissible in secondary 
frontage areas. 
4.48 The village centres of Codicote and Knebworth are large enough to provide a 
focus for the communities local to them and a range of everyday shopping 
facilities and services. The village centre of Ashwell contains a more limited 
range of shops and services and is more fragmented than Codicote and 
Knebworth’s village centres. However, Ashwell still has enough shops, 
services and facilities to have a designated centre, unlike many other small 
settlements in the District.  
4.49 The suburban neighbourhood centres in Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and 
Great Ashby vary considerably, in terms of size, range of shops and services 
and catchment area. However, they are all worthy of a level of protection as 
they serve the day to day needs of the local community. The Council wants to 
improve and protect the District’s centres, reduce the need for unnecessary 
travel to alternative facilities and ensure that the proportion of expenditure 
going outside the District does not increase. 
4.50 The growth of the District will require additional centres to be provided to 
serve the strategic housing sites.  The centres for the two largest sites at 
Baldock and on the edge of Luton are expected to contain a wider range of North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
52 
  retail facilities. Once built, these will become local centres in our retail 
hierarchy and future proposals within them will be assessed appropriately. 
4.51 These will be supplemented by smaller, neighbourhood-level centres in these 
and other Strategic Housing Sites which will not form part of the formal retail 
hierarchy but will be protected by the general retail policies of this Plan. 
4.52 Our evidence shows there will be a steady growth in retail demand over the 
plan period, although projected growth post-2026 carries a degree of 
uncertainty due to changing shopping and retail patterns and the effects of 
Covid-19. Projected growth is driven in part by planned population growth but 
also by underlying changes in the way people shop and how much money 
they have available to spend. It is anticipated that on-line shopping will 
continue to grow whilst a certain amount of future demand can be 
accommodated through the re-occupation of existing, vacant shop units. 
However, it is also necessary to identify new sites for retail43. Projected retail 
needs, and particularly those in the post-2026 period, will be kept under 
review via the monitoring framework and updated retail studies. 
4.53 Some of this future demand will be met within the development sites identified 
in this Plan, ensuring that new residents have access to an appropriate range 
of local shops. Where planned urban extensions adjoin towns outside of the 
District, we will work with neighbouring authorities to identify the most 
appropriate types and levels of additional provision. 
4.54 A number of shops are located outside of our retail hierarchy. This includes 
individual premises and small groups of shops that perform a neighbourhood 
function, including those in a number of rural settlements. Our detailed 
policies set out our approach. 
4.55 Our Sustainability Appraisal concludes that this policy provides clear support 
for existing town and local centres and should have direct economic benefits 
and contribute to the achievement of sustainable patterns of land use.

  Countryside and Green Belt 
 
Policy SP5: Countryside and Green Belt 
We support the principles of the Green Belt and recognise the intrinsic value 
of the countryside. Green Belt and Rural Areas Beyond the Green Belt are 
shown on the Policies Map. We: 
a) Have conducted a comprehensive review of the Green Belt. Land has 
been removed from the Green Belt to: 
i. enable strategic development at the locations referred to in 
Policies SP8 and SP3; 
ii. enable local development around a number of the District’s 
towns and villages; and 
iii. define boundaries for villages referred to in Policy SP2 
which fall within the Green Belt but were previously 
‘washed over’ by this designation; 
b) Have provided new Green Belt to cover, in general terms, the area 
bounded by the Metropolitan Green Belt to the east, the Luton Green 
Belt to the west and the A505 Offley bypass to the north; 
c) Will only permit development proposals in the Green Belt where they 
would not result in inappropriate development or where very special 
circumstances have been demonstrated; and 
d) Will operate a general policy of restraint in Rural Areas beyond the 
Green Belt through the application of our detailed policies. 
4.56 The vast majority of land in North Hertfordshire is rural in nature. Whilst more 
than three-quarters of the District’s homes are in the towns, the land area of 
these main settlements covers less than 7% of the District.  
4.57 Restraint on unsustainable development in rural areas is a well-established 
policy in this area. The District has previously had two distinct areas of Green 
Belt. The London (Metropolitan) Green Belt covers Hitchin, Letchworth 
Garden City, Baldock, Stevenage and nearby areas. The Luton Green Belt 
covers parts of the west of the District. There are also rural areas beyond the 
Green Belt. 
4.58 National policy allows for Green Belt boundaries to be altered through the 
preparation of local plans where ‘exceptional circumstances’ exist. Although 
there is no definition of this term within Government guidance, this matter has 
been considered by the courts44. Our evidence considers the approach that 
has been recommended45. On balance, it is considered that the relevant

(21 April 2015)

2016) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
54 
  circumstances do exist within North Hertfordshire to review boundaries and 
enable development to meet locally identified needs. 
4.59 Green Belt boundaries have been reviewed around all of the main towns 
within and adjoining the District, with the exception of Royston which lies 
beyond the Green Belt. Boundaries have also been reviewed around a 
number of villages previously surrounded or covered (‘washed over’) by the 
Green Belt. 
4.60 In part to offset the Green Belt releases necessary to meet housing needs, 
particularly in the Stevenage, Hitchin and Luton area, an additional area of 
Green Belt is designated around Offley and Whitwell to cover an area which 
was not previously Green Belt. This has the effect of linking the formerly 
separate Metropolitan and Luton Green Belts. This new area of Green Belt is 
intended to strengthen protection in the area of the District between 
Stevenage and Luton. 
4.61 Proposals for development within the Green Belt will be considered against 
national policy. Where the proposed use can be considered acceptable in 
principle, we will use the detailed policies of this Plan to determine whether 
permission should be granted. 
4.62 National policy generally guards against further alterations to Green Belt in 
the short- to medium-term following a review46. However, this requirement is 
not absolute. Given the potential direction of future local plan reviews, and the 
need to properly consider long-term solutions, it is not considered appropriate 
to identify significant areas of safeguarded land at this point. The exception to 
this is to the west of Stevenage (see Policy SP8 and Monitoring and Delivery 
chapter). 
4.63 The Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt covers the majority of the east of the 
District including most of the land between Baldock and Royston as well as 
the villages and countryside to the south of Royston. It also covers the land to 
the north and west of Hitchin beyond the outer edge of the Green Belt.  
4.64 In terms of intrinsic character and beauty, the Rural Area beyond the Green 
Belt contains some of the highest quality countryside in the District. However, 
the settlements are generally more dispersed meaning a Green Belt 
designation cannot be justified. This sparser pattern of development 
additionally means that, outside of the defined settlements, many sites are not 
well located in relation to key services. On these grounds it remains 
appropriate to restrain the types of development allowed in the Rural Area 
beyond the Green Belt. Our detailed Development Management policies set 
out the approach that will apply in this area. 
4.65 Wherever possible, the inner boundaries of the Green Belt and Rural Area 
have been drawn around our settlements using strong features that provide 
clear, defensible boundaries. In certain cases this means that some land that 
 
46 Paragraph 85 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
55 
  we wish to remain undeveloped lie within the settlement envelopes. Urban 
Open Land designations are used at Baldock, Royston and Little Wymondley 
to ensure the affected land remains protected. Our detailed policies set out 
these allocations and our approach. 
4.66 Both the Green Belt and the Rural Areas Beyond the Green Belt are policy 
designations designed to restrict the types and amount of new development 
that can occur. Our approach to the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB), and areas of countryside which are valuable in terms of their 
landscape and biodiversity is set out in Policy SP12. 
4.67 Our Sustainability Appraisal recognises that releasing Green Belt sites for 
housing and economic development should help to support economic growth 
in the District and will play an important role in providing the necessary level 
of new housing, including affordable housing. However, it will also have some 
negative environmental effects.  We will concentrate on reducing and 
mitigating these impacts through other policies in this Plan.  
 
 
  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
56 
  Transport and Infrastructure 
 
Policy SP6: Sustainable transport 
We will deliver accessibility improvements and promote the use of 
sustainable transport modes insofar as reasonable and practicable. We 
will: 
a) Comply with the NHDC Transport Strategy and the provisions of 
the, the Local Transport Plan and other supporting documents as 
relevant; 
b) Encourage development in locations which enable sustainable 
journeys to be made to key services and facilities; 
c) Work with Hertfordshire County Council, neighbouring authorities, 
Highways England and service providers to ensure that a range of 
sustainable transport options are available to all potential 
occupants or users. This may involve new or improved pedestrian, 
cycle and passenger transport (including rail and/or bus) links and 
routes; 
d) Seek the earliest reasonable opportunity to implement sustainable 
travel infrastructure on Strategic Housing Sites and other 
development sites in order to influence the behaviour of occupiers 
or users, along with supporting Travel Plans in order that 
sustainable travel patterns become embedded at an early stage; 
e) Assess development proposals against the parking standards set 
out in this Plan and having regard to relevant supplementary 
advice; 
f) Require applicants to provide assessments, plans and supporting 
documents to demonstrate the safety and sustainability of their 
proposals; and 
g) Protect existing rights of way, cycling and equestrian routes and, 
should diversion be unavoidable, require replacement routes to the 
satisfaction of the Council. 
4.68 North Hertfordshire has a relatively good transport network, although the 
strategic road and rail links are generally better for north-south access than 
for east-west access. There is also an extensive local road network, which 
connect the four main towns within North Hertfordshire with its surrounding 
rural area. 
4.69 National and local policies and guidance seek to reduce the growth of car 
usage and achieve greater use of more sustainable modes of transport. 
4.70 The primary responsibility for delivering transport provision in North 
Hertfordshire rests with Hertfordshire County Council as the local highway 
authority. Highways England are responsible for the strategic road network 
which includes the A1(M) within North Hertfordshire.  The involvement of North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
57 
  North Hertfordshire District Council relates mainly to Development Planning 
and the management and enforcement of parking which could have 
implications on the local and strategic highway network. 
4.71 The overarching transport policy document for the area is the Hertfordshire 
Local Transport Plan (LTP4) which provides the framework for achieving 
better transport systems in Hertfordshire for the plan period 2018-2031. LPT4 
was adopted in 2018.  The Local Transport Plan covers all modes of transport 
including walking, cycling, public transport, car-based travel, reducing road 
freight movements and making provision for those with mobility impairments. 
4.72 Although the Local Transport Plan identifies some specific schemes, the 
majority of transport schemes are identified at settlement level. From time to 
time the County Council, North Hertfordshire District Council, and 
neighbouring authorities publish other documents and strategies47 which will 
also need to be taken into account when considering development proposals. 
This includes the NHDC Transport Strategy and also relevant strategies 
prepared by neighbouring authorities, such as the Stevenage Mobility 
Strategy, for sites that are functionally attached to, or in close proximity to 
North Hertfordshire.   
4.73 New development can help to improve the range of transport opportunities 
available in the District by helping to improve existing facilities and providing 
new components where required. 
4.74 Many of the developments in the smaller settlements may not be enough on 
their own to have a major transport impact within an area, However, 
cumulatively a number of developments can create additional demands and 
burdens on existing infrastructure (such as increased use of less appropriate 
roads, higher volumes of traffic through constrained village centres) which 
may require suitable mitigation to be implemented. Such mitigation can also 
include better, walking and cycling improvements and public transport 
services which will reduce the need to travel by car. The Council will consider 
these overall cumulative impacts as far as they are able as part of Policy SP7 
and may require appropriate contributions from all such development sites. 
4.75 However, national policy also recognises that the scope for passenger 
transport and/or other sustainable transport measures may be more limited in 
some locations48. Best endeavours should still be made to ensure that the 
best outcomes can be achieved for all new developments, regardless of their 
location. 
4.76 In pursuing this approach, we need to take a pragmatic and realistic approach 
that recognises the role of the car in modern lifestyles. Even if sustainable 
alternatives are used for journeys to school or work, most households will still 
have access to a car for other trips.  
 
47 These could include the forthcoming HCC Growth Transport Plans, the NHDC Transport Strategy 
prepared as part of the evidence base as well as other local strategies, for example cycling. 
48 Paragraph 29 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
58 
  4.77 Parking standards will be used to assess applications for development. These 
take a balanced approach that reflects the levels of car ownership we expect 
from new development. Our detailed policies additionally set out the approach 
we will take to the assessment of highway proposals and provision for 
pedestrians and cyclists. 
4.78 Due to the largely rural nature of much of the District, there are many public 
rights of way that exist across North Hertfordshire. These are protected under 
their own statutory regime. However, diversion applications to facilitate 
development are made to the District Council. A number of the sites identified 
in this Plan contain public rights of way. Any applications to modify or divert 
these routes will be considered separately to any planning application. 
However, our general expectation is that existing rights of way should be 
incorporated into the green infrastructure of development proposals. 
Wherever possible, existing routes and alignments should be maintained. 
4.79 Our Sustainability Appraisal says our policy provides strong and clear support 
for sustainable patterns of development. The early provision of sustainable 
travel infrastructure as part of new developments is supported. 
Policy SP7: Infrastructure requirements and developer contributions 
The Council will require development proposals to make provision for 
infrastructure that is necessary in order to accommodate additional 
demands resulting from the development. We will: 
a) Require developers to provide, finance and / or contribute towards 
provision which is fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to 
the development, including: 
i. on-site and/or off-site improvements and infrastructure 
necessary as a result of the development in order to:  
 ensure appropriate provision of facilities and 
infrastructure for new residents; 
 contribute toward addressing cumulative impacts that 
might arise across multiple developments; 
 avoid placing unreasonable additional burdens on the 
existing community or existing infrastructure; 
 mitigate adverse impacts where appropriate; and/or 
 enhance critical assets or make good their loss or 
damage; and 
ii. maintenance and/or operating costs of any such new 
provision; 
b) Ensure essential new infrastructure to support new development is 
will be operational no later than the completion of development or 
during the phase in which it is needed, whichever is earliest; 
c) Refuse planning permission where appropriate agreements or 
processes ensuring criteria (a) and (b) can be met are not in place; North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
59 
  d) Have regard to relevant national guidance or requirements in 
relation to planning obligations and any Community Infrastructure 
Levy or successor funding tariff which may be introduced by the 
Council; 
e) Work with landowners, developers and other agencies in facilitating 
the delivery of sites identified in the Local Plan and associated 
infrastructure and seek to overcome known obstacles; and 
f) Need robust evidence to be provided where developers consider 
that viability issues impact upon the delivery of key infrastructure 
and/or mitigation measures. This evidence will be used to determine 
whether an appropriate and acceptable level of contribution and / or 
mitigation can be secured. 
4.80 The nature of planned growth in the District is such that new facilities and 
infrastructure will be required. Our strategic policy seeks to ensure that the 
necessary infrastructure and appropriate mitigation is provided. 
4.81 On the largest development sites, it will be necessary to directly provide 
facilities alongside the primary use – schools within residential areas, bus 
stops within business parks, cycling routes and new footways etc. In other 
areas, much of the growth arises from a number of smaller developments. A 
small development on its own may not be enough in itself to have a major 
impact within an area. However, cumulatively a number of developments 
(including both the larger and smaller sites) can create additional demands 
and burdens on existing infrastructure which may require suitable mitigation to 
be implemented.  
4.82 Transport infrastructure including highways improvements and sustainable 
transport measures such as walking, cycling, improved public transport and 
behaviour-change projects are needed to address cumulative impacts; the 
latter seek to reduce vehicle travel to improve capacity and enable more 
sustainable travel. The NHDC Transport Strategy sets out the measures 
required, and all developments will be expected to contribute to these 
measures. 
4.83 Development can also impact upon existing built and natural assets. This 
could be through removing trees leading to a change in the biodiversity and 
landscape character of a site, to altering the setting of a listed building. One of 
the aims of the Local Plan is to seek to conserve and enhance such features. 
However, if there are reasons to allow proposals that outweigh any harmful 
effects, then appropriate mitigation or compensation will be required.  
4.84 The provision of infrastructure will need to be linked directly to the phasing of 
development to ensure that it is delivered in line with the timing of future 
growth. The Council will put in place formal arrangements for ensuring key 
infrastructure is delivered by the relevant bodies and that all funding sources, 
in addition to developer contributions are explored. Initial support (pump 
priming) may be necessary to reflect the time lag between provision and other North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
60 
  funding streams. Where new facilities are provided then start-up, maintenance 
and operating costs will be required. 
4.85 Our evidence base sets out in greater detail the infrastructure that we 
anticipate will be required49. This will be reviewed throughout the plan period 
to ensure that decisions on infrastructure are made in light of up-to-date 
information. This provides flexibility as the role and nature of infrastructure 
providers will change over the period to 2031. 
4.86 At present, infrastructure contributions are normally secured through legal 
agreements. The Council will explore new mechanisms for contributions to 
new infrastructure provision. 
4.87 Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is a way of collecting contributions from 
development through the use of standard charges. Any decision to develop a 
CIL for North Hertfordshire would be taken separately to the Local Plan. It 
would be subject to its own processes and Examination. 
4.88 Even if a CIL were to be implemented, legal agreements would still be 
necessary in many cases. On the largest sites they would be used to secure 
the delivery of on-site improvements such as schools and off-site 
improvements on the local highway network. On all sites, securing affordable 
housing will be dealt with by means of planning obligations. It is not currently 
the Government’s intention to provide affordable housing through the CIL. 
4.89 Our evidence demonstrates that the requirements placed upon development 
by this Plan should not prove a serious risk to its implementation. It shows 
there is scope for many of the sites identified in this Plan to make significant 
contributions towards infrastructure and other policy objectives50. However, 
there may be individual circumstances where this is not the case. This may 
arise for a number of reasons. It may be as a result of (unexpected) site-
specific circumstances. It may be as a result of wider factors, such as the 
state of the economy. 
4.90 In cases where viability is an issue, developers will need to provide an 
assessment and analysis of their viability evidence in order to verify it. This 
must be completed by a suitably qualified individual or company and 
scrutinise the assumptions that have been made and the conclusions that 
have been reached and whether they are justified. The methodology and 
scope of any such assessment should be agreed in advance between the 
applicant and the Council. If, following this assessment, it is accepted by the 
Council that the viability of a scheme would be critically undermined by 
application of the Council’s usual standards and expectations, we will 
exceptionally: 
 consider which requirements are most critical to securing development 
and meeting the overall vision and objectives of this Plan; 
 
49 Infrastructure Delivery Plan (RS Regeneration, 2016; RS Regeneration & NHDC, 2018) 
50 North Hertfordshire Whole Plan Viability Assessment (DSP, 2016) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
61 
   assess the extent to which these might be met in a way which makes any 
scheme viable; and 
 determine whether this would result in an appropriate and acceptable level 
of contribution and / or mitigation. 
4.91 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that this policy is critical in ensuring that the 
Plan delivers against a significant number of the sub-objectives in the 
sustainability appraisal framework, not only through ensuring the delivery of 
needed infrastructure but also through making provision for the mitigation of 
the adverse impacts of new development. The implementation and impacts of 
the policy will be carefully monitored through other policies in this Plan to 
ensure that it does hinder future development.

  Housing and Development  
 
Policy SP8: Housing 
Over the period 2011-2031, housing growth will be supported across the 
District. We will: 
a) Release sufficient land to deliver at least 11,600 net new homes for 
North Hertfordshire’s own needs. Of these: 
i. around 11,500 net new homes will be provided within that 
part of the District falling within the Stevenage Housing 
Market Area (HMA); while 
ii. around 100 net new homes will be provided within that part of 
the District falling within the Luton HMA; 
b) Provide additional land within the Luton HMA for a further 1,950 net 
new homes as a contribution towards the unmet needs for housing 
arising from Luton with approximately 1,400 of these being delivered 
over the Plan Period to 2031; 
c) Deliver these homes through the sites and allowances identified in 
this Plan that will support approximately51: 
i. 5,100 homes from completions and permissions achieved 
since 2011 and other allowances; 
ii. 7,700 homes from six Strategic Housing Sites delivering 
approximately 5,560 of these by 2031: 
 BA1 - North of Baldock for 2,800 homes (approximately 
1,400 to be delivered by 2031); 
 LG1 - North of Letchworth for 900 homes (approximately 
600 by 2031); 
 NS1 - North of Stevenage in Graveley parish for 900 
homes (approximately 775 by 2031); 
 HT1 - East of Hitchin for 700 homes; 
 GA2 - North-east of Great Ashby in Weston parish for 600 
homes; and 
 EL1 / EL2 / EL3 - East of Luton for 2,100 homes 
(approximately 1,500 by 2031); 
iii. 4,000 homes through local housing allocations that will 
provide homes on: 
 further sites within the adjusted settlement boundaries of 
the towns; 
 
51 These requirements include a small buffer of approximately 13% over and above the total housing 
requirement set through criteria (a) and (b) of this Policy to ensure sufficient flexibility. See Monitoring 
and Delivery chapter for further information. All figures are net.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
63 
   land within the adjusted settlement boundaries of five 
villages identified for growth where more than 200 homes 
are expected to be built over the Plan period; and 
 sites identified within the defined settlement boundaries of 
the Category A villages. 
  This includes the use of land within pre-existing settlement  
  limits, non-strategic sites released from the Green Belt and  
  other land identified following a review of other relevant  
  boundaries or designations. 
iv. 4 new, permanent Gypsy and Traveller pitches 
d) Maintain a five-year housing land supply and target the completion 
of 20% of new homes over the plan period on previously developed 
land; 
e) Seek to provide long-term certainty by 
i. identifying Strategic Housing Sites that will continue delivery 
beyond the end of the Plan period in 2031; 
ii. working with the Government and other relevant agencies to 
identify new settlement options within North Hertfordshire 
that can provide additional housing supply in the period after 
2026; and 
iii. safeguarding land to the west of the A1(M) at Stevenage, as 
shown on the Policies Map to meet longer-term development 
needs in the period beyond 2026 subject to a future review of 
this Plan; and 
iv. undertaking a review of this plan by the end of 2023; 
f) Support a range of housing tenures, types and sizes measured 
against targets to provide: 
i. 33% of all homes over the plan period as Affordable Housing 
for local needs with targets to deliver up to 40% Affordable 
Housing where viable; 
ii. a broadly even split between smaller (1- and 2-bed) and 
larger (3+ bed) properties subject to up-to-date-assessments 
of housing needs; and 
iii. 56 plots on specified Strategic Housing Sites to help pro-
actively address demand for self-build development over the 
plan period; and 
g) Provide at least 350 bed spaces in suitable, supported 
accommodation to meet the needs of those who cannot live in their 
own home. 
4.92 The need for housing is one of the biggest issues for local plans to address. A 
balance needs to be struck between the large and pressing need for housing 
with the desirability of protecting the countryside. Green Belt boundaries in North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
64 
  North Hertfordshire were last reviewed between 1984 and 1992. At that time 
access to housing was comparatively much easier than it is today, especially 
for younger newly-forming households.  
4.93 Our evidence identifies a requirement for 11,500 homes to be built between 
2011 and 2031 to meet the needs of North Hertfordshire52. A modest uplift 
has been added. This predominantly reflects the fact that, as people live for 
longer and live in their own homes for longer, it may be more appropriate to 
assume that more of their needs will be met in the normal housing stock53. 
4.94 It is also necessary to consider the wider needs of housing market areas 
which affect North Hertfordshire. In particular, the Luton housing market area 
covers parts of North Hertfordshire, and the need for development in this area 
is significant. A contribution towards unmet needs is made by this Plan. 
4.95 It would only be possible to deliver a modest proportion of these housing 
requirements on land within the village and Green Belt boundaries established 
in the previous District Plan54. Having considered a wide range of evidence, 
this Plan concludes that sensible, planned expansion of towns and villages is 
the best way of delivering the growth needed whilst protecting the largely rural 
character of the remainder of the District. 
4.96 Approximately 5,100 of the required homes are accounted for by completions 
since 2011, sites which have already obtained planning permission and 
commenced development and other allowances. This includes two large 
developments on the edge of Royston with permission for almost 600 homes. 
The majority of these homes will be on previously developed land and also 
include: 
 windfalls (those sites which will continue to come forward for development 
outside of the local plan process) ; and  
 Letchworth Town Centre as a broad location. This is an area where it is 
reasonable to assume development might occur in the latter years of the 
plan, but where we cannot currently identify the exact location. The 
boundary of the broad location is the same as the Town Centre boundary 
for Letchworth shown on the policies map.  
4.97 Just under half of all new homes over the plan period will be delivered on six 
Strategic Housing Sites removed from the Green Belt. Three of these sites 
adjoin some of North Hertfordshire’s largest settlements – Hitchin, Letchworth 
Garden City and Baldock.  
4.98 Stevenage adjoins North Hertfordshire to the south-east. The tight 
administrative boundaries here mean it is possible to develop two strategic

  sites that are within North Hertfordshire, but will integrate with the planned 
urban area of Stevenage. 
4.99 These sites will all be built wholly to meet the housing needs of North 
Hertfordshire.  
4.100 Luton lies immediately to the west of the District. This strategic allocation for 
2,100 homes is predominantly to meet the needs of Luton, but around 150 of 
the homes here will contribute to North Hertfordshire’s housing needs55. 
4.101 A strategic policy has been prepared for each site setting out the site-specific 
measures we will require. These are in addition to the general requirements 
on matters such as affordable housing and open space set out in the detailed 
policies of the Plan which apply in all instances. 
4.102 The remainder of new homes will be delivered through a range of local 
housing allocations set out in the detailed policies of this Plan: 
 Sites for over 2,200 homes, in addition to the strategic sites, are identified 
within the adjusted settlement boundaries of the towns.  
 Sites for nearly 1,600 homes are identified at the five village locations 
identified by Policy SP2; while 
 A review of settlement boundaries in the Category A villages allows for 
approximately 180 homes. 
4.103 This Plan also makes provision to meet the future needs of the Gypsy and 
Traveller community. A new site is allocated at Woodside Place, Danesbury 
Park Road at the southern edge of the District allowing requirements over the 
period to 2031 to be met. 
4.104 These targets require housing completions within the District to accelerate 
well above those achieved historically. However, past rates have been 
constrained, in part, by tight village and Green Belt boundaries that have not 
been reviewed for well over twenty years whilst Government policy supports a 
‘significant boost’ in the supply of housing. 
4.105 This needs to be balanced against realistic expectations about when we can 
expect to see new homes being built. This is especially the case on the 
largest new sites which require the certainty provided by this Plan in order to 
proceed and can require significant up-front investment in infrastructure such 
as new roads. As a result, most of the planned new homes will be delivered 
after 2021.  
4.106 The spatial strategy proposed by this Plan requires the simultaneous delivery 
of a number of strategic sites around the main towns. There will be challenges 
in this approach. These include the capacity of the development industry to 
 
55 The remaining 50 homes within the Luton Housing Market Area for North Hertfordshire’s needs 
identified in criterion (a)(ii) will be met from local housing allocations, completions, permissions and 
windfalls. See Housing and Green Belt Technical Paper (NHDC, 2016). North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
66 
  deliver and the ability of the market to absorb these new homes.  We will 
support higher delivery rates where possible.  This might include using 
innovative approaches to construction.  We will develop a greater 
understanding of the rates of housing delivery that can be achieved as 
schemes are progressed and reflect these in the review of the plan as set out 
in Policy IMR2. 
4.107 A stepped approach is considered most appropriate to deal with these issues. 
An average of 313 homes per year were built over the first nine years of the 
plan period between 2011 and 2020.  Moving forward, housing supply will be 
measured against targets to deliver an average of 500 homes per year over 
the period to 31 March 2024. From April 2024 a target of 1, 120 homes per 
year will apply. Our approach to five-year land supply is set out in Policy IMR1 
in Chapter 14. 
4.108 As this Local Plan was developed, many residents suggested that a new 
settlement in North Hertfordshire would be the best way to meet future needs. 
We recognise many of the merits of this argument. In the longer term, 
continual incremental additions to existing settlements may not be the best 
solution. 
4.109 The Council is committed to fully exploring new settlement options in the 
District and initial work has been undertaken56. However, we cannot rely upon 
a future new settlement to contribute to housing requirements in this current 
Plan.  We will work with relevant partners on an on-going basis to build the 
evidence base that is required to support any new settlement(s) and deliver 
on our aspirations. 
4.110 The outcomes of the new settlement process will be reflected in the next 
review of this Plan. The review will supplement rather than replace the 
allocations in this Plan and provide greater certainty for the period beyond this 
Plan. 
4.111 If a new settlement is pursued, it would be unlikely to meet all future needs 
and it would probably still remain necessary to identify additional sites57. This 
issue is exacerbated by the constrained nature of some surrounding 
authorities. Stevenage Borough’s current plan strategy is likely to leave only 
limited development opportunities within their administrative area by 203158. 
4.112 Land to the west of the A1(M) at Stevenage within North Hertfordshire has 
long been identified as a sustainable location for a substantial urban 
extension to the town. Given the history of this site, it is considered there is 
sufficient justification to remove this site from the Green Belt now and 
safeguard it for future use. This land is not allocated for development at the 
present time. No development will be permitted until a plan review determines 
 
56 North Hertfordshire New Settlement Study (ATLAS, 2016) 
57 Long-term Government household and population projections, which form the starting point for 
consideration of local plan housing targets, continue to predict substantial growth within North 
Hertfordshire well beyond 2031.

  that the site is required to meet long-term needs and remains (part of) the 
most appropriate solution. 
4.113 In taking this approach, it is recognised that we are required to undertake a 
review of the Plan every five years to see if it needs to be updated.  This Plan 
commits to undertaking a full review by the end of 2023, well within the five-
year period. 
4.114 Policy IMR2 in the Monitoring and Delivery chapter of this plan sets out in 
greater detail how we expect the local plan review process to occur.  
4.115 As well as setting targets for the amounts of housing, it is vital that the Local 
Plan sets clear expectations as to the types of homes that will be built. 
4.116 The price of housing in North Hertfordshire is a key issue and many local 
residents are unable to afford housing without some form of assistance. At 
least one out of every three new homes built over the plan period will be 
Affordable Housing59 to meet local needs. This will be achieved through a 
tiered approach requiring up to 40% provision on allocated sites, with 100% 
affordable schemes appropriate in some instances. 
4.117 Self-build provides another route to home ownership. Small developments, 
often delivered by local builders and companies, have historically made a 
valuable contribution to housing land supply in North Hertfordshire. These 
include schemes designed by individuals for their own use. We will continue 
to support small windfall schemes where they are compatible with the policy 
framework of this plan. Government guidance also encourages us to facilitate 
further opportunities for people to self-build through Local Plan policies and 
other measures. On five of our strategic sites, 1% of plots will be reserved and 
marketed for those who wish to build their own home reflecting demand 
recorded on the Council’s Self-Build Register. No specific self-build targets 
have been set on Local Housing Allocation sites and local demand will be 
considered on a site-by-site basis having regards to the Council’s self-build 
register. Self-build may additionally be an issue that local communities wish to 
explore through Neighbourhood Plans. 
4.118 Detailed policies will ensure that development sites deliver an appropriate 
range of property sizes. Sites in the most accessible locations will generally 
be expected to provide smaller units at higher densities while we will also 
ensure appropriate levels of provision for the family market. 
4.119 We also need to provide the right sort of homes for older residents. Up to 650 
bed spaces of specialist accommodation may be required60. However, this 
needs to be viewed in the context of changes in the ways in which older 
people might seek to live, and in which providers might seek to deliver 
services over the plan period. A slightly lower requirement has been set, 
 
59 This term is defined in Annex 2 of the 2012 NPPF.

  offset against the additional requirement for ‘mainstream’ housing identified in 
paragraph 4.93. 
4.120 Our Sustainability Appraisal concludes that this policy provides clarity about 
the scale and location of housing which will be delivered in North 
Hertfordshire up to 2031. As well as securing long-term housing supply, 
stipulating the type and mix of housing required, the policy should help to 
support economic growth in the District through increasing local demand and 
spend and by creating jobs in construction and other development-related 
industry.  
 
 
  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031

  Design 
 
Policy SP9: Design and Sustainability 
The Council considers good design to be a key aspect of sustainable 
development. We will: 
a) Support new development where it is well designed and located and 
responds positively to its local context; 
b) Require Strategic Masterplans to be produced for Strategic Housing 
Sites and other significant development. Significant development 
generally comprises residential development of 100 dwellings or 
more.  Exceptionally, developments under 100 dwellings will be 
considered significant if there are site specific complexities and 
sensitives that require a masterplan-led approach.  In some 
circumstances a Strategic Masterplan may also be required to 
consider the cumulative impact of more than one site to support a 
co-ordinated and integrated approach to place-making and design. 
c) Require Strategic Masterplans and planning applications for 
Strategic Housing Sites and significant development to (as 
applicable):  
i. create buildings, spaces and streets which positively 
reflect and respond to the local landscape, townscape 
and historic character 
ii. create integrated, accessible and sustainable transport 
systems with walking, cycling and public transport 
designed to be the most attractive forms of transport and 
effectively linking into the surrounding areas; 
iii. provide a clear structure and hierarchy of pedestrian 
friendly streets and well-connected footpaths and 
cycleways integrate with the wider built and natural 
environment and communities; 
iv. plan for integrated and mixed-use communities with 
walkable locally accessible community, employment and 
retail facilities; 
v. positively integrate with adjacent rural and urban 
communities and positively contribute to their character 
and the way the area functions, including addressing 
cumulative, cross boundary planning and infrastructure 
matters; 
vi. create and accessible multi-functional green infrastructure 
network that provides: 
 a key structuring and functional place-making feature 
supporting healthy lifestyles, sport, play and recreation 
linking into the wider Green Infrastructure Network; 
and North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
70 
   a high-quality integrated network to support ecological 
connectivity, biodiversity net gain, climate adaptation 
and mitigation linking into the wider Ecological 
Network 
vii. ensure the effective use of sustainable urban drainage 
and sustainable water management; 
viii. ensure a hierarchy of linked, high quality and attractive 
public spaces and public realm that is safe, attractive and 
supports social interaction for all age groups; and 
ix. design to last with a clear stewardship, management and 
maintenance strategy 
d) Ensure Strategic Masterplans are informed by a technical and 
design evidence base and include the following for Strategic 
Housing Sites and where applicable for other significant 
development: 
i. site specific vision and place-making principles 
ii. Masterplan setting out the quantum, scale, type, mix and 
distribution of land uses, housing and community facilities;  
iii. Green Infrastructure Framework identifying the scale, 
distribution, type and design of green spaces, biodiversity 
net gain, strategic drainage and on and off-site linkages: 
iv. Movement Framework setting out the key access points, 
strategic highways, street hierarchy and footways and 
cycleways (on and off site) 
v. Urban Design Framework and design principles 
identifying how the site responds to local character and 
context and key structuring elements and layout principles 
(including heights and densities) 
vi. Sustainability & Energy Framework identifying site-wide 
and building scale opportunities for low and zero carbon 
vii. Illustrative Masterplan Layout 
viii. Infrastructure Delivery, Phasing & Management Strategy 
e) Encourage the submission of Strategic Masterplans for the 
Council’s consideration and agreement before the submission of a 
planning application.  We will also confirm the scope and contents of 
individual Strategic Masterplans with applicants in pre-application 
discussions.  Planning applications must be accompanied by a 
Strategic Masterplan.  Where applications have already been 
submitted to the Council a Strategic Masterplan should be agreed 
with the Council prior to or as part of the grant of planning 
permission.  Adherence to the Strategic Masterplan will be secured 
through planning conditions and/or legal agreement. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
71 
  f) Assess proposals against detailed policy requirements set out in this 
Plan and have regard to the Design SPD; and 
g) Adopt the Government’s additional technical standards for the size 
of new homes, water efficiency and, in specified circumstances, 
accessibility. 
4.121 Design is central to good planning. The achievement of high quality, 
sustainable design is required by Government guidance. Planning policies 
should promote high quality, inclusive design in layouts and buildings in terms 
of function and impact. Design which does not make the most of opportunities 
to improve the character and quality of an area should be refused. 
4.122 North Hertfordshire has a high quality natural and built environment. 
Promoting sustainable growth is one of the priorities for the District. Achieving 
this objective depends on securing development that is of a high quality and 
inclusive design which reinforces local distinctiveness through fully addressing 
the creation of a sense of place and a safe and healthy environment. 
4.123 North Hertfordshire is fortunate in having three historic market towns, the 
world’s first Garden City and many villages all with unique characters set in a 
high-quality rural environment. As development pressures increase in the 
District it is important to respect, retain and where possible enhance the 
existing character of both the urban and rural areas to maintain the quality of 
the District’s environment.  
4.124 Policy SP9 sets out the strategic design and masterplanning expectations of 
the Council for the Strategic Housing Sites and other significant development.  
The policy has to apply to a wide range of developments in terms of quantum, 
scale and complexity.  The policy should be applied in its entirety to the 
Strategic Housing Sites but for other significant development a tailored and 
case-by-case approach will be required to identify a proportionate level of 
masterplan and design detail to secure design quality dependant on site 
specific issues and the level of detail submitted with any planning application. 
4.125 Strategic Masterplans are an effective tool in securing comprehensive and 
timely delivery and securing design quality and positive place outcomes.  
Masterplans support comprehensive, integrated, well-planned and sustainable 
places in terms of the natural, built and historic environment.  An effective 
masterplanning process helps to support a multi-disciplinary, integrated, 
inclusive and collaborative approach to securing quality design and delivery.  
It also assists with resolving and co-ordinating planning issues at an early 
stage in the process speeding up decision-making and driving forward 
delivery through a shared vision. This both de-risks and provides certainty. 
4.126 We encourage the production of Strategic Masterplans on a staged basis, 
initially evaluating and agreeing baseline technical, character and design 
analysis and assessments, then agreeing a shared vision and set of place-
making objectives, exploring and testing a series of options with stakeholder 
inout and then the agreement of a preferred option and masterplan. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
72 
  4.127 For large sites that are developed over a long period, strategic masterplans 
may require review and be flexible to adapt to changing circumstances.  A 
Strategic Masterplan is not a blueprint but a framework within which further 
planning and design instruction can emerge over time. 
4.128 The detailed policies of this Plan and supplementary guidance set out 
standards that will apply to new development in the District. Government 
reforms and technical standards have streamlined the type and amount of 
additional requirements that we can ask of new development. Having regard 
to relevant evidence, we consider it appropriate to introduce these optional 
requirements in North Hertfordshire.  
4.129 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that this policy with its broad strategic 
approach should help to ensure that the plan delivers against a number of the 
sustainability appraisal framework objectives and is particularly important 
given the scale of new development proposed by this Plan.  
  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
73 
  Healthy Communities 
 
Policy SP10: Healthy Communities 
We will provide and maintain healthy, inclusive communities for our 
residents. We will 
a) Support the retention of existing community, cultural, leisure or 
recreation facilities; 
b) Require appropriate levels of new community, cultural, leisure and 
built sport & recreation facilities to be provided in new 
development; 
c) Work with the NHS Trust, the Clinical Commissioning Groups and 
other relevant providers to ensure appropriate coverage of 
healthcare facilities across the District; 
d) Maintain the network of local retail centres identified in Policy SP4 
and support the retention of locally-important shops; 
e) Work with Hertfordshire County Council and education providers to 
ensure the planning system contributes to the provision of 
sufficient school places and facilitates the provision of new or 
expanded schools in appropriate and accessible locations. This 
will include monitoring of projected future demand to inform the 
review of this plan in relation to secondary education provision for 
the Stevenage area; and 
f) Protect, enhance and create new physical and green infrastructure 
to foster healthy lifestyles. 
4.130 National policy recognises that the planning system plays a role in facilitating 
social interaction and creating healthy, inclusive communities. Community and 
recreation facilities together with green spaces can play an important role in 
the life of local people enabling people not only to participate in physical 
activities but also in cultural pastimes, all of which can help to enhance 
physical, spiritual and mental well-being. Community, leisure, recreation and 
cultural facilities can include village halls, community centres, sports halls, 
theatres, museums, libraries, places of worship, doctors and dental surgeries 
and schools. Retail facilities in the towns and villages are afforded protection 
by Policy SP4.  
4.131 Community provision requires partnership with key agencies. A number of 
community halls, for example, are owned and / or operated by parish councils.  
4.132 Our general presumption will be that existing facilities should be retained. 
However, there may be exceptions to this. Where facilities are being replaced, 
are not in the right location to address future patterns of demand or are no 
longer viable in their current form some limited losses of existing premises will 
be permitted. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
74 
  4.133 Our detailed policies set out our approach to considering applications, 
including proposals affecting Assets of Community Value. 
4.134 The East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust are responsible for hospital 
services. Health care delivered through GP surgeries and other secondary 
facilities is primarily managed by the East and North Hertfordshire Clinical 
Commissioning Group. The largest sites will be expected to make appropriate 
provision for new, on-site healthcare facilities. 
4.135 Most of the District operates a two-tier education system, with children 
attending primary schools from ages 4-11 and secondary schools from ages 
11-16 (and up to 18 where sixth-form provision is made).  
4.136 The east of the District operates a three-tier system of lower (ages 5-9), 
middle (9-13) and upper (13-16/18) schools. This system is also used in 
neighbouring Bedfordshire. On sites close or adjacent to the County 
boundary, consideration will need to be given as to the most appropriate 
forms of provision or contribution. 
4.137 At the same time, the Government’s changes may allow for more innovative 
and flexible approaches to school provision in the future. Concepts such as 
‘all through schools’ – which provide education for all ages from 4 to at least 
16 – may be appropriate in certain locations, including the largest 
development sites. This approach might also enable more sustainable travel 
patterns by providing modest levels of secondary school provision in locations 
where children currently have to travel further afield.  
4.138 We will work with Hertfordshire County Council, landowners, Academy Trusts 
and other relevant bodies to deliver appropriate solutions. Our Strategic 
Housing Sites will see the on-site provision of new primary and, where 
appropriate, secondary school facilities to serve the growing population. Some 
Local Housing Allocations will also result in new school places being provided, 
including at Ickleford, Codicote and Knebworth.  
4.139 Forecasting education demand that will arise from new developments over the 
long term is challenging. It is difficult to predict with certainty how and when 
school places will be needed until developments are built and new families 
move in. This is a particularly complex issue in the Stevenage area where 
housing developments have been proposed by three local authorities (North 
Hertfordshire, East Hertfordshire and Stevenage) across a wider number of 
and variety of sites contained in separate local plans. These plans set out 
allocations and requirements for secondary education that could meet 
demand well int the 2030s. However, this issue needs to be kept under review 
particularly as alternative sites and opportunities which supplement those 
identified in current Plans and/ or better address the County Councils 
operational preferences may arise over this period. We will monitor long-term 
forecasts of demand with the County Council to inform the early review set out 
in Policy IMR2. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
75 
  4.140 The NPPF addresses the importance that access to open space has for the 
health and wellbeing of a community. Physical infrastructure, for instance 
walking and cycling routes, can have dual benefits of improving health 
through exercise, whilst sustainable modes of transport also lessen the impact 
on the natural environment. Green infrastructure assets can also be a driver 
for economic growth and investment.   
4.141 The towns and villages of North Hertfordshire are attractive places in which to 
live and work. The green infrastructure network forms an essential part of the 
quality and character of the settlements, providing accessible formal 
recreation opportunities, informal open space, wildlife habitats and links to the 
countryside. During the plan period up to 2031 the District will need to 
accommodate housing growth and it is important that the green infrastructure 
network is protected where possible, and opportunities are taken to enhance 
the network to ensure that the settlements remain attractive and healthy 
places to live.  
4.142 In promoting the creation of healthy communities, the NPPF states that local 
authorities should identify specific needs, qualitative and quantitative deficits 
and any surpluses in open space provision, as well as any open space that is 
required. These requirements are set out in the detailed policies. 
4.143 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that this policy is critical to the delivery of a 
number of the social and environmental sub-objectives in the sustainability 
appraisal framework.   
 
  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
76 
  Natural and Historic Environment 
 
Policy SP11: Natural resources and sustainability 
This Plan seeks to meet the challenges of climate change and flooding. 
We will: 
a) Support proposals for renewable and low carbon energy 
development in appropriate locations; 
b) Take a risk based approach to development and flood risk, 
directing development to areas at lowest risk in accordance with 
the NPPF and ensuring the provision of Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SuDS) and other appropriate measures; 
c) Support the principles of the Water Environment (Water 
Framework Directive) Regulations 2017 and seek to protect, 
enhance and manage the water environment;  
d) Give consideration to the potential or actual impact of land 
contamination and support proposals that involve the remediation 
of contaminated land; and 
e) Work with utilities providers, East Hertfordshire District Council and 
relevant agencies to ensure additional wastewater treatment 
capacity is delivered without harm to protected European sites. 
4.144 To assist in securing radical reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the 
Council is required to help increase the use and supply of renewable and low 
carbon energy. Proposals for renewable and low carbon energy will be 
favourably considered subject to consideration of the impacts. A balance 
needs to be struck between the beneficial outcomes of renewable energy, and 
any adverse impacts produced by the development itself. 
4.145 Risk of flooding can arise from a number of sources including river flooding, 
surface water runoff, sewer or groundwater flooding. Within North 
Hertfordshire there are a number of rivers and streams. Localised flooding 
has also occurred away from those water courses. 
4.146 Our evidence has identified those areas of the District most at risk from 
flooding61. Development allocations have been identified in line with its 
recommendations. Where necessary, specific mitigation measures have been 
identified while our detailed policies set out the general requirements that will 
apply in all cases. 
4.147 This includes the provision of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS). 
SUDs are an important flood risk mitigation measure to manage surface water 
run-off. They can take a variety of forms, including green roofs, swales, 
 
61 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment update (North Hertfordshire District Council, 2016) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
77 
  permeable pavements and retention ponds and, when well designed, 
integrate with wider green infrastructure provision ( see Policy SP12). 
4.148 This Plan also seeks to have regard to the wider water environment. The 
Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) Regulations 201762 
transpose European legislation that requires member states to make plans to 
protect and improve the water environment. It seeks to improve the condition 
of all qualifying water bodies to a “good” status and prevent deterioration in 
the water environment. 
4.149 North Hertfordshire is located at the watershed between the Great Ouse and 
Thames river catchments. Headwaters of river catchments are, by their 
nature, small in terms of volume. This means that environmental capacity for 
change can be limited. 
4.150 Water Cycle Studies have been produced for both the Rye Meads catchment 
area63 and Royston64, where identified foul treatment infrastructure issues 
have arisen as a result of potential future development. Both studies identify 
that technical solutions can be realised. Where appropriate, contributions will 
be sought and / or conditions used in accordance with Policy SP7. 
4.151 Wastewater from some parts of North Hertfordshire is treated at Rye Meads 
on the Hertfordshire / Essex border. This site lies within a protected site of 
European importance and currently has capacity to serve additional 
development until 2026. We will work with the relevant bodies to ensure long-
term wastewater treatment solutions are available which will not have an 
adverse impact upon the Lee Valley Special Protection Area. 
4.152 Much of North Hertfordshire’s water supply comes from an unconfined aquifer 
sited beneath the District. We will ensure that development does not have an 
adverse impact upon groundwater. 
4.153 This approach should prevent pollution of the water environment. However, it 
is also important to have regard to pollution and contamination in a broader 
context. 
4.154 There are numerous sites in the District which are potentially affected by 
contamination as a consequence of their historical land uses. Our detailed 
policies set out the approach we will take to (potentially) contaminated sites 
and polluting uses. 
4.155 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that this policy supports a number of the 
sustainability appraisal framework objectives.

Policy SP12: Green infrastructure, landscape and biodiversity  
We will accommodate significant growth during the plan period whilst 
ensuring the natural environment is protected and enhanced.  We will: 
a) Protect, identify, manage and where possible enhance a strategic 
multi-functional network of green infrastructure;  
b) Consider and respect landscape character, scenic beauty and 
locally sensitive features, particularly in relation to the Chilterns 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty;  
c) Protect, enhance and manage designated sites in accordance with 
the following hierarchy of designations and features: 
 Internationally designated sites 
 Nationally designated sites 
 Locally designated sites;  
 Non-designated sites that include important habitats and 
species 
d) Protect, enhance and manage biodiversity networks including 
wildlife corridors, ancient woodlands and hedgerows, wetland and 
riverine habitats, Local Geological Sites, protected species, priority 
species and habitats, and non-designated sites of ecological value 
and ensure measurable net gains for biodiversity; and 
e) Protect other open spaces and support provision of new and 
improved open space. 
4.156 North Hertfordshire has a varied and attractive natural environment which is 
under increasing pressure from development, recreational uses and changing 
agricultural practices, particularly in the areas which are adjacent to the towns 
and villages.  
4.157 The natural environment forms the setting to the towns and villages in which 
people live, work and spend their leisure time. Where possible, it should be 
protected and enhanced in the future to maintain the existing high quality of 
life that people in the District enjoy. 
4.158 This Plan sets out a clear strategic approach for the protection, enhancement, 
creation and management of networks of green infrastructure. Green 
infrastructure refers to all assets within and between towns and villages, both 
urban and rural. It is a network of multi-functional open spaces, including 
urban parks, gardens, woodlands, hedgerows, watercourses and associated 
buffer zones, and green corridors in addition to protected sites, nature 
reserves and open countryside.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
79 
  4.159 Benefits to be gained from green infrastructure include a healthy environment, 
improved biodiversity value, climate change mitigation and flood attenuation 
as well as enhanced networks for walking and cycling, which contributes to a 
carbon neutral development. The retention of substantial connected networks 
of green space in urban, urban fringe and adjacent countryside areas to serve 
growing communities is vitally important in ensuring these benefits are 
maximised.  
4.160 Our detailed policies set out our approach to green infrastructure. 
4.161 Much of North Hertfordshire is largely unspoilt, with very attractive landscape 
encompassing a range of natural, man-made and urban and rural spaces. 
The natural landscape to the west of Hitchin towards Hexton and Lilley follows 
the escarpment of the Chiltern Hills and part of the District here falls within the 
Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). There are also locally 
important landscapes which contribute to a feeling of remoteness in other 
parts of the District, for example Lilley Bottom and the East Anglian Heights.  
4.162 Whilst there are no biodiversity sites designated at the European level in the 
District, for example Ramsar sites, Special Areas of Conservation or Special 
Protection Areas, there are a number of nationally designated sites. Strict 
protection and control will be applied to all national designations in 
accordance with the conservation of Species and Habitats Regulations 
(2010). These designations include six Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSIs) as shown on the Policies Map and eight designated Local Nature 
Reserves (LNRs).  
4.163 Ancient woodland is a nationally agreed designation for land that has been 
woodland since at least 1600 AD. The District’s woodlands will be managed 
over the plan period to provide recreation and amenity for local residents, and 
also to ensure their survival to benefit biodiversity. Ancient hedgerows are 
protected by the Hedgerow Regulations 1997 and will be protected and 
enhanced where possible to ensure their contribution to biodiversity and 
ecological networks.   
4.164 Species or Habitats of Principal Importance as identified in S41 of the Natural 
Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 are defined at the national 
level and the Hertfordshire Biodiversity Action Plan65 sets out an approach to 
biodiversity at the county level. In addition to this, the Hertfordshire Local 
Nature Partnership (LNP) Guiding Principles have informed the policies in this 
Plan. 
4.165 The District has over 300 designated Wildlife Sites66. The Hertfordshire 
Environmental Records Centre updates the list of designated Wildlife Sites on 
 
65 Hertfordshire Environmental Forum (2006) A Biodiversity Action Plan for Hertfordshire, 
http://www.hef.org.uk/nature/biodiversity_vision/index.htm  
66 Please refer to the list held by the Hertfordshire Environmental Records Centre for the current list of 
designated Wildlife Sites  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
80 
  a regular basis. Sites identified or designated as Wildlife Sites are afforded 
protection as sites of substantive nature conservation value.  
4.166 Local Geological Sites are given the same level of protection as Wildlife Sites 
and are considered important for their educational or historical value. There 
are currently 11 Local Geological Sites in North Hertfordshire. 
4.167 There are a wide range of important habitats within North Hertfordshire, 
including hedgerows, wildflower meadows, orchards, ponds, lakes, reed bed 
and fen, ancient woodlands in the south, chalk grasslands and chalk streams 
in the east,  and wet woodlands along the River Hiz and its tributaries, and a  
wildlife corridor which runs in a south-west to north-east direction passing 
through the northern part of the district which is an important asset of food 
and habitat for flora and fauna, particularly birds. Many of these habitats are 
subject to specific designations, reflecting their value in terms of wildlife 
interest, for instance national sites such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
and Local Nature Reserves, and local sites such as local wildlife sites. The 
Biodiversity Action Plan for Hertfordshire and the Green Infrastructure Plan for 
North Hertfordshire identify the importance of such habitats. 
4.168 North Hertfordshire is also host to a number of Local Geological Sites, which 
are identified as the most important sites for geology not covered by land 
protection designations, such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Our 
detailed policies set out the designations for biodiversity and geodiversity 
assets.   
4.169 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that our policy directly addresses the 
environmental protection objectives as set out in our sustainability appraisal 
and recognises the need to provide environmental protection in the context of 
accommodating significant growth. 
Policy SP13: Historic environment 
The Council will balance the need for growth with the proper protection 
and enhancement of the historic environment. When considering the 
impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated 
heritage asset, great weight will be given to the asset’s conservation and 
the management of its setting.  We will pursue a positive strategy for the 
conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment through: 
a) Maintaining a strong presumption in favour of the retention, 
preservation and enhancement of heritage assets and their setting 
according to their significance; 
b) Identifying sites on the national register of Heritage at Risk or on 
the Council’s ‘At Risk’  register; 
c) Periodic reviews of Conservation Areas and other locally 
designated assets; and 
d) Publication of detailed guidance. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
81 
  4.170 The District has a rich built heritage with many ancient monuments (many 
being associated with the prehistoric Icknield Way), 44 conservation areas 
and over 2,500 listed buildings. 
4.171 These factors make a strong positive contribution to North Hertfordshire but 
can be among the most vulnerable features of the District when major 
development is proposed. 
4.172 National policy seeks to conserve the historic environment which contributes 
to the local distinctiveness of the area, but also to facilitate development 
where it would not lead to substantial harm. In addition to this, the historic 
environment is among environmental matters that must be considered when 
pursuing sustainable development. The Council will take a positive and pro-
active approach to this historic environment. This section is our heritage 
strategy setting out the main features of the historic environment in North 
Hertfordshire. 
4.173 Currently identified Heritage assets in North Hertfordshire include: 
 Over 2,500 Listed Buildings 
 44 Conservation Areas 
 13 Registered Parks and Gardens 
 62 Scheduled Ancient Monuments 
 Over 1,000 sites of Archaeological Interest 
4.174 Listed Buildings are designated by central Government. With the District’s fine 
urban and rural history, the statutory list includes buildings and structures of a 
wide range of sizes, ages, types and uses and of varying architectural styles, 
methods of construction and materials, both local and imported. 
4.175 Of the 2,500 listed buildings within North Hertfordshire, 29 buildings have the 
highest Grade I listing, whilst a further 135 are Grade II* listed. 
4.176 The forty-four Conservation Areas in North Hertfordshire include (parts of) 
settlements of varying characters from the historic linear core of Barkway to 
the original town centre and residential neighbourhoods of Letchworth Garden 
City.  
4.177 Conservation Areas are designated under separate legislation to that which is 
used for local plans. Appraisal and review can therefore take place on a 
rolling-basis alongside and / or outside of the local plan process. 
4.178 Over the lifetime of this Plan, we will carry out a programme of work relating to 
our Conservation Areas with priority for locations with potential development 
pressures and where there have been significant changes since the 
designation was first made. The reviews will include the production of 
character statements and will provide opportunities to consider amending 
boundaries. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
82 
  4.179 We will consider the need to develop supplementary guidance for 
Conservation Areas in the form of management plans. Where this is pursued, 
it will become a material consideration in the determination of relevant 
applications. 
4.180 Historic England maintains a national register of Heritage at risk for sites that 
are most at risk of being lost as a result of neglect, decay or inappropriate 
development. The Council will also explore, with parish councils and 
designated neighbourhood planning groups, the possibility of developing a list 
of locally designated heritage assets at risk. If implemented, we would work 
with Historic England, owners and occupiers to find new, appropriate uses 
and solutions to secure the future of heritage assets. 
4.181 Historic assets can also form part of the green infrastructure network. Of the 
thirteen Registered Parks and Gardens in the District, one is Grade I (St 
Paul’s Walden Bury); one is Grade II* (Knebworth Park) and eleven are Grade 
II. These sites contain listed buildings and so also form part of their setting. 
The registered sites are of varying ages and character dating from the 18th 
century through to the early 20th century. Historic England’s advice suggests 
about two-thirds of the sites on the register are of national significance.  
4.182 Working with the Hertfordshire Gardens Trust and based on its advice the 
Council will, where possible, identify other sites of interest. These will be 
added to the Hertfordshire Historic Environment Record (HER) and will be 
considered by the Council as non-designated heritage assets, as defined in 
the NPPF, and given appropriate consideration in the determination of 
planning applications.  
4.183 In addition, because there are no special controls for works within historic 
parks and gardens, we will consider serving Tree Preservation Orders outside 
conservation areas where the character of a site may be threatened by the 
loss of important trees. 
4.184 North Hertfordshire has an especially rich archaeological heritage, including 
Archaeology Areas and Areas of Archaeological Interest. 
4.185 There is archaeological evidence of human activity from early prehistoric 
times but with the District probably being best known for its late Iron Age and 
Roman remains.  
4.186 In addition, there are Iron Age hill forts, a number of important ancient roads 
and routes including the Icknield Way and Roman Ermine Street and small 
mediaeval castles and moated manor sites. 
4.187 As well as the sixty-two scheduled ancient monuments there are a number of 
sites within the District that have been identified as being of comparable 
national importance to the sixty-two scheduled ancient monuments.  
4.188 In accordance with the NPPF, these will be considered in the same way as 
scheduled sites in the determination of development proposals. Many other North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
83 
  sites of interest are known and new sites are becoming known on a regular 
basis. Because of this, a finite list of sites and their areas cannot be identified. 
Sites of interest are included in the Hertfordshire Historic Environment 
Record, which is be updated on an annual basis. 
4.189 The Council recognises the importance of these heritage assets and has 
additionally been developing and adopting Registers of Buildings of Local 
Importance on a parish by parish basis in conjunction with Conservation Area 
reviews. 
4.190 The detailed policies of this Plan identify those sites where impact upon the 
historic environment must be carefully managed. 
4.191 Our Sustainability Appraisal says that our policy directly addresses the 
sustainability appraisal framework objectives relating to the protection, 
conservation and enhancement of heritage assets and landscapes. 
  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
84 
  Strategic Housing Sites 
4.192 The following policies identify our Strategic Housing Sites and set out site-
specific measures to be addressed in any proposals. These are in addition to 
matters set out in the detailed policies of this Plan, such as affordable housing 
and open space, which apply in all cases. 
4.193 The supporting text to Policy SP8 sets out the key findings of our 
Sustainability Appraisal in relation to housing. Each Strategic Housing Site 
has additionally been subject to an individual appraisal which has informed 
the policies below. Further details can be found in the Environmental Report, 
which should be referred to for more information67. 
4.194 All strategic sites will be informed by a Strategic Masterplan. We encourage 
their production to be undertaken pro-actively and collaboratively with the 
Council and key stakeholders in accordance with Policy SP9 Design and 
Sustainability and the individual site policy requirements.  Planning 
applications must be accompanied by a Strategic Masterplan, and adherence 
to it and any further masterplanning and design requirements will be secured 
through conditions and/or legal agreements. 
Policy SP14: Site BA1 – North of Baldock 
Land to the north of Baldock, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated as 
a Strategic Housing Site for a new neighbourhood of approximately 2,800 
homes.  
A comprehensive and deliverable Strategic Masterplan for the entire 
allocation is to be prepared and agreed between the landowner/developer 
and the Council. 
Where applications have already been submitted to the Council a Strategic 
Masterplan should be agreed prior to the or as part of the grant of planning 
permission. 
Any application on part of the site will be assessed against its contribution 
to the Strategic Masterplan and must not prejudice the implementation of 
the site as a whole. 
Development proposals should provide the following planning and 
masterplanning requirements:  
a) A new mixed-use local centre/s to provide for a range of day to day 
local needs including additional along with additional neighbourhood-
level provision of around 500m2 (net) convenience retail provision 
and 1,400m2 (net) of comparison retail and food and beverage 
floorpsace; 
b) Structural planting to create a sense of place, integration into 
surrounding landscape and to reinforce a long-term, defensible 
Green Belt boundary to the north and east; 
 
67 Sustainability Appraisal of the North Hertfordshire Local Plan (CAG, 2022) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
85 
  c) A new link road connecting the A507 North Road to the A505 
Baldock bypass including a new bridge across the railway; 
d) Sustainable transport measures to include: 
i. a secondary rail crossing for pedestrians and cyclists in the 
vicinity of Ashville Way; 
ii. safe access routes to / from, and upgrades to, Baldock 
station;  
iii. sensitive integration of Bridleway Baldock 034 / Bygrave 002 
as a north-south route through the development; and 
iv. the use of Bygrave Road / Ashwell Road from the south-
western edge of the allocated site to the link road as a 
sustainable transport corridor; and 
v. comprehensive integration into the existing pedestrian and 
cycle, public transport and road networks 
e) At least 28 serviced plots for self-build development; 
f) Provision of an appropriate site for a care home for older people in 
Use Class C2 in accordance with the locational criteria in Policy 
HS4; 
g) A community hall and GP surgery;  
h) Up to 6 forms of entry (FE) of additional primary-age education 
provision;  
i) Up to 8 forms of entry (FE) of additional secondary-age education 
provision.  A secondary school larger than 6FE will be supported 
where: 
i. it is located at the south of the allocation site; and 
ii. safe, sustainable and direct routes to school are provided 
from Clothall Common; 
j) Address existing surface water flood risk issues, particularly to the 
south of Ashwell Road, through SUDs or other appropriate solution; 
k) Appropriate mitigation, compensation and / or enhancement of key 
features of biodiversity as informed by detailed assessments 
including: 
i. Ivel Springs Local Nature Reserve; 
ii. Bygrave Road local wildlife site; and 
iii. identified protected species and priority habitats; 
l) Built development contained to the south and south-west of the 
ridgeline that generally extends eastwards from the A507 south of 
Blackhorse Farm and southwards from Ashwell Road; and 
m) Sensitive treatment of heritage assets and their settings including: North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
86 
  i. an access solution from the A507 North Road which 
satisfactorily addresses potential impacts; 
ii. retaining framed views of St Mary’s Church from within and 
beyond the site; and 
iii. using the location of areas of archaeological significance to 
inform a site-wide green infrastructure strategy. 
iv. iv. Ivel Springs Scheduled Ancient Monument  
4.195 Land to the north of Baldock is the largest, single development site allocated 
through this Plan. A total of 2,800 homes can be accommodated here, 1,400 
of which are anticipated to be built within the plan period to 2031. 
4.196 The location of the site, and the way in which Baldock has historically 
developed, enables substantial new development within relatively close 
proximity to both the train station and Baldock town centre. 
4.197 This site enables growth to meet needs arising from the surrounding areas in 
such a way that does not erode the narrow gaps between the towns of 
Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and Baldock. 
4.198 The site is also large enough to support new schools, local facilities and a 
new link road, including an additional road bridge over the railway so that not 
all traffic has to use the Station Road bridge and the White Horse crossroads. 
4.199 At minimum, the site will contain a 6FE secondary school to ensure the 
demands arising from within the development can be met.  A larger school of 
8FE would additionally serve existing residents of Clothall Common and 
adjoining new development.  Appropriate measures to ensure pupils can 
safely and conveniently walk or cycle to school from the south of the railway 
line will be required to support this scale of provision. 
4.200 A range of sustainable transport measures will be required. Critically, this will 
include measures that allow safe access to the northern side of Baldock 
station and the town centre as well as routes through the development to 
provide access to the wider countryside for all Baldock residents.   
4.201 National policy encourages the creation of inclusive and mixed communities 
meeting the needs of all age groups. A small proportion of plots will be 
reserved for those wishing to build their own home. Land will also be reserved 
for a home for older people who need greater levels of care. A minimum of 
50-60 bed spaces are likely to be required in order to support the provision of 
communal facilities and on-site staff. The care home site should be 
sustainably located close to key facilities in line with the requirements of 
Policy HS4. 
4.202 To the north, the allocation extends to the line of Bridleway Bygrave 001. This 
right of way is considered the most appropriate long-term, defensible North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
87 
  boundary for the Green Belt68. Additional planting may be required to reinforce 
its role. However, there is a clear ridgeline located approximately 200 metres 
to the south of this which is considered the most appropriate limit for built 
development. 
4.203 To the south of the ridgeline, the site faces towards the existing town. To the 
north it relates to the countryside beyond. This area would be most 
appropriate for the provision of some types of open space, school playing 
fields and / or replacement habitat where it creates an appropriate transition 
between the rural and urban. 
4.204 Along the eastern edge, the boundary to the north of Ashwell Road is defined 
by a field boundary hedgerow which should be reinforced. The boundary and 
ridgeline to the south of Ashwell Road are less well defined. 
4.205 The masterplanning process should address these issues and, where 
possible, mitigate against adverse impacts upon the wider landscape. 
4.206 The site and surrounding area has been specifically identified as (potentially) 
hosting a variety of habitats and species protected by legislation. This 
includes the corn bunting69. Appropriate measures will be required as part of 
any application. This may range from the localised retention of habitats on-site 
to biodiversity offsetting. This is where habitats lost are re-provided at an 
appropriate alternate location. 
4.207 Baldock and its surrounds are home to a wide-range of heritage assets. This 
includes sites associated with ancient settlements, the town centre 
Conservation Area and a range of individually listed buildings. 
Policy SP15: Site LG1 – North of Letchworth Garden City 
Land to the north of Letchworth Garden City, as shown on the Policies 
Map, is allocated as a Strategic Housing Site for a new neighbourhood of 
approximately 900 homes.  
A comprehensive and deliverable Strategic Masterplan for the entire 
allocation is to be prepared and agreed between the landowner/developer 
and the Council. This should follow and implement Garden City principles. 
Where applications have already been submitted to the Council a Strategic 
Masterplan should be agreed prior to the or as part of the grant of planning 
permission. 
Any application on part of the site will be assessed against its contribution 
to the Strategic Masterplan and must not prejudice the implementation of 
the site as a whole. 
Development proposals should provide the following planning and 
masterplanning requirements:

69 Blackhorse Farm, Baldock. Guidance Note; Corn Bunting (BSG Ecology, 2016) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
88 
  a) The most appropriate points of vehicular access considering 
landscape and traffic impacts; 
b) Comprehensive integration into the existing pedestrian and cycle, 
public transport and road networks;  
c) An appropriate education solution which delivers a new 2FE primary 
school on-site;  
d) Measures required to address nearby heritage assets including the 
Scheduled Ancient Monument at Radwell Lodge and the Croft Lane 
and Norton Conservation Areas;  
e) The approach to existing trees and hedgerows around and within 
the site, with the presumption that trees will be retained and any 
hedgerow losses kept to a minimum;  
f) Neighbourhood-level retail and community facilities providing 
around 900m2 (net) of retail and food and beverage floorspace and 
a GP surgery; 
g) At least 9 serviced plots for self-build development; 
h) Provision of an appropriate site for a care home for older people in 
Use Class C2 in accordance with the locational criteria in Policy 
HS4 subject to up-to-date assessment of likely future needs and 
existing supply; 
i) Incorporate ordinary watercourses (and any appropriate measures) 
within comprehensive green infrastructure and / or SUDs approach; 
j) Structural planting to create a sense of place, integration into the 
surrounding landscape and a long-term, defensible Green Belt 
boundary, particularly to the north-west and east;  
k) Diversion and / or re-provision of the Letchworth Greenway to 
provide a revised route around the new urban edge; and 
l) Undertake a detailed odour assessment to demonstrate no adverse 
impact on future residents and occupants of non residential 
buildings. 
4.208 Letchworth holds a special place as the world’s first garden city. Although 
development of the town to Ebenezer Howard’s original vision of 32,000 
residents has been achieved, it is considered there remains scope for a 
sensitive extension of the town to the north, which respects the town’s original 
ideals while making provision for the needs of the 21st Century. A masterplan 
will be required for this site which demonstrates how these principles will be 
incorporated. 
4.209 The masterplan will also be required to demonstrate an access solution which 
works in both highway and urban design terms. Previous work has shown that 
a new access from Norton Road could be accommodated in landscape 
terms70. However, this needs to be balanced against a requirement to 
 
70 Land north of Letchworth: landscape sensitivity study (LUC, 2013) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
89 
  properly integrate this site with the existing Garden City. At the same time, 
any impacts upon the existing local highway network need to be managed 
within acceptable limits. 
4.210 Sites at this scale generate enough demand to support the provision of new 
primary schools on-site. Site LG1 will follow this principle. However, the 
irregular shape of the site and the location of surrounding schools mean that 
this requires further consideration through the masterplanning process to 
ensure existing school intake and travel patterns are not unduly affected. 
4.211 Although this site will not generate a requirement for a local centre which 
forms part of the formal retail hierarchy, it will be necessary to provide 
neighbourhood-level shops and facilities to ensure that the new development 
is sustainable. Our evidence also identifies a requirement for a new GP 
surgery in Letchworth to serve new development71. 
4.212 A small proportion of plots will be reserved for those wishing to build their own 
home. To ensure sufficient provision of homes for older people, any 
application should be supported by up-to-date evidence of housing need. This 
will determine whether it is necessary to make provision for a care home. 
These normally require a minimum of 50-60 bed spaces in order to support 
the provision of communal facilities and on-site staff so an accurate picture of 
existing supply across Letchworth and the wider district will be essential. Any 
care home site should be sustainably located close to key facilities in line with 
the requirements of Policy HS4. 
4.213 This site forms part of the elevated northerly edge to Letchworth. Much of the 
site is relatively flat though falls away to the north-west towards Pix Brook and 
to the north / north east to the Ivel Valley, with several ordinary watercourses 
on the site draining broadly in these directions. 
4.214 Our evidence shows that, within the plateau on which most of the site sits, 
there is only low landscape sensitivity to development. In the peripheral areas, 
there are views across a much wider landscape which continues into 
neighbouring Central Bedfordshire72. 
4.215 Although parts of the north-eastern boundary are quite clearly defined, there 
are currently limited features demarcating the north-west and eastern edges 
of the site. These should be addressed in a comprehensive strategy which 
limits any harm to existing green infrastructure and the wider landscape, 
preserves the setting of nearby heritage assets and creates new defensible 
limits to the town. 
4.216 The Letchworth Greenway is an off-road circular route around the edge of the 
town. It was constructed in 2003 to celebrate the town’s centenary. 
Development of this site will result in incorporation of part of the existing 
Greenway into the urban area. These affected sections should be re-routed

  and re-provided as part of any application. The possibility of providing radial 
link paths from the existing urban area, through the site to the Greenway (and 
beyond) should be explored as part of a comprehensive green infrastructure 
strategy. 
4.217 An odour assessment will need to demonstrate that a suitable distance is 
provided between Letchworth Garden City Water Recycling Centre and 
sensitive development (defined as buildings which are regularly occupied) as 
part of the detailed masterplanning of the site. 
Policy SP16: Site NS1 – North of Stevenage 
Land to the north of Stevenage within Graveley parish, as shown on the 
Policies Map, is allocated as a Strategic Housing Site for a new 
neighbourhood of approximately 900 homes.  
A comprehensive and deliverable Strategic Masterplan for the entire 
allocation is to be prepared and agreed between the landowner/developer 
and the Council. 
Where applications have already been submitted to the Council a Strategic 
Masterplan should be agreed prior to the or as part of the grant of planning 
permission. 
Any application on part of the site will be assessed against its contribution 
to the Strategic Masterplan and must not prejudice the implementation of 
the site as a whole. 
Development proposals should provide the following planning and 
masterplanning requirements:  
a) Integration with adjoining development in Stevenage Borough 
including site-wide solutions for access, sustainable travel, 
education, retail, and other necessary medical and social 
infrastructure to include:  
i. 2FE of primary-age education provision either wholly within 
the site or in conjunction with the adjoining land allocated for 
development in Stevenage Borough ensuring adequate 
primary school capacity across both sites over the lifetime of 
the developments;  
ii. travel provision designed having regard to the Stevenage 
Mobility Strategy and including: 
 Effective links into the existing pedestrian and cycle, 
public transport and road networks; and 
 an upgraded junction at the intersection of Graveley Road 
/ North Road; and 
iii. neighbourhood-level retail facilities subject to an up-to-date 
assessment of local demand and supply; 
b) A detailed drainage strategy identifying water infrastructure required 
and mechanism(s) for delivery; North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
91 
  c) At least 9 serviced plots for self-build development;  
d) Structural planting to create a sense of place, integration into 
surrounding landscape and a long-term, defensible Green Belt 
boundary to the north;  
e) Integration of existing public rights of way to provide routes through 
the site to the wider countryside including: 
i. Footpath Graveley 006 and Bridleway Gravely 008 along the 
perimeter of the site; and 
ii. Footpath Graveley 007 as a south-east to north-west route 
through the site and link path from the urban area to the 
Stevenage Outer Orbital Path;  
f) Sensitive consideration of existing settlements, landscape features 
and heritage assets including:  
i. Graveley village and Conservation Area; 
ii. the St Nicholas & Rectory Lane Conservation Area including 
the Grade I listed St Nicholas Church and Rook’s Nest; and 
iii. Chesfield Park.

assessments to mitigate any landscape, heritage and Green Belt 
impacts to the fullest reasonable extent. 
4.218 The area north of Stevenage is currently undeveloped farmland in the parish 
of Graveley. Adjoining land within Stevenage Borough to the south has been 
identified for development and this provides an opportunity for a coherent 
extension of the town to the north73. A masterplanning exercise for this site 
will need to consider the collective implications of these allocations and 
demonstrate appropriate solutions. This may lead to some facilities which will 
serve the whole development being located wholly within either North 
Hertfordshire’s or Stevenage’s administrative areas. 
4.219 It is envisaged that principal access to the site will be in the form of a looped 
estate road, one end of which will be in Stevenage Borough. The northern end 
of this road will emerge at, or close to, the existing junction of the B197 at 
Graveley Road / North Road. A new arrangement, possibly a roundabout, will 
need to be provided. Any transport proposals should consider the effects on 
adjacent networks and communities such as Graveley, and propose suitable 
mitigation; the analysis should also consider cumulative impacts. 
4.220 The site will need to integrate provision for walkers, cyclists and public 
transport in line with the aims of the Stevenage Mobility Strategy. This will 
include connections to the wider sustainable travel network. These measures, 
 
73 Stevenage Borough Local Plan 2011-2031 (May 2019) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
92 
  along with wider transport and mobility proposals arising from development of 
the site, will be developed in consultation with Hertfordshire County Council 
and Stevenage Borough Council. 
4.221 Development at this scale would normally generate a requirement for the on-
site provision of a 2FE primary school. The relationship with the adjoining land 
in Stevenage means that, in this instance, it may be possible to co-locate 
education provision for the two schemes to ensure the most effective 
outcome. 
4.222 Our evidence suggests that the three housing allocations to the north of 
Stevenage within the District will generate a requirement for two additional 
GPs74. The most appropriate location and format for this provision will be 
determined in consultation with health service providers also having regard to 
existing and proposed patterns of provision within Stevenage. 
4.223 The retail forecasts supporting the plan suggest that approximately 1,300m2 
of A-class floorspace could be accommodated within this site to meet the 
needs arising from the new housing75. Equally it is recognised that Site NS1 is 
located in close proximity to existing and proposed convenience supermarkets 
and proposed local facilities within Stevenage. Any application should be 
supported by an up-to-date assessment of local retail requirements to ensure 
provision within this site is appropriately scaled to meet the needs generated 
by the development. 
4.224 Existing field boundaries in this area are generally quite well defined. 
However, in order to preserve the setting and separation of Graveley village 
and its Conservation Area, it is considered most appropriate to draw back the 
allocation and Green Belt boundaries to a new alignment. This will require 
new planting and sensitive design and layout to preserve the setting of the 
Conservation Area. 
4.225 These perimeter areas also incorporate statutory rights of way which should 
be retained. A further footpath bisects the development and this should be 
incorporated as a green route from the Stevenage urban area, through the 
development site to the countryside beyond. 
4.226 This route also forms a recognised link to the Stevenage Outer Orbital Path 
(StOOP). StOOP is a 27-mile walking route around the town using footpaths 
and other routes that are open to the public.  
4.227 The site is in close proximity to a number of heritage assets. Sensitive design 
and layout will be required to ensure that any harm to their settings is 
minimised. Assessment of any impact upon the historic environment must be 
comprehensive and should not stop at the administrative boundary. To the 
south-east of the site, the adjoining land within Stevenage Borough is known 
colloquially as ‘Forster Country’ in recognition of author EM Forster. His

  childhood home of Rook’s Nest is Grade I listed with a large part of its historic 
landscape setting protected by a the St Nicholas’ and Rectory Lane 
Conservation Area. This conservation area also contains and provides the 
setting for a Grade I listed, twelfth century church. 
4.228 To the east lies Chesfield Park. Although not formally recognised through 
statutory listings or registers, the house and surrounding parkland are 
important local features. These are generally well separated from the 
allocated site by an existing tree belt but the transition between these areas 
will need to be considered. 
Policy SP17: Site HT1 – Highover Farm, Hitchin 
Land to the east of Hitchin, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated as a 
Strategic Housing Site for a new neighbourhood of approximately 700 
homes.  
A comprehensive and deliverable Strategic Masterplan for the entire 
allocation is to be prepared and agreed between the landowner/developer 
and the Council. 
Where applications have already been submitted to the Council a Strategic 
Masterplan should be agreed prior to the or as part of the grant of planning 
permission. 
Any application on part of the site will be assessed against its contribution 
to the Strategic Masterplan and must not prejudice the implementation of 
the site as a whole. 
Development proposals should provide the following planning and 
masterplanning requirements:  
a) Neighbourhood-level retail facilities providing approximately 500m2 
(net) of retail and food and beverage floorspace; 
b) Principal access from Stotfold Road with provision for sustainable 
modes of transport and comprehensive integration into the existing 
pedestrian and cycle, public transport and road networks; 
c) At least 7 serviced plots for self-build development; 
d) Approximately two hectares of land reserved for provision of a new 
primary school; 
e) Appropriate separation distances from the adjoining railway 
embankment to safeguard residential amenity;  
f) Lower density development and / or green infrastructure provision 
as informed by detailed landscape assessments at the north of the 
site to: 
i. maintain appropriate visual and physical separation 
between Hitchin and Letchworth Garden City;  
ii. address surface water flood risk; and North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
94 
  iii. respect the setting of the scheduled burrows to the north-
east; 
g) Sensitive consideration of other designated and non-designated 
heritage assets at Highover Farm including the Grade II listed 
Threshing Barn;  
h) Undertake Contaminated Land Preliminary Risk Assessment, 
particularly relating to current and historic agricultural use; and 
i) Undertake ecological appraisal in relation to Stotfold Road Verges 
and Hitchin Railway Banks Wildlife Sites. 
4.229 The land at Highover Farm provides opportunity for a strategic-scale site on 
the edge of Hitchin to address locally arising needs.  
4.230 Although this site will not generate a requirement for a local centre which 
forms part of the formal retail hierarchy, it will be necessary to provide 
neighbourhood-level shops and facilities to ensure that the new development 
is sustainable. 
4.231 This development will necessitate a new principal access from Stotfold Road. 
However, it is important to ensure that this does not result in new 
development ‘turning its back’ on the remainder of Hitchin. 
4.232 A site at this scale will generate sufficient demand to support a new primary 
school on site. This will need to be at least 1FE in size. Further information on 
likely pupil yields, along with an understanding of any extent to which the 
nearby Highover JMI School may be able to meet future demands, will 
determine if it is necessary to deliver a 2FE school on-site. 
4.233 A number of existing roads run to the edge of the allocated land, including 
Highover Way and High Dane. These provide opportunities to integrate 
development with the surrounding area whilst ensuring that any such routes 
do not create an alternate access from Stotfold Road to the industrial areas 
located between the railway lines 
4.234 The most appropriate solutions will be determined through the Development 
Management process having regard to the detailed policies of this Plan. 
4.235 Although the gap between Hitchin and Letchworth Garden City is relatively 
narrow in this location, it is considered that Stotfold Road and the Cambridge 
railway provide definitive, defensible boundaries. Notwithstanding this point, it 
will be necessary to demonstrate an appropriate design solution as the site 
tapers to its northern end to respect this separation and nearby heritage 
assets. 
4.236 The Highover Farm complex, at the south-west of the allocation site, is an 
important and long-evolved complex of agricultural buildings recognised on 
the Council’s register of locally important heritage assets. In 2018, the 
Threshing Barn, which lies within this complex, was Grade II listed. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
95 
  Policy SP18: Site GA2  – Land off Mendip Way, Great Ashby 
Land to the north-east of Great Ashby within Weston parish, as shown 
on the Policies Map, is allocated as a Strategic Housing Site for a new 
neighbourhood of approximately 600 homes.  
A comprehensive and deliverable Strategic Masterplan for the entire 
allocation is to be prepared and agreed between the 
landowner/developer and the Council. 
Where applications have already been submitted to the Council a 
Strategic Masterplan should be agreed prior to the or as part of the grant 
of planning permission. 
Any application on part of the site will be assessed against its 
contribution to the Strategic Masterplan and must not prejudice the 
implementation of the site as a whole. 
Development proposals should provide the following planning and 
masterplanning requirements:  
a) Neighbourhood-level facilities providing approximately 500m2 
(net) of retail and food and beverage floorspace and other 
necessary medical and social infrastructure; 
b) Four hectares of land at the north of the allocation site, broadly 
bounded by Footpaths Weston 044 and Weston 027 and Dell 
Spring reserved for education use to accommodate 2FE of 
primary-age provision and 4FE of secondary age provision;  
c) Principal access from Mendip Way with: 
i. provision for sustainable modes of transport having regard 
to the Stevenage Mobility Strategy; and 
ii. comprehensive integration into the existing pedestrian and 
cycle, public transport and road networks; 
d) Transport Assessment to identify and secure measures to 
manage traffic flows arising from the development along Back 
Lane; 
e) A detailed drainage strategy identifying water infrastructure 
required and mechanism(s) for delivery; 
f) At least 6 serviced plots for self-build development;  
g) Structural planting along site boundaries as informed by detailed 
landscape assessments to reinforce the revised Green Belt 
boundary and mitigate landscape impacts;  
h) Address existing surface water flood risk issues, particularly 
running south-east from Dell Spring to Newberry Grove, through 
SUDs or other appropriate solution; 
i) Appropriate mitigation, compensation and / or enhancement of 
key features of biodiversity including: North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
96 
  i. local wildlife sites at Tilekiln Wood, Parsonsgreen Wood, 
New Spring Wood, Brooches Wood and Claypithills Spring 
Wood;  
ii. identified protected species and priority habitats; and 
iii. retention of green infrastructure connectivity and corridors 
to the wider countryside; 
j) Integration of existing public rights of way within and adjoining the 
site to provide routes to the wider countryside including 
i. Footpaths Weston 027 and Weston 044 and Bridleway 
Weston 033 as features which help define the perimeters 
of the site; and 
ii. Footpath Weston 029 as a potential green corridor through 
the site;  
k) Provision of a green infrastructure corridor beneath the current 
alignment of the pylon lines to respect statutory safety clearance 
requirements for residential development; and 
l) Lower intensity development and / or green infrastructure 
provision to the north of the site to minimise harm to the setting of 
listed buildings. 
4.237 Great Ashby is a relatively new parish, representing the residential area 
adjoining Stevenage that has been substantially completed since the turn of 
the century. For the purposes of our settlement hierarchy it is considered to 
be a town. 
4.238 Land to the north-east of the existing settlement limits is identified for the 
development of approximately 600 homes within the parish of Weston. 
4.239 Although this site will not generate a requirement for a local centre which 
forms part of the formal retail hierarchy, it will be necessary to provide 
neighbourhood-level shops and facilities to ensure that the new development 
is sustainable. Our evidence identifies that the three housing allocations to the 
north of Stevenage within the District will generate a requirement for two 
additional GPs. The most appropriate location and format for this provision will 
be determined in consultation with health service providers also having regard 
to existing and proposed patterns of provision within Stevenage. 
4.240 Great Ashby’s existing primary school is significantly oversubscribed. As a 
consequence, it draws its intake from a very tight catchment area. There is 
also no local secondary school and Hertfordshire County Council has 
identified future pressures on secondary-age provision in the Stevenage area 
as a key concern. 
4.241 Development of this site provides the opportunity to address these issues. 
Reserving sufficient land within this site to deliver 2FE of primary-age and 
4FE of secondary-age provision will meet the requirements arising from the North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
97 
  site itself and also help alleviate pressures arising from existing and planned 
development in Great Ashby. Together these will help to create a more 
sustainable residential neighbourhood at the north-east of Stevenage 
enabling more short-distance journeys to school. 
4.242 It is currently anticipated that the secondary element of a new school will not 
be required before the late 2020s at the earliest. To ensure an appropriately 
sized site, additional school playing fields would be required on land beyond 
the allocation boundary to the south-west of Footpath Weston 027 and 
Warrensgreen Wood towards Warrens Green Lane. This land is retained 
within the Green Belt to ensure appropriate control over any built structures. 
4.243 The Stevenage Mobility Strategy aims to significantly increase the proportion 
of journeys undertaken on foot, by bike and by public transport over the plan 
period. Sites on the edge of Stevenage will need to make appropriate 
provision for sustainable modes of transport, and appropriate contributions to 
relevant sustainable travel schemes across the town, to ensure that they meet 
these aims. 
4.244 There are local concerns that Back Lane, a narrow minor road which leads to 
Church Lane in Graveley, could be used by increased numbers of vehicles 
leaving the site, and that junctions in Graveley itself will suffer from congestion 
as a result of increased flows. This issue should be specifically addressed in 
the Transport Assessment for the site as part of the consideration of likely 
development impacts upon the wider highway network.  
4.245 These measures, along with wider transport and mobility proposals arising 
from development of the site, will be developed in consultation with 
Hertfordshire County Council and Stevenage Borough Council. 
4.246 Much of the revised Green Belt boundary has been drawn along the routes of 
public rights of way. Although clearly defined features, parts of their 
alignments cut across more open land. Structural planting will reinforce the 
new boundary as well as providing visual containment of the development. 
4.247 Distinct areas of woodland lie between the site and the existing development 
at Great Ashby. These should be sensitively incorporated into the 
development having regard to their status as local wildlife sites. These woods, 
and the connections from them to the wider countryside, will be integral to the 
green infrastructure of the site. This will also include incorporation of key 
rights of way. 
4.248 A green infrastructure corridor currently runs through Great Ashby following 
the alignment of the overhead power lines. This should additionally be carried 
through the new development to provide a continuous link through the 
neighbourhood to the wider countryside. The width of the corridor will be 
informed by the health and safety clearance requirements imposed by 
National Grid (or any other relevant body). North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
98 
  4.249 The site adjoins a number of Grade II listed buildings at Tile Kiln Farm and 
care should be taken in the detailed design of any scheme to ensure this area 
retains an appropriate setting. 
Policy SP19: Sites EL1, EL2 & EL3  – East of Luton 
Land to the east of Luton, as shown on the Policies Map, is allocated as a 
Strategic Housing Site for a new neighbourhood of approximately 2,100 
homes.  
A comprehensive and deliverable Strategic Masterplan for the entire 
allocation is to be prepared and agreed between the landowner/developer 
and the Council. 
Where applications have already been submitted to the Council a Strategic 
Masterplan should be agreed prior to the or as part of the grant of planning 
permission. 
Any application on part of the site will be assessed against its contribution 
to the Strategic Masterplan and must not prejudice the implementation of 
the site as a whole. 
Development proposals should provide the following planning and 
masterplanning requirements 
a) A new mixed-use local centre/s to provide for a range of day-to-day 
local needs including additional neighbourhood-level provision of 
around 250m2 (net) convenience retail provision and 850 m 2 of 
comparison retail and food and beverage floorspace and other 
necessary social infrastructure; 
b) Structural planting to create a sense of place, integration into the 
surrounding landscape and to reinforce a long-term, defensible 
Green Belt boundary to the east and mitigate landscape impacts; 
c) Principal access to be taken from Luton Road and integrated into 
Luton’s existing highway network via Crawley Green Road with:  
i. provision for sustainable modes of transport; 
ii. comprehensive integration into the existing pedestrian and 
cycle, public transport and road networks; and 
iii. appropriate transport mitigation measures secured to 
address impacts on Luton; 
d) 4FE of primary-age and 4FE of secondary-age education provision 
to ensure the needs arising from this allocation can be met within the 
site with any secondary education solution designed so as not to 
preclude the potential for future expansion; 
e) Appropriate mechanism(s) to ensure that all the affordable housing 
derived from the 1,950 homes for Luton’s unmet needs address 
affordable housing needs from Luton Borough; 
f) Built development contained within the Breachwood Ridge and 
avoiding adverse impacts on the wider landscape of the Lille y Valley North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
99 
  or the Chilterns AONB as informed by detailed landscape 
assessments;  
g) Integration of existing public rights of way within and adjoining the 
site to provide routes to the wider countryside including: 
i. Footpath Offley 001 as a route from south-east Luton to 
the rural area; and 
ii. Footpaths Offley 039, Offley 002 and Offley 003 as 
potential north-west to south-east green corridors through 
the site;  
h) Address existing surface water flood risk issues, particularly along 
the south-western perimeter of the site, through SUDs or other 
appropriate solution; 
i) Appropriate noise mitigation measures, to potentially include 
insulation and appropriate orientation of living spaces; 
j) Appropriate mitigation, compensation and / or enhancement of key 
features of biodiversity as informed by detailed assessments 
including: 
i. the adjoining local wildlife sites at Stubbocks Wood; and 
ii. priority deciduous woodland habitat at Brickkiln Wood;  
k) Sensitive integration of existing settlements and heritage assets, 
including 
i. minimising the visual impacts of development upon the 
historic parts of Cockernhoe, including relevant listed 
buildings;  
ii. using the location of the Mangrove Green and Cockernhoe 
areas of archaeological significance to inform a site-wide 
green infrastructure strategy; and 
iii. retaining an appropriate setting to the adjoining Putteridge 
Bury; 
l) Undertake Contaminated Land Preliminary Risk Assessment, 
particularly relating to historic landfill; and 
m) Detailed drainage strategy identifying water infrastructure required 
and mechanism(s) for delivery. 
4.250 Three adjoining sites are identified to the East of Luton totalling 2,100 
dwellings. Around 150 homes will meet requirements arising from within North 
Hertfordshire, with the remaining 1,950 homes addressing needs that cannot 
be physically accommodated within Luton. The contribution towards unmet 
needs from Luton will include the provision of both market and affordable 
homes. The District Council will work with Luton Borough Council to secure 
appropriate mechanisms for nomination rights in any legal agreement(s) 
relating to the site(s). North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
100 
  4.251 Our assessment shows that the land broadly bounded by Mangrove Green, 
Brick Kiln Lane and Brickkiln Wood (site EL3 and parts of site EL1) is most 
supportable in terms of impacts upon landscape and Green Belt. Beyond 
these limits, impacts become more pronounced76. 
4.252 However, this needs to be balanced against the acute levels of unmet needs 
arising from Luton and the associated requirements of the NPPF and Duty to 
Co-operate. It is considered that the strategic allocation represents North 
Hertfordshire’s reasonable maximum contribution77. 
4.253 Our assessments show that this level of development can be accommodated 
without a significant adverse impact on the wider highway networks of Luton 
and Hertfordshire78. This will be achieved, in part, by ensuring that education 
needs arising from the allocation will be met within the site itself. In the period 
beyond 2028, it may prove necessary to expand secondary provision to 
ensure wider education needs across the rural west of the District can be met. 
This matter will be kept under review and subject to further investigation and / 
or planning application(s) at the appropriate time. 
4.254 The site will need to integrate provision for walkers, cyclists and public 
transport in line with the aims of the NHDC Transport Strategy and the 
sustainable travel strategy set out in the Luton Local Plan. This will include 
connections to the wider sustainable travel network. 
4.255 The eastern section of site EL1 and all of site EL2 will require sensitive design 
and landscaping (including structural planting) to visually contain development 
from longer views. The revised Green Belt boundaries predominantly follow 
existing, recognisable features such as roads, tree belts and rights of way. 
Where necessary, additional planting should be provided for reinforcement 
and to mitigate against impacts upon the wider landscape. 
4.256 The site is in close proximity to the Luton Airport noise corridors and 
mitigation measures may be required, particularly towards the south-east of 
the site which lies closest to the flight path. 
4.257 The allocation will adjoin existing small settlements including Cockernhoe, 
Mangrove Green and Tea Green as well as the registered park at Putteridge 
Bury. The relationship of these areas to the new development will need to be 
carefully considered, notably for the two greens at Cockernhoe Green and 
Mangrove Green. 
4.258 East of Luton lies within the Thames Water area with wastewater draining to 
their facility at East Hyde south east of Luton. Previous work identifies that 
this treatment works should have sufficient capacity to accommodate this 
 
76 North Herts Site Selection Report (Peter Brett Associates, 2016) 
77 A review conducted by Sir Michael Heseltine suggested that authorities should “leave no stone 
unturned” in seeking solutions to growth. This has been broadly accepted as the benchmark against 
which the Duty to Co-operate is tested, especially where unmet needs exist.

MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
5 Economy & Town Centres 
Policy ETC1: Appropriate uses in Employment Areas 
Within the safeguarded Employment Areas, and the Employment 
Allocations (BA10 and RY9), as shown on the Policies Map, planning 
permission will be granted for office, research and development, industrial 
processes, industrial and storage and distribution uses provided: 
a) For allocated sites any relevant site-specific criteria are met; and 
b) Any Use Class B8 development is easily accessible from the 
primary road network. 
Planning permission for other uses will be granted as an exception to the 
above criteria provided they are: 
i. Ancillary to the above uses; 
ii. Essential to the continued operation of an established premises; 
iii. Would bring comparable benefits to office, research and 
development, industrial processes, industrial and storage and 
distribution uses in the same location; or 
iv. Would make use of a site that would otherwise be likely to 
become or remain vacant for an extended period of time. 
Conditions and legal agreements will be used to limit uses to ensure that 
development meets, and will continue to meet, identified employment 
needs 
5.1 Within the four main towns there are a number of established Employment 
Areas, where the majority of employment premises are located. They include 
certain E class uses (office, research and development, industrial processes), 
B2 (industrial) and B8 (storage and distribution) class uses. They are well-
established areas and are a valuable resource to the District. 
5.2 Over the lifetime of this Plan these will be supplemented by the new 
allocations identified by Policy SP3 which will become Employment Areas 
covered by this policy. Detailed considerations for these sites are set out in 
the Chapter 13 of this Plan which must be taken into account. 
5.3 In order to maintain an adequate level of employment land to meet the needs 
of the local economy, we will protect defined Employment Areas from uses 
which would undermine their purpose or be better located in other areas of 
the District. The Council does not wish to inhibit the ability of existing firms to 
expand. It will be supportive of the redevelopment of sites which would lead to North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
106 
  an improvement in the quality of employment floorspace suited to modern day 
needs. 
5.4 However, the Council recognises that Employment Areas are often sought-
after locations for a number of other uses. It is recognised that there is a need 
for some flexibility to meet the needs of uses, including sui generis uses such 
as motor trade uses and taxi vehicle depots79. These uses tend to cause 
conflict in other parts of the towns, such as town centres or residential areas 
as a result of impacts on residential amenity and living conditions. 
5.5 Motor vehicle premises, in particular, usually include a mixture of sales and 
repairs. The sale of motor vehicles tends to provide lower density of 
employment than normally expected in an employment area. The amount of 
the retail sales element on larger developments will be restricted in order to 
protect the availability of, and maximise the use of, employment land. In 
addition, in order to prevent the change of use of buildings to shops a 
condition will be imposed on any grant of permission removing permitted 
development rights. These considerations apply to the sale of all types of 
vehicles. 
5.6 Development proposals for uses in employment areas that are not for office, 
research and development, industrial processes, industrial and storage and 
distribution uses which seek to make use of the exception criteria of this policy 
will be considered on their merits. When assessing such proposals, the 
Council will have regard to (as applicable in each instance):  
 employment generation on site; 
 impact on relevant town centres, including details of any sequential and / 
or impact testing; 
 where appropriate, the level and type of retail involved on the site; 
 any potential benefits to the community or surrounding businesses from 
the proposed use; 
 the proportion of the site to be used for sales and display as opposed to 
repairs and servicing, in the case of motor trade uses;  
 accessibility by non-car modes of transport; and 
 any evidence clearly demonstrating that: 
o the land or premises is no longer required to meet future 
employment needs of the District;  
o the land or premises is inappropriate or unfeasible for employment 
use, based on market conditions or amenity / living condition 
problems; and  
o no other suitable sites outside designated employment areas are 
viable and available. 
5.7 A number of the District’s Employment Areas are identified through the 
Hertfordshire Waste Local Plan as Employment Land Area of Search (ELAS) 
and parts of them may be acceptable for waste uses. The Hertfordshire 
 
79 ‘Sui generis’ is a term used to mean any use which does not fall within the use classes defined in 
the Use Classes Order. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
107 
  County Council ELAS SPD80 sets out specific considerations for each 
employment area.  
5.8 The Council is required to make provision for sufficient employment land over 
the plan period. To ensure that development meets identified employment 
needs, both now and in the future, conditions and legal agreements will be 
used. 
Policy ETC2: Employment development outside Employment Areas 
and Employment Allocations BA10 and RY9 
Planning permission for employment uses outside of allocated 
Employment Areas and Employment Allocations BA10 and RY9 will be 
granted provided that:  
a) The proposal is: 
i. within a defined settlement boundary or the built core of a 
Category B village; or  
ii. for small scale offices or other small employment 
development; and   
iii. is appropriate to the location in terms of size, scale, function, 
catchment area and / or historic and architectural character; 
and 
b) There would be no significant adverse impacts on living conditions. 
The Council will only permit the loss of existing employment uses on 
unallocated sites, where it can be demonstrated that: 
i. the land or premises is no longer required to meet future 
employment needs of either the local community or the 
District, demonstrated through evidence of at least twelve 
months of active marketing;  
ii. the existing use has a significant adverse impact on the 
amenities of surrounding land uses; or 
iii. the existing use is detrimental to highway safety. 
5.9 There are a number of employment sites across North Hertfordshire that are 
outside the designated Employment Areas and Employment Allocations but 
which provide sources of local employment and services. These are in other 
parts of the main towns including town centres, in larger villages, and 
sometimes within category B and C villages or in the countryside following the 
re-use or redevelopment of agricultural buildings. Some have been there for a 
long time and may not be in the most appropriate location while others exist 
perfectly well adjacent to other uses such as residential and / or in their wider 
setting. Planning Applications seeking non-employment uses on such sites 
will need to be supported with evidence that at least twelve months of active 
 
80 Hertfordshire County Council Employment Land Area of Search SPD (2015) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
108 
  marketing has been undertaken. This will include an assessment of market 
signals, including that the marketing has been conducted appropriately given 
the terms, rental values and / or sales values of the site and similar properties, 
the benefits of the proposed uses and the impact on the community of such a 
loss of employment land.   
5.10 These sites are often small scale, although there are larger office 
developments in and around Hitchin and Letchworth Garden City town 
centres for example. The provision and retention of appropriate dispersed 
employment sites contributes to sustainable development aims by reducing 
the need to travel for local residents, something which is advocated in the 
NPPF. We will have regard to these factors to determine whether the 
proposed use is appropriately located. 
5.11 The Council will permit appropriate proposals for farm and other land-based 
diversification schemes that benefit the rural area. The re-use or 
redevelopment of rural buildings for employment purposes will be subject to 
Policy CGB4. 
Policy ETC3: New retail, leisure and other main town centre 
development 
Planning permission for new retail, leisure and other main town centre 
uses81 will be granted provided that: 
a) The sequential test is passed;  
b) Where the town centre development is outside of the town centre, 
an impact assessment is provided based on the following minimum 
floorspace thresholds demonstrating there is no unacceptable harm 
to the vitality or viability of a designated town centre:  
 Hitchin: 2,500 gross sq.m and above; 
 Letchworth Garden City: 1,000 gross sq.m and above; 
 Baldock, Royston and elsewhere: 500 gross sq.m and above; 
c) Within retail allocation sites, as shown on the Policies Map, any 
relevant site-specific criteria are met;  
d) The proposal is appropriate to the area in terms of use, size, scale, 
function, catchment area, historic and architectural character; and 
e) There would be no significant adverse impact upon living conditions.  
The Council will use planning conditions or legal agreements to limit uses 
to ensure that the identified retail needs are met, and will continue to be 
met, through the allocated sites. 
 
81 Main town centre uses are defined in the Local Plan Glossary   North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
109 
  5.12 Our evidence establishes the need for additional retail, commercial and 
leisure floorspace in the District over the period to 203182. This Plan identifies 
six allocated sites where a substantial proportion of these needs will be met. 
5.13 In assessing proposals for main town centre uses, we will adopt the 
‘sequential approach’ as set out in Government guidance83. Therefore, retail 
uses will be considered in the following order of preference: 
1) within town centres, on allocated sites within town centres, or in local 
centres;  
2) the edge of centres; and 
3) out of centre, only where there are no available, suitable and viable sites 
which are sequentially preferable. 
5.14 Business uses within town centres can add to the vitality and viability of 
centres. Office workers within a town centre will create more custom for shops 
and services. The Council is therefore generally supportive of new office 
development in town centres in accordance with the sequential test. Office 
development will be encouraged above ground floor retail. 
5.15 The District has a number of local scale leisure facilities such as leisure 
centres and swimming pools. The provision of large-scale leisure, 
entertainment and cultural facilities within the District is limited but this reflects 
the size of its catchment and the fact that residents also have good access to 
facilities in neighbouring towns such as Stevenage, Luton and Cambridge. 
North Hertfordshire’s location within the catchment area of these larger 
centres will limit the potential for further commercial leisure and entertainment 
facilities.  
5.16 Nevertheless, the first preference for the location of leisure facilities is within 
the defined town centre boundaries.   
5.17 With regard to retail use, the edge of centre is generally taken to mean up to 
300m from the primary shopping frontage. For other main town centre uses, 
edge of centre means up to 300m from the town centre boundary84. 
5.18 This Plan identifies thresholds for the application of the impact test in North 
Hertfordshire’s towns in line with our evidence85. Applications for main town 
centre uses on sites outside the town centres, not otherwise in accordance 
with the development plan and exceeding the thresholds in Policy ETC3 must 
also be assessed against the impact considerations set out in Government 
guidance before planning permission will be granted.

110 
  5.19 The Council is required to make provision for sufficient retail land over the 
plan period. To ensure that development meets identified retail needs, both 
now and in the future, conditions and legal agreements will be used. 
Policy ETC4: Primary Shopping Frontages 
Town Centre boundaries for Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and Royston 
are shown on the Policies Map. Within the designated Primary Shopping 
Frontages, planning permission will be granted at ground-floor level: 
a) For shops; or 
b) For other main town centre uses86 if it does not, individually or 
cumulatively, undermine the retail function of the centre in the 
daytime or detract from the centre’s vitality and viability.  
  
Policy ETC5: Secondary Shopping Frontages 
In the Secondary Shopping Frontages of Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, 
Baldock and Royston, as shown on the Policies Map, planning permission 
will be granted at ground-floor level:  
a) For shops, financial and professional services, restaurants and 
cafes, pubs or drinking establishments and takeaways; or  
b) For other main town centre uses87 if it does not individually or 
cumulatively, undermine the retail function of the centre or detract 
from the centre’s vitality and viability. 
5.20 We want to ensure that the town centres maintain their primary retail function 
whilst increasing their diversity with a range of complementary uses, 
promoting competitive, flexible town centre environments. The concept of 
shopping as a leisure activity supports the encouragement of uses which 
increases the vitality throughout the day, extending the range of services for 
local people throughout the day and into the evening. The main function of the 
primary shopping area is retail, but town centres in general need a variety of 
other services such as banks, restaurants, pubs and personal services, which 
add interest and vitality and extend the use of the centres into the evening. 
5.21 Too many non-retail uses can create ‘dead frontages’ (units not normally open 
during normal shopping hours or which attract relatively few customers), 
reduce the interest and attraction of the primary shopping area, and harm the 
retail function. This is particularly a problem where there are a number of units 
in a row which are not shops. This is something the Council is keen to 
prevent. 
 
86 Main town centre uses are defined in the Local Plan Glossary 
87 Main town centre uses are defined in the Local Plan Glossary 
 North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
111 
  5.22 We monitor all retail units within the four main town centres on an annual 
basis, as well as those in the local centres. There is evidence in some centres 
that shop units are being lost to non-shop uses in the core shopping areas.  
5.23 Within Primary Frontages we will retain the attractiveness of the essential and 
continuous shopping cores of our town centres; only shops will generally be 
permitted here. 
5.24 For Secondary Frontages, the policy is more flexible, allowing shops, financial 
and professional services, restaurants and cafes, pubs or drinking 
establishments and takeaways, based on their contribution to vitality and 
viability and their ability to attract people to the centre.  
5.25 Evidence in the form of predicted footfall, opening times and linked trips will 
be required for any application seeking to meet part b of policies ETC4 and 
ETC5 to assess the impact upon daytime retail function, vitality and viability. 
Where a shop unit has been vacant for an extended period of time (normally 
at least one year), documentary evidence should demonstrate that all 
reasonable attempts to sell or let the premises for the preferred use(s) as set 
out in part a. of Policies ETC4 and ETC5 have failed. 
Policy ETC6: Local Centres  
Within Local Centres, as shown on the Policies Map or identified in 
approved masterplans for the strategic site allocations, planning 
permission will be granted where: 
a) It is for a shop, financial and professional services, café or 
restaurant, pub or drinking establishment, takeaway or use classes 
F1 or F2 at ground floor level; and 
b) The centre would continue to provide a range of uses including 
shops to meet day-to-day needs and the vitality and viability of the 
centre would be maintained.  
Proposals for over 500 sq.m gross will not generally be suitable in local 
centres.  
5.26 Local centres consist of village centres such as Codicote, Knebworth and 
Ashwell, and neighbourhood centres such as Walsworth (Hitchin), Jackmans 
(Letchworth Garden City) and Great Ashby. These centres vary in size from 
five units up to around twenty-five units. Their composition also varies with 
some being almost all retail units, while others contain a mix of retail, food and 
drink and community facilities.  
5.27 Local Centres are identified as forming part of our retail hierarchy in Policy 
SP4. The general locations of local centres are shown on the Policies Map. 
Detailed maps for each centre showing where the provisions of Policy ETC6 
are applied are contained in Appendix 3. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
112 
  5.28 The village centres of Codicote and Knebworth are large enough to provide a 
focus for the communities local to them and a range of everyday shopping 
facilities and services. This includes: convenience stores, post offices, 
hairdressers, dry cleaners and food and drink establishments. 
5.29 The Council considers that it is important that the neighbourhood centres 
continue to provide a mix of shopping, services and community facilities, and 
in particular retail units. A predominance of shops is considered to be 
necessary to secure the future viability of these centres. However, some non-
retail uses may be appropriate in the centres where local community retail 
needs are already met. 
5.30 In all local centres, the Council wants to retain local facilities and at the same 
time prevent changes to non-retail uses that would be more appropriate in 
larger centres or employment areas. 
5.31 Where a vacant shop premises is subject to a proposed change of use where 
planning permission is required, then documentary evidence will be necessary 
to show that all reasonable attempts to sell or let it for use as a shop for a 
year or more have failed. If there are other vacant units in the centre this will 
also be taken into account.  
Policy ETC7: Local community shops and services in towns and 
villages  
Planning permission for small-scale proposals providing new shops and 
services to serve the day-to-day needs of the local community will be 
granted where: 
 The site is within a defined settlement boundary; 
 In the case of Category B villages, the site is within the built core; or 
 In the case of Category C settlements, the proposed development 
meets the criteria of Policy CGG2b. 
280 sqm will generally be used as a guide to determine small scale. This 
reflects the Use Classes Order 2020 and recognises that some such 
facilities will fall within Class E or other use classes. 
Planning permission for the loss or change of use of any shops, services or 
facilities outside the defined retail hierarchy will be granted where:  
a) There is another shop, service or facility of a similar use available 
for customers within an 800m walking distance; and 
b) The proposed replacement use would complement the function and 
character of the area.  
An exception to criterion (a) above will only be permitted if it can be 
demonstrated that the unit is no longer required to meet the needs of the 
local community, including through evidence of at least twelve months 
active marketing. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
113 
  5.32 Scattered local shops, services and other facilities in towns and rural areas 
provide residents with access to important goods and services. They also 
minimise the need to travel. The less mobile are particularly reliant on these 
facilities which include shops, post offices, pubs and petrol filling stations88. 
5.33 New facilities of an appropriate scale and location within towns, villages and 
smaller settlements will generally be supported, subject to meeting the criteria 
of Policy CGB2b where applicable.  
5.34 However, given the high value of residential land in the rural area, there is 
often pressure from landowners to change the use of, or redevelop, existing 
facilities for residential purposes. This may be the case even where the 
business is thriving, if the return on an existing use is less than can be gained 
from residential development. 
5.35 These facilities should be protected wherever possible and the policy seeks to 
prevent their loss. However, where it can be shown such facilities are no 
longer needed and not viable, then permission may be granted for a change 
of use. Planning Applications seeking a change of use that is not for shops, 
services or similar facilities will need to be supported with evidence that at 
least twelve months of active marketing has been undertaken. This will 
include an assessment of market signals, including that the marketing has 
been conducted appropriately given the terms, rental values and / or sales 
values of the site and similar properties, the benefits of the proposed use(s) 
and the impact on the community of such a loss of shops, services or similar 
facilities.    
5.36 Convenient walking distance, as set out in the policy, will be taken to be up to 
800m for most existing users of the current facility, in line with Government 
guidance89. 
5.37 Some local facilities, such as pubs, can be listed as an Asset of Community 
Value (ACV). This provides additional protections if the owners wish to 
change the use of, demolish and / or sell the facility. The fact that a facility is 
an ACV can be an additional material consideration in the determination of 
any planning applications. The Monitoring and Delivery section of this Plan 
provides additional information on ACVs. 
Policy ETC8: Tourism  
Planning permission for tourism-related development will be granted, 
subject to the sequential approach set out in Policy ETC3 where it: 
a) Increases the attractiveness of the District as a tourist destination; 
 
88 This policy is generally directed at Policies for main town centre uses (as defined in the 2012 
NPPF). Applications for relevant sui generis uses including petrol filling stations will also be 
considered against this policy. Policies for other community uses will be considered against Policy 
HC1. 
89 Manual for Streets  (Department for Transport, 2007). This will be measured as the distance from 
prospective customers’ places of residence to the alternate facility. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
114 
  b) Improves visitor accommodation; or   
c) Delivers sustainable tourist and visitor attractions in appropriate 
locations.  
5.38 Tourism can bring benefits to an area both directly as a source of employment 
and income for the local tourism industry, and indirectly through tourism 
expenditure (e.g. retail, catering, and accommodation).  
5.39 The three historic market towns of Hitchin, Baldock and Royston, along with 
Letchworth Garden City make North Hertfordshire attractive to visitors. Its 
rural area is also a place for people to visit, for tourism as well as leisure. 
5.40 The district of North Hertfordshire is itself not a major tourist destination. 
However, there are a wide range of attractions in the District, particularly 
those based on heritage and the countryside. Some, such as Letchworth, the 
world’s first Garden City, Royston Cave and the British Schools and Museum 
in Hitchin are unique.  Knebworth House and its grounds are a major day 
visitor destination in the region and unique nationally in their capacity for large 
music. The inclusion of a tourism policy reflects this sector’s growing 
significance as a form of economic development, and its potential to diversify 
both urban and rural economies. 
5.41 Tourism fulfils some of the aims of sustainable development because its 
survival depends upon conserving and maintaining the quality of the 
resources upon which it depends. Tourism provides an incentive and income 
to protect the built and natural environment, promoting these features for the 
enjoyment of local people and visitors, and enhancing local diversity and 
cultural traditions. 
5.42 The Council supports proposals for new or extended tourist developments as 
a means to strengthen the local economy and increase visitors to the area in 
line with policies in the NPPF. To encourage sustainable forms of tourism, 
Policy ETC3 prioritises the location of possible developments within town 
centres in line with the sequential approach. Here, passenger transport can 
best be utilised and so limit associated traffic congestion.  
5.43 Hotels and guest houses provide for both business and tourist visitors. 
Additional hotel bed-spaces should be encouraged in sustainable locations. 
The preferred locations for large hotels will be in town centres. Where there 
are no suitable sites, edge of town centre or other locations easily accessible 
by public transport may be considered. 
5.44 However, in controlled circumstances, it may be appropriate to allow 
exceptions to a strictly sequential approach. Small hotels and guest houses 
may be appropriate in residential areas of towns and in villages. 
5.45 Tourism growth trends indicate that the demand for bed and breakfast 
accommodation will increase. It is likely that the regular use of even one or North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
115 
  two rooms of a house for bed and breakfast accommodation will be a material 
change of use requiring planning permission.  
5.46 For rural proposals, the need is to protect the countryside for its own sake, 
with aspects such as nature conservation, archaeology, landscape and 
agricultural land in mind. 
5.47 In the rural area the Council will be supportive of appropriately located 
facilities that support the rural economy and rural businesses and which 
respect the character of the countryside. The Council will weigh the degree to 
which proposals can be accessible by a variety of modes of transport with 
benefits to the rural economy and the potential of widening access to the 
countryside. 
5.48 The Council will consider all tourism-related development proposals that fall to 
be considered under this policy in terms of: 
 the sustainability of the location, scale and extent of the development;  
 the expected level of activity;  
 the number of visitors;  
 the intensity of use; and  
 the impact on the highway network.

  6 Countryside and Green Belt 
Policy CGB1: Rural Areas beyond the Green Belt. 
In the Rural Areas beyond the Green Belt, as shown on the Policies Map, 
planning permission will be granted provided that the development: 
a) Is infilling development which does not extend the built core of a 
Category B village;  
b) Meets a proven local need for community facilities, services or 
affordable housing in an appropriate location; 
c) Is strictly necessary for the needs of agriculture or forestry;  
d) Relates to an existing rural building;  
e) Is a modest proposal for rural economic development or 
diversification; or 
f) Would provide land or facilities for outdoor sport, outdoor recreation 
and cemeteries that respect the generally open nature of the rural 
area. 
6.1 The Rural Area beyond the Green Belt covers the countryside to the east and 
north of the District that lies outside of the towns and larger villages identified 
in Policy SP2. These areas do not meet the necessary criteria to be 
designated as Green Belt, but it is still necessary to impose restraints on 
development to prevent inappropriate schemes90. 
6.2 Policy CGB1 sets out the broad typologies of development considered 
acceptable within the Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt. Where schemes fall 
within one or more of the categories above, they will be judged against other 
relevant policies of the Plan. 
6.3 Policy SP5 explains that proposals within the Green Belt will be judged 
against the policies of the NPPF to determine whether they are acceptable in 
principle. 
Policy CGB2a: Exception sites for affordable housing in the Green 
Belt 
Planning permission for limited affordable housing in the Green Belt  
 Adjoining Category A villages; or 
 Beyond the built core of Category B villages;  
 
90 The Council’s definition of “Rural Areas beyond the Green Belt” is not intended to replicate the 
NPPF definition of “rural areas” which also includes development within villages, as covered by other 
policies of this Plan.  
 North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
117 
  will be granted provided that the land is identified for such development in 
a Neighbourhood Plan or: 
a) It meets a proven local need as identified through a parish survey or 
other relevant study;  
b) There are no reasonable alternate, suitable and available sites: 
i. within the defined boundaries of the relevant Category A 
settlement or the built core of the relevant Category B village; 
or 
ii. otherwise within a reasonable travelling distance (by various 
modes) of the location where the need has been identified; 
c) The proposal would meet relevant criteria of Policy HS2, particularly 
in relation to need, affordability and retention of dwellings;  
d) The proposed development would not have a substantial adverse 
impact on the openness or general policy aims of the Green Belt; 
and  
e) The public benefit of the proposal outweighs any harm that might 
arise against these aims. 
Development permitted in Category C settlements within the Green Belt 
under Policy SP2 will also need to meet criteria (a) to (e) above. 
 
Policy CGB2b: Community facilities, services and affordable housing 
in the Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt 
Planning permission for community facilities, services or affordable 
housing in the Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt 
 Adjoining Category A villages; or 
 Beyond the built core of Category B villages 
will be granted provided that the land identified for such development in a 
Neighbourhood Plan or: 
a) It meets a proven local need as identified through a parish survey or 
other relevant study;  
b) There are no reasonable alternate, suitable and available sites:  
i. within the defined boundaries of the relevant Category A 
settlement or the built core of the relevant Category B village; 
or  
ii. otherwise within a reasonable travelling distance (by various 
modes) of the location where the need has been identified; 
c) Any affordable housing would meet relevant criteria of Policy HS2, 
particularly in relation to need, affordability and retention of 
dwellings;  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
118 
  d) The proposed development would not have a substantial adverse 
impact on the openness or general policy aims of the Rural Area 
beyond the Green Belt; and  
e) The public benefit of the proposal outweighs any harm that might 
arise against these aims. 
Development permitted in Category C settlements in the Rural Area 
Beyond the Green Belt under Policy SP2 will also need to meet criteria (a) 
to (e) above 
The provision of limited market housing to cross-subsidise schemes under 
this policy will be granted planning permission in exceptional 
circumstances where it can be demonstrated that the level of market 
housing proposed is strictly necessary to make the required development 
deliverable and would accord with criteria (d) and (e) of this policy.  
6.4 The cost of housing in the District's villages is often higher than in the towns. 
As such, whilst there are problems of affordability across the District, they are 
most acute in the rural area.  
6.5 This Plan proactively identifies a range of development allocations across the 
District. These will all be expected to contribute towards affordable housing 
provision and, where justified, new infrastructure resulting in a significant 
boost in new homes and facilities for local needs. 
6.6 However, on occasion a small-scale need may still be identified for affordable 
housing or other types of community facilities to meet rural needs which 
cannot be met within the adjusted settlement boundaries of the main towns 
and villages. This policy continues North Hertfordshire’s historic approach of 
allowing specified development on exception sites.  
6.7 This exception sites policy does not override other relevant policies, such as 
those relating to biodiversity and landscape. Where a need is identified, it will 
be necessary to identify an appropriate site for the development. 
6.8 Any applications under this policy should be supported by specific evidence of 
need commissioned, or otherwise endorsed by, the relevant Parish Council. 
6.9 A number of the settlements identified in Policy SP2 are located relatively 
closely to one another and it may be possible to meet any such needs more 
sustainably in nearby settlements. In justifying the exception site, applicants 
should have regard to actual and potential sites both within the parish where 
development is proposed and in other, nearby locations. In assessing 
compliance with criterion b of the policies, the Council will have regard to 
potential alternate sites within both a 15 minute drive time and a 30 minute 
journey time using passenger transport where the locations are connected by 
a route providing at least five services per weekday. 
6.10 Even where affordable housing is delivered under exception policies, 
residents may still require a significant income. In some instances, this has North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
119 
  led to providers requesting a relaxation of the local occupancy restrictions that 
are normally placed upon exception sites. This means that the eventual 
occupants of new homes are not necessarily those for whom the scheme was 
originally envisaged. In compiling evidence of need, applicants should give 
consideration to these issues ( see Policy HS2 and supporting text). 
6.11 In exceptional cases, it may be necessary to allow some enabling 
development. Where market housing is proposed, it must be justified by the 
submission of viability evidence which will be independently tested at the cost 
of the applicant. 
6.12 In all cases, there will remain a general presumption against development 
which would have a significant adverse impact on the general aims of 
countryside and Green Belt policies. 
6.13 Over the lifetime of this Plan, parish councils (or other relevant bodies) may 
be able to make use of new powers that will enable them to deliver the types 
of scheme envisaged by this policy directly, and without the need for planning 
permission91. However, in many instances, it may remain preferable to meet 
such needs through a planning application.  
Policy CGB3: Rural workers’ dwellings 
Planning permission for isolated new homes in the countryside to support 
agricultural, forestry and other rural businesses will be granted provided 
that: 
a) There is a clearly established existing functional need; 
b) The unit and the rural business concerned have been established 
for at least three years, have been profitable for at least one of 
them, are currently financially sound, and should remain so;   
c) The functional need could not be fulfilled by another existing 
dwelling on the unit, or any other existing accommodation in the 
area which is suitable and available for occupation by the workers 
concerned; and 
d) The proposal responds appropriately to the site’s local context and 
the needs of the business in terms of design, scale and function. 
Where accommodation is proposed in association with a new business, 
applicants will need to demonstrate the business is viable with secure 
future prospects as an exception to criterion (b). 
If a new home is deemed essential to support a rural business, it should 
first be permitted through a time-limited permission, or temporary 
accommodation such as a caravan. Permission for permanent dwellings 
will normally only follow in the event of a persistent need.  
 
91 The Localism Act (2011) includes powers such as Neighbourhood Development Orders and 
Community Right to Build. These can require examinations and / or referenda in order to be 
established.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
120 
  Any temporary or permanent home will be restricted to the occupancy of a 
worker associated with the business. Planning permission for the removal 
of agricultural occupancy conditions will only be granted where: 
i. The circumstances which led to the imposition of the relevant 
condition(s) have significantly changed;  
ii. The building is demonstrably not required or suitable for an 
agricultural or rural business use; and  
iii. It is clearly evidenced that there is no further need in the locality for 
an agricultural worker’s dwelling. 
Where proposals are for development that would be inappropriate in the 
Green Belt, this policy will be used to help consider and assess any case 
of very special circumstances. 
6.14 The significant majority of land in North Hertfordshire remains rural and in 
productive agricultural use. Agriculture and other rural businesses underpin 
both the rural economy and the landscape character of the rural areas. 
6.15 In some limited cases there may be a need for workers to live in close 
proximity to a specific rural location or use92.  A functional need test will be 
applied to establish whether it is necessary for one or more workers to be 
available at all times in order to sustain the business. This will need to be 
demonstrated over a period of time.  
6.16 We will consider the history of the business and land holding to establish the 
recent pattern of use of the land and buildings. This will include consideration, 
for example, of whether any existing homes, or buildings suitable for 
conversion, have recently been sold separately from the land holding 
concerned. Such a sale could constitute evidence of a lack of need. 
6.17 Agricultural occupancy conditions are normally imposed to recognise that 
permission would not otherwise have been granted. Removing these 
conditions can undermine policies which otherwise seek to restrict the building 
of new homes in the countryside. 
6.18 Any such applications will be closely scrutinised. In particular, where criterion 
(ii) is met, the Council may subsequently resist future applications for further 
agricultural or rural business premises on the same site. 
Policy CGB4: Existing buildings in the Rural Area Beyond the Green 
Belt 
a) Planning permission for the re-use, replacement or extension of 
buildings in the Rural Area beyond the Green Belt will be granted 
provided that: 
 
92 Paragraph 55 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
121 
  b) Any existing building to be converted for re-use does not require 
major extension or reconstruction; 
c) The resultant building(s) do not have a materially greater impact on 
the openness, purposes or general policy aims of the Rural Area 
beyond the Green Belt than the original building(s); and 
d) Any outbuilding(s) are sited as close as possible to the main 
building(s) and visually subordinate to them. 
6.19 North Hertfordshire has a large number of rural buildings. The traditional 
houses in the rural area tend to be small cottages which would have been 
occupied by agricultural labourers. Many of the other rural buildings are barns 
and agricultural buildings. Such buildings define the character of parts of the 
District.  
6.20 However, there are pressures for change to rural buildings which need to be 
managed. Smaller houses might be attractive in their own right, but often 
come under pressure for large extensions or complete rebuilding to a larger 
scale. Likewise, non-residential rural buildings sometimes become obsolete 
for their original purpose and come under pressure for re-use or replacement. 
6.21 National policy provides clear guidance on proposals for the re-use, 
replacement or extension of buildings in the Green Belt which will be used, 
alongside the detailed design policies of this plan for relevant applications. 
6.22 We consider that a broadly consistent approach is also justified in the Rural 
Area Beyond the Green Belt to ensure that similar proposals do not cause 
harm. Such harm may come from a variety of sources. The extension, 
alteration or replacement of buildings can change their character negatively, 
for example where a modest cottage, over time, becomes a mansion.  
6.23 National guidance seeks to support economic growth in rural areas and also 
avoid the provision of new, isolated homes in the countryside93. Policy CGB4 
should be read alongside that advice and viewed in light of the Council’s 
consequential preference that rural buildings be re-used for economic 
development purposes where possible and consistent with the other policies 
of this Plan. 
6.24 In some instances, buildings affected by this policy may additionally be listed 
or subject to other heritage designations and other relevant policies and 
guidance will need to be taken into account. All proposals will be considered 
against the general design policies of this Plan. 
Policy CGB5: Urban Open Land 
In areas of Urban Open Land, as shown on the Policies Map, 
planning permission will be granted provided that the development: 
 
93 Paragraphs 28 and 55 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
122 
  a) Would provide land or limited ancillary built facilities for:  
i. outdoor sport, outdoor recreation or cemeteries; 
ii. rural land uses or buildings appropriate in an urban 
fringe location; or 
iii. landscaping, essential transport infrastructure or other 
earthworks associated with the development of 
adjoining allocated sites; 
b) Is low intensity in nature; and 
c) Would maintain openness and respect the transition from the 
urban area to the rural area beyond. 
6.25 Green Belt and the Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt provide strong policy 
protections for the countryside of North Hertfordshire. However, it is important 
that these designations are, wherever possible, defined using clearly 
recognisable features. 
6.26 To the south-east of Baldock, north-east of Royston and south of Little 
Wymondley, dual carriageway bypasses provide clear, defensible boundaries 
which can be used to help establish the limits of Green Belt and Rural Area 
designations. 
6.27 Leaving all unallocated areas within these boundaries as undesignated ‘white 
land’ would mean some land parcels on the urban fringe would not benefit 
from any specific policy protections. They could be subject to speculative 
applications which would be detrimental to local character, or would not 
provide an appropriate transition from the urban to the rural. 
6.28 However, it is also recognised that, in appropriate circumstances, this land 
could provide opportunities for the location of access roads or other transport 
infrastructure, general landscaping, school playing fields, sports pitches or 
other low-intensity uses associated with nearby development and / or the 
adjoining settlements. Where such uses are sought within Urban Open Land, 
all reasonable attempts should be made to maintain openness and careful 
consideration should be given to the scale of any ancillary buildings and 
treatments such as boundary fencing or bunding. 
6.29 Intensive agricultural uses and larger rural buildings, such as new barns and 
storage facilities, will not be considered appropriate on Urban Open Land. 
However, it may be possible to accommodate some less-intensive rural land 
uses and facilities, such as paddocks or small holdings without prejudicing the 
overall aims of this policy. 
6.30 In considering the intensity of any proposed uses of Urban Open Land, 
consideration will be given to the nature and scale of any associated 
secondary effects, such as vehicular movements, as well as the development 
itself. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031

  7 Transport 
Policy T1: Assessment of transport matters 
Planning permission will be granted provided that: 
a) Development would not lead to highway safety problems or cause 
unacceptable impacts upon the highway network; 
b) Mechanisms to secure any necessary sustainable transport 
measures and / or improvements to the existing highway network 
are secured in accordance with Policy SP7; 
c) Suitable Transport Statements, Transport Assessments and / or 
Travel Plans along with supporting documents are provided where 
required; and 
d) For major developments, applicants demonstrate (as far as is 
practicable) how: 
i. the proposed scheme would be served by public 
transport;  
ii. safe, direct and convenient routes for pedestrians and 
cyclists will be provided; and  
iii. comprehensive integration into the existing pedestrian and 
cycle, public transport and road networks will be secured. 
7.1 Every year, developers add around 20km of new highway to the 
Hertfordshire’s road network. It is important to ensure quality and consistency 
in these works. 
7.2 In assessing development proposals, we will generally be guided by the 
advice and responses of Hertfordshire County Council as the local highway 
authority who assess the impacts of development proposals on behalf of the 
Council as a Statutory Consultee to the planning process. The County Council 
support the use of Transport Statements, Assessments and supporting 
documents in order to do this. These reports also guide requirements within 
the development site. 
7.3 Guidance published by the County Council sets out the thresholds at which 
these are required94. The current thresholds are set out below, though it 
should be noted that: 
 site-specific circumstances may result in statements or assessments being 
requested for development below these thresholds; while 
 guidance may be updated over the lifetime of this Plan. 
 
94 Roads in Hertfordshire – A Guide for New Development (HCC, 2011) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
125 
  7.4 The most up-to-date requirements, including highway design standards, 
should be referred to as proposals are developed. We will also have regard to 
relevant national guidance in our decision-making95. 
Table 1: Thresholds for Transport Statements and Transport Assessments 
 Transport Statement Transport 
Assessment 
Residential  >50 homes >80 homes 
Business  >1,500m2 Gross Floor 
Area (GFA) >2,500m2 GFA 
Industrial  >2,500m2 GFA >4,000m2 GFA 
Warehousing  >3,000m2 GFA >5,000m2 GFA 
Non-food retail >800m2 GFA >1,500m2 GFA 
7.5 Travel Plans should be provided for all developments which exceed the 
Transport Assessment Threshold. Travel Plans should set out measures that 
will be adopted by developers that encourage the use of sustainable modes 
for journeys and reduce single occupancy vehicular travel. We and / or the 
County Council may require other supporting documents to assess the 
development, particularly to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place to 
facilitate delivery, servicing and / or waste collection. 
7.6 Transport models have been developed to support, and assess the proposals 
contained in, this Plan. Using these, we have identified a number of mitigation 
measures that would be needed to support the plan’s implementation96. 
Developers should make use of these models and their results when 
preparing their proposals to ensure assessments are carried out consistently. 
Developers need to detail the design of schemes and test appropriate 
mitigation measures. 
7.7 However, it is also recognised that the modelling carried out to support the 
Local Plan is more strategic in its nature and developers will be required to 
supplement these findings with additional local intelligence and modelling to 
ensure the impacts of their schemes on individual settlements, localities and / 
or junctions are fully understood and, where necessary, mitigated. 
Contributions will be sought towards the implementation of relevant schemes 
in the vicinity of the development site under the requirements of Policy SP7. 
7.8 It is important to ensure that new developments offer appropriate and 
practicable sustainable transport alternatives. All major developments should 
 
95 Including advice in Paragraph 32 of the 2012 NPPF and Planning Practice Guidance. 
96 Preferred Local Plan Model Testing (AECOM, 2016); Infrastructure Delivery Plan (RS 
Regeneration, 2016) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
126 
  set out how public transport, walking and cycling will be addressed. In doing 
so, it is recognised that it may not always be appropriate to incorporate clearly 
defined provision for all modes, and solutions will vary from urban to more 
rural areas97. 
7.9 Notwithstanding this, development proposals should provide safe pedestrian 
access in all instances. On larger developments, demarcated cycle routes 
should additionally be provided along principal arterial roads. These should 
connect to lower order streets where safe on-street cycling can be 
encouraged or where shared spaces might be an appropriate response. 
Policy T2: Parking 
Planning permission will be granted provided that: 
a) Parking for residential development is provided in accordance with 
the minimum standards set out in Appendix 4 of this Plan;  
b) Parking for non-residential development is provided having regard to 
the standards for non-residential development set out in the relevant 
Supplementary Planning Document; 
c) Proposals have regard to relevant Supplementary Planning 
Documents, strategies or advice and; 
d) Applicants clearly identify how they provide for all likely types of 
parking demand and demonstrate that parking will be safe and of a 
design and layout that will function satisfactorily. 
Variations from these standards will only be considered where applicants 
can demonstrate that the accessibility, type, scale, mix and use of the 
development; the availability of and opportunities for public transport; local 
car ownership levels; and on-street conditions justify such variations. 
7.10 Most development proposals generate demand for parking relating to different 
users be it for visitors, residents, employees or solely for operational 
purposes.  
7.11 Parking is one tool that can be used to influence travel demand and mode of 
travel. Previous policies to influence car ownership based on maximum 
standards of parking provision at trip origin (residential parking) are 
acknowledged to be flawed. Experience in North Hertfordshire shows that 
insufficient parking provision in residential environments can have an adverse 
impact. Limiting parking availability at trip origins does not necessarily reduce 
car ownership and can displace vehicles onto the adjacent local highway 
network, diminishing the streetscape, causing increased levels of congestion, 
and potentially obstructing emergency vehicles.  
7.12 It is now recognised and accepted that, in most locations, demand 
management through parking is most appropriate at the trip destination (for 
 
97 Paragraph 29 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
127 
  example commercial, leisure and retail parking). The need for greater parking 
control has developed in line with the growth of motorised traffic, particularly 
in the rise in ownership and use of private cars. The emphasis of sustainable 
transport is now placed on locating residential development where car use is 
less likely / and or necessary for many trips. 
7.13 The main priority of this policy is, therefore, to seek to influence car use, 
through application and assessment of parking standards, promoting use of 
alternative modes of transport and travel planning, as opposed to restricting 
car ownership. Many residents may have cars, which influence car ownership 
levels, but choose to travel sustainably for school or commuting purposes.  
7.14 Car parking can also impact on the design quality and flood risk of 
development and as such, consideration should be given to this in 
accordance with Policy D1: Design and Sustainability. 
7.15 Parking standards for residential car and cycle parking are set out in Appendix 
4 of this Plan. Parking provision in accordance with these standards will 
generally meet the day to day needs of the occupiers but without over 
provision. Relevant applications will be required to meet these standards. 
Recommended standards for other uses, and other types of parking, are set 
out in supplementary guidance98. This document also provides general 
guidance on issues such as design and layout. 
7.16 Applications should have regard to this advice and other relevant plans and 
strategies including those produced by Hertfordshire County Council as the 
local highway authority and show how they have been taken into account in 
developing proposals. Advice will be regularly reviewed over the plan period 
to take account of changes in car ownership and travel patterns and mode 
share, national policy guidance and any other relevant matters. 
7.17 The policy also introduces some flexibility in the application of the standards. 
Where development proposals seek to reduce the standard, applicants will be 
required to demonstrate justification for such variation based on the principles 
of the NPPF (paragraph 39 of the 2012 version) and taking into consideration 
impact on on-street conditions such as highway safety, available on-street 
capacity as well as likely pedestrian and environmental impacts.

  8 Housing strategy 
Policy HS1: Local Housing Allocations 
Local Housing Allocations are listed by parish and settlement in Chapter 13 
and shown on the Policies Map. Planning permission for residential 
development and associated infrastructure on these sites will be granted 
provided that: 
a) Development broadly accords with the indicative number of homes 
shown; 
b) Proposals successfully address site specific policy considerations; 
and 
c) Unless site-specific policy considerations state otherwise, a variety 
of homes are provided in accordance with the general policy 
requirements of this Plan. 
Planning permission for other uses will be refused. 
8.1 This Plan establishes targets to provide 13,550 homes in North Hertfordshire 
over the period 2011-2031. Approximately 75% of this number is accounted 
for by the general allowances and Strategic Housing Sites set out in Chapter 
3 (see Policies SP8 and SP14 to SP19). 
8.2 The remainder will be delivered through Local Housing Allocations within and 
adjoining the District’s towns and villages. These are individually set out in the 
policies in the Communities chapter of this Plan. 
8.3 An indicative number of homes is shown for each site based on our 
evidence99. We will take a design-led approach to each site as schemes are 
brought forward. This may result in housing numbers changing in response to 
the pre-application and planning application process and our policy approach 
allows for development to fall within a reasonable range of our initial 
expectations. 
8.4 Chapter 13 also sets out detailed considerations for each site that must be 
taken into account. This includes specific requirements, such as the provision 
of space for school expansions, or mitigations. Beyond these, all 
developments will have to comply with any other relevant policies in this Plan. 
8.5 Where local communities prepare neighbourhood plans, these allocations 
may be subject to additional requirements or change. Prospective applicants 
should be mindful of emerging and adopted neighbourhood plans in the parish 
or settlement where the site is located.

Background Paper (NHDC, 2016) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
129 
   Policy HS2: Affordable housing 
Planning permission for new homes will be granted provided that: 
a) Affordable housing is  
i. provided in accordance with the following targets subject to 
viability: 
  Size of site (gross  
  dwellings)  Target percentage of dwellings 
 to be affordable 
  11 – 14 dwellings  25% 
  15 – 24 dwellings  35% 
  25 or more dwellings  40% 
ii. delivered on-site unless robustly justified; and 
iii. genuinely affordable to local people where rents or prices 
are linked to open-market values 
b) The size, type and tenure of any affordable housing meets: 
i. the Council’s expectation that 65% of the affordable housing 
required by criterion (a)(i) will be rented and 35% other forms 
of affordable housing; 
ii. the housing needs of the area including needs identified by 
relevant local authority housing register data, Neighbourhood 
Plans and any settlement- or parish-level surveys or 
assessments; and 
iii. the requirements of Policy HS3 and will contribute to an 
appropriate mix of housing across the site as a whole; 
c) The affordable housing is secured for first and subsequent occupiers 
through an appropriate condition or legal agreement providing for  
i. the retention of dwellings through the Council, a registered 
provider or similar body agreed with the Council; and 
ii. where appropriate, review mechanisms 
d) Relevant Supplementary Planning Documents, strategies or advice 
have been taken into account. 
Where development of a site is phased or divided into separate parts, or 
could reasonably be considered part of a larger development which would 
exceed the thresholds, it will be considered as a whole for the purposes of 
affordable housing provision. 
8.6 North Hertfordshire is going to be affected by considerable housing growth 
over the plan period. However, if all the new houses were to be sold privately, 
the District’s own housing needs would fail to be met. New-forming 
households on lower incomes would not be able to afford to live locally. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
130 
  8.7 These problems are well recognised across the country as a whole and the 
Government encourages local planning authorities to set out policies on 
affordable housing100, based on assessments of local housing needs. 
8.8 Affordable housing is provided for those who cannot access open market 
housing. It includes social rented and affordable rented housing and 
intermediate housing, such as shared ownership schemes or other models 
where they meet the definition of Affordable Housing set in national policy. 
Affordable Housing is normally delivered in partnership with Registered 
Providers who assume long-term responsibility for the homes and can include 
schemes built through Community Land Trusts or other forms of co-operative 
provision. It is secured with planning conditions and legal agreements to make 
sure that the benefit of the housing continues in the long term. 
8.9 At least one-third of new-forming households in the District over the plan 
period may require assistance with their housing101. Over the plan period, this 
target should be achievable. On most sites, targets to provide up to 40% 
affordable housing can be supported102. Policy SP7 sets out our approach 
where developers consider that the policy requirements of our plan will 
adversely affect viability. We will robustly examine any schemes which seek 
to make affordable housing provision at below target levels. 
8.10 In circumstances where below target levels of affordable housing are agreed 
but the Council considers that viability may improve over the lifetime of the 
proposed scheme, review mechanisms will be built into any relevant 
agreements. This is more likely to occur in developments with long build-out 
times, where there is presently a limited comparable market with which to 
compare viability factors or where approvals are granted at a time of adverse 
economic conditions. 
8.11 Our general expectation is that any affordable housing provision required and 
secured under this policy will be made on site. Although sites of between 10 
and 14 units will deliver relatively low numbers of affordable homes, 
Registered Providers operating in the District are normally willing to take on 
these small groups of new homes. The onus will be firmly upon the applicant 
to robustly justify off-site provision or contributions in lieu. On Strategic 
Housing Sites, or other large schemes, a phased approach to affordable 
housing delivery will normally only be agreed where this is critical to ensuring 
viability and / or the provision of supporting infrastructure. The justification for 
any of these approaches will need to demonstrate how the scheme would 
contribute to the objective of delivering mixed and balanced communities. 
8.12 Our normal approach will be to request 65% rented tenures and 35% other 
tenures for affordable housing to meet the needs of local people and ensure 
 
100 As defined in Annex 2 of the 2012 NPPF 
101 Stevenage and North Hertfordshire Strategic Housing Market Assessment Update: Volume Two 
(ORS, 2016); Review of the Official Projections for North Hertfordshire (ORS, 2020)

(NHDC, 2016) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
131 
  viability. This may change as the plan period progresses in response to new 
evidence or to reflect site-specific circumstances.  
8.13 The strength of local house prices means that affordable housing products 
which are linked to open-market sales or rental values will remain out of reach 
for many households and this issue will need to be taken into consideration. 
Affordable rent for larger (3+ bed) properties will normally be capped at below 
80% of the local market rent. For shared ownership products, the most 
appropriate initial purchase percentages will be assessed on a case-by-case 
basis based upon local sales values. The Council will also consider the likely 
impacts of any proposed service (or other) charges in determining 
affordability. 
8.14 We will also need to respond to any changes at the national level such as 
funding regimes or proposals for new housing products, such as Starter 
Homes. 
8.15 In all instances, the most appropriate mix of affordable housing will be 
negotiated having regard to relevant information including the results of the 
latest local (parish) or district-wide Housing Needs Surveys, the most recent 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment, the location of the site and nature of 
the proposed scheme as a whole. 
8.16 All affordable housing will be secured through legal agreements. Where 
appropriate, these agreements will include mechanisms to ensure that those 
with local connections are given appropriate priority in the allocation of 
homes. This is particularly relevant for schemes outside of the main towns 
where occupants of affordable housing on both allocated and exception sites 
may need to demonstrate a connection either to the parish in which the 
housing is to be provided, or to another nearby parish where a specific need 
for affordable housing has been identified. A local connection to the District is 
normally required to be eligible for inclusion on the housing waiting list. 
8.17 The Council has prepared supplementary guidance which provides further 
information on the provision of affordable homes in the District103. This will be 
updated and / or replaced over the lifetime of this Plan. Development 
proposals should have regard to this information and any other relevant 
housing strategies. 
8.18 The situation regarding the provision of affordable housing on the edge of 
rural settlements as an exception to normal policies of rural restraint is 
considered in Policy CGB2. 
Policy HS3: Housing mix 
Planning permission for new homes will be granted provided that: 
 
103 Draft Developer Contributions SPD (NHDC, 2022) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
132 
  a) An appropriate range of house types and sizes are provided taking 
into account: 
i. the overall targets of this plan; 
ii. the findings of the most up-to-date evidence including the most 
recent Strategic Housing Market Assessment, the Council’s Self-
Build Register and other relevant evidence of housing need; 
iii. the location and accessibility of the site; and 
iv. recent completions, existing permissions and sites in the five 
year supply; and 
b) The scheme would provide a density, scale and character of 
development appropriate to its location and surroundings. 
8.19 National policy requires local plans to provide for a mix of housing that meets 
the requirements of different groups within the community104. Current 
evidence suggests it is most appropriate to target a broad balance between 
smaller (defined as 2-bed or less) and larger (3-bed or more) homes over the 
plan period. 
8.20 The majority of completions since 2011 have been for smaller units whilst 
some of the sites identified through this Plan are specifically anticipated to 
focus upon small homes and / or flats. These are identified in the relevant 
site-specific considerations in Chapter 13. 
8.21 On most suburban and edge-of-settlement sites, applicants should therefore 
make an initial assumption of 60% larger (3+ bed) and 40% smaller (1 or 2 
bed) homes to ensure an overall mix is achieved. The most appropriate 
solution will be considered on a site-by-site basis having regard to this, up-to-
date evidence of housing need, the criteria set out above and the outcomes 
from applying Policy HS2. 
8.22 Given the design-led approach to development set out through this Plan, 
district-wide density standards have not been prescribed. Development on the 
periphery of settlements should generally be at a lower density to mark the 
transition to the rural area beyond. In town centres and close to the railway 
stations higher densities will be considered appropriate in principle but will 
require particular care in the design with respect to avoiding the sense of 
overcrowding or congestion. Further advice is set out in the Design policies of 
this Plan. 
Policy HS4: Supported, sheltered and older persons housing 
Planning permission for sheltered and supported housing in uses classes 
C2 and C3 will be granted provided that: 
a) there is good access to local services and facilities; 
 
104 Paragraph 50 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
133 
  b) the site is well served by public transport; 
c) appropriate levels of on-site landscaping, amenity space and car 
parking (for residents, visitors and staff) are provided; and 
d) it would accord with Policy HS3(b). 
Planning permission for residential developments of 100 units or more will 
be granted provided that an element of accommodation within Use Class 
C3 for older persons housing is included under the requirements of Policy 
HS3(a) where this would be consistent with criteria (a) to (d) above.  
8.23 Over the plan period, there will be a substantial increase in the number of and 
proportion of older residents in North Hertfordshire. The number of people 
aged 70 or over is predicted to increase by more than 10,000. By 2031, they 
will account for 1 in every 6 of the population, compared to 1 in 8 now105. 
8.24 This reflects national trends. The ‘baby boom’ generation born in the period 
after World War II are now reaching, and surpassing, retirement age. 
8.25 Older people are living longer, healthier lives and that the forms of specialist 
housing offered today might not offer the best solutions in future years. 
Government policy seeks to support people living at home for as long as 
possible106. As a result, the types of home that will be needed by our older 
residents will vary. Many will continue to live in their own homes with a 
minimum of support. Others may seek to downsize. However, some people 
will require more specialist accommodation or assistance.  
8.26 Other groups will also have support needs, including people of all ages with 
physical or learning disabilities. 
8.27 A number of models exist to meet the housing needs that this creates. 
 Homes with extra care, sheltered housing and assisted living normally 
consist of self-contained accommodation in a purpose-built block or small 
group of homes. Care is provided for those who would like the comfort of 
knowing assistance is available, or cannot live completely on their own, 
but do not need significant levels of personal care; while 
 Care or nursing homes provide a degree of personal care and / or long-
term assistance for those who cannot live independently. 
8.28 Accommodation that is self-contained with only modest levels of care will 
normally fall within use class C3. For the purposes of planning, this will 
contribute towards the overall targets for new homes identified in Policy SP8. 
Accommodation with greater levels of care, support and / or communal 
facilities will tend to fall within use class C2. However, the distinction between 
these uses can be fine. 
 
105 Stevenage and North Hertfordshire SHMA update (ORS, 2015) 
106 Stevenage and North Hertfordshire SHMA update (ORS, 2015) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
134 
  8.29 Some future sheltered and supported housing needs will be delivered by the 
market in response to perceived demand. Further accommodation will be 
delivered by registered providers. Individual proposals will be assessed 
having regard to the criteria above. 
8.30 On larger housing sites we will expect a proportion of new homes to 
contribute towards the modelled demand for older persons housing107. This 
should include affordable housing provision where appropriate. The most 
appropriate form(s) of provision will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. On 
some sites, the provision of a modest number of bungalows or smaller 
housing units that meet Accessible and Adaptable standards (see Policy HS5) 
may be the most appropriate approach. On larger sites we may seek a wider 
range of provision including sheltered and / or supported housing across both 
the market and affordable elements of provision. 
8.31 All of our Strategic Housing Sites will be large enough to support the provision 
of local facilities such as shops and bus routes. It should be possible for each 
of the sites identified in Policy SP14 to SP19 to accommodate the 
requirements of this policy. Any additional requirements for these sites in 
relation to C2 provision are set out in the site-specific policies. 
8.32 On other sites, we will take a common-sense approach. Where an application 
is close to essential facilities, and can accommodate supported, sheltered or 
other older persons provision in a coherent way, we will expect it to be 
provided. In some instances, such as sites on the edge of villages with fewer 
facilities, it may not be as practical to insist on these types of homes. 
Policy HS5: Accessible and adaptable housing 
Planning permission for major residential development will be granted 
provided that: 
a) applicants demonstrate that at least 50% of homes can be built to 
the M4(2) Accessible and Adaptable standard; and 
b) on schemes where 10 or more affordable units will be delivered, 
10% of these can additionally be built to the M4(3) wheelchair user 
standard108. 
8.33 The Government’s revised approach to technical standards for new 
development identifies three categories of accessibility: 
 M4(1) – visitable dwellings 
 M4 (2) – accessible and adaptable dwellings; and 
 M4 (3) – wheelchair user dwellings109. 
 
107 The housing types encompassed by this are set out in Figure 38 of the Stevenage & North 
Hertfordshire Strategic Housing Market Assessment Update: Volume 2 (ORS, 2016) 
108 Under the requirements of Policy HS2, this will normally be on schemes of 25 or more homes. 
109 Building Regulations 2010, Approved Document M: Access to and use of buildings, 2015 edition North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
135 
  8.34 Our evidence demonstrates that it is both appropriate and viable to pursue the 
higher M4(2) and M4(3) standards in North Hertfordshire110. Requiring 50% of 
new homes on major residential schemes to meet the intermediate standard 
will make a positive contribution to future needs as the population ages. This 
requirement should be applied across both market and affordable homes.  
8.35 The highest M4(3) standard should only be applied to homes where the 
District Council will be responsible for allocating or nominating a person to live 
in that dwelling111. A modest proportion of affordable homes will be required to 
adhere to this additional standard. 
8.36 Compliance with M4(2) and M4(3) standards will be monitored through the 
Building Regulations regime as new homes are built. Planning permissions 
will be appropriately conditioned to say that this requirement must be met. 
8.37 However, it is also necessary to ensure that schemes can be built out in 
accordance with a granted planning permission. Appropriate information 
should be submitted alongside planning applications. Applicants should 
demonstrate through their drawings and / or Design & Access statements that 
the standards can be accommodated when the scheme is built. 
Policy HS6: Relatives’ and dependents’ accommodation 
Planning permission for relatives’ and dependents’ accommodation formed 
by the adaptation or extension of the main dwelling will be permitted 
provided that:  
a) a genuine need for the accommodation is demonstrated; 
b) the annex is subordinate to the main dwelling and designed in such 
a way that it can be easily (re-)incorporated into the main house if 
use as an annex ceases; 
c) any development would not exceed the size of extensions that 
would otherwise normally be acceptable; and 
d) the occupation of the accommodation is restricted by condition. 
Free standing annexes will be allowed where the above criteria are met 
and it can be demonstrated that adaptation or extension of the main house 
is not possible.  
8.38 In certain instances, it can be desirable for additional residential 
accommodation to be provided alongside an existing dwelling. For example, a 
family with elderly or infirm relatives may wish to provide an annex for them. 
This is to be encouraged, because it can strengthen family ties and, where the

  dependants were previously occupying a family-sized house, can increase the 
amount of available housing for others. 
8.39 Where such accommodation can be provided as a self-contained planning 
unit such as through subdivision of the existing home or the provision of an 
additional dwelling, it will be treated as a windfall and normal policies will 
apply. 
8.40 Where interdependent accommodation is proposed, or where subdivision or 
the creation of an additional dwelling would not otherwise be acceptable, this 
policy will be applied. 
8.41 Case law surrounding the provision of annexes is complex. Anyone 
considering building an annex for relatives or dependents should seek 
professional advice and engage with the Council at an early stage in the 
process.  
Policy HS7: Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople 
The Council will protect existing and allocated lawful pitches for Gypsies 
and Travellers.  
The following site, as shown inset into the Green Belt on the Policies Map, 
is allocated for the provision of permanent Gypsy and Traveller pitches to 
meet the District’s needs up to 2031: 
 Policy CD6 - Land at Woodside Place, Danesbury Park Road is 
allocated for the provision of 4 permanent Gypsy and Traveller 
pitches. 
This site is allocated solely for the accommodation of Gypsy and Travellers 
that meet the planning definition. Planning Permission will only be granted 
for development and occupation that meets the planning definition of 
Gypsy and Travellers. Other uses will not be permitted. 
There is no identified need to allocate any transit or travelling showpeoples’ 
sites.  
a) Planning permission for accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers 
or Travelling Showpeople will be granted where: 
b) it satisfies a demonstrated local need for accommodation; 
c) the intended occupants meet the planning definition of Gypsies and 
Travellers, or Travelling Showpeople, as set out in government 
guidance or case law; 
d) residents of the proposed site can access local services such as 
shops, schools, public transport and medical facilities within a 
reasonable distance from the site and where those facilities have 
capacity to meet the needs of the site’s residents; 
e) the proposed site: North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
137 
  i. does not conflict with any other development plan policy or 
national policy including flood risk, agricultural land 
classification, contamination and hazardous development, 
and has no significant adverse impact on the character and 
appearance of the countryside, or on features of significant 
biodiversity or heritage importance; 
ii. has no significant adverse impact on the amenity of nearby 
residents or adjoining land users and can be successfully 
screened and contained within a specified boundary; 
iii. has adequate and safe access from a suitable road, and 
adequate parking, storage, turning and servicing on site; 
iv. is capable of being serviced with water, electricity, sewerage 
and rubbish disposal; and 
v. will provide a safe, inclusive and secure environment for the 
residents in an appropriate location to meet their needs. 
Where all the above criteria are met, proposals for sites for Gypsies, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople may be appropriate in the 
countryside as rural exception sites (in line with Policy CGB2b) but Green 
Belt policies would still apply. 
8.42    The Local Plan should make appropriate provision to meet the needs of 
Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in North Hertfordshire. The 
Council’s evidence112 shows that there is no identified need for transit or 
travelling show people sites but a need to provide four additional pitches for 
Gypsies at Danesbury Park Road. 
8.43  There is currently one private Traveller site at Pulmer Water in the parish of 
Codicote. This consists of twelve permanent pitches. There is a further site at 
Danesbury Park Road which currently benefits from a temporary planning 
permission and is allocated in this Local Plan to meet the identified need. 
Historically, the District has not been an area where significant numbers of 
Gypsies, Travellers or Travelling Showpeople have resided in or resorted to, 
which is supported by figures for unauthorised encampments and 
developments. 
8.44  As with affordable housing, current government guidance allows Gypsy and 
Traveller sites to be located in the open countryside, as an exception to 
normal policies of control. This is in recognition of the particular difficulties that 
Gypsies and Travellers have obtaining and affording land within settlements.  
8.45 The site at Pulmer Water has a complex planning history and consists of 
Gypsy and Traveller provision adjoining a caravan park with permission for 
residential use. A robust and up-to-date assessment of current occupation 
and the future needs arising from this site, alongside any needs from 
 
112 Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment Study (2018); NHDC Note on Gypsy and 
Traveller provision (2020) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
138 
  elsewhere in the District, will be required to inform the proposed early review 
of the Plan (see Policy IMR2 in the Delivery Chapter).

  9 Design 
 Policy D1: Sustainable design 
Planning permission will be granted provided that development proposals: 
a) Respond positively to the site’s local context; 
b) Take all reasonable opportunities, consistent with the nature and 
scale of the scheme, to: 
i. create or enhance public realm; 
ii. optimise the potential of the site by incorporating Sustainable 
Drainage Systems (SuDS); 
iii. reduce energy consumption and waste; 
iv. retain existing vegetation and propose appropriate new 
planting; 
v. maximise accessibility, legibility and physical and social 
connectivity both internally and with neighbouring areas;  
vi. future proof for changes in technology and lifestyle; 
vii. design-out opportunities for crime and anti-social behaviour; 
and 
viii. minimise the visual impact of street furniture and parking 
provision;  
c) Have regard to the Design SPD, and any other relevant guidance; 
d) Within Letchworth Garden City have regard to the Letchworth 
Garden City Design Principles contained in Appendix 5; and 
 
e) For residential schemes, meet or exceed the nationally described 
space standards and optional water efficiency standards. 
9.1 National guidance states that planning should achieve high quality and 
inclusive design for all development.  Development proposals should consider 
the potential for minimising their impact on the environment both during 
construction and throughout the life of the development whilst creating 
development that responds to and enhances its surroundings. It’s also 
recognised that good quality design is essential for health and well-being. 
9.2 Development must respond positively to the site and the local context taking 
into consideration position, orientation, scale, height, layout, massing, 
detailing and use of materials.  
9.3 A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) should be undertaken to 
assess the significance and effect of development proposals on the landscape 
and peoples views and visual amenity.  Design and Access Statements (DAS) 
are required for most planning applications. A DAS require applicants to North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
140 
  explain and justify the key elements of the proposal and show that the 
physical, economic, policy and social context of the site and its locality have 
been taken into account. 
9.4 Public realm, publicly accessible space, creates the character and sense of 
place for our environment. Enhancing existing public realm or creating new 
using high quality materials, design and workmanship will result in a high 
quality environment that makes a positive contribution to a sense of place and 
healthy communities. Developers are expected to have regard to emerging 
advice and good practice to ensure that development schemes positively 
contribute to the public realm, local street scene and wider landscape through 
high quality design. 
9.5 Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) if incorporated into the layout of the 
development at the early stages can have a positive impact not only on the 
local drainage system but also on the landscape amenity and biodiversity of 
the site.  Trees, shrubs and other soft landscaping provide a number of 
environmental benefits, ranging from climate change mitigation to the 
management of surface water drainage and flood risk.  Further information is 
provided in Natural Environment Policy NE8: Reducing Flood Risk and NE9: 
Sustainable Drainage Systems  
9.6 Using innovative design to reduce energy consumption and waste from the 
construction and use of buildings can optimise the potential of the site and 
have a positive influence on the environment. Development should seek to 
minimise carbon emissions and maximise opportunities for the generation of 
energy from renewable sources, so far as is practicable given other policies in 
this plan and viability considerations. The efficient use of new materials from 
local or sustainable sources, together with the reuse and recycling of 
materials will help to reduce the energy used and the waste created in the 
development. It will also help the development to achieve local character and 
distinctiveness. The policy encourages sustainable design, and the use of 
materials and technologies that will ensure that the energy used in the 
construction and throughout the life of the development will be minimised.  
9.7 Existing vegetation should influence the layout and design of development. A 
vegetation condition survey should be undertaken to ascertain what plants 
within and adjoining the site, which would be affected by development, are 
worthy of retention and what protection measures should be put in place 
during construction. The British Standard BS5837: Trees in relation to design, 
demolition and construction – recommendations sets out guidance on tree 
retention, effect of trees on design considerations and means of protecting 
trees during construction.  
9.8 Development proposals should consider how the scheme will integrate with 
the existing circulation patterns particularly pedestrian, cycle and public 
transport.  Safe and secure pedestrian and cycle routes should be provided 
both within the site and linking into the wider network.  The policy seeks to 
ensure that the design and location of new development makes it accessible 
to all potential users. There is a need to ensure that where appropriate, new North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
141 
  development includes facilities or open space that is conveniently located and 
easy to gain access to by all potential users. 
9.9 The potential for future changes in technology and lifestyles should be 
considered when planning and designing schemes to ensure flexibility in the 
use of buildings throughout their life. 
9.10 Creating safe and attractive places by designing-out opportunities for crime 
and anti-social behaviour through the incorporation of physical and 
management measures will help to minimise the risk of crime. Development 
should be built to the Police preferred minimum security standard of Secured 
By Design SBD Part 2.  The location of parking areas should ensure that they 
create safe and secure places to leave and access vehicles. 
9.11 Street furniture such as signs, lighting columns, bins and seats can create 
clutter and have a negative impact on the visual quality of an area. Similarly, 
parking areas need to be well designed and integrated into the development 
scheme.   Good design can ensure that cars and street furniture are not 
dominant features in new developments.    
9.12 Development proposals should be in line with current regulations and 
guidelines and any future changes in Legislation or to the Building 
Regulations that will affect the sustainability of a building.  North Hertfordshire 
lies in an area of serious water stress.  Both the Environment Agency and 
Anglian Water support the introduction of the optional water efficiency 
standard within the district therefore, the lower figure of 110 litres per person 
per day for water consumption is sought. The introduction of the lower 
standard will have a marginal impact on scheme viability in the area. 
9.13 Building Futures113 is an interactive tool for new development in Hertfordshire. 
Building Futures is mentioned in the Design SPD114 and developers are 
strongly encouraged to look at this suite of documents, which provide practical 
and technical guidance on reducing the environmental impact of development, 
and will be helpful in enabling developments to satisfy this policy.  Information 
on the Hertfordshire Design Review Panel and the way it can advise on 
development proposals is also available. 
9.14 Sport England’s Active Design guidance on how the design and layout of 
residential and other areas plays a vital role in keeping communities healthy 
and active should be considered. 
9.15 Further guidance is set out in the Design SPD which covers key principles for 
all development within the District and specific principles for each of the four 
towns, the villages and the rural area. The Design SPD identifies other 
relevant guidance prepared for North Hertfordshire such as Conservation 
Area Statements, Town Centre Strategies, Urban Design Assessments, 
Landscape Character Assessments, the Green Space Strategy and the Green 
 
113 Building Futures – A Hertfordshire web-based guide to promoting sustainability in development.  
114 Design SPD (NHDC 2011) North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
142 
  Infrastructure Plan. These documents are available to view on the Council’s 
website and are updated on an on-going basis. 
9.16 For development proposals in Letchworth Garden City reference should be 
made to the Letchworth Garden City Design Principles set out in Appendix 5 
of this Plan.   
 Policy D2: House extensions, replacement dwellings and 
outbuildings 
Planning permission for house extensions will be granted where: 
a) The extension is sympathetic to the existing house in height, form, 
proportions, roof type, window details, materials and the orientation 
of the main dwelling; and  
b) The extensions do not dominate adjoining properties and:  
i. it is well related to the floor levels of adjoining properties,  
ii. there is an appropriate distance between the proposed 
extension and the windows of the adjoining properties; and 
iii. spacing between buildings ensures there is no harm to the 
character and appearance of the streetscene. 
Planning permission for replacement dwellings and outbuildings will be 
granted where: 
c) The proposal does not harm the character and appearance of the 
site; and 
d) The location of the proposal does not have an adverse impact on 
the character and appearance of the streetscene or area. 
9.17 There is a need to maintain a high-quality environment in residential areas 
and across the district as a whole whilst allowing flexibility with regard to 
house extensions, replacement dwellings and outbuildings. The policy 
requires that consideration is given to the effect that a proposal may have on 
the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers and the character and 
appearance of the locality in which they are proposed as these are matters 
that can often be overlooked with the desire for increased living space. 
9.18 This policy also serves to protect the character and appearance of those 
remaining modest rural workers dwellings and to ensure that proposals for 
replacement or extension of dwellings in the countryside would not have a 
materially greater impact. Further guidance for proposals in rural areas is set 
out in the Countryside and Green Belt policies. 
Policy D3: Protecting living conditions 
Planning permission will be granted for development proposals which do 
not cause unacceptable harm to living conditions North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
143 
  Where the living conditions of proposed developments would be affected by 
an existing use or the living conditions of an existing development would be 
affected by a proposed use, the Council will consider whether there are 
mitigation measures that can be taken to mitigate the harm to an 
acceptable level. If the Council is not satisfied that mitigation proposals 
would address the identified harm, development proposals will not be 
permitted.  
9.19 All development has the potential to have an adverse impact on its 
neighbours, in a wide variety of ways. Such harm may arise from traffic 
generation, parking, loss of daylight and sunlight, noise, overlooking, pollution 
(including light pollution) and dominance as well as other issues. 
9.20 A significant number of proposed sites for housing in the District are on 
previously developed land within urban areas. Such sites are often close to 
existing residential areas. Care is needed to ensure that the adverse impacts 
of any such development on neighbouring residents is minimised. It is not 
practical to provide absolute protection for existing residents’ current living 
conditions, instead, there is a need to ensure that any impacts a development 
has are identified and appropriate mitigation built into the scheme. 
9.21 In the rural area, farm diversification schemes can help support the District’s 
rural economy. However, some diversification schemes could seriously affect 
the living conditions of the surrounding area, especially if they generate 
significant traffic. 
9.22 There are two ways mitigation may occur. Either the development can 
incorporate measures to reduce the effect it has, or it can fund works off site 
to reduce the impact on those affected by it. This latter course of action may 
be appropriate for development such as the expansion of airfields, where 
there will inevitably be an increase in noise, but it may be possible to provide 
sound protection to those buildings affected by that noise. 
9.23 This policy also covers the situation where there is an existing use which will 
have an adverse impact on a proposed residential development site. The 
proposed development will need to show that satisfactory living conditions will 
be achieved taking into account the nature of the existing development – for 
example, homes proposed in a noisy area. 
9.24 London Luton Airport immediately adjoins the District to the west.  
Development potentially affected by noise from the airport will need to ensure 
that appropriate mitigation measures are incorporated.  Site-specific criteria 
for relevant allocated sites are set out in the Communities section of this plan. 
Policy D4: Air quality 
Planning permission will be granted provided that development 
proposals: North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
144 
  a) Give consideration to the potential or actual impact on local air 
quality, both during the demolition/ construction phase and as a 
result of its final occupation and use; 
b) Propose appropriate levels of mitigation to minimise emissions 
to the atmosphere and their potential effects upon health and 
the local environment; and  
c) Carry out air pollution impact assessments, where required, to 
determine the impact on local air quality of the development.  
Where an air quality impact assessment demonstrates that a 
development is unacceptable from a local air quality perspective the 
development will be refused. 
Where air pollution impact assessments are not required there will still 
be a requirement on developers to provide appropriate levels of 
mitigation to address emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere. 
9.25 This policy supports Policy D3: Protecting living conditions but also 
encourages sustainable development, in particular sustainable transport 
(Policy SP6: Sustainable Transport). The District will be accommodating a 
significant amount of development during the plan period which will 
undoubtedly generate additional road traffic and put added pressure on 
existing road networks. Therefore, because the major source of local air 
pollution in the District originates from road traffic emissions it is important for 
this Plan to deal with the implications for air quality of the anticipated 
development. 
9.26 The outcome of the air pollution impact assessment will be used to determine 
the nature and scale of the steps that should be taken to remove or reduce 
the scale of those concerns. Ideally this will occur at the design, planning 
and/or development stage, but may in certain circumstances rely on post 
development mitigation measures.  
9.27 Two of the main roads that cross the District do so on a north – south axis: the 
A1(M) and A10. Another main road is the A505 that traverses the District on a 
southwest – northeast axis. It is the A505 that is currently directly associated 
with air quality concerns because it passes through the four main population 
centres of the District namely Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, Baldock and 
Royston. Of particular concern is the area in the south of Hitchin. Notably 
Stevenage Road (A602) near the Hitchin Hill roundabout, which has been 
designated an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) and the Payne’s Park 
roundabout at the A602 junction with the A505 which was designated an 
AQMA in 2016.  
9.28 The NPPF115 states that air pollution is a material planning consideration and 
more specifically that planning policies should sustain compliance with and 
contribute towards national objectives for air pollutants and the presence of 
AQMAs and their Action Plans. Furthermore, it states that the effects 
 
115 Paragraph 124 of the 2012 version of the NPPF.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
145 
  (including cumulative effects) of pollution on health should be taken into 
account. Therefore, because each local authority will have its own unique 
causes and contributing factors to elevated levels of air pollution it is vital that 
local development documents include policies to appropriately influence the 
District’s specific development demands.  
9.29 The policy addresses the protection of the health of the residents of proposed 
developments, as well as the protection of the residents of existing properties 
particularly, although not exclusively, those that live in close proximity to the 
District’s roads. In addition to the air quality problems identified in Hitchin that 
are associated with elevated nitrogen dioxide (NO2), levels of NO2 are close 
to exceeding a national air quality objective around the A505 in the Hitchin 
Street / Whitehorse Street area of Baldock. Furthermore, particulate matter air 
pollution is a public health concern, which is reflected by the presence of a 
national air quality objective and a public health outcome indicator. 
9.30 The policy will allow the Council to achieve a consistent and transparent 
approach to the development of land where air quality concerns are relevant. 
It will also help to influence the nature of such developments so as to 
minimise or remove the potential for adverse impacts on air quality. Or where 
appropriate, identify and justify the need for and nature of measures to help to 
mitigate any otherwise unavoidable adverse air quality impacts from permitted 
developments.  
9.31 The following are types of developments for which the Council would expect 
the submission of an air quality impact assessment: 
 Within, or adjacent to an AQMA, applications for: 
o housing; 
o biomass or other forms of combustion boiler; 
o industrial developments; 
o car parks; and  
o any other development likely to significantly increase vehicle 
movements 
 Anywhere else in the District, applications that are considered to be 
‘major’ in scale for example: 
o significantly increase car parking facilities; 
o significantly increase vehicle movements, particularly heavy duty 
vehicles; 
o introduce biomass or other combustion boilers and industrial processes 
of a particular scale;  
 Or that: 
o introduce humans to an area where air pollution is an issue, but where 
humans were previously not present 
9.32 For other types of developments an air quality impact assessment will not be 
required but there will be a requirement for the developer to negotiate and 
agree air quality mitigation measures that are proportionate to the scale of the 
proposed development. This requirement is in place to provide an opportunity 
to address the cumulative impacts of smaller, or less sensitively located, North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
146 
  developments that nonetheless will be making a contribution to the emission 
of air pollutants.  
9.33 A more detailed description of the type of air pollution mitigation required for 
developments and those developments considered to be ‘major’ can be found 
in the NHDC Air Quality Planning Guidance Document116.  
9.34 Methods available to mitigate the impact of developments on air quality may 
fall into a number of categories and will be considered against other relevant 
policies in the Plan: 
 appropriate parking standards 
 accommodating infrastructure to support the use of low emission vehicles 
 appropriate location and design of buildings 
 incentives to support initiatives for public transport, car sharing and using 
alternative modes of travel 
 contributions to improve road and traffic management, infrastructure to 
support alternative modes of travel and air quality monitoring 
9.35 This is not an exhaustive list and more detail will be found in the NHDC 
supplementary Air Quality Planning Guidance Document.

  10 Healthy Communities 
Policy HC1: Community facilities 
Planning permission for new community facilities will be granted provided 
that they are: 
a) Appropriate in scale having regard to their local context; 
b) Accessible by a range of transport modes; and 
c) Would meet an identified need in the local community. 
Proposals for the redevelopment of sporting facilities will be supported 
where the development is for alternative sports and recreational provision, 
the needs for which clearly outweigh the loss of the existing facilities.  
The loss of community facilities will only be permitted where this is justified 
by:  
i. the provision of replacement facilities, either on site as part of the 
development proposal or in an alternative appropriate location;  
ii. showing that there is no local need for the facility or service and that 
any appropriate, alternative community use of the existing premises 
to meet local needs is not required; or 
iii. demonstrating that the facility, or any reasonable replacement, is 
not, and will not be viable on that site.  
10.1 The National Planning Policy Framework recognises that the planning system 
plays a role in facilitating social interaction and creating healthy, inclusive 
communities. Community and recreation facilities, together with green spaces 
play an important role in enabling people not only to participate in physical 
activities but also in cultural pastimes, all of which can help to enhance 
physical, spiritual and mental well being. 
10.2 Community facilities include: town and village halls, community centres, 
sports halls, theatres, museums, libraries, places of worship, doctors and 
dental surgeries and schools.  Development proposals which affect local 
shops and pubs will be considered under Policy ETC7: Scattered local shops 
and services in towns and villages.   
10.3 The Local Plan can help towards meeting the objective of making 
communities healthier through the retention and provision of cultural, leisure 
and community facilities. 
10.4 It is anticipated that many of the new community facilities that will be required 
over the lifetime of this Plan will be provided in association with the strategic 
developments allocated in this Plan. However, there may still be occasions 
where the provision of new, or extension of existing, facilities in other 
locations is required.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
148 
  10.5 It is important that these facilities are situated within local communities so that 
they are accessible, help to reduce the need to travel and provide 
opportunities for people to participate in activities within their own community. 
One way that this can be achieved is through the shared use of facilities such 
as the dual use of school facilities for sport and other community uses in 
appropriate locations. 
10.6 The Council’s Community Halls Strategy and Indoor Sports Facility Strategy 
and Action Plan set out detailed guidelines for the provision of new community 
facilities which developers should take into account in the design of any new 
development117.   
10.7 At the same time, existing facilities, whether publicly or privately owned, can 
be subject to development pressures for alternative uses. It is important that, 
where appropriate, such facilities are retained within the local community.  
10.8 Some local facilities can be listed as an Asset of Community Value (ACV). 
This provides additional protections if the owners wish to change the use of, 
demolish and / or sell the facility. The fact that a facility is an ACV can be an 
additional material consideration in the determination of any planning 
applications. The Monitoring and Delivery section provides additional 
information on ACVs.

  11 Natural Environment 
Policy NE1: Strategic green infrastructure 
Planning permission will be granted provided that development: 
a) Protects, conserves and where possible enhances the strategic 
green infrastructure network; 
b) Avoids the loss, fragmentation, severance or negative impact on 
the function of the strategic green infrastructure network; 
c) Creates new strategic green infrastructure where appropriate and 
is accompanied by a plan for its long-term maintenance and 
management; and 
d) Has suitable mitigation measures or appropriate replacement to 
satisfactorily address adverse impacts on the strategic green 
infrastructure network. 
11.1 Protection of those sites which contribute to the diversity of strategic green 
infrastructure throughout the District from inappropriate development is 
important.  However, in some cases it needs to be acknowledged that 
appropriate mitigation measures would enable development to take place. 
11.2 This policy will also ensure that when new strategic green infrastructure is 
created appropriate management and maintenance regimes are in place to 
provide the framework for its long-term use. 
11.3 North Hertfordshire has significant strategic green infrastructure assets. 
These are identified in the North Hertfordshire District Green Infrastructure 
Plan118 and include: 
 ancient woodlands (e.g. at Newton Wood),  
 biodiversity rich landscapes (e.g. Therfield Heath),  
 other valued landscapes and the Chilterns AONB (see also policies NE2 
and NE3) 
 chalk streams, rivers, and valleys (e.g. Lilley Bottom and the Mimram 
valley).  
 the historic designed landscapes of Letchworth Garden City and the 
literary associations of Forster Country, north of Stevenage, and   
 the rights of way networks, and long distance walking and cycling 
connections, e.g. the Chiltern Way, Hertfordshire way, National Cycle 
Route No.12. 
11.4 The plan also identifies areas of strategic green infrastructure deficiency as 
well as opportunities to create new strategic green infrastructure not yet 
identified. New development should be connected to strategic green 
infrastructure networks which provide high quality, direct linkages across the

  development where possible. Developers should use the guiding principles 
set out in the Green Infrastructure Plan to influence all development proposals 
from an early stage in the design process. 
 Policy NE2: Landscape 
Planning permission will be granted for development proposals that: 
a) Respect the sensitivities of the relevant landscape character area 
and have regard to the guidelines identified for built development 
and landscape management; 
b) Do not cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance 
of the surrounding area or the landscape character area in which 
the site is located, taking account of any suitable mitigation 
measures necessary to achieve this; 
c) Are designed and located to ensure the health and future retention 
of important landscape features; and 
d) Have considered the long-term management and maintenance of 
any existing and proposed landscaping. 
11.5 National policy119 requires the protection and enhancement of valued 
landscapes. The emphasis of the policy is to ensure that the design of a 
development proposal is sensitive to the local context to ensure that the 
scheme makes a positive contribution to the landscape. 
11.6 The policy aims to protect and enhance the quality of the natural environment 
by requiring development proposals to take into account the landscape 
character and environmental features and built form of its surrounding area. 
11.7 The guidelines referred to at criterion ‘a.’ of the policy originate from the North 
Herts Landscape Study120 which provides an assessment of the character of 
the landscape within the District.  There are 37 separate landscape character 
areas covering the District, some lie totally within the District while some 
extend into adjoining districts. The study provides a description of the 
distinctive characteristics of each landscape character area based on factors 
such as the geology, landform, soil types and historical activities for each 
area.  
11.8 The North Herts Landscape Study also identifies the inherent sensitivities of 
each character area in landscape and visual terms together with its capacity 
to accommodate a range of different types of development.  Development 
should respect the sensitivities of each landscape character area and accord 
with the guidelines for managing change identified for each landscape 
character area in relation to built development and landscape management,

  whilst recognising that some impacts on landscape are inevitable if future 
development needs are to be met. 
Policy NE3: The Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
(AONB) 
Planning permission for any proposal within the AONB, or affecting the 
setting of the AONB, will only be granted provided that it: 
a) Is appropriate in scale having regard to national planning policy; 
b) Conserves and where possible enhances the Chilterns AONB’s 
special qualities, distinctive character and biodiversity, tranquillity 
and remoteness in accordance with national planning policy and the 
overall purpose of the AONB designation; 
c) Is appropriate to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing 
of the area or is desirable for its understanding and enjoyment; 
d) Has regard to the statutory Chilterns AONB Management Plan, 
making practical and financial contributions towards management 
plan delivery as appropriate;  
e) Has regard to the Chilterns Building Design Guide and technical 
notes by being of high-quality design which respects the natural 
beauty of the Chilterns, its traditional built character and reinforces 
the sense of place and local character; and 
f) Avoids adverse impacts from individual proposals (including their 
cumulative effects) unless these can be satisfactorily mitigated.    
11.9 Part of the District between Hitchin, Lilley and Hexton (which follows the 
escarpment of the Chiltern Hills) has been recognised as being of national 
importance and forms part of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB).   
11.10 Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) are designated by the 
Government for the purpose of ensuring that the special qualities of the finest 
landscapes in England and Wales are conserved and enhanced. In policy 
terms they have the same planning status as National Parks.121 The Chilterns 
AONB was designated in 1965 and extended in 1990. The Countryside and 
Rights of Way Act 2000 places a statutory duty on local authorities to have 
regard to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of 
AONBs when coming to decisions or carrying out their activities relating to, or 
affecting, land within these areas122.  
11.11 The Chilterns AONB covers 13 local authorities and the Councils work 
together to safeguard the future of this shared nationally protected area 
through the Chilterns Conservation Board. The Board prepares a statutory 
 
121 Paragraph 115 of the 2012 NPPF 
122 Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 Section 185. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
152 
  AONB Management Plan which has been endorsed by the Council as a 
material consideration in planning decisions123. 
11.12 Proposals for development within the AONB will be considered against 
national guidance. Where the proposed use can be considered acceptable in 
principle, we will use the detailed policies of this Plan to determine whether 
permission should be granted. 
11.13 The AONB is a nationally designated landscape and as such permission for 
major developments within its boundaries will be refused unless exceptional 
circumstances prevail as defined by national planning policy124.  National 
guidance explains that whether a proposal constitutes major development is a 
matter for the relevant decision taker, taking into account the proposal in 
question and the local context125.   
11.14 In determining compliance with criterion b, actions to conserve and enhance 
the AONB shall be informed by a landscape assessment, having considered 
any relevant landscape character assessments and landscape and visual 
impact assessments and shall focus upon: 
i. the Chilterns AONB’s special qualities which include the steep chalk 
escarpment with areas of flower-rich downland, broadleaved 
woodlands (especially beech), commons, tranquil valleys, the network 
of ancient routes, villages with their brick and flint houses, chalk 
streams and a rich historic environment of hillforts and chalk figures; 
ii. the scope for enhancing and restoring those parts of the landscape 
which are previously developed, degraded or subject to existing 
intrusive developments, utilities or infrastructure; 
iii. locally distinctive patterns and species composition of natural features 
such as chalk downland, trees, hedgerows, woodland, field boundaries, 
rivers and chalk streams; 
iv. the locally distinctive character of settlements and their landscape 
settings, including the transition between man-made and natural 
landscapes at the edge of settlements; 
v. visually sensitive skylines, geological and topographical features; 
vi. landscapes of cultural, historic and heritage value; 
vii. important views and visual amenity; 
viii. Tranquillity, dark skies and remoteness and the need to avoid intrusion 
from light pollution, noise, and motion; and 
ix. in the case of major development proposals, shall be informed by 
landscape and visual impact assessment, having considered all 
relevant landscape character assessments. 
11.15 Development proposals which lie outside the AONB but within its setting can 
also have impacts on it. The Council’s duty of regard applies to development 
outside but which would affect land in an AONB126.  Although it does not have

  a defined geographical boundary, the setting of the Chilterns AONB is the 
area within which development and land management proposals, by virtue of 
their nature, size, scale, siting, materials or design could be considered to 
have an impact, either positive or negative, on the natural beauty and special 
qualities of the Chilterns AONB. Advice on development in the setting of the 
AONB is contained within guidance produced by the Chilterns Conservation 
Board127. 
Policy NE4: Biodiversity and geological sites 
Planning permission will only be granted for development proposals that 
appropriately protect, enhance and manage biodiversity in accordance 
with the hierarchy and status of designations and features listed in Policy 
SP12. 
All development should deliver measurable net gains for biodiversity and 
geodiversity, contribute to ecological networks and the water environment, 
and/or restore degraded or isolated habitats where possible. 
Applicants should, having regard to the status of any affected site(s) or 
feature(s): 
a) Submit an ecological survey that is commensurate to the scale and 
location of the development and the likely impact on biodiversity, 
the legal protection or other status of the site; 
b) Demonstrate that adverse effects can be avoided and / or 
satisfactorily minimised having regard to the hierarchy of protection 
below: 
i. locating on an alternative site with a less harmful impact; 
ii. providing adequate mitigation measures; or 
iii. as a last resort compensated for. 
The acceptability of approach(es) to avoidance, mitigation and 
compensation will be commensurate with the status of the asset(s) likely 
to be affected by the application; Compensation is unlikely to be an 
appropriate solution for proposals affecting nationally or internationally 
designated sites other than in the most exceptional circumstances. 
c) Include appropriate measures to manage construction impacts by 
demonstrating how existing wildlife habitats supporting protected or 
priority species will be retained, safeguarded and managed during 
construction;  
d) Integrate appropriate buffers of complimentary habitat for 
designated sites and other connective features, wildlife habitats, 
priority habitats and species into the ecological mitigation and 
design. The appropriateness of any buffers will be considered 
having regard to the status of the relevant habitat. 12 metres of 
complimentary habitat should be provided around wildlife sites 
 
127 Chilterns Conservation Board position Statement on Development affecting the setting of the 
Chilterns AONB. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
154 
  (locally designated sites and above), trees and hedgerows. It may 
be necessary to exceed this distance for fragile habitats such as 
ancient woodland or to provide appropriate root protection for 
mature trees; and 
e) Provide a long-term management and monitoring plan including 
mitigation measures as necessary. 
Local Geological Sites are ratified by the Herts & Middlesex Wildlife Trust 
(HMWT) and are afforded the same protection as Local Wildlife Sites. 
11.16 Sites allocated in this Plan that have the potential to impact on designated 
biodiversity sites are required to provide an ecological survey and provide 
mitigation and/or off-setting measures as necessary. Where appropriate the 
Strategic Policies and Communities sections of this Plan provide site-specific 
policies relating to the impact on designated sites, for instance on Therfield 
Heath SSSI or Wain Woods SSSI. 
11.17 Sites can contain important habitats or species even where they are not 
formally designated. These may be identified by the Hertfordshire 
Environmental Records Centre, other relevant sources (such as the 
Government’s ‘MAGIC’ mapping tool) or through the survey process as being 
of ecological interest and should be afforded an appropriate level of 
protection. 
11.18 Ecological surveys will be expected to involve an objective assessment of 
ecological value and identify any priority habitat, protected or priority species 
on site with survey data and site assessment to establish the potential impact. 
Surveys should be consistent with BS42020 Biodiversity- Code of Practice for 
Planning and Development, or as superseded, and use the DEFRA 
Biodiversity Metric128, or as superseded, or any statutorily prescribed 
alternative to assess ecological value and deliver measurable net gain. 
11.19 Development proposals will be expected to maximise opportunities for net 
gains, or contribute to improvements in biodiversity. This methodology will 
ensure that appropriate mitigation or compensation is provided to meet the 
aims of national policy and is commensurate to the scale and location of the 
development and the likely impact on biodiversity, the legal protection or other 
status of the site. 
11.20 Where off-site compensation is delivered as a last resort, the ecological 
networks mapping system developed by the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife 
Trust and Local Nature Partnership should be used. This provides the basis of 
 
128 The DEFRA Biodiversity Metric is a tool used to quantify the value of biodiversity at any site and 
can form an evidence base on required mitigation for a development, the amount of residual 
biodiversity impact, and if necessary, the amount of require offsite compensation.  
The current Biodiversity Metric is available at : 
http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/6049804846366720  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
155 
  targeted habitat creation to maximise the benefits to biodiversity of any 
required ecological measures. 
11.21 Certain habitats (such as chalk grassland) are priority habitats for the District. 
Restoration, mitigation and any compensation measures should focus on 
these priority habitats as described in the Hertfordshire Biodiversity Action 
Plan129. 
11.22 Developments are required to demonstrate how existing wildlife habitats such 
as trees, hedgerows, woodlands and rivers (and any connective features 
between them) will be retained, safeguarded and managed during and after 
development, including the provision of buffers where required.  
11.23 Where necessary, a management plan outlining mitigation and monitoring 
measures may be required to sensitively manage any issues arising as a 
result of the development on biodiversity or geodiversity assets and will be 
secured through planning conditions or obligations. 
11.24 Net gains can be delivered through the provision of soft landscaping, including 
trees, shrubs and other vegetation to support wildlife habitats as identified by 
the Hertfordshire Biodiversity Action Plan130. Similarly, the provision of 
permanent integrated features for wildlife can contribute to net gains, for 
instance the provision of bat and swift boxes, particularly where development 
borders open space. 
Policy NE5: Protecting open space 
Planning permission will only be granted for any proposed loss of open 
space provided that: 
a) It can be demonstrated that the open space is surplus to 
requirements and justified on the basis of:  
i. the quality and accessibility of the open space; 
ii. the extent to which the open space is serving its purpose;  
iii. the quality and accessibility of alternative public open space; 
and  
b) It is mitigated against by: 
i. re-provision of an appropriate open space taking into account 
quality and accessibility; and/ or 
ii. financial contributions towards new or existing open space 
where:

   the required provision cannot reasonably be delivered on-
site; or 
 the required provision cannot be provided on site in full; and 
 the proposal has over-riding planning benefits. 
 
Policy NE6: New and improved open space  
Planning permission will be granted for development proposals that make 
provision for new and/or improved open space which: 
a) Meets the needs arising from the development having regard to the 
Council’s open space standards and other relevant guidance; 
b) Contributes towards improving the provision, quality and 
accessibility of open space; and 
c) Incorporate any necessary open space buffer(s) for landscape, 
visual, ecological or air quality reasons. 
Any on-site provision must include a long-term maintenance and 
management plan, and where required phasing plans, to demonstrate 
delivery. 
Any built facilities within new or existing open space must be ancillary to 
the primary use and of an appropriate scale and design. Measures should 
be taken to integrate such facilities into the landscape 
Proposals for new open spaces which meet identified needs will be 
encouraged in suitable locations, served by a choice of sustainable travel 
options. 
Financial contributions towards the provision of open space will be 
considered only where it can be demonstrated that the requirements of 
policy NE5 part (b)(ii) are met. 
Where a development is phased, or a site is either divided into separate 
parts or otherwise regarded as part of a larger development, it will be 
considered as a whole for the purposes of open space provision. 
11.25 Types of open spaces for the purposes of this policy are categorised as: 
 Parks and Gardens  
 Amenity Green Space 
 Provision for Children and Young People 
 Outdoor Sports Facilities (including schools) 
 Natural and Semi-Natural Greenspace 
 Green Corridors 
 Cemeteries and Churchyards 
 Allotments and Community Gardens North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
157 
  11.26 In 2009 the Council commissioned the Green Space Study to understand the 
existing quantity and accessibility of different types of open space. To ensure 
the evidence was up-to-date in accordance with current national policy, the 
Council undertook a review of open space provision across the District in 
2016. 
11.27 The Open Space Review defines the types of open space, sets out the 
current provision of open space, identifying deficits, surpluses as well as 
priorities for improvement and suggested standards for open space provision 
associated with new development. The review analyses open space provision 
in the four main towns of Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, Baldock and 
Royston, as well as in rural areas. The Council also currently has a number of 
Action Plans131 that set out open space priorities, which along with other 
relevant guidelines132 can be used when determining the type of open space 
required.  
11.28 Over the plan period it is anticipated that some open spaces could come 
under pressure for development. It is therefore vital that any proposed loss of 
open space is carefully considered to ensure that both the existing and future 
population of North Hertfordshire has sufficient access to open space. In parts 
of the District where there are identified deficiencies in open space, any 
proposed loss would be subject to increased scrutiny. 
11.29 As well as guarding against losses we also need to ensure provision of open 
space on new development and securing improvement to existing spaces.  
11.30 It is vital to ensure that any on-site open space in new development is high 
quality, complements the landscape setting and is fully publically accessible to 
support sustainable and inclusive communities. Open space should be well 
integrated into the design of a scheme and located to achieve good assess for 
all residents by suitable and sustainable modes of travel. Further to this, the 
provision of new open spaces across the District will be valuable in alleviating 
visitor and recreational pressure on designated biodiversity sites. 
11.31 The Open Space Review outlines locations where there is currently under-
provision of certain types of open space and should be used in determining 
the most appropriate type of open space required.  
11.32 Designing new open spaces to meet community needs and enable community 
access can be extremely valuable in maximising access to open space. For 
example, enabling open spaces associated with schools to be used by the 
community can be helpful in meeting the demands for specific types of open 
space, such as playing fields.  
11.33 In some developments, there may be a requirement for open space buffers to 
protect against sources of pollution, such as roads or railway lines, or for 
 
131 The Council’s Action Plans include: Cemeteries and Closed Churchyards Action Plan; Outdoor 
Play Provision Action Plan; Outdoor Sports Facilities Action Plan; and the Allotments Action Plan.

158 
  landscape, visual or ecological purposes, for instance connective features 
such as hedgerows and watercourses. In these cases, it will be expected that 
the open space standards will be delivered alongside any buffer areas which 
are necessary.  
11.34 The Council will support proposals for facilities within new and existing open 
spaces, for instance changing rooms or a kiosk, where the proposed facility is 
ancillary to the primary use and is of a scale and design that is commensurate 
with the primary use. The Council will consider larger facilities where they are 
appropriate to the use of the open space in accordance with national policy 
and guidance. 
11.35 Long-term management and maintenance plans will be required to ensure 
that open spaces can continue to be enjoyed by the community in years to 
come. 
11.36 It is acknowledged that some types of open space can only realistically be 
delivered on a larger scale due to the amount of space that would be required 
and management arrangements. In these circumstances it may be acceptable 
for financial contributions to be provided towards the provision of open space.  
11.37 Where it can be demonstrated that open space cannot be provided on site a 
financial contribution towards the provision of new or enhancement of existing 
open space will be sought subject to the criteria set out in the policy. In such 
instances, the Council will direct such contributions towards areas with an 
identified open space deficiency or towards projects for new or improved open 
spaces. This is to ensure that the additional demand created by the proposed 
development is met. 
11.38 This Plan does not designate Local Green Space. However, the Council will 
support the designation and enhancement of Local Green Space as proposed 
by local communities, for instance in Neighbourhood Plans, where 
appropriate. 
Policy NE7: Reducing flood risk 
Planning permission for development proposals will be granted provided that 
(as applicable):  
a) Development is located outside of medium and high-risk flood areas 
(flood zone 2 and 3) and other areas affected by other sources of 
flooding where possible; 
b) Where (a) is not possible, application of the sequential and exception 
tests is demonstrated where development is proposed in areas of 
flood risk using the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) and 
Environment Agency flood maps;  
c) A FRA has been prepared in accordance with national guidance that 
considers the lifetime of the development, climate change impacts 
and safe access and egress; North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
159 
  d) It will be located, designed and laid out to ensure the risk of flooding 
is reduced whilst not increasing flood risk elsewhere; 
e) The impact of any residual flood risk will be minimised through flood 
resistant, resilient design and construction; 
f) Any flood protection and mitigation measures necessary will not 
cause harm to nature conservation, heritage assets, and/ or 
landscape and recreation and, where possible, will have a positive 
impact in these respects; and 
g) Overland flow routes and functional floodplain areas are protected 
from all development other than that which is “water compatible” and 
this must be designed and constructed to remain operational and safe 
for users during flood events, resulting in no net loss of flood plain 
storage and not impeding water flows or increasing flood risk 
elsewhere. 
 
11.39 The PPG sets out the definitions for the zones of flood risk (rivers and sea 
flooding), ranging from zone 1 with a low probability of flooding to zone 3b 
which is the functional floodplain. It also sets out the sequential test and 
exception test which should be used to assess the suitability of a site for 
development.  
11.40 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) has been carried out for the District, 
which will help to provide the basis for applying the sequential and exception 
tests for development sites. It is acknowledged that it may be necessary for 
water infrastructure to be provided. This is considered to be water-compatible 
development and therefore can be appropriate in areas of flood risk; although 
such development in Flood Zone 3b should be designed and constructed to: 
remain operational and safe for users during flood events, result in no net loss 
of flood plain storage and not impede water flows or increase flood risk 
elsewhere. In areas of flood risk development should take into account flood 
resilience measures. 
11.41 Flood zone maps are produced by the Environment Agency. These maps 
define flood zones 1, 2 and 3, according to the NPPF. North Hertfordshire’s 
SFRA defines flood zone 3b. Proposals for development in an area at risk of 
flooding may be refused planning permission where it increases flood risk or 
conflicts with the sequential approach set in the NPPF.  
11.42 Where development is proposed in an area at risk from flooding, the applicant 
will be required to demonstrate that the site passes the flood risk Sequential 
Test before providing a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) as part of the planning 
application submission. The flood risk Exception Test may also need to be 
demonstrated at this stage. An FRA is applicable to development over 1 
hectare in flood zone 1 and all types of development in flood zones 2 and 3. 
Flood risk impacts should be taken into account for the lifetime of the 
development, and consideration given to the mitigation that needs to be North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
160 
  provided for the increased future flood risk with predicted climatic changes. 
This should include appropriate consideration of downstream flood risks and, 
where necessary, on site attenuation to address this. 
Policy NE8: Sustainable drainage systems 
Planning permission for development will be granted provided that: 
a) The most appropriate sustainable drainage solution is used taking 
into account technical, viability and design issues to reduce the 
risk of surface water flooding, enhance biodiversity, water quality 
and provide amenity benefits;  
b) It aims to mimic the natural drainage patterns and processes as 
far as possible; and 
c) Drainage solutions follow the SuDS hierarchy. 
11.43 In addition to fluvial flooding, surface water and other forms of flooding 
provide a significant risk to development in North Hertfordshire. An increase in 
the number of hard, impermeable surfaces can prevent rainwater soaking 
naturally into the ground and generate additional rainwater runoff. However, 
incorporating sustainable drainage systems into a development scheme can 
help to reduce the impact of rainwater runoff and therefore surface water 
flooding. 
11.44 The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 requires Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SuDS) for new developments. SuDS need to be incorporated into 
the design of schemes from the outset. This is because many SuDS features 
will influence the layout of a development and may be interlinked with open 
space, highways, ecological and/or landscape features. 
11.45 The Council will consult and work with the Lead Local Flood Authority133 
(LLFA), the Environment Agency and Internal Drainage Boards as required on 
development proposals that are at risk from flooding or may contribute to 
additional surface run off.  At risk areas are identified in the SFRA and 
mitigation measures need to be considered when designing development in 
order to reduce the risk of flooding from surface water. When selecting 
appropriate drainage techniques, it is important to try and maximise the 
number of benefits, and to prioritise the most sustainable approaches taking 
into consideration appropriate design and financial viability issues. These 
techniques can be set out in the form of a hierarchy. Evidence will need to be 
provided that development has followed the surface water management 
hierarchy as detailed below.

11.46 For major development the LLFA is a statutory consultee in relation to the 
management of surface water drainage. Whilst SuDS is only a requirement for 
major development, it is recommended for all development to ensure surface 
water is appropriately managed. Developers should consult with the Lead 
Local Flood Authority and / or the Internal Drainage Board at the earliest 
possible opportunity, to ensure SuDS are incorporated at the design stage. 
Policy NE9: Water quality and environment 
Planning permission for development proposals will be granted provided 
that they make appropriate space for water, including (as applicable): 
a) Maintaining a minimum 8 metre134 wide undeveloped buffer zone 
from all designated main rivers;  
b) Maintaining a minimum 5m wide undeveloped buffer zone for 
ordinary watercourses; and 
 
134 Water Resources Act 1991 
North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
162 
  c) River restoration and resilience improvements where proposals 
are situated close to a river or considered to affect nearby 
watercourses. 
11.47 Groundwater is an important resource for both water supply and biodiversity 
as it discharges into surface waters and wetlands, and maintains river and 
stream flows during dry spells. Most potable water (water which is safe to 
drink) in North Hertfordshire is abstracted from the ground. As a 
consequence, it can be vulnerable to pollutants. It is therefore important to 
protect these water resources from any potential pollutants and recapture as 
much water run off as possible. Development proposals therefore must 
demonstrate that available improvements in the efficiency of water use, 
surface drainage systems and pollution prevention measures have been 
optimised, and that they have strived to mitigate future problems. Policy 
NE11: Contaminated Land specifically sets the requirements for contaminated 
land. 
11.48 The policy encourages development proposals to incorporate sustainable 
water management measures into the design. The policy will ensure that 
where development takes place that appropriate measures are taken to 
protect the development against flooding and ensure that the design of the 
development conserves precious water resources, improves water quality and 
enhances the natural environment. This will enhance and protect local 
biodiversity and wildlife corridors and ensure the preservation of acceptable 
flood flow routes is maintained. 
11.49 The NPPF135 emphasises the importance of natural networks of linked habitat 
corridors to allow the movement of species between suitable habitats and 
promote biodiversity. River corridors are particularly effective in this way. 
11.50 Rivers and watercourses enhance the quality of the environment. Their 
protection and enhancement will improve the enjoyment of these assets, 
enhancing biodiversity and make them more resilient to current and future 
pressures. This can be achieved through the use of buffers alongside 
watercourses and through restoration projects as part of development 
schemes.  
11.51 Main rivers are watercourses shown to be designated as main on the 
Environment Agency's statutory flood map136. These are usually a larger 
stream or river with a significant effect on the overall drainage of a catchment 
area, however smaller watercourses can also be designated as main rivers. 
The Environment Agency has authority, powers, rights and responsibilities for 
regulating main rivers. Ordinary watercourses are any other river, stream, 
ditch or culvert (other than a public sewer) that is not a designated Main River. 
The responsibility for maintenance of these lies with anyone who owns the 
adjacent land or property. Where these fall in Internal Drainage Board (IDB)

  land they are regulated by the IDB, outside of this North Hertfordshire District 
Council will be the regulator. 
11.52 Where proposals are considered to affect nearby watercourses or sites that 
are situated close to a river, the Council will seek river restoration and 
resilience improvements as part of the proposal. In some instances, financial 
contributions may be appropriate towards these measures the restoration of 
rivers. 
Policy NE10: Water conservation and wastewater infrastructure 
Planning permission for new development will be granted provided that; 
a) It does not result in the deterioration of any watercourse in 
accordance with the Water Environment (Water Framework 
Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 (WFD);  
b) It helps contribute towards the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
actions and objectives; 
c) It helps achieve the objectives set out in the Anglian and Thames 
River Basin Management Plans;  
d) Mechanisms for delivering any necessary new or improved water 
and/ or wastewater infrastructure are secured under the 
requirements of Policy SP7; and  
e) Adequate foul water treatment and disposal already exists or can 
be provided in time to serve the development. 
New development around Stevenage within the Rye Meads Sewage 
Treatment Works Catchment will need to demonstrate that additional 
potable water supply and consequential wastewater treatment capacity 
can be achieved and implemented ahead of development without 
significant environmental impact, including adverse effects on 
designated sites.  
11.53 North Hertfordshire is located at the watershed between the Great Ouse and 
Thames river catchments. Headwaters of river catchments are small which 
means as a consequence there is very little dilution available for large sewage 
discharges.  
11.54 As a result there is little environmental capacity that can be taken up without 
causing a breach of statutory environmental targets including the Water 
Environment (Water Framework Directive) Regulations 2017 (WFD). 
Additionally water supply also has implications under the WFD, not just water 
quality. The Great Ouse and Thames catchments are both highly water 
stressed. Any proposed increase in groundwater abstraction from these 
catchments is also likely to have implications on compliance with WFD 
regulations.  
11.55 The WFD is being implemented in the UK largely through River Basin 
Management Plans (RBMP) which detail the pressures facing the water North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
164 
  environment and what actions need to be taken in order for the WFD to be 
met in each area. For North Hertfordshire this includes both the Thames and 
Great Ouse RBMPs137. Working with the Environment Agency and key 
stakeholders will be important to deliver future outcomes of these plans and 
improve the District’s water environment. 
11.56 At present only the River Ivel is at a “good” status while the rest of the water 
bodies in North Hertfordshire are failing. Further information in relation to the 
water bodies in North Hertfordshire is available on the Environment Agency’s 
Catchment Data Explorer138 including measures that will help achieve their 
objectives. Developers will be expected to contribute towards measures and 
objectives through their development proposals. 
11.57 The Stevenage Water Cycle Strategy (WCS) requires that for new 
development to proceed in the area, it will need to be demonstrated that it can 
be delivered within the water resource and water quality constraints. 
Developers will need to ensure that additional potable water supply 
requirements can be met and that waste water will not exceed available 
treatment capacity. Any necessary upgrades to infrastructure will have to be 
implemented ahead of the development. Rainwater harvesting and grey water 
reuse need to be strategically planned across larger sites and a strategy of 
retrofitting water efficiency features could also take place in the area. 
Reducing potable demand for water will reduce the consequent loading on the 
sewerage network.  
11.58 In Royston, the Environment Agency and the wastewater undertaker have 
agreed that in principle a technically feasible engineering solution can be 
delivered to accommodate all of the growth proposed. Should a new permit be 
required in order to meet the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, 
this would involve a tightening of standards and would necessitate a costly 
upgrade of Royston Sewage Treatment Works.  
11.59 Drainage strategies should be used to demonstrate that a proposed 
development has considered the available surface and foul water drainage 
options during a scheme’s preparation stage to ensure that adequate 
infrastructure is in place before development commences. 
Policy NE11: Contaminated land 
Planning permission for development affecting or affected by 
contaminated land will be granted provided that: 
a) A contaminated land study / contaminated land risk assessment 
is submitted as part of the application; 
 
137 For information see: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/great-ouse-catchment-flood-
management-plan   
138 http://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
165 
  b) Appropriate mechanisms are in place to investigate, 
characterise the risks and remediate the contamination to 
remove the risks, or reduce the risk to an acceptable level; and  
c) The site is suitable for use taking account of ground conditions, 
groundwater vulnerability and pollution arising from previous 
land use and land remediation in reference to relevant guidance 
(and any subsequent updates)139 
11.60 The District will be accommodating a significant amount of development 
during the plan period. This policy supports Policy SP11 in protecting and 
enhancing the environment in the context of accommodating significant 
development. As a significant proportion of the District’s housing growth will 
take place on previously developed land, it is important for this Plan to deal 
with the implications of contamination. 
11.61 Decisions should ensure that the site is suitable for its new use taking account 
of ground conditions, pollution arising from previous uses and any proposals 
for land remediation. 
11.62 Much of the area covered by this plan overlies Secondary and Principal 
Aquifers. Abstractions are located throughout the plan area, with WFD 
aquifers and rivers present. Source Protection Zones (1 to 3) and landfills are 
present within the plan area, and mostly in the areas around Hitchin, 
Letchworth, Baldock, Royston, Ashwell and Stevenage. Principal aquifers are 
geological strata that exhibit high permeability and provide a high level of 
water storage. They may support water supply and/or river base flow on a 
strategic scale. Secondary aquifers are often capable of supporting water 
supplies at a local scale and normally provide an important source of flow to 
some rivers. The use of groundwater for local drinking water supplies in the 
area makes it particularly vulnerable to pollution. 
11.63 Certain new activities need to be deterred in sensitive areas based on their 
intrinsic hazard to sensitive receptors (e.g. groundwater, Principal Aquifers, 
Source Protection Zones). Close to sensitive receptors a precautionary 
approach is likely to be taken even where the risk of failure is low as the 
consequences may be serious or irreversible. 
11.64 Where risks from landfill gas are likely to arise, where land contamination may 
be reasonably suspected, or particularly environmentally sensitive 
developments (e.g. petrol filling stations) are proposed for sensitive sites, 
developers are encouraged to hold pre-application discussions. A Preliminary 
Risk Assessment (PRA) should be undertaken as the first stage in assessing 
these risks and is a requirement for validating relevant planning applications.

166 
  11.65 The policy will allow the Council to achieve a consistent and transparent 
approach to the redevelopment of land where contamination of the ground 
may be a constraint. It will also help to meet the objectives of the Water 
Framework Directive. The policy also allows us to approve higher value land 
uses on sites where serious contamination may make other types of 
development unviable. Receptors to contamination include human beings, the 
historic built environment and the natural environment, including controlled 
waters as defined in Section 4 of the Contaminated Land  Statutory Guidance 
(DEFRA, 2012) 140. 
11.66 The contaminated land assessment / study will need to demonstrate how the 
site will be safely managed before, during and after development and highlight 
any remedial action where required. Development must ensure that water 
quality is not compromised and improvements to water quality will be secured 
where appropriate, in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. 
Policy NE12: Renewable and low carbon energy development 
Proposals for solar farms involving the best and most versatile agricultural 
land and proposals for wind turbines will be determined in accordance with 
national policy. Proposals for other renewable and low carbon energy 
development which would contribute towards reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions will be permitted subject to an assessment of the impacts upon:  
i. Landscape quality, landscape character and visual amenity, 
including consideration of cumulative impacts of development; 
ii. Environmental assets;  
iii. The historic environment, including the impact on the setting of 
historic assets ; 
iv. The transport network; 
v. Air quality; 
vi. Aviation interests; and 
vii. The amenity of residents.  
In assessing renewable and low carbon energy proposals against the 
above criteria the Council will give significant weight to their local and wider 
benefits, particularly the potential to reduce greenhouse gas and other 
harmful emissions, and the social benefits of community owned schemes 
where this is relevant. 
Proposals for decentralised energy schemes associated with development 
of the strategic sites allocated in the Plan will be encouraged subject to an 
assessment of the impacts.   
In all cases, end of life/redundant plant, buildings, apparatus, and 
infrastructure must be removed and the site restored to its former state or a 
condition agreed with the Council.

167 
   
11.67 The UK Renewable Energy Strategy141  sets out how the UK will ensure that 
15% of all energy will come from renewable sources by 2020. Renewable 
sources of energy include wind, wave, tidal, hydro or solar power and 
biomass fuels. Nationally, the increased use of renewable and low carbon 
technology will contribute to improving energy security, increased economic 
activity and help to slow down climate change through the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions.  The National Planning Policy Framework says 
that local plans should maximise renewable and low carbon energy 
development while ensuring that adverse impacts are addressed 
satisfactorily. 
11.68 The Hertfordshire Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Technical Study142  
identifies energy opportunity areas in the District. This may assist developers 
to choose the appropriate renewable technology, depending on the location of 
the development.  The Study also identified that there may be areas of 
opportunity to investigate decentralised energy schemes, this could be 
particularly relevant in those areas where larger scale development may take 
place.  Broadly, decentralised energy schemes refer to energy that is 
generated off the main grid and can include micro-renewables, heating and 
cooling.  Schemes can serve a single building or a whole community.  
Although development proposals for renewable and low carbon energy will be 
supported in appropriate locations, it is also important that development 
proposals incorporate energy efficient measures to help reduce the demand 
for energy in the first place. The Council is mindful that an appropriate 
balance must be maintained between the benefits of renewable energy and 
other constraints and considerations in accordance with National Planning 
Practice Guidance (PPG).  
11.69 Renewable energy technologies evolve rapidly in response to technical 
innovation and consequently funding regimes can also change significantly.  
This can result in differing levels of interest in development proposals for 
renewable technology and indeed changes to where those developments 
might best be located.

  12 Historic Environment 
 Policy HE1: Designated heritage assets 
Planning applications relating to Designated heritage Assets or their setting 
shall be accompanied by a Heritage Assessment/Justification Statement 
that: 
i. Assesses the significance of heritage assets, including their setting; 
ii. Justifies and details the impacts of any proposal upon the 
significance of the designated heritage asset(s); and 
iii. Informs any necessary measures to minimise or mitigate against 
any identified harms. 
Planning permission for development proposals affecting Designated 
Heritage Assets or their setting will be granted where they (as applicable): 
a) Enable the heritage asset to be used in a manner that secures its 
conservation and preserves its significance; 
b) Incorporate a palette of materials that make a positive contribution 
to local character or distinctiveness, where it is appropriate and 
justified; and 
c) Will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of the 
designated heritage asset, and this harm is outweighed by the 
public benefits of the development, including securing the asset’s 
optimum viable use. 
Where substantial harm to, or loss of significance, of a designated heritage 
asset is proposed the Council shall refuse consent unless it can be 
demonstrated that the scheme is necessary to deliver considerable public 
benefits that outweigh the harm or loss. 
12.1 Designated heritage assets include Scheduled Monuments, Listed Buildings, 
Conservation Areas and Registered Parks and Gardens. National guidance 
states that great weight should be given to the conservation of those 
assets143, including (where appropriate) securing an asset’s optimum viable 
use.  
12.2 The Council recognises the significance of designated heritage assets within 
the District and the contribution they make to defining local character, 
providing a sense of place and achieving sustainable development. Their 
conservation and preservation is an important consideration within the 
planning process and is recognised within specific legislation144 and national 
planning policy. The Council will require applicants to assess the significance 
of the designated heritage asset, including its setting, and justify and detail the 
 
143 Paragraph 132 of the 2012 NPPF 
144 Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
169 
  impact of the proposal upon the significance of the asset to ensure proposals 
preserve the significance of assets. 
12.3 The NPPF sets out that substantial harm to designated heritage assets should 
generally be avoided, unless specific exception criteria are met145.  In some 
cases where proposals will lead to less than substantial harm to a designated 
heritage asset, it is necessary to weigh any harm against the public benefits of 
the proposal including (where appropriate) securing an asset’s optimum viable 
use146 and ensure that necessary mitigation measures are identified to 
minimise any identified harm. Sites allocated in this Plan that have the 
potential to lead to less than substantial harm to a designated heritage asset 
and or its setting have been weighed against the public interest test and 
mitigation or guidance measures are set out in this Plan where necessary147.  
12.4 North Hertfordshire contains forty-four conservation areas. These have been 
designated due to their particular historic or architectural significance. The 
conservation area boundaries are shown on the Policies Map.  Particular care 
will be required when considering the scale, layout, design and materials of 
development proposals within or adjacent to conservation areas. They must 
be designed to harmonise with their surroundings and in conservation areas 
preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the heritage asset.  The 
Council will provide guidance for shopfront design and advertising within 
conservation areas to encourage high quality design and enhance the 
character and significance of conservation areas. 
 Policy HE2: Heritage at risk 
Planning permission will be granted for proposals that seek to conserve or 
provide new uses for designated heritage assets identified on the national 
register, or the Council’s ‘At Risk’ register maintained by the Council, that 
are justified and appropriate to the significance of the asset to return a 
heritage asset to beneficial use. 
Proposals that harm the significance of heritage assets included on 
national and local registers will be resisted unless the need for, and the 
benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh that harm, 
taking account of the asset’s significance and importance, and all feasible 
solutions to avoid and mitigate that harm have been fully assessed. 
12.5 As part of its heritage strategy the Council will maintain and review a list of 
heritage assets at risk and work with Historic England, owners and occupiers 
to find new, appropriate uses and solutions to secure the future of heritage 
assets. Generally, the Council will work constructively with landowners to 
 
145  Paragraphs 132 and 133 of the 2012 NPPF 
146 Paragraph 134 of the 2012 NPPF 
147 See Policies SP14 to SP19 and the Communities section for guidance and mitigation. The Housing 
and Green Belt Background Paper (NHDC, 2016) sets out how the strategy in this Plan has been 
balanced against heritage and other harms. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
170 
  seek to prevent heritage assets from becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place, trying 
to find appropriate uses where possible.  
12.6 Where possible, planning obligations shall be sought to contribute to the 
conservation of such assets and legal agreements will be used to ensure the 
repair of assets alongside new developments. Proposals that lead to 
substantial harm to, or loss of, the significance shall comply with the test 
detailed in paragraph 133 of the 2012 NPPF. 
 Policy HE3: Non-designated heritage assets  
Permission for a proposal that would result in harm to, or the loss of, a 
non-designated heritage asset will only be granted provided that a 
balanced judgement has been made that assesses the scale of harm to, or 
loss of significance of the non-designated asset and, where the proposal 
results in the loss of a non-designated heritage asset: 
a) The replacement building contributes to preserving the local 
character and distinctiveness of the area; and  
b) Where the asset is located in a conservation area a continuous 
contract for the demolition and redevelopment of the site has been 
secured, unless there are justifiable grounds for not developing the 
site. 
12.7 North Hertfordshire has a rich heritage of designed landscapes and historic 
buildings, many of which are not designated, but contribute to a strong sense 
of place and contribute much to the character of historic towns, villages and 
the wider countryside.  
12.8 Non-designated heritage assets are buildings, monuments, sites, places, 
areas or landscapes identified as having a degree of significance meriting 
consideration in planning decisions but which are not formally designated 
heritage assets. This policy is concerned with those non-designated heritage 
assets that are locally listed, such as buildings of local interest. 
12.9 Buildings of local interest are those identified on Registers of Buildings of 
Local Interest adopted by the Council and are selected based on criteria 
found in those documents.  
12.10 Buildings that do not satisfy the criteria for buildings of local interest but which 
have townscape merit and contribute to the special interest of a Conservation 
Area are identified as ‘positive buildings’ and often form notable groups that 
help to define the streetscape.  
12.11 As and when a Conservation Area review is undertaken, further additions to 
the Buildings of Local Interest Register or positive buildings will be identified. 
12.12 Where appropriate, the Council intends to continue its programme of 
producing local lists for each town and parish. This will be in accordance with North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
171 
  historic England’s published advice for the establishment and management of 
local lists148. 
12.13 The Council will seek to conserve the character and significance of parks and 
gardens identified as locally important heritage assets and include these on 
the Hertfordshire Historic Environment Record or identified on adopted local 
lists or maps of heritage assets. 
12.14 Because of the developing programme for producing local lists and the 
ongoing potential for discovering assets of interest, the Council will determine 
development proposals affecting all identified non-designated heritage assets 
in accordance with the NPPF.  
Policy HE4: Archaeology 
Permission for development proposals affecting heritage assets with 
archaeological interest will be granted provided that:  
a) Developers submit an appropriate desk-based assessment and, 
where justified, an archaeological field evaluation.  
b) It is demonstrated how archaeological remains will be preserved 
and incorporated into the layout of that development, if in situ 
preservation of important archaeological remains is considered 
preferable; and 
c) Where the loss of the whole or a material part of important 
archaeological remains is justified, appropriate conditions are 
applied to ensure that the archaeological recording, reporting, 
publication and archiving of the results of such archaeological work 
is undertaken before it is damaged or lost. 
Where archaeological sites have been assessed to meet the criteria for 
inclusion on adopted registers or maps of locally important heritage assets 
these shall be treated in the same way as archaeology areas and areas of 
archaeological significance.  
Areas of as yet, unknown archaeology may be identified during research, 
or through the planning or plan making process. These sites or areas 
should be treated in the same way as archaeology areas and areas of 
archaeological significance. 
12.15 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) are the most important archaeological 
and historical sites and are given statutory protection.  Historic England is 
responsible for identifying SAMs and any works on them require special 
permission from the Government. There are currently 60 SAMs in North 
Hertfordshire, and this list is under constant review.  
12.16 There are also a number of archaeological areas and Areas of Archaeological 
Significance across North Hertfordshire which, although not nationally 
 
148 Historic England (2016) Local Heritage Listing. Historic England Advice Note 7. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
172 
  recognised or designated are considered to be of local importance. This is 
because they contain or have the potential for moderate or high 
archaeological remains within them. Known heritage assets of national and 
local significance are recorded on the Hertfordshire Historic Environment 
Record. The Historic Environment Record is a dynamic dataset, which is 
updated constantly to reflect new discoveries made in Hertfordshire. This data 
is available to view on the ‘Heritage Gateway’149 .  
12.17 This does not mean that areas outside the SAMs or Areas of Archaeological 
Significance are without archaeological potential, and important 
archaeological remains may exist elsewhere within the District. The Council 
will seek to protect other valuable remains throughout the District. From time-
to-time alterations to existing areas of archaeological significance, or 
identification of new areas will be required based on new data or 
understanding of significance.  
12.18 Where development proposals will affect any of these areas, prospective 
developers will be required to undertake an archaeological assessment (if 
necessary with a field evaluation) of the site in line with Government guidance 
and in consultation with the County Council’s Historic Environment Unit. A full 
report of this recording work and any findings should be submitted to the local 
planning authority for approval before an application can be determined.  
12.19 In the event of previously unknown archaeological remains being uncovered 
after works have commenced on site, both the Council and Historic England 
should be informed.  Should the remains be deemed important enough to 
schedule, Scheduled Monument Consent will be required.

for sites that were included in the Preferred Options or submission versions of 
the Plan but have not been carried forward to this final version of the Plan 
have not been re-used. Any new sites have been given the next available 
reference number. This means that site allocation references for individual 
communities do not necessarily run sequentially.

  Ashwell 
Introduction 
13.4 Ashwell is the northernmost parish in the District (and county). The village of 
Ashwell has a relatively good range of facilities. At the 2011 census the 
population of the parish was 1,870, and there were 841 dwellings in the 
parish. Apart from the village the parish also includes a wide tract of 
countryside and some scattered farms. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.5 Ashwell is identified as a Category A village. A development boundary is 
shown on the Policies Map to indicate the area within which further 
development will be allowed. The boundary has been drawn so as to allow for 
Ashwell’s development needs during this Plan period. 
Heritage 
13.6 Ashwell has one conservation area, covering much of the central part of the 
village, and numerous listed buildings. The parish church of St Mary is Grade 
I listed. To the north of the village the grounds of Ashwell Bury are designated 
as a historic park and garden. To the south-west of the village lies the Arbury 
Banks Scheduled Ancient Monument. 
Housing 
13.7 No sites are allocated for housing in Ashwell. 117 homes have been built or 
granted planning permission since 2011. 
Economy 
13.8 The facilities of Ashwell are designated as a Local Centre under Policy SP4. 
The extent of the neighbourhood centre is shown on a map in Appendix 3. 
Any applications in this area will be considered in accordance with the 
detailed policies of this Plan.

  Baldock 
Introduction 
13.9 Baldock is a market town near the source of the River Ivel. It lies on the site of 
a Roman town which stood at the junction of the Icknield Way and the Roman 
roads to Godmanchester, Braughing, and St Albans. The site of the Roman 
town appears to have been abandoned after the Roman withdrawal. The 
modern town was founded by the Knights Templar in the twelfth century on an 
area of land which formerly belonged to Weston. A parish was created for the 
new town which covered a relatively small area. The town’s original parish 
boundaries were Icknield Way to the north, Station Road / Clothall Road to 
the east, South Road / Crabtree Lane to the south and Weston Way / Norton 
Road to the west. Baldock has since grown beyond those medieval 
boundaries to take in areas which formerly belonged to Norton, Bygrave, 
Clothall, Weston and Willian. 
13.10 Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and Baldock lie very close to each other and 
have strong relationships linking them in terms of housing markets and job 
movements. That said, each town retains a distinct identity of its own. The 
needs for development arising from the three towns are comparatively high, 
but the gaps separating the towns are small and of great importance if the 
town’s urban areas and identities are to be kept distinct. Managing growth in 
this relatively developed part of the District whilst allowing each town to retain 
its identity is one of the challenges to be addressed.  
13.11 At the 2011 census the population of Baldock (defined as the unparished 
area) was 10,280, and there were 4,491 dwellings in the town. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.12 Baldock is classed as a town in Policy SP2. A boundary for the town is shown 
on the Policies Map. Beyond this boundary is classed as Green Belt. 
Heritage 
13.13 Baldock has one conservation area, covering the town centre and older parts 
of the town. Most of the town’s listed buildings are on one of the four streets 
radiating from the Town Hall crossroads: Hitchin Street, Church Street,

13.14 Baldock also has an important history as a Roman settlement, which was 
centred on Walls Field to the east of the town centre, which is a scheduled 
ancient monument. A large area around this is also of archaeological 
significance.

Economy 
13.16 The town’s current employment areas are relatively modest. In part this is due 
to the town’s close proximity to the major employment area east of Letchworth 
Garden City. This Plan proposes extending the current small employment 
area on Royston Road into a larger business park to take advantage of the 
good location close to the junction with the bypass and within reasonably 
close proximity of the railway station and town centre. 
13.17 In order to help deliver additional local jobs in the District in combination with 
residential development over the plan period, Policy SP3 identifies that 19.6 
hectares of employment land should be allocated at Baldock. Given the site’s 
location adjacent to the A505 it provides an ideal location for employment 
development and it is considered this will allow for future growth over the plan 
period.

13.18 Baldock’s town centre provides for day-to-day shopping, with a range of 
shops mostly along High Street and Whitehorse Street and a large 
supermarket on the edge of the town centre. A traditional street market is held 
in the High Street on Wednesdays, whilst specialist farmers and craft markets 
are occasionally held. Baldock has been bypassed twice: first by the north-
south A1 in the 1963 and then by the east-west A505 in 2006. Following the 
second bypass’s opening a programme of enhancement works were carried 
out to the town centre improving the quality of the street-scene. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
184 
  13.19 The shops along High Street and Whitehorse Street lie within the designated 
town centre. Proposals here will be determined in line with our detailed 
policies on shopping frontages. 
Infrastructure & mitigation  
13.20 It is anticipated that development of the large, greenfield sites around Baldock 
will occur sequentially with those to the south of the town coming forward first 
and being used to support some of the upfront costs associated with our 
Strategic Housing Site to the north of Baldock. 
13.21 Over the plan period, the education requirement for Baldock will see up 8FE 
of additional schools provision. The exact configuration of the education 
infrastructure is still to be finalised. 
13.22 With regards to primary provision it is likely that 2FE will be provided south of 
the railway and 6FE to the north. 
13.23 Our Strategic Policy for north of Baldock sets out our expectations in relation 
to that site, including provision of a new secondary school. 
13.24 Ahead of, or alongside this, some expansion of Knights Templar School may 
be possible. Equally, it may be necessary to include some secondary 
provision to the south of the town in the short- to medium-term until the long-
term arrangements are finalised and put in place. 
13.25 The Station Road / Clothall Road / Royston Road junction is identified as 
pinch point in the Council’s transport modelling. Provision of a new road 
associated with BA1 linking the A507 with the A505 will help mitigate this 
issue enabling movement from north to east without the need to use the 
junction.  
13.26 Additionally a southern link road is proposed to enable the development of 
site BA3. This will improve connectivity to the south of the town providing the 
ability to bypass this junction. The detailed alignment of the link road will be 
determined through the Development Management process. This may require 
the existing bunding at the eastern end of the proposed link road to be re-
profiled. The agreed route of the southern link road through the bunded area 
will mark the outer limits of built development in this part of the site. 
13.27 Baldock has historically experienced air quality issues associated with traffic 
in the town. However, these measures should help to ensure that relevant Air 
Quality Objectives are not exceeded as a consequence of growth. Detailed 
assessments will be required in line with Policy D4 when larger sites 
(including BA1 to BA4) are brought forward for development. 
13.28 For much of its length, the A505 Baldock Bypass provides the most 
appropriate, defensible Green Belt boundary to the south of the town. This 
requires the removal of some land to the south of Wallington Road lying 
outside of the allocated housing areas and which should generally remain North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
185 
  undeveloped. Our detailed policies set out the approach we will take to areas 
of Urban Open Land. 
13.29 Heritage and archaeology are key considerations in Baldock owing to the rich 
history of the settlement. It is considered that sites closest to the scheduled 
ancient monuments (namely BA2, BA3, BA5 and BA11) can avoid substantial 
harm to the significance of this asset. Sensitive design will be a critical factor 
in the development of these sites.  
13.30 The mapped extent of surface water flooding, illustrates a potential issue in 
Baldock, although this may not reflect the true nature of the extent of flooding 
in the area. SUDs techniques will need to be employed to ensure that the 
issue is adequately mitigated and risk is not increased.

  Barkway 
Introduction 
13.31 Barkway is located in the rural area to the east of the District. At the 2011 
census the population of the parish was 775 people, living in 329 dwellings. 
The village has a limited range of facilities including a primary school, garage, 
pub and golf course. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.32 Barkway is one of five villages where a greater amount of development has 
been allocated. It is the largest in population terms of three villages located in 
the area to the east of the A10 and to the south of Royston. Despite this, 
facilities are limited and so residents would presently be likely to travel to 
either Royston to the north or Buntingford to the south for many day to day 
items. A development boundary is shown on the Policies Map to indicate the 
area within which further development will be allowed. The boundary has 
been drawn so as to allow for Barkway’s development needs during this Plan 
period. 
Heritage 
13.33 Many properties in the village date back to the 17th and 18th century although 
there are also a number from the 16th century and even some from the 15th 
century. The older part of the village has a linear form with many of the oldest 
properties fronting the High Street. Many are rendered, with some displaying 
distinctive pargetting (ornamental plasterwork), whilst several properties have 
thatched roofs. Barkway has had a village church for over 1000 years, 
although the current flint and stone church dates back to the 13th century. The 
designated conservation area covers much of the historic linear section of the 
village. The parish church of St Mary Magdalene is a Grade I listed building. 
To the north-east of the village the Cockenach estate is designated as a 
historic park and garden. 
Housing 
13.34 Two sites are allocated in Barkway for an estimated 160 new homes. A further 
57 homes have been built or granted planning permission within the parish 
since 2011.

  Infrastructure & mitigation 
13.36 The existing first school in Barkway is federated with the first school in 
neighbouring Barley with different year groups taught in each village. Current 
estimates suggest that the additional pupils likely to arise from the sites in 
Barkway can be accommodated in the existing schools. Contributions to 
support sustainable travel between the two sites should be secured from new 
developments. Both school sites are constrained and are considered difficult 
to expand. Hertfordshire County Council hold a reserve school site in the 
village, lying within site BK3. A reserve site will be retained providing the 
opportunity to respond to any further increase in the number of pupils from the 
two villages. 
13.37 We will work with the County Council and Diocese (who operate the schools 
in Barkway and Barley) to explore the most appropriate long-term education 
solution. 
13.38 Although Barkway has a range of local facilities, there is presently no shop in 
the village. The development of land to the north of the village provides an 
opportunity to remedy this and support the long-term role of the village. 
13.39 Newsells Park Stud is an established rural business which lies directly to the 
north of site BK3. The stud is a specialist business which relies on the 
adjoining pasture land to create the best conditions for rearing foals. 
Development on site BK3 will need to take into account any potential impact 
from noise, increased activity and other forms of disturbance both during 
construction and throughout the occupancy of the scheme.

  Barley 
Introduction 
13.40 Barley is located in the rural area on the eastern edge of the District. At the 
2011 census the parish had a population of approximately 662 people and 
287 dwellings. It has a reasonable range of services for a village of its size. 
These services include a primary school, doctor’s surgery, post office and 
general store, petrol filling station/garage and two public houses. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.41 Barley is identified as a Category A village in the settlement hierarchy. 
General development will be permitted within the defined village boundary. 
Beyond the village boundary, land is classified as Rural Area beyond the 
Green Belt. 
13.42 Whilst Barley is smaller than the neighbouring village of Barkway, it does have 
a wider range of facilities and so does attract visits from both Barkway and 
other nearby settlements. However, for many requirements residents visit the 
nearby town of Royston. 
Heritage 
13.43 Barley has grown slowly but more or less continuously over recent centuries 
and so contains a wide variety of buildings. This includes buildings from the 
start of the 17th century as well as St Margaret of Antioch Church which 
originally dates from the 12th century. The Barley Conservation Area covers 
much of the village. 
Housing 
13.44 There are no sites allocated for residential development in Barley. 17 homes 
have been granted planning permission or built since 2011. 
Economy 
13.45 The economy of Barley is mixed and reflects the relatively diverse range of 
facilities and businesses that exist in the village. In addition to those 
mentioned above this also includes a coach hire company, doctor’s surgery 
and livery operation.

  Bygrave 
Introduction 
13.46 Bygrave is a small village to the north-east of Baldock. The older part of the 
village is clustered around the parish church just off the road from Baldock to 
Ashwell. More recent development has been built along the main road 
towards Baldock, notably at Lower Bygrave in the mid-twentieth century. The 
parish extends up to the edges of Baldock, and used to include part of the 
town; Baldock Station and the surrounding area were historically in Bygrave 
parish, gradually being transferred to Baldock between 1881 and 1928. 
13.47 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Bygrave was 304 and there 
were 108 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.48 Bygrave village is identified as a Category C settlement where only limited 
affordable housing or facilities for local community needs will be allowed. Most 
of the parish, including the village itself, is within the Green Belt. 
Housing 
13.49 Our Strategic Housing Site to the north of Baldock (see Policy SP14) is mostly 
within the parish of Bygrave. No other housing sites are allocated in Bygrave. 
There have been two homes built or granted planning permission in the parish 
since 2011. 
Economy 
13.50 Site BA10, Royston Road, Baldock, is mostly in the parish of Bygrave and is

  Caldecote 
Introduction 
13.51 Caldecote is North Hertfordshire’s smallest parish. Whilst it remains 
administratively a separate parish, it now shares a joint parish council with 
neighbouring Newnham. The village today is much smaller than it was in 
medieval times; the church (now closed) was rebuilt in the 14th century, just 
before the village was effectively abandoned (around the time of the Black 
Death), leaving just a manor house and a couple of farm cottages. 
13.52 Away from the shrunken village, the parish does include a couple of buildings 
on the A1, including a petrol filling station with shop. Apart from this the parish 
has little in way of facilities. 
13.53 Population statistics are not available for Caldecote separately due to its small 
size. The combined population of the three parishes of Caldecote, Newnham 
and Radwell at the 2011 census was 209 and there were 97 dwellings across 
the three parishes. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.54 Caldecote is identified as a Category C settlement where only limited 
affordable housing or facilities for local community needs will be allowed. The 
whole of the parish is designated as Rural Area beyond the Green Belt within 
which there is general restraint on development. 
Housing 
13.55 No sites are allocated for housing in Caldecote. There have been no planning 
permissions granted or new homes built in the parish since 2011.

  Clothall 
Introduction 
13.56 Clothall is a long, thin parish stretching from the southern edges of Baldock to 
the District’s southern border with East Hertfordshire near Luffenhall. The 
parish contains the small village of Clothall and the hamlet of Luffenhall. It 
also gives its name to the Clothall Common area of Baldock, which used to be 
part of Clothall parish before being transferred to Baldock. 
13.57 The village contains a village hall and church but has few other facilities. 
13.58 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Clothall was 150 and there 
were 67 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.59 Clothall is identified as a Category C settlement where only limited affordable 
housing or facilities for local community needs will be allowed. Much of the 
parish, including the village itself, is washed over with Green Belt, with 
southern and eastern parts of the parish classed as Rural Area Beyond the 
Green Belt. 
Housing 
13.60 Some of the allocated housing sites on the south-eastern edges of Baldock 
are in the parish of Clothall. For further discussion of these, see the Baldock 
page. No other housing sites are allocated in Clothall. There have been no 
planning permissions granted or new homes built within that part of Clothall 
parish outside of the Baldock urban area since 2011.

  Cockernhoe, Mangrove Green and East of Luton 
Introduction 
13.61 Cockernhoe and the area east of Luton is part of Offley parish. The 
Cockernhoe ward of Offley parish covers the area between Luton and Lilley 
Bottom Road and includes Cockernhoe, Mangrove Green and Tea Green. 
There are also a number of scattered farms and Putteridge Bury. 
13.62 The remainder of Offley parish is discussed in its own section of this chapter. 
13.63 At the 2011 census the population of the Cockernhoe ward of Offley parish 
was 493 and there were 205 dwellings in the ward. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.64 Cockernhoe & Mangrove Green is identified as a Category A village. The 
development boundary is shown on the Policies Map to indicate the area 
within which further development will be allowed. The boundary has been 
drawn so as to include both the village of Cockernhoe & Mangrove Green and 
the adjoining expansion of Luton. Outside this boundary the rest of the 
Cockernhoe ward is classed as Green Belt. 
Heritage 
13.65 This area includes the Putteridge Bury historic park and garden, now used by 
the University of Bedfordshire. 
Housing 
13.66 Our strategic site to the East of Luton is located in Cockernhoe ward. This will 
deliver 2,100 homes over the plan period. The significant majority of these 
homes are included as an allowance towards unmet needs arising from Luton. 
No further local housing allocations are proposed in this area. Five homes 
have been built or granted planning permission within the Cockernhoe ward of 
Offley parish since 2011.

employment generated by the Putteridge Bury campus of the University of 
Bedfordshire. 
13.68 There are likely to be small scale opportunities for additional employment 
development associated with the East of Luton sites, notably in the 
neighbourhood centre. Opportunities for other employment development on 
those sites will be considered through the masterplanning process.

  Codicote 
Introduction 
13.69 The parish of Codicote covers an area much wider than just the village as it 
includes some developed parts of Oaklands (Pottersheath) and areas north of 
Welwyn (Danesbury). It also includes hamlets such as Nup End to the north 
as well as a number of scattered farms. 
13.70 The village of Codicote has a relatively good range of facilities, including a 
school, shops, several public houses, village hall, car repairs garage and a 
church. 
13.71 At the 2011 census the population of the parish was 3,344 and there were 
1,496 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.72 Codicote is one of five villages where a greater amount of development has 
been allocated. The development boundary is shown on the Policies Map to 
indicate the area within which further development will be allowed. The 
boundary has been drawn so as to encompass the existing developed extent 
but also allow for Codicote’s future development needs. 
13.73 The part of Oaklands in Codicote parish is also identified as a Category A 
village under Policy SP2. The rest of the parish is classed as Green Belt. 
Heritage 
13.74 The village has one conservation area covering the linear part of the 
settlement which grew up along the High Street (B656). The wider parish also 
includes parts of the Ayot St Lawrence and Old Knebworth conservation 
areas, and also parts of the Ayot House and Knebworth Park designated 
historic parks and gardens. 
Housing 
13.75 Four sites are allocated in and around Codicote village for an estimated 315 
new homes. A further 97 homes have been built or granted planning 
permission within the parish since 2011.

13.78 The existing 1 FE Codicote school regularly fills most of its available places 
from the local area. Its current site is physically constrained. Expansion of the 
existing primary school is required to accommodate demand from the 
additional residential development within sites CD1, CD2, CD3 and CD5 as 
well as other dwellings that may come forward in Codicote. Expansion of the 
existing primary school will require site CD5 to come forward first to provide 
the land with the other three sites coming forward shortly after to ensure the 
necessary contributions for the expansion are available at the right time. 
13.79 Our transport modelling does not identify a requirement for any specific 
mitigation measures in Codicote. However, there can be localised pinch 
points on the High Street, particularly at peak times or when delays or North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031

13.80 Some minor roads leading to/from Codicote may require mitigation. This 
includes Bury Lane/Park Lane to Old Knebworth and St Albans Road. The 
effects of increased traffic through the village centre could also be offset by 
environmental improvements.  
13.81 Sites in Codicote will need to ensure that any transport assessments

  Graveley and North of Stevenage 
Introduction 
13.83 The parish of Graveley includes the village and the surrounding areas to the 
north and east. This incorporates Jacks Hill, Manor Farm and Chesfield. The 
area to the south abuts the Stevenage Borough Council administrative 
boundary. 
13.84 The village includes a school, two public houses, a village hall and a church. 
At the 2011 census the population of the parish was 487 and there were 198 
dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.85 Graveley is identified as a Category A village. The development boundary is 
shown on the Policies Map to indicate the area within which further 
development will be allowed. The boundary has been drawn so as to 
encompass the existing developed extent but also allow for Graveley’s future 
development needs. 
13.86 Most of the parish is covered by the Green Belt, but the southern part of the 
parish contains the North of Stevenage strategic site and the eastern part of 
the parish contains a site adjoining Great Ashby (discussed on the Great 
Ashby page). 
Heritage 
13.87 The village contains one conservation area, which includes the majority of the 
listed buildings. The parish church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. 
There are also a number of heritage assets in the hamlet of Chesfield, 
including listed buildings and the ruined church of St Etheldreda.  
Housing 
13.88 Our strategic site to the north of Stevenage is located in Graveley parish. One

  Great Ashby and north-east of Stevenage 
Introduction 
13.89 Great Ashby is a relatively new parish, representing the residential area 
adjoining Stevenage. Formerly part of Graveley parish (and a small strip of 
Weston parish), the new parish covers the residential estate adjoining the 
north east Stevenage.  
13.90 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Great Ashby was 5,706 
and there were 2,172 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.91 Great Ashby adjoins Stevenage and so for the purposes of settlement 
hierarchy is considered part of the town.  
Heritage 
13.92 There are no conservation areas or listed buildings within Great Ashby.  
Housing 
13.93 Two sites are allocated in and around Great Ashby for an estimated 930 new 
homes. There have been no new homes built or granted planning permission 
within Great Ashby since 2011.

13.94 The facilities of Great Ashby are designated as a neighbourhood centre under 
Policy SP4. The extent of the neighbourhood centre is shown on the map in 
Appendix 4. Proposals in this area will be considered in accordance with the 
detailed policies of this Plan. 
Infrastructure and mitigation 
13.95 Our Strategic Policies set out the key requirements in relation to the land at 
north-east of Great Ashby (see Policy SP18). 
13.96 School place provision in Great Ashby is a key issue. The existing primary 
school at Round Diamond was built to serve the original development but is 
regularly oversubscribed. This results in some children having to travel further 
afield for their education. 
13.97 Hertfordshire County Council (HCC) have identified expansion potential at 
The Leys Primary School within Stevenage as an option for providing 
additional capacity in the wider north Stevenage and Great Ashby area. 
13.98 Our proposals for site GA2 also require consideration of education provision, 
reserving land to provide a new 2FE primary / 4FE secondary ‘all through’ North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
204 
  school. These measures will ensure sufficient provision to serve Great Ashby 
as a whole. 
13.99 The Stevenage Mobility Strategy aims to significantly increase the proportion 
of journeys undertaken on foot, by bike and by public transport over the plan 
period. Sites on the edge of Stevenage will need to make appropriate 
provision for sustainable modes of transport, and appropriate contributions to 
relevant sustainable travel schemes across the town, to ensure that they meet 
these aims. 
13.100 Our transport modelling does not identify any specific mitigation scheme 
requirements for Great Ashby. There are however local concerns that Back 
Lane, a narrow minor road which leads to Church Lane in Gravely, could be 
used by increased numbers of vehicles leaving the new development sites, 
and that junctions in Graveley itself will suffer from congestion as a result of 
increased flows. These issues are also part of wider network issues 
concerning junction 8 of the A1(M) and alternative routeings to this, which are 
being reviewed by the Council and HCC, and which will propose mitigation 
measures in the area. These will be reflected in future iterations of the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Any transport proposals should consider the 
effects on adjacent networks and communities such as Graveley, and 
propose suitable mitigation; the analysis should also consider cumulative 
impacts.  
13.101 It is also recognised that there are localised highway issues in the area, 
particularly relating to on-street car parking152. The parking issues have 
arisen, in part, as a result of national planning policies in place at the time 
Great Ashby was developed which restricted the amount of off-street car 
parking the District Council could require. These measures, along with wider 
transport and mobility proposals arising from development of the site, will be 
developed in consultation with Hertfordshire County Council and Stevenage 
Borough Council. 
13.102 Some elements of potential solutions to these issues, such as the use of 
Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) to deal with parking issues, lie outside the 
direct control of the planning system and it is therefore not for this Local Plan 
to dictate the most appropriate solution(s). 
13.103 It is recognised that a careful balance needs to be struck between facilitating 
new development, encouraging sustainable travel choices, ensuring safe 
vehicular access throughout Great Ashby, the provision of parking places and 
the need to ensure that any measures which might be implemented do not 
simply displace problems to other less appropriate locations. 
13.104 We will continue to work with the Community Council, Stevenage Borough 
Council and highway authority to determine the most appropriate solution(s). 
Sites in Great Ashby will need to ensure that any transport assessments 
 
152 This also explains why high-level traffic modelling, which will not contain this level of intelligence, 
considers there to be sufficient capacity. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
205 
  appropriately take these matters into account and contribute reasonably to 
any necessary mitigation measures, or wider strategies which may seek to 
address these issues. 
13.105 Our evidence identifies that the three housing allocations proposed to the 
north of Stevenage within the District will generate a requirement for two 
additional GPs. The most appropriate location and format for this provision will 
be determined in consultation with health service providers also having regard 
to existing and proposed patterns of provision within Stevenage. 
13.106 Thames Water have identified that additional wastewater infrastructure 
capacity is likely to be required to support development at Great Ashby. 
Applicants should provide sufficient detail alongside any applications to 
demonstrate that these requirements have been understood and addressed.

  Hitchin 
Introduction 
13.119 Hitchin is one of North Hertfordshire’s main towns. Historically it forms the 
main market town serving the area, and administratively it was the base for 
the Hitchin Rural District Council, which until 1974 covered most of the 
territory which now comprises North Hertfordshire. 
13.120 Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and Baldock lie very close to each other and 
have strong relationships linking them in terms of housing markets and job 
movements. That said, each town retains a distinct identity of its own. The 
needs for development arising from the three towns are comparatively high, 
but the gaps separating the towns are small and of great importance if the 
town’s urban areas and identities are to be kept distinct. Managing growth in 
this relatively developed part of the District whilst allowing each town to retain 
its identity is one of the challenges to be addressed.  
13.121 At the 2011 census the population of Hitchin (defined as the unparished area 
of the town) was 32,731 and there were 14,702 dwellings in the unparished 
area. A further 870 people and 329 dwellings are found in the part of St 
Ippolyts parish which falls within Hitchin Priory ward, giving a combined 
population of 33,601 for the urban area of Hitchin, making it the most 
populous individual urban area in the District, narrowly overtaking Letchworth 
Garden City, which had been larger in the 2001 census. 
13.122 The town has grown over the years and has absorbed the former village of 
Walsworth within its urban area, as well as smaller hamlets such as Bearton 
Green, giving different parts of the modern town different characters. In the 
east of the town Walsworth Common / Purwell Meadows forms a major open 
space along the River Purwell. 
13.123 The town has some small areas of relative deprivation, notably on the 
Westmill estate in the north-west of the town. The Council is working with 
partners to try and regenerate the neighbourhood centre there and improve 
community facilities. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.124 Hitchin is classed as a town under Policy SP2. A settlement boundary is 
defined for the town (shown on the Policies Map), within which new 
development is encouraged. Beyond the settlement boundary is Green Belt. 
Heritage 
13.125 Hitchin developed around its long thin medieval market place, which ran 
parallel to the River Hiz and stretched from Bancroft in the north to Bridge 
Street and Tilehouse Street in the south, adjoining Hitchin Priory. The parish 
church of St Mary’s is between the historic market place and the river. Both 
Hitchin Priory and the parish church of St Mary’s are Grade I listed buildings. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
209 
  13.126 Infilling within the historic market place created the streets of Sun Street and 
Bucklersbury to the south and High Street and Churchyard to the north, 
leaving the smaller area now known as Market Place which forms the visual 
and commercial heart of the town. This area is covered by the Hitchin 
Conservation Area, which also includes some of the early suburban areas, 
notably between Walsworth Road and Wymondley Road which developed 
between the old town and the railway. 
13.127 Separate conservation areas cover the area around Hitchin Station and 
nearby Ransom’s Recreation Ground, Hitchin Hill Path, Butts Close, and the 
hamlet of Charlton to the south-west of the town. 
Housing 
13.128 Seven sites are allocated in and around Hitchin for an estimated 971 new 
homes. The significant majority of these will be built at our Strategic Housing 
Site at Highover Farm. A further 871 homes have been built or granted 
planning permission in Hitchin since 2011.

13.131 Hitchin town centre is the District’s largest town centre. It has a good range of 
shops, with the primary shopping area being largely around Market Place and North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
212 
  along High Street and Bancroft, with secondary shopping areas along 
Hermitage Road, Bucklersbury and Sun Street. 
13.132 The Churchgate Centre and its surrounds make an important contribution to 
the vitality of the town centre. It supports a significant amount of retail 
floorspace, provides the location of Hitchin Market and ensures a large 
quantity of surface level car-parking in easy access of the shops and facilities.  
13.133 However, our evidence also recognises that this area lacks amenity value and 
is largely a negative contribution to the Hitchin Conservation Area and to the 
setting of individual listed buildings153. 
13.134 A need for additional retail floorspace has been recognised by the Council 
and national guidance is clear that, where this is the case, sites should be 
allocated where this need can be met. The retail capacity projections154 are 
district wide and can be met within the district. They are based on the 
projected additional spend on retail from an increased population and 
retaining market shares from competing centres. The capacity projections for 
Hitchin indicate the potential for growth of 11,100 gross sq.m to 2031. Whilst 
the retail projections go to 2031, national planning guidance advises that such 
projections are rarely reliable beyond five years. The Council will monitor such 
projections through the monitoring framework over the plan period to help 
inform decision making on any planning applications that include retail. 
13.135 For allocation purposes, the capacity has been distributed between three of 
the four town centres in the District. Baldock does not have an allocation due 
to no sites being presented as available to the Council.  
13.136 Our evidence sees the Churchgate Centre and the surrounding area as a 
location where up to 4,000 gross sq.m of additional retail floorspace could be 
provided as part of a comprehensive mixed-use redevelopment across the 
entire allocated site. Redevelopment of this area at a suitable scale and 
reflecting the historic properties of Hitchin town centre has the potential to 
enhance the character, appearance and significance of this area. 
13.137 Paynes Park could deliver up to 3,000 gross sq.m additional retail floorspace 
and overall the remaining potential retail capacity for Hitchin of 4,100 gross 
sq.m will need to be met on a district wide basis. The retail study briefing 
note155 indicates in its summary table that by 2031 the District as a whole will 
have effectively met its current capacity projections.  
13.138 A concept framework / masterplan will be initiated by the District Council to 
address the requirements of Policies HT11 and HT12. It will consider existing 
and potential land uses, capacities for development and place-making. It will 
illustrate the disposition and connectivity of current and potential land uses 
including retail; employment/commercial; housing; community facilities; 
formal/informal public open space; the market; links to car parks, bus stops,

 Grove Road; North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
215 
   Nightingale Road; 
 Ninesprings; 
 Redhill Road; 
 Walsworth Road;

 Westmill (John Barker Place). 
13.144 The extent of these centres is shown on the maps in Appendix 3.  
Infrastructure and mitigation 
13.145 Our Strategic Policies set out the key requirements in relation to the land at 
Highover Farm (see Policy SP17). 
13.146 This includes a presumption in favour of an on-site primary school. The 
cumulative demand arising from the remaining sites within Hitchin will create 
further demand for additional school places. 
13.147 Land at Bearton Green was identified as a reserve school site in the previous 
local plan. This is currently used as a detached playing field by William 
Ransom Primary to allow the school to expand. This land could be used to 
facilitate expansion of other existing primary schools by providing detached 
playing fields. 
13.148 Hertfordshire County Council will need to undertake further work to 
understand the dynamics of school place allocations within Hitchin and to 
identify the most appropriate location(s) to make any additional primary school 
provision. 
13.149 Some expansion of existing secondary schools is considered feasible. This 
Plan removes the Priory School from the Green Belt to facilitate additional 
provision where this is considered the most suitable approach.  
13.150 Our transport modelling identifies that a number of junction improvement 
schemes will be required in Hitchin by 2031: 
 A505 Cambridge Road / Willian Road / Woolgrove Road 
 A505 Upper Tilehouse Street / B655 Pirton Road  
 A505 & A602 Paynes Park 
 A602 / B656 / Gosmore Road 
 Cadwell Lane / Wilbury Way / Woolgrove Road 
13.151 A number of these highway mitigation schemes are on the routes of the A505 
and A602 as they pass through the town. It is notable from the transport work 
that the majority of these schemes would be required even if no further 
development was being proposed through this Plan. 
13.152 All schemes in Hitchin will be required to make reasonable contributions 
towards the funding of these works and to walking and cycling schemes in North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
216 
  Hitchin which aim to influence mode share and free up capacity for new 
development. In some cases, existing traffic or background growth may result 
in junction capacity issues, and new development will further increase these 
problems. However any additional capacity developed to resolve existing or 
background growth issues will also be taken up by new development, and 
appropriate contributions are therefore likely to be required. 
13.153 Any highway mitigation scheme at the A602 / B656 / Gosmore Road 
roundabout will need to consider the effects upon the Air Quality Management 
Area which has been declared on the approach to this junction. 
13.154 Anglian Water recognise that there is capacity within the environmental 
consent for Hitchin Water Recycling Centre to accommodate planned growth 
in the town. Local upgrades may be required for certain schemes, notably site 
HT2. The need for such upgrades will be determined at the planning 
application stage when Anglian Water is approached by the developer.

  Holwell 
Introduction 
13.155 Holwell is a small parish on the border with Bedfordshire. Until 1897 it was 
part of Bedfordshire. The parish contains the village of Holwell and the 
surrounding rural area. There is a village hall and church, but little else by way 
of facilities. 
13.156 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Holwell was 361 and there 
were 164 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.157 Holwell is defined as a Category B village within which infilling development 
that does not extend the built up area into the surrounding countryside will be 
allowed. The whole parish is classed as Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt. 
Housing 
13.158 There are no sites allocated for residential development in Holwell. 30 homes 
have been built or granted planning permission since 2011.

  Ickleford 
Introduction 
13.159 Ickleford lies to the north of Hitchin. Apart from the village the parish includes 
some scattered farms and tracts of countryside. The village of Ickleford has a 
relatively good range of facilities, including a school, shops, public houses, 
village hall and church. 
13.160 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Ickleford was 1,833 and 
there were 844 dwellings in the parish.   
13.161 The civil parish extends north to the District and county boundary with 
neighbouring Central Bedfordshire. The area at the north of Ickleford parish is 
considered under a specific section of this chapter on Lower Stondon. This is 
the settlement within Central Bedfordshire that immediately adjoins North 
Hertfordshire. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.162 Ickleford is identified as one of five villages where a greater amount of 
development has been allocated. The development boundary of Ickleford is 
shown on the Policies Map to indicate the area within which further 
development will be allowed. Most of the rest of the parish is classed as 
Green Belt, save a small area in the far north of the parish on the 
Bedfordshire border which is rural area beyond the Green Belt. 
Heritage 
13.163 Ickleford has one conservation area which covers the central area of the 
village, covering the two greens (Upper Green and Lower Green) between 
which the village grew. The parish church of St Katherine’s is a Grade I listed 
building. 
Housing 
13.164 Three sites are allocated around the edge of Ickleford village for an estimated 
199 new homes. 36 further new homes have been built or granted planning 
permission since 2011.

Infrastructure and mitigation 
13.165 Our transport modelling work does not identify any specific mitigation works 
that are required on the Ickleford road network. Development here will, 
however, contribute toward traffic generation within Hitchin and appropriate 
contributions will be sought towards identified schemes in the town. Any 
transport assessments for sites in Ickleford should also consider the junction 
of the A600 and Turnpike Lane, where improved facilities for pedestrians and 
cyclists may mitigate higher traffic volumes.  
13.166 Site IC3 will require the creation of a new access onto the A600 Bedford 
Road. The most appropriate solution, along with any consequential works – 
such as changes to speed limits entering / exiting the village from / to the 
north – will be explored through transport assessments. 
13.167 Ickleford Primary is a 1FE school. However, it is located on a constrained site. 
The school premises lie partially within the conservation area and the original 
school building is listed. There is no capacity to expand within the current site 
but the advantages of keeping the school at the historic centre of the village 
are recognised in both functional and heritage terms. 
13.168 As well as serving Ickleford, the school also admits pupils from northern 
Hitchin as well as outlying rural areas and settlements. The amount of 
development proposed for Ickleford may result in a need for additional primary 
school provision. However, it is not possible to say at this point exactly how or 
when this provision might be needed. The additional demand created by new North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
221 
  development in Ickleford may be offset, either in whole or in part, by changes 
to school admission patterns outside of the village. 
13.169 Site IC3 reserves sufficient land to provide a new primary school of up to 2FE 
should this prove necessary. This would allow for the relocation of the existing 
school and / or additional provision to meet requirements arising from new 
development if this is determined to be the most appropriate solution. The 
Council will work with the school, Hertfordshire County Council and other 
stakeholders as required to monitor the demand for school places. All options 
for the retention of the existing school in its current form, its expansion within 
or adjoining its existing site or splitting provision across the two sites will be 
fully explored before any decision is taken to relocate Ickleford Primary to the 
reserve site within IC3. 
13.170 In considering this issue, regard will need to be given to the nature of the 
existing school’s catchment, the relationship with other schools on the 
northern edges of Hitchin and the most desirable format(s) for delivering 
primary education in the village. 
13.171 Anglian Water consider there is capacity in the relevant treatment works to 
support the level of growth proposed. There have been local incidents of 
sewer flooding and all sites will be required to robustly assess wastewater 
drainage requirements. 
13.172 Hertfordshire County Council, as minerals planning authority, has identified a 
potential resource block (and associated buffer) to the north of Hitchin. Sites 
IC2 and IC3 lie within these areas. These sites will be subject to consultation 
with the mineral planning authority to determine whether prior extraction or 
any other relevant measure is necessary to avoid sterilisation of any minerals 
resource.

 Kelshall 
Introduction 
13.173 Kelshall is a small village in hilly country to the south-west of Royston. It is 
one of a group of villages established by the Saxons along the line of the 
chalk ridge from Baldock to Royston. 
13.174 Kelshall has a village hall and church but few other facilities. 
13.175 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Kelshall was 163 and there 
were 65 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.176 Kelshall has limited facilities and is identified as a Category B village within 
which infilling development which does not extend the built up area of the 
village into the surrounding countryside will be allowed. 
Housing 
13.177 No sites are allocated in Kelshall for residential development. Four new 
homes have been built or granted planning permission in the parish since 
2011.

 Kimpton 
Introduction 
13.178 Kimpton parish is on the south-western edge of the District. The village of 
Kimpton has a relatively good range of facilities, including a school, shop, 
public houses, village hall and church. Apart from the village itself, the parish 
also includes the smaller settlements of Peters Green and Blackmore End as 
well as some scattered farms and a wide tract of countryside. 
13.179 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Kimpton was 2,167 and 
there were 884 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.180 Kimpton is identified as a Category A village under policy SP2. It has been 
excluded from the Green Belt with its settlement boundary being shown on 
the Policies Map. Blackmore End is classed as a Category B settlement. It 
has also been excluded from the Green Belt and infilling development that 
does not extend the built up area into the surrounding countryside will be 
permitted. Peters Green is a Category C settlement. Development here will be 
restricted to limited affordable housing and facilities for local community needs 
in accordance with our detailed policies. 
Heritage 
13.181 Kimpton has two conservation areas. Kimpton Village covers the eastern part 
of the village around the church and green, and Kimpton Bottom lies at the 
western end of the village. The parish church of St Peter and St Paul is a 
Grade I listed building.

important role in providing local employment and facilities. The Council will 
therefore seek to protect the employment function of this area under policy 
ETC4: Employment development outside employment areas. 
Infrastructure and mitigation 
13.184 There are known flooding issues in Kimpton, from both surface water and 
groundwater, particularly along Claggy Road which acts as a flood route into 
the High Street. Development in Kimpton will be required to achieve the 
equivalent of greenfield run off rates to ensure existing issues are not 
exacerbated.

 Knebworth 
Introduction 
13.193 Knebworth parish lies on the southern edge of the District between Stevenage 
and Welwyn. The village of Knebworth has a good range of facilities including 
a railway station, school, doctors and dentists, library, a range of shops, 
village hall and churches. The railway and A1(M) both cross the parish. East 
of the A1(M) is Knebworth village, which grew up around Knebworth Station. 
West of the A1(M) is Old Knebworth, adjoining the Knebworth House estate. 
Apart from the two villages the parish also includes the Knebworth House 
parkland and surrounding countryside. 
13.194 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Knebworth was 4,496 and 
there were 2,002 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.195 Knebworth is identified one of five villages where a greater amount of 
development has been allocated. It is excluded from the Green Belt with a 
settlement boundary shown on the Policies Map. General development will be 
permitted in this area. The rest of the parish is designated Green Belt. Old 
Knebworth is identified as a Category B village within the Green Belt where 
limited infilling will be allowed. 
Heritage 
13.196 Knebworth village has moved twice. The original village was in what is now 
Knebworth Park, clustered around the parish church of St Mary and St 
Thomas. The church, which is a Grade I listed building, now stands alone in 
the park, after one of the owners of Knebworth House moved the village to 
enlarge the park. The village’s new location was what is now called Old 
Knebworth. The settlement now called Knebworth grew up around the railway 
station a little way to the east of Old Knebworth. 
13.197 Knebworth has three conservation areas. The Old Knebworth Conservation 
Area covers that village, whilst the Deards End Lane and Stockens Green 
conservation areas cover suburban parts of the main village with particular 
distinctive characteristics. Knebworth Park is designated as a historic park 
and garden. The smaller Homewood estate, built as the dower house to 
Knebworth House, is also a designated historic park and garden. 
Housing 
13.198 This Plan identifies three local housing allocations within Knebworth for an 
estimated 584 new homes. A further 175 homes have already been built or 
granted planning permission within the parish. This includes development 
adjoining the southern edge of Stevenage Borough.

currently one primary school in Knebworth to the east of the High Street. This 
takes 60 Reception aged pupils each year. In recent years, school places 
have been filled by local children and the catchment is relatively tightly drawn. 
13.201 Land will be reserved within Site KB2 to provide an additional primary school 
that will meet the needs arising from new development at the west of 
Knebworth and provide capacity to serve some existing residential areas. 
Land at the south-east of the KB2 allocation is most suited for this provision 
which should additionally seek to maximise the distance of the school from 
the A1(M). 
13.202 There is currently no secondary education provision in Knebworth. Pupils 
travel to a variety of schools in Hitchin, Stevenage and Welwyn Garden City.  
13.203 Making smaller-scale secondary provision may be an appropriate solution 
which meets future needs, benefits existing residents and provides a more 
sustainable approach. 
13.204 It is currently anticipated that any secondary school provision in Knebworth 
will not be required until the late 2020s at the very earliest. To ensure an 
appropriately sized site can be made available, land to the north of Watton 
Lane at the east of the village is reserved for this purpose. We will continue to 
work with Hertfordshire County Council, the Parish Council, the landowner 
and Knebworth Primary School to monitor long-term education needs across 
the Stevenage School Place Planning Area and explore the most appropriate 
education solution for this site. 
13.205 Our transport modelling does not identify any specific mitigation scheme 
requirements for Knebworth. However, the high street, including the junction 
of Stevenage Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known 
pinch point, particularly when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the 
B197 being used as an alternate route between Welwyn Garden City and 
Stevenage. There are also issues of poor pedestrian/cycle access along 
Station Road under the railway line, and similar issues at Gun Lane and new 
development will be expected to identify any necessary improvements to 
walking/cycling conditions in these locations and make reasonable 
contributions to secure their delivery. NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
231 
 13.206 Some of the capacity issues here arise from the way in which the local 
highway is managed and in particular, the provision of short-stay on-street 
parking adjacent to the shops156. 
13.207 Highway management measures, such as the use of Traffic Regulation 
Orders (TROs), lie outside the direct control of the planning system and it is 
therefore not for this Local Plan to dictate the most appropriate solution(s). 
13.208 It is recognised that a careful balance needs to be struck between ensuring 
the continued vitality of the local centre, providing access to local facilities and 
supporting the new development planned for Knebworth. We will continue to 
work outside of the local plan process to identify and implement the most 
appropriate future strategy. 
13.209 Sites in Knebworth will need to ensure that any transport assessments 
appropriately take these issues into account and contribute reasonably to any 
necessary mitigation measures, or wider strategies which may seek to 
address these issues. 
13.210 Planning permission has been granted for a new library, doctors’ surgery and 
pharmacy on the site of the current library within the identified village centre. 
13.211 Knebworth lies within the Thames Water area with wastewater draining to 
their facility at Rye Meads near Hoddesdon. Previous work identifies that this 
treatment works should have sufficient capacity to handle all planned 
development within its catchment until at least 2026 with a reasonable 
prospect of being able to accommodate development to 2031. 
13.212 However, it is also recognised that there are constraints in the infrastructure 
connecting to Rye Meads and capacity from Knebworth is an issue that has 
been identified. Scheme promoters should work with Thames Water, and 
together, to identify the likely nature of infrastructure required to ensure this 
can be programmed appropriately. 
  
 
156 This also explains why high-level traffic modelling, which will not contain this level of intelligence, 
considers there to be sufficient capacity. NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031

 Langley 
Introduction 
13.213 Langley is one of the District’s smaller parishes. Historically it was part of the 
parish of Hitchin, becoming a separate civil parish in 1894. The parish of 
Langley has no meaningful facilities. Apart from the small village of Langley 
the parish also includes a wide tract of countryside and some scattered farms. 
13.214 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Langley was 175 and there 
were 71 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.215 Langley is identified as a Category C settlement, within which only limited 
additional development will only be allowed to meet defined local needs. The 
parish is classed as Green Belt, apart from a small area which falls within the 
land west of Stevenage which is safeguarded for potential long-term 
development by Policy SP8. 
Housing 
13.216 No sites are allocated in Langley for residential development. Seven new 
homes have been built or granted planning permission since 2011.

 Letchworth Garden City 
Introduction 
13.217 Letchworth is the world’s first garden city based on Ebenezer Howard’s 
original concept of a self contained settlement combining both town and 
country living. Much of the town is the product of a Master Plan, with areas of 
low, medium and higher density housing, industry, open space and the town 
centre in broadly separate land uses with attractively planned landscapes. 
Large open spaces are integrated into the town’s layout, notably at Norton 
Common and Howard Park and Gardens. 
13.218 The original masterplan for the garden city was focussed on the area between 
the three parallel roads of Wilbury Road / Norton Road in the north, Icknield 
Way across the middle of the area, and Hitchin Road / Baldock Road (the 
A505) to the south. After the Second World War development spread beyond 
the original masterplan, with the Grange estate to the north and the 
Jackmans, Lordship and Manor Park estates to the south. 
13.219 The town’s administrative boundaries also include the three villages of Willian, 
Norton and the old village of Letchworth, which were the three pre-garden city 
parishes covering the area. Today Willian remains a distinct village, being 
slightly separated from the urban area of Letchworth by one or two thin fields. 
Norton abuts the urban area with no clear point where Norton ends and the 
garden city begins. The old village of Letchworth, which stretched from St 
Mary’s Church and Letchworth Hall up the length of Letchworth Lane to the 
corner shop on Baldock Road, is effectively absorbed within the urban area of 
the garden city. 
13.220 At the 2011 census the population of Letchworth Garden City (including 
Willian and Norton) was 33,249 and there were 14,271 dwellings in the 
town157. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.221 Letchworth Garden City is the District’s second largest urban area, with only 
slightly fewer people than neighbouring Hitchin. Letchworth has largely grown 
to fill most of the space between Hitchin and Baldock, leaving little room for 
further growth that does not erode the separation between those towns. North 
and south of the town are the villages of Stotfold (in Central Bedfordshire) and 
Willian. A settlement boundary is defined for the town (shown on the Policies 
Map) within which new development is encouraged. Beyond the settlement 
boundary is Green Belt. 
 
 
157 At the time of the 2011 census this was the area of the Letchworth Garden City parish, which has 
subsequently been abolished. The area is the same as the combined five Letchworth wards on 
NHDC. NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
234 
 Heritage 
13.222 As the world’s first garden city, the importance of the original design and 
layout of the Garden City is recognised in the two conservation area 
designations, Letchworth and Croft Lane. There are many listed buildings in 
the town. There are also conservation areas for the old villages of Willian and 
Norton. 
13.223 The Broadway and Broadway Gardens are designated as a historic park and 
garden, as is Howard Park and Gardens. 
13.224 New development within Letchworth Garden City will need to demonstrate 
how it accords with the Letchworth Garden City Design Principles as set out in 
Appendix 5. 
Housing 
13.225 Twelve sites are allocated in Letchworth for an estimated 1,485 additional 
dwellings. A further 693 homes have been built or granted planning 
permission since 2011 and the town will see more than 2,000 new homes built 
over the plan period.

13.227 Letchworth has the second largest town centre in the District as identified on 
the Policies Map. The town centre contains both primary and secondary 
frontage located in the main retail area around Eastcheap, Leys Avenue, 
Station Road and the Garden Square shopping centre. These areas will be 
defined on the Policies Map. 
13.228 A need for additional retail floorspace has been recognised by the Council 
and national guidance is clear that, where this is the case, sites should be 
allocated where this need can be met. The retail capacity projections159 are 
district wide and can be met within the District. They are based on the 
projected additional spend on retail from an increased population and 
retaining market shares from competing centres. The capacity projections for 
Letchworth indicate the potential for growth of 9,200 gross sq.m to 2031. 
Whilst the retail projections go to 2031, national planning guidance advises 
that such projections are rarely reliable beyond five years. The Council will 
monitor such projections through the monitoring framework over the plan 
period to help inform decision making on any planning applications that 
include retail.   
13.229 For allocation purposes, the capacity has been distributed between three of 
the four town centres in the District. Baldock does not have an allocation due 
to no sites being presented as available to the Council.  
13.230 Letchworth has the potential capacity to meet wider District needs, 
recapturing trade that is currently diverted to Hitchin. There are a number of

13.231 The allocation of sites LG19, LG20 and LG21 will not prejudice other re-
development proposals, which would be of benefit to the vibrancy and vitality 
of the town centre; taking into consideration of the Local Plan as a whole. 
13.232 The Letchworth Garden City Town Centre Strategy review will commence 
within twelve months of the adoption of this plan, which working with NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
241 
 landowners, the local community, the Business Improvement District and 
other key stakeholders will consider up-to-date retail projections and if growth 
is still required, how to accommodate that growth. 
13.233 The schemes will be main town centre uses led. Consequently, no specific 
housing allocation or requirement is identified, and any residential units here 
will contribute towards the windfall / other allowances identified in Policy 
SP8(c) of this Plan. The projected additional 50 homes in the housing 
trajectory for Letchworth Garden City are expected to be completed within the 
broad location defined as the Town Centre Boundary on the Policies Map. 
13.234 Policy SP4: Town and Local Centres identifies two neighbourhood centres in 
Letchworth. Proposals in these areas will be determined using our detailed 
policies. The centres are: 
 Jackmans; and 
 The Grange. 
13.235 The extent of these neighbourhood centres is shown on the maps in Appendix 
3. 
Infrastructure and mitigation 
13.236 The provision of more than 2,000 homes across Letchworth Garden City will 
require a range of supporting infrastructure.  
13.237 Our strategic policy for the land north of Letchworth (see Policy SP15) sets 
out a range of matters that will need to be considered. The cumulative 
impacts of a number of smaller developments across the town will also need 
to be addressed. 
13.238 Any further primary school places that are required in addition to the proposed 
new school north of Letchworth will be met through expansions. Hertfordshire 
County Council have confirmed that the expansion of Fearnhill School can 
meet demand for additional secondary school places beyond 2028.  
13.239 Our transport modelling identifies two specific junctions where works will be 
required to support traffic growth in Letchworth Garden City over the plan 
period: 
 A505 / Norton Way; and 
 Junction 9 of the A1(M), known locally as Letchworth Gate 
13.240 It is notable from the transport work that both of these schemes would be 
required even if the development being proposed through this Plan did not 
occur. 
13.241 New development in Letchworth will be required to make reasonable 
contributions towards these projects and / or other schemes in nearby 
locations (see Baldock and Hitchin sections of this chapter in particular) where NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
242 
 traffic generation arising from new development will have an impact. In 
addition, contributions will be required towards walking and cycling schemes 
in Letchworth which aim to influence mode share and free up capacity for new 
development. 
13.242 However, appropriate funding arrangements will need to be made. These 
need to reflect the fact that background traffic growth triggers the 
requirements with new development then utilising some of the additional 
capacity that would be provided. 
13.243 This issue should be explored further through the transport assessments that 
will accompany any planning applications on these sites. This will help to 
determine the most appropriate approach, and any other local measures 
which may be required, on a case-by-case basis. 
13.244 Anglian Water have previously identified that there is sufficient capacity within 
the environmental consent at Letchworth Water Recycling Centre to 
accommodate the levels of growth being proposed.

 Newnham 
Introduction 
13.256 Newnham is a small parish to the north of Baldock, containing village of 
Newnham and the surrounding countryside. Newnham shares a parish 
council with the neighbouring small parish of Caldecote. 
13.257 Population statistics are not available for Newnham separately due to its small 
size. The combined population of the three parishes of Caldecote, Newnham 
and Radwell at the 2011 census was 209 and there were 97 dwellings across 
the three parishes. 
13.258 Newnham has a village hall and church, but little else by way of facilities. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.259 Newnham is identified as a Category B village, where infilling development 
will be allowed which does not extend the built up area of the village into 
surrounding countryside. Most of the parish (including the village) is classed 
as Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt, except the southernmost part of the 
parish which is within the Green Belt.

 Nuthampstead 
Introduction 
13.262 Nuthampstead is a small parish located in the far east of the District, to the 
south east of Royston. Historically it was part of the parish of Barkway, 
becoming a separate civil parish in 1866. The area is characterised by thick 
woodland and rich farmland and is on the county boundary with Essex. 
Nuthampstead’s dwellings are grouped in the hamlets of Nuthampstead and 
Morrice Green. Apart from a pub at Nuthampstead there is little by way of 
facilities. 
13.263 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Nuthampstead was 142 
and there were 52 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.264 Nuthampstead is identified as a Category C settlement, within which only 
limited additional development to meet community needs will be permitted. 
The parish is classed as Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt, within which 
there is general restraint on development. 
Housing 
13.265 No sites are allocated in Nuthampstead for residential development. No new 
homes have been built or granted planning permission since 2011. 
Economy 
13.266 In terms of the economy of the local area, there are, unusually for this size of 
settlement, two industrial areas in the parish providing premises for a range of 
businesses. These are not sufficiently large to designate as an employment 
area, but do perform an important role in providing local employment and

 Royston 
Introduction 
13.292 Royston lies in a shallow bowl set in the East Anglian Heights chalk 
escarpment, overlooking and bounded by the Cambridgeshire Plain to the 
north. At the time of the 2011 census the town had a population of 15,781 and 
there were 6,800 dwellings in the town. Development of the town has tended 
to be informed by the busy roads running through and around the town and 
the Cambridge to London railway line which bisects the town. 
13.293 The town historically straddled Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire; the original 
county boundary was Icknield Way. The town did not exist at the time of the 
Domesday Book. Instead it appears to have been founded in the medieval 
period and did not become a separate parish until 1540. Prior to that it 
straddled the parishes of Barkway, Reed and Therfield (in Hertfordshire) and 
Melbourn and Bassingbourn (in Cambridgeshire). The boundary was last 
changed as recently as 1989 after the construction of the A505 bypass. 
13.294 On the south-western edge of Royston is Therfield Heath, which forms an 
important open heathland. As well as providing open space for the town it is a 
rare chalk grassland habitat, and is protected as a Site of Special Scientific 
Interest and a Local Nature Reserve. Therfield Heath is also recognised for its 
historic and archaeological importance. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.295 Royston is the third largest of the four towns in North Hertfordshire when 
measured by population. The relative isolation of the town means that it plays 
an important service role for many of the surrounding villages in both 
Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire. A settlement boundary is defined for the 
town (shown on the Policies Map) within which additional development will be 
allowed. 
Heritage 
13.296 The town grew up around the crossroads of Icknield Way and Ermine Street, 
although the market place is not at the crossroads itself but to the south-east. 
One theory as to why the market is not at the crossroads is that Ermine Street 
originally approached the town from the south-east along Grange Bottom, 
avoiding the steepest parts of the hill to the south, and that the present line of 
High Street / London Road is a result of medieval realignments. The town 
centre is covered by a conservation area. 
13.297 The parish church of St John’s is a Grade I listed building, being originally the 
church of an Augustinian Priory, becoming the parish church after the 
dissolution of the monasteries. The Old Palace at 23 Kneesworth Street, 18 
Melbourn Street and Royston Cave are also Grade I listed buildings. NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
255 
 13.298 Therfield Heath contains Scheduled Ancient Monuments due to the presence 
of prehistoric barrows. The round barrow cemetery is the largest known 
example of its type in Hertfordshire, and provides important information on the 
beliefs and social organisation of early prehistoric communities. 
Housing 
13.299 Four sites are allocated in Royston for almost 500 new homes. 1,421 further 
homes have been built or granted planning permission since 2011. This

which will be defined on the Policies Map for the main retail area around the 
High Street, Market Hill, Lower King Street and Melbourn Street.  
13.304 A need for additional retail floorspace has been recognised by the Council 
and national guidance is clear that, where this is the case, sites should be 
allocated where this need can be met. The retail capacity projections160 are 
district wide and can be met within the District. They are based on the 
projected additional spend on retail from an increased population and 
retaining market shares from completing centres. The capacity projections for 
Royston indicate the potential for growth of 7,100 gross sq.m to 2031. Whilst 
the retail projections go to 2031, national planning guidance warns that such 
projections are rarely reliable beyond five years. The Council will monitor such 
projections through the monitoring framework over the plan period to help 
inform decision making on any planning applications that include retail.   
13.305 For allocation purposes, the capacity has been distributed between three of 
the four town centres in the District. Baldock does not have an allocation due 
to no sites being presented as available to the Council.

13.308 More than 1,000 homes are planned for Royston over the period 2011-2031. 
This will require the provision of supporting infrastructure. 
13.309 The A505 Royston Bypass provides the most appropriate, settlement 
boundary to the north of the town. This requires the removal of some land 
within the bypass, but beyond the existing and proposed employment areas, 
which should generally remain undeveloped. Our detailed policies set out the 
approach we will take to areas of Urban Open Land. 
13.310 Hertfordshire County Council has recently provided additional First School 
capacity within the town. As a consequence, it is considered that existing first

Particular congestion points identified included: 
 A505/ A10 Roundabout; 
 A505/ A1198 Roundabout; and 
 A10/ Newmarket Road/ Melbourn Street Roundabout 
13.313 In line with the Transport Strategy, development in Royston will be required to 
consider the implications of their schemes on these locations and make 
reasonable contributions towards improvements and / or other schemes 
improving walking and cycling in Royston which aim to influence mode share. 
These will be reflected in future iterations of the Infrastructure Development 
Plan. 
13.314 There are known capacity constraints in the wastewater treatment works at 
Royston161. Specific evidence has been prepared to help identify potential 
solutions. We will work together with developers and Anglian Water to ensure 
sufficient capacity is available for new developments to proceed. Where 
appropriate ‘Grampian conditions’ – which prevent development from 
occurring until such as time as specific conditions are met – will be used. 
13.315 For site RY4, an odour assessment will need to demonstrate that a suitable 
distance is provided between the Water Recycling Centre and sensitive

includes Gosmore and the southern part of the urban area of Hitchin. The 
parish includes a significant rural area, especially to the south of the village. 
13.327 Whilst St Ippolyts and Gosmore are perceived as separate villages, it is hard 
to say where one ends and the other begins. The core of St Ippolyts is around 
the church on the hill to the east and the core of Gosmore is along Gosmore 
High Street to the west, but the largely developed area between the two has 
an ambiguous identity with some properties having St Ippolyts postal 
addresses and others having Gosmore postal addresses. Facilities in this 
conjoined pair of villages include a school, shop, public houses, village hall 
and church. 
13.328 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of St Ippolyts was 2,047 and 
there were 799 dwellings in the parish. Of these, 870 people and 329

 Wallington 
Introduction 
13.345 Wallington is a small village to the east of Baldock. It shares a parish council 
with neighbouring Rushden, but remains a separate parish. The village has a 
village hall and church, but little else by way of facilities. The parish also 
includes the surrounding countryside. 
13.346 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Wallington was 150 and 
there were 60 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.347 Wallington is classed as a Category B village, where infilling development that 
does not extend the built core of the village will be allowed. Most of the parish 
is classed as Rural Area beyond the Green Belt, except a small area on the 
western edge of the parish which is Green Belt. 
Heritage 
13.348 The Wallington Conservation Area covers most of the village. 
Housing 
13.349 There are no sites allocated for residential development in Wallington. Two 
new homes have been built or granted planning permission since 2011.

 Weston 
Introduction 
13.350 Weston is a medium sized village to the south of Baldock. The parish is large, 
stretching from the southern edges of Baldock down to the north-eastern 
edges of Stevenage at Great Ashby. The village sites on a plateau, which 
drops sharply away on the edge of Baldock as the Weston Hills. 
13.351 The village has a school, shop, village hall, public house and church, and 
some small businesses. Beside the main village the parish also includes the 
hamlet of Halls Green (also with a public house) and several other smaller 
hamlets and isolated farms and dwellings. 
13.352 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Weston was 1,054 and 
there were 441 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.353 Weston is classed as a Category A village, with a settlement boundary 
defined on the Policies Map within which additional development will be 
allowed. In the south of the parish site GA2 at Great Ashby is mostly in 
Weston parish. Most of the rest of the parish is classed as Green Belt, apart 
from the eastern edges of the parish which are classed as rural area beyond 
the Green Belt. 
Heritage 
13.354 The Weston Conservation Area covers the older parts of the village. The 
parish church of Holy Trinity is a Grade I listed building. 
Housing 
13.355 One site is allocated in Weston for an estimated 40 new homes. A further 
eight new homes have been built or granted planning permission.

 Wymondley 
Introduction 
13.357 Wymondley is a parish to the east of Hitchin. It was created in 1937 by the 
merger of the two former parishes of Great Wymondley and Little Wymondley. 
Despite the names, Little Wymondley has long been the more populous, 
overtaking Great Wymondley between the 1851 and 1861 censuses.  
13.358 As well as the villages of Great and Little Wymondley the parish includes the 
hamlets of Titmore Green, Redcoats Green and Todds Green. The parish 
also includes the surrounding rural area, stretching from the edges of Hitchin 
in the north to the edges of Stevenage in the south. 
13.359 Great Wymondley has a public house, village hall and church. Little 
Wymondley has a school, non-food shop, churches and public houses. 
13.360 At the 2011 census the population of the parish of Wymondley was 1,153 and 
there were 480 dwellings in the parish. 
Role in settlement hierarchy 
13.361 Little Wymondley is one of five villages where a greater amount of 
development has been allocated. The settlement boundary is shown on the 
Policies Map within which additional development will be allowed.  
13.362 Great Wymondley is classed as a Category B village, where infilling that does 
not extend the built core of the village into the surrounding countryside will be 
allowed. 
13.363 In the south of the parish is part of the West of Stevenage site. This land is 
safeguarded for long-term potential development by Policy SP8. The 
remainder of the parish is classed as Green Belt.  
Heritage 
13.364 A conservation area covers most of Great Wymondley village. Wymondley 
Bury, The Priory and the parish church of St Mary at Great Wymondley are all 
Grade I listed buildings. 
Housing 
13.365 One site is allocated in Wymondley for an estimated 300 additional homes. 31 
further homes have been built or granted planning permission in the parish 
since 2011.

13.366 Wymondley has a number of small businesses, notably along Stevenage 
Road in Little Wymondley. This is not sufficiently large to designate as an 
employment area, but does perform an important role in providing local 
employment and facilities. The Council will therefore seek to protect the 
employment function of this area under the detailed policies of this Plan. 
Infrastructure and mitigation  
13.367 Wymondley JMI School is currently 0.5FE but has the potential to expand to 
1FE on the existing site. There is also the opportunity to explore moving the 
school to a new site within the land south of Little Wymondley. However, this 
would result in some existing residents having to travel further to school 
across Stevenage Road. This issue should be explored through any 
application. 
13.368 Our transport modelling identifies the junction between Hitchin Road and Arch 
Road in Great Wymondley as a location where a mitigation scheme will be 
required to support new development. Some minor roads leading to and from 
the villages within Wymondley parish may require other traffic management 
measures which will also need to be investigated and will be reflected in 
future iterations of the Infrastructure Development Plan. Mitigation could 
include environmental improvements to the village centre. The mitigation of 
these issues will be part of the wider package of measures identified through 
the wider consideration of network issues concerning A1(M) J8 and alternate 
routeings to this. 
13.369 Any development on site WY1 will need to make appropriate contributions, 
recognising that developments in Hitchin, Letchworth and, to a lesser degree, 
Stevenage are all likely to contribute to traffic movements through this 
junction. 
13.370 Anglian Water recognise that improvements to wastewater infrastructure may 
be required to support the proposed development.  
13.371 There are known flooding issues in Wymondley from both surface and river 
fluvial flooding. The key flood route broadly follows the alignment of 
Stevenage Road with an additional surface water flood route along Priory 
Lane. Hertfordshire County Council Wymondley Flood Investigation Report, 
November 2014, makes recommendations to reduce the risk of flooding along NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
273 
 Stevenage Road. These recommendations relate to measures upstream and 
outside of the site. However, implementation of an appropriate flood 
attenuation scheme on the site may support these measures and benefit the 
village by reducing the overall flooding risk. 
13.372 Any development to the south of Little Wymondley will be required to achieve 
the equivalent of greenfield run off rates to ensure existing issues are not 
exacerbated. Opportunities will also be sought to alleviate existing problems. 
13.373 The A602 Wymondley Bypass provides the most appropriate, defensible 
Green Belt boundary to the south of the village. This requires the removal of 
some land from the Green Belt that lies within the bypass but which should 
generally remain undeveloped. Our detailed policies set out the approach we 
will take to areas of Urban Open Land.

 SECTION FIVE - IMPLEMENTATION 
MONITORING AND REVIEW 
14 Delivery 
14.1 One of the key tests that the Local Plan must meet is to ensure that it is 
effective. This means that it should be capable of being delivered within the 
plan period and based on effective joint working on cross-boundary strategic 
priorities. This section demonstrates how this will be achieved through 
implementation and monitoring. 
Implementation  
14.2 Alongside the Council there are many organisations that will contribute 
towards the delivery of the aims of the Local Plan. For example: 
 Hertfordshire County Council  has a significant role to play in relation to 
education and highways alongside other functions;  
 North Hertfordshire Homes  and other providers in relation to the delivery 
of affordable housing;  
 The health authorities  will need to ensure there are the right medical 
facilities at the right time;  
 the water companies  and the Environment Agency  in relation to water 
supply and treatment; 
 The development industry  will play a significant role in bringing 
development forward, together with the provision of or contribution towards 
infrastructure alongside other forms of funding; 
 North Hertfordshire has seven neighbouring authorities , each producing 
their own local plans. We will ensure that these plans complement each 
other and address issues which cross local authority boundaries; 
 Communities can also choose to become neighbourhood planning 
areas to help shape and deliver development and infrastructure in their 
areas; 
14.3 The Council will continue to work in partnership with these and other relevant 
bodies and will put further mechanisms in place to ensure delivery within the 
plan period. Some of the key methods and schemes that will be used to 
ensure delivery are summarised below: 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and Key Infrastructure: 
14.4 Ensuring that existing and new communities are sustainable involves a co-
ordinated and flexible approach to the provision of infrastructure. An NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
278 
 Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) has been prepared as a background 
document to support the Local Plan and assist as a delivery mechanism162.  
14.5 It takes into account the growth targets and sets out the infrastructure that is 
likely to be needed to support growth within the District to 2031. We have 
worked with a variety of infrastructure providers to understand likely future 
requirements.  
14.6 Predicting infrastructure needs so far into the future is not straightforward. The 
precise detail of most development schemes is not known and the nature of 
public services can change along the way.  
14.7 The IDP represents current strategic thinking and provides a guide for 
planning future infrastructure. It will continue to be updated on an iterative 
basis over the lifetime of the plan to reflect change. 
14.8 Notwithstanding this point, the IDP has identified a number of areas where 
significant interventions will be required to support the delivery of the plan: 
 Strategic Transport  – The scale of growth within the District will result in 
a significant number of new trips on a transport network that is already 
under stress in certain areas. Congestion issues are particularly focused 
within Hitchin and junctions relating to the A1(M). Not only as a result of 
growth in North Hertfordshire, but also in relation to existing issues and 
development in nearby authorities. There is a clear need to focus on 
promoting sustainable travel modes to limit the impacts of growth whilst 
delivering significant physical mitigation measures. Our transport 
modelling has helped to identify 11 specific schemes that will be required 
in the District over the period to 2031 as well as other schemes in 
neighbouring Stevenage which are influenced by this Plan’s proposals163. 
 School Places  – The County Council believe that, in many areas, existing 
schools are reaching, or at, capacity. This is addressed in this Plan 
through the provision of new schools or school expansion on Strategic 
Housing Sites and elsewhere. Schemes will need to demonstrate 
acceptable education solutions in order to gain planning permission; 
 Sewerage Infrastructure  – Our evidence has highlighted potential 
capacity issues with wasterwater treatment capacity, particularly at 
Royston Sewage Treatment Works and Rye Meads Sewage Treatment 
Works. Technical solutions are possible and further detailed discussions 
are taking place with the water companies and the Environment Agency to 
inform appropriate mitigation measures. 
14.9 Whilst these issues are not absolute constraints to the Local Plan, continued 
and proactive engagement with relevant parties, such as the developers, 
Highways Agency and Highways Authority, the Local Education Authority, the 
Environment Agency and Water companies, the Hertfordshire Local 
 
162 North Hertfordshire Infrastructure Delivery Plan (RS Regeneration, 2016; RS Regeneration & 
NHDC, 2018) 
163 AECOM transport modelling (AECOM, 2016) NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
279 
 Enterprise Partnership and the Hertfordshire Local Nature Partnership is 
fundamental in achieving appropriate solutions. 
14.10 The IDP should be referred to for a full programme of mitigation measures 
required to support the Local Plan. Delivery of these schemes will be 
monitored on an on-going basis through our Authority Monitoring Reports. 
Developer Contributions and Other Funding Sources: 
14.11 The development industry will also be expected to reasonably contribute to 
the delivery of the Local Plan. Our approach to securing infrastructure and 
mitigation measures through new development is set out in Policy SP7. At the 
same time, it is acknowledged that the sites and schemes identified in this 
Plan are unlikely to make sufficient contributions to support the full range of 
infrastructure envisaged by the IDP. 
14.12 This does not mean that development cannot occur. The Council will continue 
to work in partnership with other agencies to enable much needed funding for 
infrastructure. This might include: 
 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)  – LEPs are partnerships between 
businesses and local authorities set up by Government to support growth. 
North Hertfordshire is covered by the Hertfordshire LEP. 
o LEPs receive substantial funding settlements from central 
Government to meet strategic growth priorities and are responsible 
for then identifying specific projects which contribute to their aims; 
 Central funding  – although a number of bodies are likely to ‘bid’ to the 
District Council for infrastructure contributions in the form of developer 
contributions, they also have access to their own funding programmes. 
Major hospital works, for example, are often ultimately funded directly 
through the Department for Health. Highways England similarly receive 
direct settlements to deliver key projects. This includes the proposed 
conversion of the A1(M) between Junction 6, near Codicote, and Junction 
8, near Little Wymondley to a ‘SMART’ motorway. This will provide 
additional capacity by creating a third lane in each direction through hard-
shoulder running at peak times. 
 Grants and programmes  – Where individual projects meet specific 
objectives, they can receive grant funding. Well known examples include 
lottery funding, particularly where there are heritage or health benefits. 
Development Management through the Planning Application Process 
14.13 This is a key mechanism for ensuring development is delivered appropriately. 
The Council has a primary role in determining planning applications and 
ensuring that they are delivered in accordance with this Local Plan, other 
elements of the statutory Development Plan, national policy and legislation164.  
 
164 Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the Development Plan unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise. As well as this Local Plan, the Development Plan includes NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
280 
 14.14 A number of schemes have been worked up in tandem with this Plan to 
ensure early delivery and compliance with policy. A pro-active approach will 
continue to be taken to all schemes. This should not only promote delivery, 
but should also ensure that developers are fully aware of how their planning 
applications will be assessed. Appropriate conditions and/or planning 
obligations will be used to ensure delivery of infrastructure and appropriate 
mitigation measures are put in place for schemes. 
14.15 An estimate of the number of new homes has been provided against each 
site. However, as set out in the policies of this Plan, these figures are not 
binding and the Development Management process will be used to explore 
design-led solutions on individual sites. Where it proves possible to deliver 
higher numbers of homes within the policy framework of the plan, this will be 
supported and will contribute greater flexibility to the plan by increasing the 
‘buffer’ of new homes over and above the targets in Policy SP8. 
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs), other plans and documents: 
14.16 Where appropriate, local authorities can set out further guidance that supports 
the policies in the Local Plan. Formal guidance takes the form of 
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD). Current guidance includes that 
on parking standards and design. 
14.17 There are also Town Centre Strategies for each of the four towns while 
communities are choosing to prepare Neighbourhood Plans for their area to 
assist implementation. 
14.18 The Council will review SPD and other guidance on an on-going basis 
throughout the lifetime of this Local Plan. 
Council Owned Land and Property 
14.19 The Council can use its own assets to assist in delivery and promote growth. 
Protection and improvement of environmental assets on Council owned land 
will also be important. 
Acquisition powers 
14.20 The Council can use its resources to assemble land and sites. However, it is 
envisaged that almost all of the development that is set out in, or will by 
controlled by, this Plan will be delivered by third parties. 
14.21 Recent legislation provides greater opportunities for local communities to take 
control of assets in their local areas. This includes the community Right to Bid 
which gives local people additional time to develop a strategy where local 
 
any Neighbourhood Plans produced by local communities and the Waste Local Plan and Minerals 
Local Plan produced by Hertfordshire County Council. NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
281 
 facilities which have been identified as an Asset of Community Value are 
earmarked for sale by their owners. 
14.22 As a last resort, the Council’s Compulsory Purchase powers can be used to 
ensure implementation of the policies and priorities of the Local Plan. This 
includes for buildings identified as Assets of Community Value which are 
perceived to be under threat. However, the Council’s preferred approach 
remains pro-active negotiation with, and advising of, landowners, developers 
and other relevant parties to assist the delivery of schemes and the retention 
of important local facilities. 
14.23 Where a local community considers that an Asset of Community Value is 
under threat and that they may wish the request the use of the Council’s 
Compulsory Purchase powers, they should contact the Council for further 
advice on the appropriate procedure(s) and any financial implications. 
Monitoring  
14.24 A monitoring framework will allow us to assess whether the policies in this 
Plan are being successfully implemented. This will be set out in, and form the 
basis of, our authority monitoring reports (AMRs) that we must produce 
annually. 
14.25 The AMR will show whether policies are working or having the right effect. It 
will demonstrate whether we are meeting the targets we have set for 
ourselves, or on track to do so. 
14.26 As well as tracking the direct effects of implementing the plan, monitoring also 
allows us to consider the wider social, economic and environmental impacts. 
There is considerable cross-over here with the requirements of environmental 
assessment legislation which requires on-going monitoring of significant 
effects165.  
14.27 The table below sets out some of the key indicators and targets (where 
applicable) that will be measured. These will be supplemented by other 
indicators and contextual data on matters such as unemployment rates, retail 
vacancies and travel choices.  
14.28 The table is followed by a housing trajectory setting out how the delivery of 
new homes is currently anticipated to occur over the plan period. Figure 6 
over-page shows the anticipated housing trajectory. This will be kept up-to-
date in future monitoring reports. This programme of delivery will allow the 
plan to demonstrate a five-year land supply at the point of adoption and, 
subsequently, on an on-going basis166. 
 
165 Sustainability Appraisal of the North Hertfordshire Local Plan (CAG, 2021) 
166 Further information on the calculation of five-year land supply is set out in the Housing and Green 
Belt Background Paper (NHDC, 2016) NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
282 
 14.29 Although many of these indicators will be influenced by the implementation of 
this plan they are also subject to wider forces, such as the state of the 
economy, and the choices made by individuals, businesses and other service 
providers. Failure to meet these targets should not necessarily be read as a 
failure of the plan and future monitoring reports will identify where external 
factors have influenced performance.

Policy IMR1: Five Year Housing Land Supply  
In order to identify and update annually a supply of specific deliverable 
sites sufficient to provide five years worth of housing, we will: 
a) Deliver the total housing requirement of 13,000 net dwellings over 
the plan period on a stepped basis. The Council’s  five year 
housing land supply will be measured against housing requirement 
targets of: 
 350 dwellings per annum for the plan period from 2011 to 31 
March 2020;  
 500 dwellings per annum for the plan period from 1 April 2020 
to 31 March 2024; and  
 1,120 dwellings per annum for  the remainder of the plan period 
from 1 April 2024 to 2031; 
b) Add any shortfall in housing delivery since the plan’s start date, 
spread evenly over the remaining plan period, to the calculation of 
the requirement; 
c) Ensure that the supply of specific, deliverable sites included a 
buffer (moved forward from later in the plan period) in line with 
national planning policy; and 
d) Monitor housing completion and permissions on an ongoing basis 
to ensure the housing trajectory is based upon robust and up-to-
date information and assumptions. 
14.30 Figure 6 over-page shows the anticipated housing trajectory. This will be kept 
up-to-date in future monitoring reports. This programme of delivery will allow 
the plan to demonstrate a five-year land supply at the point of adoption and, 
subsequently, on an on-going basis. 
14.31 In order to achieve this, the plan uses a stepped approach to the housing 
requirement.  For the period to 1 April 2020, a housing requirement of 350 
dwellings per annum is applied recognising that the quantum of development 
delivered from the start of the plan period in 2011 to this date is fixed. This 
increases to 500 dwellings per year between 2020 and 2024 before rising to a 
requirement for 1,120 dwellings per annum over the remaining years of the 
plan period. NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL PLAN 2011-2031  
285 
 14.32 This approach is linked to development strategy set out in this plan. A 
significant proportion of future new homes will be delivered upon new 
strategic sites. Delivery of these sites requires their release from the Green 
Belt which is achieved through this plan. However, this means that in the first 
half of the plan period from 2011 to 2021, reliance has been placed upon sites 
permitted under the previous policy regime and extant planning permissions.  
14.33 In the second half of the plan period from 2021, the Local Housing Allocations 
released from the Green Belt will be critical to maintaining the delivery profile 
and a rolling five-year land supply. It is anticipated that the Strategic Housing 
Sites will become the main component of new housing supply in the latter 
years of the plan. The stepped approach to housing delivery over the plan 
period allows a better match with actual and anticipated delivery. 
14.34 The same circumstances support a measured approach to meeting the 
shortfalls in housing delivery that have occurred since 2011. To this end the 
plan does not seek to meet the full extent of any backlog of delivery within the 
first five years (known as the Sedgefield approach) but rather seeks to meet 
this backlog over the remainder of the plan period (the Liverpool approach). 
14.35 In addition to the measures above, national policy requires a buffer, moved 
forward from later in the plan period, to be applied to the calculation of the five 
year supply167.  This buffer should be a minimum of 5% but, where there has 
been a record of persistent under delivery of housing, this should be 
increased to 20%.   
14.36 In the period from the start of the plan period on 1st April 2011 to 31st March 
2020 the delivery of housing completions in the District were well below the 
650 dwellings per annum that would be necessary if the requirement were to 
be met evenly over the whole plan period, averaging 313 dwellings per 
annum. This necessitates the application of a 20% buffer at the point of the 
plan’s adoption. 
14.37 The buffer requirement will be added to both the housing requirement and any 
backlog in delivery to be met over the five year period under assessment. 
14.38 These approaches are set out in Policy IMR1 and will be the basis of the 
housing land supply calculations that are produced for monitoring purposes 
over the plan period.  The delivery of sites will be monitored and will inform 
the plan review set out in Policy IMR2.

 Review 
 
Policy IMR2: Local plan early review  
The Council will undertake a whole plan review of the Local Plan 2011-2031 
by the end of 2023 at the latest. This will determine whether this Plan needs 
to be updated either in whole or in part. All policies will be reviewed but with 
particular regard paid to the following matters that were specifically identified 
during the preparation and examination of this plan: 
 Housing requirements for the District and wider housing market 
areas; 
 Housing delivery having regard to the progress and implementation of 
the Strategic Housing Sites and Local Housing Allocations identified 
in this plan and the rates of development being achieved measured 
against the stepped approach and housing trajectory set out in this 
plan; 
 The safeguarded land to the West of Stevenage; 
 The outcomes of the process(es) to comprehensively explore new 
settlement options in the District; 
 Gypsy and Traveller provision 
 The identification of needs for retail, leisure, office and other main 
town centre uses; 
 Options for long-term secondary education provision in the 
Stevenage area; and 
 Broad alignment with the statutory five-year time limit for reviews of 
the East Hertfordshire and Stevenage local plans (required by 
November 2023 and May 2024 respectively) to allow co-ordinated 
consideration of the above matters. 
The review will have regard to up-to-date information and be conducted in 
line with Government policy and statutory requirements. Subject to the 
outcomes of that review, a new plan or policies will be prepared to a new 
time horizon of at least 2041. 
The review will also serve to build upon existing strong, working 
relationships with adjoining and nearby authorities and may result in the 
preparation of a joint plan or policies based upon wider functional 
geographies. 
14.39 The Government expects plans to be regularly reviewed every five years168 
and we will need to update our Local Plan more regularly than has happened 
in the past. National guidance recognises that plans can be reviewed in whole 
or in part to respond flexibly to changing circumstances169. We will use the 
 
168 Regulation 10A of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 (as 
amended) 
169 Paragraph 153 of the 2012 NPPF North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
288 
 monitoring framework, set out above, to keep the effects of this Plan under 
review. 
14.40 Where monitoring shows that we are consistently failing to meet relevant 
targets, or are unlikely to do so in the future, or that wider conditions have 
changed to the extent that the strategy in this plan is no longer appropriate, 
we will initiate a review of the Plan that relates to those specific issue(s) 
identified. 
14.41 In addition to our monitoring, we recognise local plans should normally set out 
where development will occur over a 15-year period from the point of 
adoption170. This Plan shows how we will meet our needs over the period to 
2031, 10 years from the anticipated date of adoption. 
14.42 Policy IMR2 therefore commits to an early, whole plan review to commence 
by the end of 2023 that will allow the Council to consider longer-term 
requirements, including in relation to a number of specific issues identified 
through the production of this plan. 
14.43 We consider that this Plan makes maximum use of reasonable and available 
development sites at the time of writing. On-going processes are likely to 
supplement the range of spatial options available in North Hertfordshire in the 
period after 2026. It is considered most appropriate to let these ‘run their 
course’ in order to properly inform longer-term planning. 
14.44 The Council has resolved to fully explore the possibilities of a new settlement 
within the District. Our work to date recognises the long-term nature of these 
projects. Further work will be initiated to identify potential locations where any 
new settlement(s) might be located and this continues to be progressed. 
14.45 At the same time, future decisions by other bodies may significantly influence 
future options for growth in North Hertfordshire. We will continue to work with 
central government, the Hertfordshire Growth Board and other relevant 
agencies to better understand the likely nature of these171. 
14.46 The outcomes of these deliberations and the new settlement process will be 
reflected in the review process outlined in Policy IMR2. We currently consider 
it most likely that this review will result in a need to comprehensively update 
the local plan, recognising that this cannot be prejudged at this time. Our 
present intention is that any comprehensive review of this Plan will be 
completed by the mid-2020s at the latest. It will roll the Plan forward to a new 
time horizon of at least 2041 and deliver any specific additional or updated 
policies and sites that are identified as being needed. 
14.47 This Plan recognises the requirements of the Duty to Co-operate and makes a 
positive contribution towards unmet development needs from Luton. This 
 
170 Paragraph 157 of the 2012 NPPF 
171 The Hertfordshire LEP, for example, has identified a long-list of potential strategic transport 
projects over the period to 2050 which could unlock new locations or directions for growth. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
289 
 maximises the contribution that we feel can be made from that part of the 
District within the Luton Housing Market Area (HMA). 
14.48 We have actively worked with the other authorities in the HMA – Luton, 
Central Bedfordshire and Aylesbury Vale – to understand the extent to which 
the market area as a whole can accommodate development needs over the 
period to 2031172.  The authorities in the Luton HMA jointly commissioned and 
subsequently agreed a Growth Options Study.  This demonstrates sufficient 
potential capacity within the Luton HMA to accommodate Luton’s unmet 
housing needs for the current round of plans. If there proves to be insufficient 
capacity within the Luton HMA in the future, it will be necessary to look further 
afield for potential solutions. This would be likely to involve a number of 
authorities. 
14.49 We will also work with these and other relevant authorities to understand, and 
holistically plan for, any long-term strategic infrastructure requirements arising 
from future growth. This will include consideration of any infrastructure that 
may be required within North Hertfordshire to facilitate the delivery of growth 
proposed in other authorities’ plans or other long-term aspirations that may 
come to fruition over the plan period. Any proposals to expand London Luton 
Airport beyond the limits of its current planning permission would fall within 
the scope of this commitment. 
14.50 NHDC is a co-commissioning authority for the A505 Corridor Study along with 
Luton Borough Council, Central Bedfordshire Council, Hertfordshire County 
Council and other neighbouring authorities as appropriate.  The outcomes of 
this Study will determine the likely long-term cumulative traffic impacts of 
growth in the wider area on both Luton and North Hertfordshire and potential 
measures to mitigate these. 
14.51 We will continue to engage constructively in these processes and, if 
necessary, consider how best to reflect the outcomes. Dependant on the 
nature of any issues raised, it may be possible to deal with this through partial 
or focused reviews of any relevant policy/ies. 
14.52 Beyond these defined events, there may be changes in circumstances that we 
cannot currently foresee, or are yet to understand the full implications of, but 
which have a substantial impact upon the District. This might be a major 
change to the way in which the planning system operates, as suggested in the 
Government’s 2020 White Paper, or structural changes to the population or 
the way we live, work or spend our leisure time in response to Brexit, Covid-
19, climate change or any other future event.  It is anticipated that the review 
process outlined in IMR2 will be the most appropriate means of considering 
these matters but the Council may also consider focussed reviews of 
individual or small groups of policies prior to this where necessary.

 Appendix 2: Local Plan Designations 
The Local Plan Policies Map includes the following designations, which are set by, 
and specifically relate to, policies in the Plan: 
 Green Belt 
 Rural Area Beyond the Green Belt 
 Urban Open Land 
 Employment Areas  
 Employment Sites  
 Housing Sites 
 Neighbourhood Centres 
 Settlement Boundaries 
 Town Centre Boundaries 
 Primary Shopping Frontage 
 Secondary Shopping Frontages 
 Mixed use Allocations 
 Safeguarded Land 
 Gypsy / Traveller Site 
The Policies Map also includes the following designations, which although referred to 
by policies in the Plan, are not the responsibility of the Local Plan and the extents of 
the designations are not set by the Local Plan process. The relevant authority listed 
next to the allocation (below) is responsible for their designation.  Their extents may 
change throughout the duration of the Local Plan and so viewing the organisations 
websites is recommended for the most up-to-date position (In the case of 
Conservation Areas, whilst the local authority is responsible for setting their extent it 
is a separate process to the Local Plan): 
Designation Designating authority 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest Natural England 
Area of Outstanding Natural

Additionally there are a number of other designations which policies in the Local Plan 
refer to; however, as the Local Plan does not control their designation or set their 
extents and they are so numerous and extensive that they would confuse the other 
designations, they are not included on the Policies Map. Again the authority listed 
next to the allocation is responsible for their designation and so viewing the 
organisations websites is recommended for the most up-to-date position (again, in 
the case of designations that are the responsibility of the District Council the process 
for setting their extents is separate to the Local Plan).  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031

 Appendix 4: Car Parking Standards  
Residential Parking Standards 
Class Use C3 Car Parking Standard Minimum Cycle Parking 
Standard 
1 bedroom 1 space per dwelling 
minimum 1 secure covered space 
per dwelling. None if 
garage or secure area 
provided within curtilage of

minimum 
Retirement 
developments (e.g. 
warden assisted 
independent living 
accommodation) 1 space per dwelling 
minimum 1 secure and covered 
space for residents per 5 
units.  
 
The above standards will also require visitor / unallocated parking as set out below to 
be added. Garages will be counted towards meeting the standards only if they are at 
least 7m x 3m measured internally. Reductions from these standards will only be 
considered where applicants can demonstrate that the accessibility, type, scale, mix 
and use of the development; the availability of and opportunities for public transport; 
local car ownership levels; and on-street conditions justify such variations.  
Visitor/Unallocated Parking 
Class Use C3 Car Parking Standard Minimum Cycle Parking 
Standard 
Visitor / unallocated Between 0.25 and 0.75 
spaces per dwelling 
(rounded up to nearest 
whole number) with the 
higher standard being 
applied where there are 
no garages in the 
schemes and the lower 
standard applied where 
every dwelling in the 
scheme is to be provided 
with a garage For above C3 general 
housing - if no garage or 
secure area is provided 
within curtilage of dwelling 
then 1 covered and secure 
space per dwelling in a 
communal area for visitors 
 
For C3 retirement 
developments - 1 covered 
and secure visitor space 
per 3 units 
For the above visitor and unallocated parking standards, reductions in provision will 
be considered where: North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
314 
 1. Alternative publicly available off-street parking is available within 2 minutes’ 
walk of the site; 
2. Visitor parking arising from small-scale (i.e. infill) development can be 
accommodated on-street without compromising highway safety, the amenity 
of existing residents or the ability for businesses to operate; or 
3. Relevant evidence is submitted by the applicant which supports a reduction in 
standard and considers existing and future car ownership and likely visitor 
demand.

 Appendix 5: Letchworth Garden City Design Principles 
1. For development proposals in Letchworth, their overall layout and design should, 
as far as practicable, reflect 'Garden City' layout and design principles. Creative 
reinterpretation of the principles in the light of modern requirements will be 
sought, and a knowledge of the quality and variety of early garden residential 
development in the Garden City is a pre-requisite to the success of any 
proposals. The following notes are intended to give a guide to examples which 
might be studied, with benefit.  
2. The term 'Garden City' is equated with open residential development, 
characteristically low density and generously landscaped with mature trees and 
hedges set amongst individual houses. This is only partly true. Many of the finest 
early Garden City layouts depended on a successful corporate design for the 
scheme as a whole, in addition to the individual features mentioned above. The 
key to success in the best of examples quoted below is the appreciation of the 
way houses are grouped to form a sequence of outdoor spaces related to each 
other and to the overall setting.  
3. The broadest overall effect is that of the vista. This has a formal quality 
exemplified by the broad tree-lined swathe which projects the main axis of the 
town across Norton Common, and was very effectively handled in the section of 
Broadway between the J.F. Kennedy Gardens and the Sollershotts where a 
double avenue of Lime trees was planted. Other principal approach roads of the 
town were treated in this manner, for example Norton Way South and Pixmore 
Way. In the latter, the articulated building lines of the early Letchworth U.D.C. 
Council housing was notably successful. 
4. In contrast, the principle of closure represented the breaking down of the street 
picture into sequences by means of closing the view at key points, particularly at 
road junctions. Notable examples are the view southwards into Rushby Mead 
from Hillshott analysed in detail below; The Crescent between Pixmore Way and 
Baldock Road where a series of spaces is created along a curved road; or more 
formally, in Jackmans Place around the triple road junction where a focal block is 
set across the view line. The use of an informal design approach should not be at 
the expense of purposeful design of space framed by buildings, an aspect always 
emphasised by Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, consultant architects for the 
original Letchworth Plan of 1904 and much of the subsequent detailed layout of 
housing.  
5. Within the street picture, accents were often created by variations in the building 
line. For example, the splayed arrangement of the tree blocks of Silver Birch 
Cottages in Station Road added visual interest to an otherwise monotonous road. 
Greens were used to create a corporate sense of design, for example at 
Westholm, Ridge Road and in the section of Lytton Avenue between Gernon 
Road and Pixmore Way.  
6. Finally, group design was used as a means of giving identity to the various roads 
within the Garden City. The residential cul-de-sac, was one of the earliest 
instances of the use of a feature which is now common in housing layouts. Other 
means of grouping include the linking together of blocks at street corners, as at 
the junction of Ridge Avenue and Hillshott, and the use of linking walls and 
garages as in the groups at the junction of Lytton Avenue and South View. North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
316 
 Occasionally, corners would be treated with blocks of striking design, for example 
the twin 'L' blocks which frame the north side of the junction between Sollershott 
East and Field Lane or the block boldly set diagonally across the acute angled 
junction between Sollershott East and South View.

 Glossary 
This Glossary gives a definition for a number of terms used in this Local Plan and / 
or in consideration of planning matters. These definitions are correct at the point of 
publication but may be changed or superceded by any relevant changes in 
legislation, national policy etc. 
Adoption  
Confirmation, usually by a legal notice, stating the final adoption of a planning policy 
document by a Local Planning Authority.  
Affordable Housing  
Housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the market (including 
housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is for essential 
local workers); and which complies with the detailed definitions set out in the 
National Planning Policy Framework, falling into one or more of the following 
categories: 
 Affordable housing for rent 
 Starter Homes 
 Discounted market sales housing 
 Other affordable routes to home ownership 
Allocated Site/Site Allocation  
Sites which are identified for a specific use e.g. housing or Green Belt on the Local 
Plan Policies Map.  
Annual Monitoring Report / Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) 
A report which must be produced by a Local Planning Authority every year which 
presents data on key matters affecting the planning and development of their area. 
This includes reporting on progress with the Local Plan, any Neighbourhood Plans 
and any targets included in local plan policies. The two terms are used 
interchangeably but normally mean the same thing. 
Biodiversity  
The variety of life in all forms (e.g. wildlife, plants etc).  
Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP)  
An overarching framework for habitat and species conservation, which works on the 
basis of partnership to identify local priorities and targets.  
 North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
318 
 Brownfield site/Previously Developed Land (PDL)  
Brownfield Land is land which has been previously developed. For land to fall under 
PDL it must be, or have been, occupied with a permanent structure within the site’s 
curtilage. Excluded from PDL is land occupied by forestry or agricultural buildings, 
mineral extraction or waste disposal sites, residential gardens, parks, recreational 
grounds, and allotments as well as land that was previously developed but the 
remains of any structure have blended into the landscape.  
Buildings of Local Interest 
Buildings designated by the local planning authority to be of local significance and 
included in a local list. Although they are not statutorily protected, close scrutiny will 
be given to any development affecting them. They are referred to as non-designated 
heritage assets. 
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)  
A levy allowing local authorities to raise funds from owners or developers of land 
undertaking new building projects in their area. The CIL must be collected through 
the preparation of a Charging Schedule, supported by a range of infrastructure 
planning and economic viability evidence.  
Comparison Goods/Convenience Goods  
Comparison goods include clothing, shoes, household appliances, books, etc, where 
the customer can make a comparison between different retailers. This differs from 
convenience goods, which include everyday items such as food and drink.  
Conservation Area  
An area defined in the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 
as ‘an area of special architectural and historic interest, the character or appearance 
of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance.’ Councils must publish a map 
showing the boundaries of these areas where extra planning controls apply and also 
produce a conservation area proposals statement.  
Deliverable Site  
To be considered deliverable for housing development, sites should:  
 Be available now;  
 Offer a suitable location for development now and contribute to the creation of 
sustainable, mixed communities; and  
 Have a reasonable prospect that housing will be delivered on the site within 
five years.  
 
 North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
319 
 Density  
A measurement of how intensively land is occupied by built development. For 
housing, this is often measured in dwellings per hectare (dpha).  
Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DHLUC)  
The Government department which sets policy on local government, housing, urban 
regeneration, planning and fire and rescue. Formerly called the Ministry for Housing,

Design and Access Statement  
A document that explains the design concepts, implications and justification 
associated with a planning application. This includes how an applicant has carefully 
considered how everyone, including disabled people, older people and young 
children, will be able to use the development.  
Developer Contribution  
In-kind or financial contributions provided by developers to contribute to the cost of 
infrastructure and other items, in order that the development is acceptable in 
planning terms and accords with the policies in the Local Plan. This can take the 
form of a legal agreement or the operation of a tariff-based system for contributions. 
Legal agreements may take the form of a ‘planning obligation’, which is a legally 
enforceable obligation entered into under section 106 of the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990 to mitigate the impacts of a development proposal.  
Development Plan  
Local Plans, Waste & Minerals Plans and Neighbourhood Plans, which have been 
adopted or made under powers in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, 
as amended by the Localism Act 2011.  
Development Plan Document (DPD)  
Planning policy documents which carry the most weight. Once they have been 
prepared they have to be submitted to the relevant Secretary of State. They are then 
examined by an independent planning inspector to make sure that they meet 
legislative, regulatory and national policy requirements. Local Plans are a form of 
DPD. 
Development Management  
The process by which proposals for new development are assessed by the Local 
Planning Authority. This is undertaken primarily through the determination of 
planning applications.

a strong presumption against development.  
Green Infrastructure (GI)  
A concept recognising the environmental, social and economic, often multi-functional 
value of the network of natural environmental components and green and blue 
spaces that lies within and between towns and villages. In the same way that the 
transport infrastructure is made up of a network of roads, railways and airports, etc. 
Green Infrastructure has its own physical components, including parks, rivers, street 
trees and moorland.  
Greenfield Sites  
Greenfield sites are land which is not previously developed and can include 
agricultural land in rural areas, but also undeveloped land within the urban area.  
Housing Market Areas 
The geographic area defined by household demand and preference for all types of 
housing, reflecting the key functional linkages between places where people live and 
work.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031

‘deprivation’ across a range of indicators, against which social and economic 
conditions in one area can be compared to other areas in England.  
Infill Development 
The development of a relatively small gap between existing buildings.  
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP)  
An evidence document supporting the Local Plan. This will set out a range of 
existing, planned and required infrastructure within the local authority area. It will set 
out the key infrastructure projects which will be critical to the successful delivery of 
the Local Plan.  
Listed Buildings

detailing the schemes and initiatives that will be delivered, together with the 
performance indicators and targets used to monitor progress.  
Local Wildlife Site (LWS)/Local Geological Site (LGS)  
Previously known as Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC), or 
alternatively Site of Biological Interest (SBI)/Site of Geological Interest (SGI). These 
are areas of land with significant wildlife or geological value. Typically they can 
comprise an area of woodland, grassland meadows or a local water body.   
Localism Act  
Enacted in late 2011, the Act contains a wide range of legislative changes, including 
many affecting local authorities and local spatial planning. The Act introduced the

which should be followed in its development.  
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)  
Introduced by the Government in 2012, this replaced the majority of adopted national 
planning policy, including most Planning Policy Statements and Planning Policy 
Guidance notes. The NPPF is supplemented by remaining guidance, and a number 
of other policy statements. The NPPF sets out national priorities for delivering 
sustainable development and economic growth, including a very wide range of 
policies and guidance, relating to themes such as housing, environment and 
economy, and procedural matters (such as plan-making and decision-taking). The 
NPPF is periodically updated. The most recent version was published in 2021. 
Neighbourhood Plan  
A plan prepared by a Parish Council or Neighbourhood Forum for a particular 
neighbourhood (made under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 as 
amended by the Localism Act 2011). A neighbourhood plan would, once brought into 
effect, comprise part of the statutory Development Plan for the area. It would 
therefore, alongside any adopted Local Plan documents, need to be considered 
when assessing any development proposals affecting the area. 
Net New Homes 
Additional new homes which have been built. Net housing figures are the total 
(gross) number of new homes built minus any loss of housing.

Renewable and low carbon energy  
Includes energy for heating and cooling as well as generating electricity. Renewable 
energy covers those energy flows that occur naturally and repeatedly in the 
environment – from the wind, the fall of water, the movement of the oceans, the sun 
and from biomass and deep geothermal heat. Low carbon technologies are those 
that can help reduce emissions (compared to conventional use of fossil fuels).

the current plan period. These sites are proposed to be taken out of the Green Belt 
but are not allocated for development in the current Local Plan.  
Scheduled Monument  
A nationally important historic building or structure or archaeological site, given 
protection against detrimental and unauthorised change. When designated, 
Scheduled Monuments are added to the schedule (which has been kept since 1882)

housing development.  
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA)  
A study across an identified largely ‘self contained’ housing market to assess how 
the market operates and is likely to operate in the future. A SHMA assesses past,

examination.  North Hertfordshire Local Plan 2011-2031  
326 
 Sustainability Appraisal (SA) / Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)  
These terms are often used interchangeably and are often used to mean the same 
thing, although they technically have different definitions. It refers to assessing the 
economic, environmental and social effects of a plan from the outset of the 
preparation process to allow decisions to be made that accord with sustainable 
development.  
Sustainable Development 
Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs.  
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)  
These systems aim to mimic the natural movement of water from a development, 
slowing run-off, reducing flood risk, improving water quality and potentially providing 
attractive features.  
Sustainable Modes of Transport 
Sustainable modes of transport refers to the broad subject of transport that 
is sustainable in the senses of social, environmental and climate impacts. 
Transport Assessment (TA)  
A comprehensive and systematic process that sets out transport issues relating to a 
proposed development. It identifies what measures will be required to improve 
accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car 
such as walking, cycling and public transport and what measures will need to be 
taken to deal with the anticipated transport impacts of the development.  
Travel Plan
