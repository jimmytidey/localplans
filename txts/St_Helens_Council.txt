 1 1. Introduction 
1.1 What is the St Helens Borough Local Plan? 
1.1.1 The St Helens Borough Local Plan sets out the framework for the growth 
and development of the Borough.  It identifies how and where new 
development and regeneration should take place and thereby promotes 
and manages the future development of the Borough.  It will also shape 
the investment plans of the Council, other public and voluntary 
organisations, and the private sector.  
1.1.2 The Local Plan includes: 
 the vision and objectives for the development of the Borough up to 
and beyond 2037; 
 strategic policies guiding the amount, form and location of new 
development; 
 site allocations for new housing, employment, and other forms of 
development; and 
 local policies with additional requirements to guide the 
consideration of planning applications for new development, and 
details of where these will apply. 
1.2 What is the Plan trying to achieve? 
1.2.1 St Helens Borough Council has worked for many years with other 
stakeholders to create a modern, distinctive, economically prosperous, 
and vibrant Borough, in which key environmental assets are protected and 
enhanced.  The Local Plan will play an important role in achieving these 
aims. 
1.3 Relationship to other planning documents 
1.3.1 This Local Plan Written Statement forms a key part of the statutory 
‘development plan’ for St Helens Borough.  Other ‘development plan 
documents’ include: 
 the Joint Merseyside and Halton Waste Local Plan 2013, which 
sets out the planning strategy and site allocations for the 
sustainable management of waste across Halton, Knowsley, 
Liverpool, Sefton, St Helens, and Wirral; and 
 the Bold Forest Park Area Action Plan 2017, which sets out a 
strategy for the sustainable development and regeneration of 
several communities and adjacent countryside in the southern part 
of the Borough. 
1.3.2 Further development plan documents may be adopted during the lifetime 
of the Plan. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 2 1.3.3 The Council’s Policies Map is a separate document that is updated as 
necessary when each development plan document is adopted.  It 
identifies, on an Ordnance Survey map base, areas that are allocated for 
development or covered by specific designations, for example to 
recognise their environmental character.  The Policies Map has been 
updated for adoption of this Plan. 
1.3.4 National legislation also allows neighbourhood plans to be prepared for 
specific parts of the Borough.  To date, no neighbourhood plans have 
been prepared in St Helens Borough.  Government policy requires that 
any neighbourhood plan that is prepared should not undermine the 
strategic policies of the Local Plan1. 
1.3.5 The policies of the Local Plan replace all the policies in the St Helens 
Local Plan Core Strategy 2012 and the previously ‘saved’ policies of the St 
Helens Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 1998.  No part of the Core 
Strategy or the UDP documents will remain extant from adoption of this 
Plan. 
1.3.6 None of the policies in the Joint Merseyside and Halton Waste Local Plan 
2013 or Bold Forest Park Area Action Plan 2017 will be replaced by this 
Local Plan.  These documents will remain fully in place beyond adoption of 
this Plan. 
1.3.7 The Council has also adopted a range of Supplementary Planning 
Documents (SPDs).  These provide further guidance and can be 
area-based or theme-based.  The Council proposes to review some 
existing SPDs after this Plan is adopted and prepare further SPDs as 
appropriate. 
1.3.8 The Council also has a duty to prepare regular Monitoring Reports that 
assess the effectiveness of adopted planning policies in addressing the 
key economic, social, and environmental issues facing St Helens Borough.  
The Statement of Community Involvement sets out how the Council will 
engage stakeholders when preparing new planning policies and 
determining planning applications.  The Local Development Scheme sets 
out which planning policy documents will be produced by the Council, 
including a timetable for their preparation. 
1.3.9 A number of published evidence base studies have played a key role in 
shaping the Local Plan and are referred to in relevant parts of this Plan.  In 
particular, the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) identifies the 
key items and types of infrastructure that must be provided, how and when 
each item is to be provided, and by whom. 
1.3.10 Further details concerning the role of these, and other documents 
prepared by the Council, are set out on its website at 
https://www.sthelens.gov.uk/ . 
 
1 National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 – Paragraph 29 St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 3 1.4 Preparing the Local Plan 
1.4.1 The Council has undertaken extensive consultation with the local 
community and other stakeholder groups as it has prepared the Local 
Plan.  This included an initial consultation on the scope of the Local Plan 
(in 2016) and then consultation on the Local Plan Preferred Options (in 
late 2016 / early 2017).  Separate documents set out how these 
consultations were undertaken and with whom, the key issues raised in 
the responses and how these have been addressed in the Plan. 
1.5 Sustainability Appraisal and Habitats Regulation Assessment 
1.5.1 A key role of the Local Plan is to promote sustainable development.  This 
means promoting: 
 social progress that meets the needs of everyone; 
 effective protection of the environment; 
 prudent use of natural resources; and 
 high levels of economic growth and employment. 
1.5.2 To ensure that the Plan is truly sustainable it has been subject to a robust 
process of sustainability appraisal as it has been prepared.  The outcomes 
of this process are set out in a separate sustainability appraisal report. 
1.5.3 As required by relevant legislation, the Plan has also been subject to a 
process of Habitats Regulation Assessment as it has been prepared.  This 
has assessed and, as appropriate, addressed the effects of the Plan on 
certain areas in the Liverpool City Region that have been recognised at 
the European level for their nature conservation significance.  The 
outcomes of this exercise are set out in a separate Habitats Regulation 
Assessment report. 
1.6 National and regional context 
1.6.1 A range of existing and emerging policy documents have influenced the 
development of the St Helens Borough Local Plan.  The National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) aims to promote sustainable development and 
growth while making the planning system less complex and more 
accessible.  The Local Plan has been prepared to accord with the tests of 
‘soundness’ set out in the NPPF.  It has also had regard to the 
Government’s online Planning Practice Guidance. 
1.6.2 At the regional level, the North West Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS) was 
revoked in 2013. 
1.7 The Liverpool City Region 
1.7.1 St Helens Borough forms one of 6 local authority areas within the 
Liverpool City Region (the others being Halton, Knowsley, Liverpool, 
Sefton, and Wirral).  The City Region authorities have worked closely 
together for many years on strategic planning matters, and these working St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 4 relationships were formalised by the creation of a City Region Cabinet in 
2009 and then the City Region Combined Authority in 2014.  Key 
documents prepared at a City Region level include the Liverpool City 
Region Growth Strategy, Merseyside Local Transport Plan, Liverpool 
Airport Masterplan, and the Liverpool City Region Ecological Framework.  
The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is also preparing a Spatial 
Development Strategy that will help to shape the development of the City 
Region.  There are also close working relationships between St Helens 
Borough and other neighbouring districts including West Lancashire, 
Warrington, and Wigan. 
1.7.2 The individual local authorities within and around the Liverpool City Region 
have also either recently prepared or are in the process of preparing their 
own Local Plans.  In accordance with the ‘duty to cooperate’ the Council 
has worked closely with these other Councils and other public bodies in 
addressing key strategic planning issues such as housing, the economy, 
infrastructure, and strategic environmental assets.  This has been, for 
example, by either commissioning evidence on a shared basis or closely 
involving partners as evidence has been gathered.  The results of this 
cooperation have underpinned the approach to key issues in this Plan. 
1.7.3 The Local Plan also relates closely to a range of more local strategies 
such as the St Helens Housing Strategy, the St Helens Plan, and the St 
Helens Economic Regeneration Strategy. 
1.8 Structure and form of the Local Plan 
1.8.1 Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of this Local Plan set out, respectively, the context for 
the Plan, key issues and opportunities facing the Borough and its overall 
vision, aims and objectives.  The policies of the Plan are then presented in 
chapters 4 (‘Core Policies’), 5 (‘Area Policies’), 6 and 7 (that set out a 
range of policies on thematic topics) and 8 (‘Development Management 
Policies’).  Each policy is presented in a box with a further box identifying 
links to the relevant aims and objectives of the Plan and its reasoned 
justification underneath.  Those policies that are strategic in nature are 
indicated as such.  The Plan is also supported by a range of appendices. 
1.9 Future review of the Local Plan 
1.9.1 In accordance with national planning legislation, the Local Plan will be 
subject to regular monitoring and will be reviewed at least once every 5 
years after its adoption to assess whether it needs updating, and action 
taken to update the Plan if considered necessary.  This will ensure that 
planning policies in St Helens Borough remain responsive to the 
development needs of the Borough. 
1.10 Relationship to the Development Management process 
1.10.1 It is likely that most of the policies in this Plan will be delivered via 
individual development proposals that will require a planning application.  
Planning applications are themselves subject to consultation processes St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 5 before being decided.  When determining planning applications, the 
Council will assess them against all the relevant policies of this Plan and 
other documents referred to above. 
1.10.2 It is important that developers discuss their proposals with the Council at 
an early stage, so that any issues concerning their acceptability can be 
addressed before a planning application is submitted. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: INTERPRETATION OF THE PLAN’S POLICIES 
National planning law requires that decisions concerning planning 
applications must be made in accordance with the ‘development plan’ 
unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  In this context, the 
‘development plan’ for St Helens Borough includes all the policies of this 
Local Plan together with other ‘development plan’ documents (such as those 
listed earlier in this section).  These policies must therefore be read as a 
whole. 
Proposals that may comply with one policy may not necessarily comply with 
others.  In assessing such cases, decision makers will need to weigh up the 
factors involved, to ensure that a balanced decision is made.  Depending on 
the nature and location of the proposal, other factors such as national policy 
requirements may also be relevant.

 6 2. St Helens Borough Profile 
2.1 Sub-regional context 
2.1.1 Located between Liverpool and Manchester, St Helens Borough enjoys a 
strategic position at the heart of the North West and Merseyside 
conurbation. 
2.1.2 The economy of the Borough is closely linked with that of the rest of the 
Liverpool City Region and West Lancashire.  It shares a housing market 
with Halton and Warrington and there are also links, for example, in terms 
of journeys to work, with Wigan, Salford and Manchester.  Key 
opportunities in the surrounding area include the growth of Liverpool 
Superport, Liverpool John Lennon airport and enhanced transport linkages 
driven by the emerging 30 year vision of Transport for the North (TfN).

 7 2.2 Place 
2.2.1 The urban form of St Helens Borough can be traced back to its history of 
coal mining, railways, and world famous glass industries.  Driven by rapid 
population growth during the 18th and 19th centuries, St Helens (and the 
related areas of Haydock, Newton-le-Willows and Rainhill) grew to form 
substantial urban areas.  Within the northern part of the Borough are a 
number of villages and hamlets that originally formed to serve the 
surrounding agricultural uses.  Within the southern part of the Borough a 
number of communities that originally served the coal mining industry 
have in some cases merged to form part of the core urban area of St 
Helens. 
2.2.2 In recent decades the traditional industries have declined in importance, 
with a corresponding reduction in jobs and business opportunities, and the 
creation of a legacy of derelict and (in some cases) contaminated land.  
These issues lie at the heart of many challenges facing the Borough. 
2.2.3 However, St Helens Borough has also undergone considerable positive 
change, with successful efforts to regenerate the economy, infrastructure, 
and environment.  Key achievements have included the completion of a 
new stadium for the Saints Super League team, improvements to railway 
stations, new business premises, the new Town Centre College Campus, 
improved parks and open spaces, reclamation of former collieries and 
some other industrial sites, and significant levels of new housing.  Big 
attractions include The Dream - a 20m high artwork on a reclaimed colliery 
overlooking the M62 – and the nationally significant Haydock Park 
Racecourse. 
2.3 Demographic trends 
2.3.1 The resident population of St Helens Borough, that totalled 179,331 in 
20172, is expected to grow steadily, albeit at a slower rate than for the 
North West and for England.  The Borough has an aging population with a 
higher proportion of people aged 65 years and over, and proportionally 
fewer people of working age between 16 to 64 years old than England as 
a whole.  The number of residents of the Borough who are in their 80s is 
expected to almost double to 12,800 in 2037, and the number of residents 
in their 90s is expected to almost triple to 9,7003. 
2.3.2 The Borough is ethnically less diverse than many other areas, with 96.6% 
of the population4 identifying themselves as white, compared to 79.8% 
nationally and 87.1% in the North West.

 8 2.4 Economy and Skills 
2.4.1 The economy of St Helens Borough has many strengths and 
opportunities, and recent years have seen the creation of new or improved 
employment floorspace, for example alongside the A570 St Helens 
Linkway.  Due to its location and excellent transport connectivity the 
Borough has great potential to increase its economic competitiveness, 
including in the growing logistics sector.  Self-employment levels have 
increased and business survival rates at 5-years after start-up have 
improved in recent years5. 
2.4.2 Notwithstanding these opportunities, St Helens Borough is ranked as the 
36th most deprived out of 326 local authorities in England6.  Its relative 
position has deteriorated since the 2010 Index of Deprivation that ranked 
the Borough as the 51st most deprived area.  Deprivation levels in some 
parts of the Borough have also worsened relative to others.  The 
proportion of children in low income families is higher than those in 
England and the North West as a whole.  St Helens Borough still has 
levels of dependency on benefits that are above regional and national 
averages7. 
2.4.3 The unemployment rate in St Helens Borough is (according to data in 
Table 2.1) lower than regional and national averages.  However, the 
economic activity and employment rates in the Borough remain lower than 
both the regional and national averages.  Furthermore, economic inactivity 
(e.g., due to sickness) is much higher than the North West average and 
pay levels in the Borough are also lower than elsewhere.

 9 respectively9.  Attainment levels for children and young people at Key 
Stages 2 and 4 also fall below regional and national averages. 
2.5 Housing 
2.5.1 In 2011, 30% of the Borough’s housing stock was terraced and 9% flats.  
The percentage of semi-detached houses (46%) was significantly higher 
than the regional and national averages (36% and 31% respectively).  The 
percentage of detached houses (14%) was significantly lower than the 
regional and national averages (18% and 23% respectively).  The 
proportion of dwellings in owner occupation in St Helens Borough (67.8%) 
was higher than the regional average (65%)10. 
2.5.2 The proportions of different types of dwelling in the Borough in 2011 were 
similar to those that existed in 2001, albeit with a small increase in the 
percentage of detached dwellings and flats/apartments and a 
corresponding decrease in the relative percentage of semi-detached and 
terraced properties.  These changes reflect the new build aspirational 
housing projects undertaken across the Borough, stock clearance of older 
properties and a tendency by Registered Social Landlords to build smaller 
housing units in recent years. 
2.5.3 Affordability of market housing for sale is an issue in the Borough with 
lower quartile house prices over four times greater than the lower quartile 
household income in the Borough11. 
2.6 Health and Wellbeing 
2.6.1 Life expectancy in St Helens Borough, recently measured at 77.46 years 
for males and 80.95 years for females, is considerably below the national 
averages12.  The two main causes of death in St Helens are cancer 
(27.2%) and circulatory disease (21.9%).  Furthermore, over 71% of the 
18+ adult population in the Borough – considerably higher than the 
national average - is estimated to be classed as overweight or obese13.  
This has been identified as a growing problem, in particular for children 
and young adults. 
2.6.2 Crime rates in St Helens Borough have reduced in recent years and are 
performing relatively well compared to neighbouring authorities, national 
averages, and those in other local authority areas with similar 
characteristics14.  It is considered important to maintain this progress.

 10 2.7 Transport 
2.7.1 St Helens Borough has an extensive and well used bus and rail network, 
with ten railway stations that provide regular connections to neighbouring 
towns and cities, and direct trains as far afield as North Wales and 
Blackpool.  Nevertheless, a need has been identified to improve aspects 
of the public transport network and walking and cycling facilities. 
2.7.2 The Borough also enjoys a strategic position at the heart of the regional 
road network, between the core cities of Manchester and Liverpool, with 
easy access to the M58 to the north, the M62 to the south and the M6 to 
the east.  However, highways in the Borough are under increasing 
pressure as traffic flows continue to rise; this leads to local congestion and 
capacity issues at peak times at various junctions. 
2.7.3 The Council is working closely with infrastructure and service providers to 
identify and address these issues, including (in appropriate cases) through 
the use of contributions from developers linked to future development.  
Current proposals for new infrastructure are set out in the St Helens 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 
2.8 Town Centres 
2.8.1 St Helens Town Centre plays an important sub-regional role as the 
Borough’s principal town centre providing a range of retail and other 
services for the Borough.  This is complemented by the roles played by 
Earlestown Town Centre (within the town of Newton-le-Willows) and a 
range of smaller district and local centres.   
2.8.2 A key challenge is for the town and other centres to diversify their role in 
response to changing economic circumstances, including competition from 
retail parks and internet shopping. The Council has successfully secured 
an initial £173,029 capacity funding grant to support the development of a 
Town Deal Board and Investment Plan from the Governments Town Deal 
fund to help with projects around land use and regeneration, connectivity, 
skills, and employment for St Helens Town Centre. 
2.8.3 In addition, the Council is entering into a strategic partnership agreement 
with the English Cities Fund (ECF) to ensure the delivery of a Borough 
wide regeneration strategy initially starting with St Helens Town Centre. 
2.9 Heritage Assets 
2.9.1 The Borough boasts a varied and unique built environment, based upon its 
history connected with the railways, mining, glass and other industries.  
Existing heritage assets make a valuable contribution to economic and 
social wellbeing and a focus for heritage led regeneration and tourism 
development.  They include: 148 Listed Buildings (Grade I, Grade II* and 
Grade II), 12 Scheduled Monuments (four of which are identified on 
Historic England’s “at risk” register), one Registered Battlefield, eight 
Conservation Areas and three Registered Parks and Gardens.  There are 
also a number of areas of archaeological interest and above-ground St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 11 assets of local interest that may not meet the criteria for statutory 
designation but that merit local protection. 
2.10 Green Infrastructure, Outdoor Sport and Leisure 
2.10.1 Despite the urban character of much of the St Helens Borough, over half 
of its area is rural or semi-rural in nature, and 7% of it constitutes open 
green spaces within the urban areas.  The Borough benefits from an 
extensive network of open countryside and green spaces, much of which 
is accessible to local residents providing opportunities for formal and 
informal recreation, and improved health and quality of life.  Certain 
spaces provide valuable nature conservation habitats, including, for 
example, 120 designated Local Wildlife Sites.  Open spaces also play a 
role in helping to manage flood risk, including in the Sankey Catchment 
that covers much of the Borough. In addition, open spaces provide 
opportunities to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. 
Therefore, this plan will support the Council’s Climate Change Emergency 
declaration. 
2.10.2 Landscape improvement programmes have been undertaken in a number 
of locations, for example Bold Forest Park in the south of the Borough, 
Carr Mill Dam and Stanley Bank in the north.  All these sites have had 
significant investment that enabled improved levels of public access for 
walking, cycling and horse riding.  The Mersey Forest and related 
initiatives have played a major role in securing the environmental 
regeneration of parts of the Borough. 
2.11 Key Issues 
2.11.1 Based upon the issues identified in the Council’s Local Plan Scoping 
Consultation Document and the Sustainability Appraisal Scoping Reports, 
and comments received from stakeholders, it has been identified that the 
Local Plan should seek to address the following: 
i) Deliver sustainable communities; 
ii) Strengthen and diversify the local economy; 
iii) Deliver sustainable development; 
iv) Meet local housing needs; 
v) Meet employment needs; 
vi) Protect and where possible enhance the town, district and local centres; 
vii) Manage the rural economy; 
viii)Improve health; 
ix) Maximise accessibility and social inclusion; 
x) Sustain population recovery; 
xi) Reduce crime; 
xii) Encourage the use of sustainable transport; 
xiii) Manage and enhance the environment; 
xiv) Recognise and support community and cultural facilities; and 
xv) Manage river catchments and enhance biodiversity. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 12 3. St Helens Borough in 2037 
3.1 Spatial Vision 
3.1.1 The vision of the Local Plan describes the type of places that the Borough 
of St Helens and its constituent settlements should be in 2037. It is that: 
By 2037, St Helens Borough will provide, through the balanced 
regeneration and sustainable growth of its built-up areas, a range of 
attractive, healthy, safe, inclusive, and accessible places in which to 
live, work, visit and invest. 
A range of high quality new employment development will have taken 
place, making use of the Borough’s excellent transport links and its 
location between Liverpool and Greater Manchester.  Established 
employment areas will continue to provide affordable accommodation 
for a wide range of employers.  The rural economy will have been 
sustained and diversified. 
The Town Centres of St Helens and Earlestown and the Borough’s 
network of smaller centres will have adapted to changing economic 
conditions and provide a wide range of vibrant shopping, leisure, and 
other uses. 
Good quality new market and affordable housing will have been 
provided, broadening the housing stock, meeting local needs, 
providing safe and sustainable communities, and making the Borough 
a residential destination of choice.  Effective use shall have been 
made of the Borough’s stock of brownfield land to help meet these 
needs. 
The Borough’s housing will be well connected to employment areas, 
local facilities, attractions, and green spaces in a way that will 
encourage walking, cycling and the use of public transport.  Health will 
have been further improved by encouraging active lifestyles with a 
wide range of sporting, community, and leisure opportunities. 
The Borough’s unique heritage, linking to its historic role in the glass, 
rail, coal mining and other industries, and its wide range of important 
natural environmental assets will be both recognised and valued.  Its 
network of green spaces and wider cultural and leisure offer, 
epitomised by features such as the Sankey Valley, Bold Forest Park, 
‘The Dream’, St Helens Rugby League Stadium, World of Glass, and 
Haydock Racecourse, will be retained and strengthened. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

 16 4. Core Policies 
4.1 Policy LPA01: Spatial Strategy 
 
Policy LPA01: Spatial Strategy 
1. The sustainable regeneration and growth of St Helens Borough through to 
2037 and beyond will be focussed (as far as practicable, having regard to the 
availability of suitable sites) on the Key Settlements, namely St Helens Core 
Area, Blackbrook and Haydock, Newton-le-Willows and Earlestown, Rainford, 
Billinge, Garswood and Rainhill. 
2. New development will be directed to sustainable locations that are appropriate 
to its scale and nature and that will enable movements between homes, jobs 
and key services and facilities to be made by sustainable non-car modes of 
transport. 
3. The re-use of suitable previously developed land in Key Settlements will 
remain a key priority.  A substantial proportion of new housing throughout the 
Plan period will be on such sites.  This will be encouraged through the use of 
Policies LPA07 and LPC02 to support the delivery of sites, particularly those 
on Previously Developed Land, by, for example, setting lower thresholds for 
developer contributions on previously developed sites to reflect the higher 
costs and lower sales values typically associated with redeveloping such sites 
where appropriate. 
4. Comprehensive regeneration of the wider Borough will be delivered by the 
English Cities Fund Regeneration Partnership, through the provision of quality 
housing, new commercial activity, upgraded infrastructure and the overall 
improvement of the social and economic viability of the Borough on a phased 
basis. 
5. This Plan releases land from the Green Belt to enable the needs for housing 
and employment development to be met in full over the Plan period up to 
31 March 2037, in the most sustainable locations.  Other land is removed from 
the Green Belt and safeguarded to allow for longer term housing and / or 
employment needs to be met after 31 March 2037.  Such Safeguarded Land is 
not allocated for development in the Plan period and planning permission for 
permanent development should only be granted following an update of this 
Plan.  Within the remaining areas of Green Belt (shown on the Policies Map) 
new development shall be regarded as inappropriate unless it falls within one 
of the exceptions set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (or any 
successor document).  Inappropriate development in the Green Belt shall not 
be approved except in very special circumstances. Delivery of compensatory 
improvement measures within areas remaining in the Green Belt will be 
required following any release of Green Belt land for development purposes. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 17 Details of such improvements will be considered during the Development 
Management process and assessed on an individual application basis. 
6. Substantial new employment development (set out in Policy LPA03 and 
excluding town centre uses) will take place on large sites that are capable of 
accommodating large employment buildings (over 9,000m2) and are close to 
the M6 and M62.  High quality road, public transport and active travel links will 
be required between existing and proposed residential areas, particularly 
those with high deprivation levels, and areas of employment growth.  Existing 
employment areas will be retained where they are suitable and viable for this 
use in order to maintain a diverse portfolio of accessible employment 
opportunities across the Borough.  Suitable development that would diversify 
the rural economy will also be supported. 
7. Parkside West and Parkside East form transformational employment 
opportunity sites that will make a major contribution to the economic 
development of St Helens Borough, the Liverpool City Region and beyond.  
Development that prejudices their development in accordance with Policies 
LPA03, LPA09 and LPA10 will not be allowed. 
8. The preferred locations for new town centre development shall be within St 
Helens Town Centre (as the Borough’s principal town centre), Earlestown 
Town Centre, and the Borough’s network of district and local centres, in line 
with Policies LPB01, LPB02 and LPC04. 
9. The quality of life, health and wellbeing of St Helens Borough’s residents, 
workers and visitors and the quality of the natural environment will be 
supported by: 
 a) taking steps to maintain, enhance, connect and / or expand the Borough’s 
network of ecological, open space and recreational sites and greenways in 
accordance with Policy LPA08; 
 b) seeking improvements to the quality of open space within and around new 
development; 
 c) requiring new development proposals to mitigate their contribution to 
climate change and to adapt to its impacts; 
 d) supporting the delivery of landscape reclamation and improvement 
projects in locations such as the Bold Forest Park and Sankey Valley 
Park; and 
 e) requiring development to support healthy lifestyles in accordance with 
Policy LPA12. 
10. The provision of a convenient, safe, and sustainable transport network, and 
the delivery of improvements to the network, will be required in line with 
Policy LPA06. 
11. New development that would deliver regeneration within the key settlements 
and accord with other Plan policies will be supported.  Regeneration in these 
settlements will also be promoted by (in addition to the measures set out St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 18 above) focussing available resources on its effective delivery and preventing 
development that would adversely impact upon or jeopardise the delivery of 
regeneration proposals.

Strategic Aims, Objectives and Key Delivery Mechanisms 
Strategic Aims Met All 
Strategic Objectives Met All 
Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Bold Forest Park Area Action Plan 
• Development Management process 
• Funding programmes 
• St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
4.3 Reasoned Justification 
4.3.1 Policy LPA01 underpins the other policies in the Plan, setting out how 
development will be distributed across the Borough up to 2037 and 
beyond.  It aims to meet the needs of the Borough’s residents, 
businesses, workers, and visitors whilst minimising adverse impacts and 
wherever possible enhancing the natural environment. 
Sub-regional context 
4.3.2 In preparing this Plan, the Council has cooperated extensively with nearby 
districts in the Liverpool and Greater Manchester City Regions, and in 
Warrington and West Lancashire.  The following key conclusions have 
been drawn from this process: 
 None of the neighbouring districts have identified a need for St Helens 
Borough to accommodate any of their housing development needs; 
 No spare site capacity has been identified in any neighbouring local 
authority areas to accommodate any of the housing needs arising in 
the Borough; 
 A need has been identified within the Liverpool City Region as a whole 
(including St Helens Borough) to accommodate the growth of the 
logistics and warehousing sector (associated with underlying 
economic trends and the growth of the port of Liverpool), with a 
particular focus on the need for large scale units of over 9,000m2; 
 Warrington Council has identified scope for a site at Omega South 
West within St Helens Borough to be developed to help meet its 
employment needs; 
 All of the immediately neighbouring districts to St Helens Borough 
have (due to restrictions on the supply of land in their existing urban 
areas) recently undertaken or are in the process of undertaking Green 
Belt reviews to meet their development needs. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 19 Key Settlements and spatial areas in St Helens Borough 
4.3.3 The largest settlements within the Borough provide, or are large enough to 
provide, a range of facilities and services to meet many day to day 
household needs and are shown on the Key Diagram as Key Settlements.  
The Key Settlements are of varying scales and roles as follows. 
Key Settlements and spatial areas 
 St Helens Core Area  – centred around the Principal Town Centre of St 
Helens and including the surrounding built up area from Moss Bank in the 
North, Clock Face to the South, Eccleston to the West and Parr and Sutton to 
the East, it forms the largest Key Settlement of the Borough. 
 It includes St Helens Central Spatial Area – an area immediately surrounding 
St Helens Town Centre, including industrial and business areas and the 
Ravenhead and St Helens out-of-centre retail parks. 
 Blackbrook and Haydock  – located to the east of St Helens Core Area, this 
Key Settlement contains the significant Haydock Industrial Estate and the local 
centre of Clipsley Lane. 
 Newton-le-Willows and Earlestown  – the largest distinct Key Settlement 
after the Core Area, and contains Earlestown Town Centre, known for its 
markets, and the local centre of Newton. 
 Rainford – the largest village in the north of the Borough, this Key Settlement 
contains a local shopping centre and also acts as a service centre for the 
distinct settlement of Rainford Junction to the north (where there is a train 
station with links to Wigan and Liverpool). 
 Billinge – a village that forms a Key Settlement in the north of the Borough 
with a distinct shopping centre. 
 Garswood – a village in the north of the Borough that has some shops and 
services.  Whilst it has no distinct central shopping / service centre it is large 
enough to form a Key Settlement. 
 Rainhill – a village in the south of the Borough with a local centre that is 
physically linked to neighbouring urban areas and is a Key Settlement. 
Other settlements 
The following are not Key Settlements, have only limited opportunities for 
development, and require sustainable transport links to the Key Settlements and 
employment sites to be maintained and enhanced: St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 20  Rainford Junction  – a satellite settlement that is physically separate from 
Rainford but functionally reliant on Rainford for day-to-day services and is 
excluded from the Green Belt. 
 Crank – a small village / hamlet to the north of the Borough, with a tightly 
defined developed area, that is excluded from the Green Belt. 
 Bold Heath  – a small village / hamlet in the south of the Borough with an open 
low density character that is ‘washed over’ by the Green Belt. 
 Kings Moss  – a small village / hamlet to the north of the Borough that has 
weak boundaries around it and is ‘washed over’ by the Green Belt. 
Development needs in St Helens Borough 
4.3.4 The Borough has economic activity and employment rates, skills levels 
and average wages that are below national averages.  Recent rates of 
employment development and investment have been substantially below 
those achieved in the 1990s.  It has also become clear that the existing 
available stock of employment land and premises in St Helens Borough is 
not sufficient in terms of amount, site size, site location and site 
characteristics to meet market requirements, leading to missed investment 
and job opportunities. 
4.3.5 The Borough is, however, well placed to provide new employment, 
including helping to address the sub-regional need for large scale logistics 
development, due to its location close to the M6, M62 and A580 and to 
major north-south and trans-Pennine rail routes.  There is also a unique 
opportunity to develop land at Parkside for rail-enabled and other 
employment development.  The needs for employment development are 
set out in further detail in Policy LPA03. 
4.3.6 This Plan addresses these issues by providing sufficient employment land 
on a variety of sites to meet the needs of modern businesses.  This will 
encourage inward investment, allow businesses to expand, retain and 
create jobs, and increase employment rates.  It will also enable St Helens 
Borough’s residents to work closer to home and so reduce the currently 
extensive numbers of people who need to commute to other locations or 
move away to find work.  The Plan’s approach accords with that of the 
Liverpool City Region growth strategy. 
4.3.7 The Borough also has a substantial need for new housing development 
that is linked to demographic needs and the need to provide sufficient 
housing to support employment growth.  The primary focus of new 
housing development in recent years has been on Previously Developed 
Land (‘PDL’ or ‘brownfield land’) in urban areas.  Such locations tend to be 
well served by existing infrastructure and services and can be developed 
whilst minimising impact on the environment outside urban areas.  
However, every update of the St Helens Strategic Housing Land 
Availability Assessment (SHLAA) since 2010 has found that there is St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 21 inadequate land in the urban areas to meet housing needs in the longer 
term.  Housing needs are set out in further detail in Policy LPA04. 
Figure 4.1: Key Settlements Plan 
 
Spatial Strategy for meeting development needs (including Green Belt review) 
4.3.8 The Council aims to ensure that the housing and employment needs of St 
Helens are met in full within the Borough.  New development will be 
guided towards sustainable locations, generally within, on the edge of, or 
close to Key Settlements (insofar as this is acceptable and practicable).  
This approach will take account of environmental and infrastructure 
constraints; the need to maintain an effective Green Belt; settlement size; 
projected future population growth; past rates of housing delivery in 
relation to settlement size; and the availability of services and facilities. 
4.3.9 The Council will also give continued priority to the development of suitable 
and available sites within urban areas.  However, due to the lack of 
sufficient capacity on these sites to meet needs, and the lack of any scope 
to help meet the Borough’s needs in any neighbouring district, some sites 
on the edges of existing settlements have been removed from the Green 
Belt by this Plan and allocated for development in the period up to 2037.  
Some other sites have been removed from the Green Belt but, rather than 
being allocated for development, have been safeguarded to meet potential 
longer term development needs after 2037.  This will ensure that the 
changes to the Green Belt endure well beyond 2037, avoiding the need for 
another Green Belt review for a substantial period, and giving a clear 
indication of the potential location of future development and associated 
infrastructure needs. 
St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 22 4.3.10 The Council’s SHLAA indicates that there is capacity for substantial 
housing development on urban sites.  However, it also established that 
Green Belt release would be required to help meet identified housing 
needs over the Plan period.  Likewise, there is a significant shortfall in the 
urban supply of employment land against the identified needs. 
4.3.11 In view of the NPPF advice that local authorities work jointly with 
neighbouring authorities to meet any development requirements that 
cannot be met within their own boundaries, it should be noted that whilst 
St Helens shares a housing market area with Halton and Warrington, both 
have identified shortages of urban land supply for housing.  St Helens 
Borough shares a functional economic market area with Halton, Knowsley, 
Liverpool, Sefton, West Lancashire, and Wirral, none of which have 
identified spare capacity for employment development which could help 
meet the needs of St Helens.  Such is the shortage of employment and 
housing development land in the surrounding areas as a whole that 
several authorities (Knowsley, Sefton, and West Lancashire Councils) 
have successfully undertaken local Green Belt reviews to meet their own 
needs, with further authorities also undertaking them (collectively covering 
the whole of Greater Manchester, Halton, Warrington, and Wirral).  None 
of these reviews have identified surplus capacity to help meet 
development needs arising in St Helens. 
4.3.12 In addition, there are other reasons why it is not desirable for housing or 
employment development needs arising in St Helens to be met in other 
authorities.  If a neighbouring authority were able to meet such needs, this 
would (due to the shortage of urban land supply identified in those areas) 
be through the release of Green Belt, i.e. the prospective loss of Green 
Belt in St Helens would simply be replaced by a similar loss of Green Belt 
elsewhere.  This would also lead to a risk that residents would need to 
move out of the Borough, potentially resulting in the loss of economically 
active residents within local communities.  Such an approach would also 
be unlikely to guarantee delivery of affordable or special housing needs for 
residents of St Helens.  If demand for new employment was required to be 
met outside the Borough, it would tend to exacerbate net out-commuting.  
This would prejudice the achievement of sustainable patterns of travel and 
make it more difficult for residents of St Helens, some of whom are likely 
to be reliant on public transport to access employment. 
4.3.13 For all of these reasons, there are considered to be exceptional 
circumstances at the strategic level to justify the release of Green Belt 
land to meet identified development needs. 
4.3.14 The sites that have been removed from the Green Belt have been 
selected following a comprehensive Green Belt Review.  This has 
identified sites on the basis of their scope to be developed whilst 
minimising harm to the overall function of the Green Belt, and their 
suitability for development in other respects.  The criteria used have 
included their physical suitability for development, accessibility by 
sustainable transport modes to services and facilities, levels of existing or 
potential future infrastructure provision, their economic viability for 
development, and the impact that their development would have on the 
environment.  Further details of this process are set out in the St Helens St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 23 Green Belt Review 2018.  Small changes have also been made to the 
boundary of the Green Belt to amend minor anomalies, for example where 
the original Green Belt boundary no longer follows the edge of the built up 
area. 
4.3.15 New employment development falling within use classes B2, B8 and for 
light industrial, offices and research and development uses will be 
primarily focussed on large previously undeveloped sites in close proximity 
to the M6 and M62 in order to meet modern requirements and market 
demand.  Due to their peripheral location, improved road, public transport 
and active travel links will be required between these sites and residential 
areas in the Key Settlements, in particular to provide links to the proposed 
new employment areas from areas of deprivation.  Existing employment 
areas will be retained and protected through Policy LPA03 to maintain a 
distribution of accessible employment sites across the Borough unless 
they are no longer suitable and viable for this use. 
4.3.16 The interconnected sites of Parkside West and East benefit from a 
location at the heart of the north-west motorway network and access to the 
national rail freight network, presenting an opportunity to provide an 
employment development that will act as a link to the Southern English 
ports and Europe, as well as supporting the growth of the Liverpool 
SuperPort.  Policies LPA03, LPA03.1, LPA09 and LPA10 set out details of 
the proposed development of these sites.  The Council will also support 
steps to improve transport linkages between Parkside, the rest of the 
Borough and surrounding areas to facilitate sustainable access for the 
workforce. 
Protection of remaining areas of Green Belt from inappropriate development 
4.3.17 Following the adoption of this Plan, over half of the land area of the 
Borough will remain in the Green Belt.  Land remaining in the Green Belt 
will continue to be strictly protected from inappropriate development, such 
as most forms of housing and employment development, in accordance 
with national policy. 
4.3.18 The Government attaches great importance to the protection of the Green 
Belt, with the fundamental aim being to prevent urban sprawl by keeping 
land permanently open.  The essential characteristics of Green Belt 
include its openness and permanence.  The NPPF sets out the purposes 
of Green Belt, which are: 
“a)  to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas; 
b) to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another; 
c) to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment; 
d) to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and 
e) to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of 
derelict and other urban land.” 
4.3.19 Many forms of development are classified as being inappropriate within 
the Green Belt.  Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the 
Green Belt and will not be approved except in very special circumstances.  
Very special circumstances will not exist unless the potential harm to the St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 24 Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly 
outweighed by other considerations. 
4.3.20 In addition, the Council aims to protect and enhance remaining areas of 
Green Belt by seeking the delivery of compensatory improvement 
measures. In accordance with paragraph 142 of the NPPF, delivery of 
compensatory improvement measures will be sought when sites are 
released from the Green Belt for development as part of this Plan. Such 
measures should enhance the environmental quality and accessibility of 
the remaining Green Belt land, amongst other improvements. Further 
guidance is provided within the National Planning Practice Guidance 
(Green Belt Land). 
4.3.21 The delivery of compensatory improvements will be supported by a 
number of policies within this Plan.  For example, policies LPA08, LPC05-
10 and LPC12 all have an environmental focus, which will support the 
delivery of Green Belt compensatory measures.  Additionally, 
Development Management focussed policies, including LPD01-03 and 
LPD09 will support this. 
4.3.22 Beyond the policy framework in this Plan to support the delivery of Green 
Belt compensatory measures, as well as other development plan 
documents, such as the Bold Forest Park AAP, the Council will continue to 
build on project improvements delivered to date.  Improvements include 
those at the strategic level, such as at Bold Forest Park, for example the 
expansion of tree cover and the delivery of improved recreational facilities.  
A further strategic level project is the Sankey Valley Corridor Nature 
Improvement Area (NIA), which is focussed on enhancing the aquatic 
environment as well as the surrounding natural environment within the 
catchment, and improvements in environmental management practices.  
Improvements in this location have included accessibility enhancements, 
including walking, and cycling infrastructure and new signage, enabling 
increased access to the Green Belt for residents and visitors.  It is 
expected that further improvements can be delivered at these two 
strategic projects as part of Green Belt compensatory measures. 
4.3.23 There are further sites around the Borough that could be improved as part 
of Green Belt compensatory measures including those which form part of 
the Knowsley and St Helens Mosslands Nature Improvement Area (NIA), 
comprising three sites in the north of the Borough, near Rainford, one by 
Parr and one by Newton-le-Willows (see appendix 9).  In addition, there 
are many Local Wildlife Sites (LWS) in the Borough, which are identified 
on the Policies Map, and appendix 8 of this Plan shows that there are 
several LWS in each ward of the Borough, with many of these wards 
having LWS in the Green Belt.  There are also three Local Nature 
Reserves located within the Green Belt. Compensatory measures can also 
occur at non-designated sites within the Green Belt, for example, 
initiatives related to alleviating the effects of flooding events, such as those 
implemented previously in the settlement of King’s Moss.  Therefore, there 
are clear opportunities for localised Green Belt compensatory measures to 
be delivered on such designated and non-designated sites across the 
entire Borough through the delivery of environmental improvements, in 
addition to the two identified strategic sites referred to above. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 25 The role of town, district and local centres 
4.3.24 The Plan also aims to support existing town, district, and local centres by 
preventing new development outside their boundaries that may harm their 
vitality and viability.  Proposals for new retail and other town centre uses 
will be focussed towards existing centres appropriate to their type and 
scale, thereby maximising their accessibility by existing public transport 
and active travel provision and facilitating linked trips.  The preferred 
location for new comparison retail and intensive town centre leisure 
development will be St Helens Town Centre.  Further details of these 
matters are set out in Policies LPB01, LPB02 and LPC04. 
Green infrastructure 
4.3.25 Within and outside the Key Settlements open space and greenways 
provide spaces for nature, opportunities for recreation, exercise and 
relaxation, ecological linkages, and active travel routes.  Open spaces and 
landscaping, including those provided within development sites also 
provide opportunities to adapt to climate change by storing flood water, 
reducing urban heat islands, capturing carbon, and improving air quality 
and therefore support the Council’s Climate Change Emergency 
declaration.  Whilst public funding support to create and manage open 
spaces, flood water storage and greenways is limited, the development of 
sites for housing or employment uses, including on sites released from the 
Green Belt, is likely to present opportunities for such provision. 
Transport provision 
4.3.26 This Plan aims to protect existing transport infrastructure and secure 
improvements to provide efficient travel linkages within the Borough and to 
link the Borough with other areas.  It also seeks to ensure that 
development does not prevent improvements to Junction 23 of the M6 and 
other road and public transport infrastructure from being implemented.  
Enhancing linkages between areas of deprivation and employment areas 
particularly by public transport, walking and cycling is a key priority.  Such 
enhancement of sustainable transport modes further supports the 
Council’s Climate Change Emergency declaration through the promotion 
of active and low carbon travel opportunities. Further details of the Plan’s 
approach to transport issues are set out in Policy LPA06. 
Supporting regeneration 
4.3.27 As a priority, the Council will continue to work to support the 
redevelopment of brownfield sites in the urban area.   
4.3.28 The Council has entered into a formal partnership agreement with the 
English Cities Fund as the Council’s preferred strategic partner to ensure 
the delivery of a Borough wide regeneration strategy, including economic 
regeneration and housing. The Council has recognised that a new 
approach to growing the economy of the Borough is required that seeks to 
work pro-actively with the private sector and establish a strategic 
partnership maximising the opportunities presented to deliver significant 
future growth in St Helens and deliver key priorities including Town Centre 
regeneration, social wellbeing and providing appropriate infrastructure to 
support future development. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 26 4.3.29 Furthermore, as part of the ‘Town Deal’ initiative established by the 
Government in 2019, the Council has successfully secured significant 
investment of up to £25 million. This funding will be used to help increase 
economic growth with a focus on land use and regeneration, improved 
connectivity (both transport and better broadband connectivity), skills and 
employment, and heritage, arts, and culture for St Helens Town Centre. 
4.3.30 The Council will prepare SPDs covering specific areas to help implement 
regeneration where this is considered necessary. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Policy LPA03: A Strong and Sustainable Economy 
1. The Council will work with partner organisations to: 
 a) help meet the Liverpool City Region’s needs for economic growth, job 
creation and skills development; 
 b) maximise the economic opportunities presented by St Helens Borough’s 
location in relation to strategic road and rail routes; 
 c) ensure the necessary infrastructure is provided to support business needs 
(see Policy LPA07);  
 d) support the creation of and expansion of small businesses; and 
 e) support businesses and organisations in the economic recovery and 
renewal from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
2. The Council will aim to deliver a minimum of 173.24 hectares of land for 
employment development between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2037 to meet 
the needs of St Helens Borough. 
3. The sites as shown in Table 4.1 and on the Policies Map are allocated for 
development for the employment uses indicated. 
4. Proposals to develop or re-develop any of the above allocated sites for uses 
not listed in Table 4.1 will be refused, unless it has been demonstrated that: 
 a) the site is no longer both suitable and viable for an employment use 
identified in Table 4.1; and 
 b) the site has been offered for employment use on the open market at a 
reasonable price in a manner and for a period agreed with the Council; and 
 c) the results of the marketing exercise have been transparently shared with 
the Council; and 
 d) no employment use can be delivered as part of a mixed-use scheme on 
the site. 
5. Other sites and buildings that are currently or were last used for employment 
use (or for sui generis use generating employment), including those in the 
employment areas listed in appendix 5, will be protected from changes to 
other uses, unless justified.  Changes of use of such sites and buildings will be 
justified and permitted where it is demonstrated either that: 
 a) the land or building (or any part of it) is no longer suitable and 
economically viable for light industrial, offices and research and 
development, B2 or B8 uses in accordance with the Local Economy 
Supplementary Planning Document; or St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 32  b) the land use planning benefits of the proposed development would 
outweigh the benefits of retaining the site or building in its existing use 
(including vacant buildings and sites). 
6. Proposals for the re-use, re-configuration, or re-development for light 
industrial, offices and research and development, B2 or B8 uses of land or 
buildings used for light industrial, offices and research and development, B2 or 
B8 uses (including where such proposals would lead to a more intensive use 
of the land or buildings) will be supported, subject to compliance with other 
policies in the Plan. 
7. Proposals for Class E uses in locations outside a defined centre will be subject 
to a condition to prohibit town centre uses (as defined in the glossary of the 
NPPF) unless the requirements of Policy LPC04 are satisfied. 
8. The Council will support proposals to help diversify the rural economy, 
including through the re-use of suitable buildings in rural areas for appropriate 
employment uses, subject to other policies in the Plan. 
9. The Council will support the protection, creation, enhancement and expansion 
of tourism, cultural and visitor resources, facilities, and attractions by 
favourably considering proposals that are appropriate to the local character 
and appearance of the area and that will: 
 i) increase the range and quality of the accommodation offer in the Borough: 
or 
 ii) enhance an existing tourist or visitor attraction; or 
 iii) attract investment to the Borough and create or safeguard jobs; or 
 iv) enable the economic or physical regeneration of a site or area; or 
 v) improve the quality and diversity of the Borough’s visitor offer; or 
 vi) help to maintain existing natural, historical, or cultural assets. 
10. The Council will prevent the unjustified loss of existing tourism, cultural and 
visitor resources and assets. 
11. The Council will support the use of local suppliers of goods and services and 
the creation of apprenticeships and training opportunities for local people in 
accordance with the requirements of the Local Economy Supplementary 
Planning Document. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

 St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 34 4.9 Reasoned Justification 
4.9.1 The Council’s City Growth Strategy (2008-18) and Council Plan 2017-
2020 recognise the need to work in partnership with local communities 
and businesses to deliver economic growth, to strengthen the local 
business base, and to increase aspiration, skills, and employment in the 
Borough. 
4.9.2 The Local Plan’s vision still stands true as we plan for recovery from the 
COVID-19 pandemic: By 2037, St Helens Borough will provide through the 
balanced regeneration and sustainable growth of its built-up areas, a 
range of attractive, healthy, safe, inclusive, and accessible places in which 
to live, work, visit and invest. Key to this is a continued focus on the 
economy, so that St Helens residents are able to access good quality jobs 
that raise their living standards, whilst also improving physical and mental 
health.   
4.9.3 It is anticipated that the English Cities Fund Regeneration Partnership and 
the Council’s successful Town Deal funding bid will also assist in the post 
COVID-19 economic recovery. 
4.9.4 The provision of new well-located employment land and floorspace is 
essential to the Borough's future economic prosperity.  Policy LPA03 
therefore allocates sufficient land to meet anticipated development needs 
within the light industrial, offices and research and development uses, B2 
(general industrial) and B8 (storage and distribution) use classes during 
the Plan period.  The NPPF requires the Council to plan for and 
accommodate all foreseeable types of economic growth.  Policy LPA03 
therefore identifies a range of locations, types, and sizes of employment 
sites to meet the needs of specific sectors of the business community and 
to protect existing areas where employment continues to be the most 
appropriate use. 
Liverpool City Region 
4.9.5 St Helens Borough’s economy is inextricably linked to that of the wider 
Liverpool City Region.  The Council will continue to work alongside its City 
Region partners to take full advantage of the continued growth of the City 
Region and to help deliver the economic growth, job creation, and skills 
development aspirations outlined in the Liverpool City Region Growth 
Strategy (2016) and Strategic Economic Plan (2016). 
 
15 Sites 2EA, 3EA, 10EA, and 11EA were either completed or under construction during the Local Plan Examination and have therefore been  removed 
from the Local Plan allocations and have been counted in either the completions or existing deliverable supply figures as at 31st March 2021. 
16 The phrases B2 and B8 in Policy LPA03 refer to use classes in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). 
17 The Parkside East site has a gross area of approximately 124.55ha, of which at least 60ha is reserved for development of a Strategic Rail Freight 
Interchange or other rail enabled use (see Policy LPA09).  The indicative site area of 64.55ha represents the remainder of the site which may be 
developed for a wider range of employment uses subject to compliance with Policy LPA09. A further 5.58ha of land is included (to the west of the M6) 
to facilitate the provision of rail access to the site from the north. 
18 79.57ha of land is allocated for employment use at the Parkside West site (Policy LPA10).  This area excludes the 5.58ha of land which is required 
to facilitate rail access to site 7EA and a further 12.1ha that is occupied by a spoil heap which is not considered developable. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 35 Employment Land Requirement 
4.9.6 The NPPF requires the Local Plan to address objectively assessed needs 
(OAN) for economic development, taking account of market intelligence, 
market signals and the locational needs of different types of business. 
4.9.7 The Council’s Employment Land Needs Study (ELNS) 2015 and the ELNS 
Addendum Report (2017) indicate that the Borough, due to its location on 
the M6 and M62 motorways, is ideally positioned to provide a critical role 
in the North West large-scale logistics and distribution sector.  The ELNS 
suggests that whilst traditionally St Helens Borough has been a 
manufacturing centre, with the largest land uses including class B2 
(general industrial) operations, a strong shift to B8 (storage and 
distribution) uses is expected to occur during the Plan period. 
4.9.8 The ELNS Addendum Report identified employment land OAN on the 
basis of historic trends, the need for a 5-year buffer to ensure choice and 
flexibility, and the potential for SuperPort19 and a future Strategic Rail 
Freight Interchange (SRFI) at the former Parkside Colliery to increase 
demand for employment land in the Borough, particularly in the large-scale 
logistics sector.  It identifies an employment land OAN of up to 239ha from 
201220 to 2037.  It also splits this overall need indicatively into individual 
use types, based on sectoral forecasts from Cambridge Econometrics and 
Oxford Economics and the market drivers underpinning local employment 
land demand, as set out in Table 4.2. 
Table 4.2: St Helens Borough Estimated Employment Land Needs 2012-2037 
 
4.9.9 Based on the ELNS Addendum Report, the OAN requirement for 2012-
2037 has been calculated as a minimum of 239ha as shown in Table 4.3.  
This figure has been calculated by projecting forward the historic 5.8ha per 
annum growth scenario for the 1997-2012 period (referred to in the ELNS 
Addendum Report) from the base date of 2012 to the end date of the Plan 
(2037), and then adding a 5 year buffer to the baseline OAN (to ensure 
 
19 SuperPort is the collective name given to the enhancement of sea and air ports and freight facilities along the River Mersey and Manchester Ship 
Canal. It includes the new Liverpool 2 deep water container port at Seaforth. 
20 The ELNS Addendum Report uses a forecasting base date of 2012, as there is evidence to suggest that take-up rates since then have been 
suppressed by a restricted land supply. Therefore there is a risk that the inclusion of post-2012 take-up rates would distort the historic baseline for 
predicting needs. Employment Type Hectares

4.9.10 The residual requirement for employment land (i.e., the minimum supply 
from new sites that must be provided for in the Plan) has then been 
calculated by allowing for take-up of employment land since 2012 against 
the OAN (239ha) and the existing supply of developable employment land 
in the Borough as shown in Table 4.4.  Once an allowance of 60.77ha for 
take up and 4.99ha for the existing developable employment land supply 
in the Borough has been applied the residual requirement is 173.24ha.

 37 4.9.11 The above residual requirement figure includes no allowance for replacing 
employment land lost to other uses between 2012 and 2037.  This 
approach is in line with the ELNS Addendum Report and is because the 
land take-up scenarios (from which the OAN is derived) are based on 
employment land gains only.  It also cannot be assumed that losses of, for 
example, employment land that is not readily developable for employment 
uses and / or that has been vacant for a long time, need to be replaced. 
The Liverpool City Region Strategic Housing and Employment Land Assessment 
(SHELMA) 
4.9.12 The draft Liverpool City Region Strategic Housing and Employment Land 
Assessment (SHELMA) - published for stakeholder consultation in 
October 2017 -considers the need for employment development across 7 
local authorities in the Liverpool City Region and West Lancashire.  
Together these authority areas are identified as the Functional Economic 
Market Area (FEMA). 
4.9.13 The draft SHELMA identifies that, across the FEMA as a whole, at least 
397ha of land is required for large scale B8 development (capable of 
accommodating units of over 9,000m2) between 2012 and 2037.  
However, it does not apportion this need between local authority areas as 
it states that such apportionment should be guided by the distribution of 
suitable sites.  The draft SHELMA also assesses the need for light 
industrial, offices and research and development, B2 and for smaller scale 
B8 development (of less than 9,000m2).  Unlike those for large scale B8 
uses these needs are apportioned at a district level, and for St Helens 
Borough are identified as totalling at least 61.4ha of land between 2012 
and 2037. 
4.9.14 Following the finalisation of the SHELMA, the Council will continue to work 
collaboratively with the Liverpool City Region and West Lancashire 
authorities in order to progress the matters addressed within it including 
the required distribution of land for large scale B8 warehousing.  Whilst the 
residual employment land needs in the Borough identified in Table 4.4 
(totalling 173.24ha) cover a different time period to the SHELMA they will 
be sufficient to both meet the Borough’s needs for light industrial, offices 
and research and development, B2 and small scale B8 uses and a 
substantial proportion of the sub-regional need for large scale B8 uses 
identified to date in the FEMA as a whole.  This reflects the strategic 
location of St Helens Borough in relation to the motorway and rail 
networks linking the Liverpool City Region to the rest of the country. 
Employment Land Allocations 
4.9.15 To strengthen the local economy, St Helens Borough needs to build on 
those sectors where the Borough enjoys a competitive advantage.  As 
identified above one such sector is logistics and distribution, where the 
Borough’s location in relation to the M6 and M62 motorways and the rail 
network makes it particularly attractive for development.  Market needs for 
the large-scale distribution sector (for units of above 9,000m2) generally 
focus on sites of 5ha or above and this has been reflected in the size of 
sites selected for release from the Green Belt and allocation for 
employment use in this Plan. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 38 4.9.16 The total supply of allocated employment sites will (at 182.31ha – 
excluding site 1EA) slightly exceed the residual employment land 
requirement identified in Table 4.4.  However, this is justified by: 
i) the need to reverse the suppression of employment land take-up the 
Borough has experienced since 2005, caused by an inadequate supply of 
market attractive sites; and 
ii) the need to provide flexibility to respond to any requirement to meet B8 
strategic land needs resulting from the SHELMA, over and above that 
identified in the ELNS Addendum Report and factored into the 
employment land requirement. 
Helping to meet Warrington’s Employment Land Needs 
4.9.17 St Helens and Warrington Councils have identified, under the duty to 
cooperate, that the emerging Warrington Local Plan is unlikely to be able 
to accommodate all of Warrington’s employment land needs for 2017-
2037 within its administrative boundary.  St Helens Borough Council has 
therefore agreed to allocate 31.22ha (site 1EA) of land adjoining the 
existing Omega South employment area to help Warrington Council to 
meet these needs. 
Alternative Uses on Employment Sites 
4.9.18 To ensure the development of the proposed employment allocations for 
the identified employment uses, the Council will require any applications 
for alternative uses to demonstrate that the site has been marketed for 
employment use on the open market for a minimum period of 18 months.  
Only after this period, and subject to no interest being received for the 
identified employment uses, will an application for an alternative use be 
considered further. This applies to site allocations within the Plan, as well 
as those sites contributing to meeting identified employment needs over 
the Plan Period, including but not limited to land at Florida Farm North, 
Land north of Penny Lane, Land at Lea Green Farm West and Gerards 
Park, College Street. 
4.9.19 Existing employment sites in urban areas will still have an important role to 
play in accommodating employment development during the Plan period.  
Policy LPA03 therefore seeks to protect the employment role of such sites.  
During the Plan period however some older employment areas may 
become no longer suitable for this use or may have an altered economic 
role.  Alternative uses on existing or former employment sites may be 
acceptable where continued employment use would be unacceptable on 
environmental grounds, or where the site is not well located in relation to 
the transport network or surrounding land uses, or where the community 
benefits of the proposed development would outweigh the potential loss of 
employment on the site caused by ceasing an existing use.  The 
community benefits of a scheme could be wide-ranging, and it is the 
responsibility of the applicant to clearly set out these benefits to support 
their proposal.  The Council will determine the significance of community 
benefits of proposals on a case-by-case basis. 
4.9.20 Alternative uses may also be appropriate where there is no current or 
likely future market demand for employment uses on the site and / or its St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 39 reuse for such purposes would not be viable currently or in the long term.  
The Local Economy SPD (2013) outlines the evidence applicants will be 
required to provide in relation to the marketing and viability of employment 
sites before their loss for other uses can be supported. This outlines the 
requirement for existing employment sites to carry out a minimum of 12 
months marketing for employment uses in order to identify that the site is 
not viable in the long-term. 
Use of Local Suppliers and Training and Education 
4.9.21 The St Helens City Growth Strategy aims to increase economic activity.  
The Council will seek to achieve this by helping applicants and the end 
users of suitable development schemes, for example by directing them to 
local recruitment services and apprenticeship schemes and to sources of 
information on local suppliers of goods and services.  Applicants will also 
be encouraged to provide training and job opportunities for local people 
and to use locally sourced goods and services in line with the guidance in 
the Local Economy SPD (2013). 
Green Belt Exceptional Circumstances 
4.9.22 The following paragraphs articulate the exceptional circumstances 
justifying the removal of land from the Green Belt on a site-by-site basis.  
This builds on the exceptional circumstances strategic case as set out in 
the Reasoned Justification to Policy LPA01, and the following should be 
read in that context. 
1EA – Omega South Western Extension, Land north of Finches Plantation, Bold 
4.9.23 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel reflecting this site to 
make a ‘medium’ contribution to the Green Belt purposes as whilst the site 
contains no inappropriate development and has open views across it, it is 
bordered by large scale-built development at Omega South and the M62, 
and therefore only has a moderate countryside character.  The Review 
also found the site to have ‘medium’ development potential. 
4.9.24 The site is adjacent to the Borough’s boundary with Warrington Borough, 
and its development would form a natural extension of the adjacent 
Omega employment site.  This is particularly important in relation to the 
exceptional circumstances in the context of this site being allocated to help 
meet Warrington’s employment needs. 
4.9.25 The site is within 1km of an area within the 20% most deprived population 
in the UK, so its development for employment uses would help to reduce 
poverty and social exclusion.  Further, the development of this site, 
provides the opportunity to improve sustainable transport links between St 
Helens and this site, as well as the wider Omega employment site, 
improving access to jobs in this location for residents of St Helens. 
4EA – Land south of Penny Lane, Haydock 
4.9.26 This site forms a relatively small part of a larger parcel of land that the 
Green Belt Review (2018) found to make a ‘medium’ contribution to the 
purposes of the Green Belt, with ‘good’ development potential.  It should 
be noted that the parcel of land assessed in the Green Belt Review 
included the land to both the north and south of Penny Lane.  In this St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 40 context, a significant part of the assessed Green Belt parcel (11.05ha) has 
an extant planning permission for employment development, of which the 
majority has now been developed.  This is the land to the north of Penny 
Lane.  The site forms a natural extension to the Haydock Industrial Estate.  
Indeed, given the development of land to the north of Penny Lane, this site 
is now surrounded by built development of the Haydock Industrial Estate 
to the north, east and south, and the M6 to the west.  The site is also 
located in close proximity to an area that falls within the 20% most 
deprived population in the UK.  Therefore, its development for employment 
use would help to reduce poverty and social exclusion.  The development 
would also reduce the need to travel by making best use of existing 
transport infrastructure due to its location close to a high frequency bus 
service. 
5EA – Land to the West of Haydock Industrial Estate, Haydock 
4.9.27 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of land reflecting this 
site to make a ‘medium’ contribution to the Green Belt purposes.  The site 
adjoins the large built-up area of Haydock but is relatively well contained 
and strategic gaps between Haydock and elsewhere could still be 
maintained following the release of this site from the Green Belt.  The 
Review also found the site to have ‘good’ development potential.  The 
removal of this site from the Green Belt in conjunction with site 6EA, and 
the now developed employment land at Florida Farm North presents the 
opportunity to provide a stronger, more robust boundary in this location.  
The site is located within 1km of an area falling within the 20% most 
deprived population in the UK.  Its development for employment use would 
help reduce poverty and social exclusion and help reduce the need to 
travel through making best use of existing transport infrastructure due to 
its location close to a high frequency bus service. 
6EA – Land West of Millfield Lane, south of Liverpool Road and north of Clipsley 
Brook, Haydock 
4.9.28 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of land reflecting this 
site to make a ‘medium’ contribution to the Green Belt purposes.  At the 
time the Green Belt Review was undertaken, this site did not adjoin a large 
built-up area, but was considered in part to prevent ribbon development 
along Liverpool Road.  Since that time, employment development at 
Florida Farm North has taken place adjacent the southern boundary of the 
site.  This site would form a natural extension to the Haydock Industrial 
Estate, and its development would provide a stronger, more robust Green 
Belt boundary.  The site is located within 1km of an area falling within the 
20% most deprived population in the UK.  Its development for employment 
use would help reduce poverty and social exclusion. 
7EA – Parkside East, Newton-le-Willows 
4.9.29 The Green Belt Review (2018) found this site to make a ‘high+’ 
contribution to the Green Belt purposes due to its significant size, lack of 
enclosure to the east and strong countryside character with little 
inappropriate development.  On this basis, the site would not ordinarily 
have progressed to further assessment.  However, the Review 
acknowledged that the site forms part of the wider Parkside site, straddling St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 41 the M6, for which there has been a long history of developer interest, 
including a planning application for a Strategic Rail Freight Interchange 
(SRFI), the area being highlighted as a potential location for an inter-
modal freight terminal in the previous North West RSS and the Core 
Strategy (2012) identifying the site as a strategic location for a SRFI.  
Furthermore, the evidence in the Parkside Logistics and Rail Freight 
Interchange Study (August 2016) found the site to be of regional and 
national significance in relation to regional and national policy, market 
demand and the need to deliver new and improved SRFIs, with the site’s 
opportunity for rail access to be second to none in the North West. 
4.9.30 This site has excellent locational advantages in relation to the delivery of a 
SRFI and major warehousing and industrial development, including 
accessibility by rail with north-south and east-west routes immediately 
adjacent, as well as proximity to the M6, Junction 22.  The evidence also 
indicates that the site is of a sufficiently large scale and layout to provide 
the necessary operational requirements of a SRFI.  The development of a 
SRFI on this site would support the Government’s policy to move freight 
from road to rail. 
4.9.31 Therefore, whilst development of this site could have a high impact on the 
Green Belt, there are exceptional circumstances justifying its release from 
the Green Belt for development as a SRFI (as well as other forms of B2 
and B8 employment use, in principle, provided it is rail served or is of a 
layout and scale that does not prejudice the ability to develop an 
effectively laid out SRFI on at least 60ha of the site), and the site is 
considered to have ‘good’ development potential.  Additionally, Parkside 
has been included as one of three Tax Sites as part of the Liverpool City 
Region Freeport.  Also, as part of the Secretary of State planning 
approvals made in respect of the Parkside Link Road in 2021, the 
Secretary of State acknowledged that development at Parkside will deliver 
significant economic, regeneration and sustainability benefits. 
8EA – Parkside West, Newton-le-Willows 
4.9.32 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land reflecting this site 
boundary to make a ‘medium’ overall contribution to the Green Belt 
purposes, influenced by the relatively high degree of enclosure, brownfield 
status of part of the site (former colliery and associated uses) and because 
it does not have a strong sense of openness or countryside character.  It 
also found the site to have ‘good’ development potential.  Its scale and 
location, particularly in relation to the transport network, makes it ideal for 
employment uses to meet the identified employment needs.  It will also 
support the delivery of the SRFI on Parkside East (site 7EA). 
4.9.33 The site is located within 1km of an area within the 20% most deprived 
population in the UK, so not only will development of the site bring wider 
economic benefits, but it will also help to reduce poverty and social 
exclusion, and due to its public transport links, would help to reduce the 
need to travel by car. 
4.9.34 The relevance of paragraph 142 of the NPPF should also be noted given 
the importance of giving “first consideration to land which has been 
previously developed and / or is well-served by public transport” when a St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 42 conclusion has been reached that it is necessary to release Green Belt 
land for development.  The exceptional circumstances for removing land 
from the Green Belt to meet identified development needs is set out in the 
Reasoned Justification to Policy LPA01 and given the brownfield nature of 
much of this site, and for the other reasons set out, there are exceptional 
circumstances justifying the removal of this site from the Green Belt. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 43 4.10 Policy LPA03.1: Strategic Employment Sites 
Policy LPA03.1:  Strategic Employment Sites 
1. The following sites allocated under Policy LPA03 shall constitute Strategic 
Employment Sites21: 
  1EA: Omega South Western Extension, Land north of Finches Plantation, 
Bold; 
  6EA: Land west of Millfield Lane, south of Liverpool Road and north of 
Clipsley Brook, Haydock; 
  7EA: Parkside East, Newton-le-Willows; and 
  8EA: Parkside West, Newton-le-Willows. 
2. Any planning application for development within a Strategic Employment Site 
must be supported by a comprehensive masterplan covering the whole Site, 
which must set out details of at least: 
 a) amount of development and proposed uses; 
 b) phasing of development across the whole site; 
 c) indicative layout and design details for the whole site, that must provide for 
an attractive built form with high quality landscaping when viewed from 
within the development and elsewhere; 
 d) measures to provide good levels of accessibility to the whole site by public 
transport, pedestrian and cycling links; 
 e) indicative layout promoting permeability and accessibility by public 
transport, cycling and walking; 
 f) a Green Infrastructure Plan addressing biodiversity, geodiversity, 
greenways, ecological network, landscape character, trees, woodland and 
water storage issues in a holistic and integrated way; 
 g) measures to address any potential flood risk and surface water drainage 
issues in accordance with Policy LPC12; 
 h) measures to promote energy efficiency and generation of renewable or 
low carbon energy in accordance with Policy LPC13; 
 i) a comprehensive strategy for the provision of all new, expanded and / or 
enhanced infrastructure that is required to serve the development of the 
whole site; and 
 j) how development of the site as a whole would comply with other relevant 
policies of the Local Plan. 
 
21 The boundaries of the Strategic Employment sites are identified on the Policies Map. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 44 3. Detailed development proposals within a Strategic Employment Site must be 
accompanied by a comprehensive package of training schemes and / or other 
measures to enable local residents (including unemployed and disadvantaged 
people) to access and benefit fully from the employment opportunities 
provided at the Site. 
4. Development within Strategic Employment Sites will be required, subject to 
compliance with Policy LPA07, provide or make financial contributions towards 
the provision, expansion and / or enhancement of transport infrastructure 
(including road, public transport, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure) and / or 
other infrastructure to serve the needs of the development.  Such provision 
may be either on-site or off-site and must be provided in time to meet the 
needs of the development.  Where the specific development proposal would 
only cover part of the Strategic Employment Site, the provision and / or 
contributions must be in accordance with the comprehensive masterplan for 
the whole site referred to in paragraph 2 of this Policy. 
5. The masterplans for each Strategic Employment Site, and any planning 
application for development within any other allocated employment site, must 
address site specific requirements set out in appendix 5 (in the case of sites 
1EA and 6EA) and Policies LPA09 and LPA10 (in the case of sites 7EA and 
8EA).

• Masterplanning process 
4.12 Reasoned Justification 
4.12.1 The sites covered by Policy LPA03.1 are considered to be strategic as, 
given their scale, they will play a significant role in the delivery of the 
overall strategy of the Plan.  It is anticipated that during the Plan period 
these sites will deliver most of the new employment land required to meet 
need.  To ensure that the sites are developed to their full potential it is 
essential that development proposals within them are informed by a 
comprehensive and suitable masterplan for the site as a whole.  The 
masterplan must identify any new, expanded, or enhanced infrastructure 
that is needed to serve the development as a whole.  A comprehensive St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 45 approach will also be followed to securing any necessary developer 
contributions required to deliver such infrastructure. 
4.12.2 Non-strategic sites that are allocated in Policy LPA03 are not considered 
large enough to warrant a strategic allocation.  Whilst such sites are 
anticipated to yield less employment floorspace compared to strategic 
sites, their allocation will support the overall delivery of employment land, 
and they will play a key role in ensuring the supply of sites balances the 
phased delivery that typically results from the build out of large strategic 
employment sites. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 46 4.13 Policy LPA04: Meeting St Helens Borough’s Housing Needs 
Policy LPA04: Meeting St Helens Borough’s Housing Needs 
1. In the period from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2037 a minimum of 10,206 net 
additional dwellings should be provided in the Borough of St Helens, at an 
average of at least 486 dwellings per annum. 
2. The housing requirement will be met from the following sources: 
 a) Completions; 
 b) Sites with planning permission; 
 c) Housing allocations shown on the Policies Map and listed in Table 4.5; 
 d) Sites without planning permission identified in the Strategic Housing Land 
Availability Assessment (SHLAA); and 
 e) ‘Windfall’ development, including development on small sites not 
individually identified in the SHLAA, sub-division of dwellings and 
conversions / changes of use. 
3. New development should optimise the amount of housing developed on a site.  
New development should therefore aim to achieve the following minimum 
densities: 
 a) at least 40 dwellings per hectare (dph) on sites that are within or adjacent 
to St Helens or Earlestown Town Centres; and 
 b) at least 30 dph on all sites outside St Helens and Earlestown town 
centres.  
 Densities of less than 30 dph will only be appropriate where they are 
necessary to achieve a clear planning objective. 
4. The delivery of new housing development will be monitored annually to ensure 
that: 
 a) an adequate supply of new housing is provided at all times in accordance 
with the Housing Delivery Test set out in national policy; and 
 b) there is a deliverable supply of housing that is sufficient to provide at least 
5 years’ worth of new housing development against the housing 
requirement.  The 5-year land supply to be maintained shall include any 
buffer that is required under national policy.  If annual monitoring 
demonstrates the deliverable housing land supply falls significantly below 
the required level, taking into account the requirements in relation to 
housing delivery set out in national policy, a partial or full plan update will 
be considered to bring forward additional sites. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

• Provision of a 5+ year deliverable housing land

• Facilitating housing delivery 
• St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
4.15 Reasoned Justification 
4.15.1 National planning policy requires Local Plans to provide for the delivery of 
a wide choice of new housing in sufficient quantities to meet needs.  The 
requirement of 10,206 dwellings in total over the Plan period (equating to 
an average of 486 dwellings per annum) set out in Policy LPA04 is 
designed to meet the full Objectively Assessed Need (OAN) for new 
housing in the Borough.  To identify the OAN for new housing the Council 
has taken into account a range of evidence as follows. 
Quantifying the OAN for new housing in St Helens Borough 
4.15.2 National planning policy requires Local Plans to use the nationally defined 
standard method to identify housing OAN unless exceptional 
circumstances justify an alternative approach25.  It also indicates that 
alternative approaches identifying a higher need than that indicated by the 
standard method will in principle be considered sound. 
4.15.3 The standard method uses household growth projections over a 10-year 
period as its starting point, to which it applies an ‘uplift’ to account for 
affordability issues to derive an annual housing need figure, that can be 
applied to the whole Plan period26. 
4.15.4 The most recent sub-national household projections, which have a base 
date of 2016, were published in September 2018.  However, the 
Government has published draft proposals the effect of which (in the 
context of St Helens Borough) is that calculation of housing need based 
upon the standard method should be “informed”  by the 2014 based and 
not the 2016 based household projections.  Application of the national 
standard method using this approach would generate a housing need of 
399 new dwellings per annum27. 
 
24 The NDA (net developable area) for each site is an estimate of the area available to accommodate new housing once an allowance, typically 25%,  
has been made for features that are not included when calculating density e.g., areas performing  a function for the wider area and not just the 
development, such as significant new landscaping buffers, potential new schools, areas of strategic open space and roads to serve the wider area. 
Therefore, most sites will have a NDA of 75%. 
25 The standard method is available to view at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-and-economic-development-needs-assessments . 
26 Planning Practice Guidance, July 2018. 
27 This figure is derived by applying the standard method to the average household growth indicated in the 2014 based household projections for the 
10 years from 2022 to 2032 and the 2021 affordability ratios, with the output extrapolated over the Plan period. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 49 4.15.5 A key disadvantage of relying on the standard method to identify housing 
need is that it does not take into account the increased employment 
growth that is likely to result from the development of the sites that are 
allocated for employment development in Policy LPA03.  This employment 
growth is likely to lead to increased housing need.  In addition, the long 
term trend of declining affordability is likely, if continued in the future, to 
present an upward pressure on the outputs of the standard method.  To 
address these points the Council has considered a range of other 
evidence to identify the housing OAN, as follows. 
4.15.6 The Mid Mersey Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2016 
confirmed that the local authority areas of St Helens, Warrington and 
Halton comprise a single Housing Market Area and that St Helens also 
has significant housing market and migration linkages with Knowsley and 
Wigan.  The draft Liverpool City Region SHELMA, published in 2017, 
assessed housing needs across the whole City Region and West 
Lancashire but excluding Warrington. 
4.15.7 The St Helens SHMA update 2018 used more recently published 
household and population projections, together with updated data linked to 
the development of the employment site allocations in Policy LPA03 of this 
Plan, to assess the housing OAN figures.  It did so by assessing a range 
of demographic and economic led scenarios, for example: using 
assumptions concerning the expected rate of jobs growth; the numbers of 
supporting jobs that would be generated; employment rates; and 
commuting patterns. 
4.15.8 Whilst the scenarios in the SHMA update 2018 indicate a range of annual 
housing needs figures, the scenario that is considered to be the most 
realistic gives rise to a figure of 486 net new dwelling completions per 
annum28. 
The housing requirement 
4.15.9 It has been established (see the reasoned justification to Policy LPA01) 
that the Borough does not need to accommodate any housing needs 
arising in any neighbouring local authority area, and that no neighbouring 
local authority has capacity within their urban area(s) to accommodate any 
of the housing needs arising in St Helens Borough.  As a result, and as no 
constraints have been identified that prevent the OAN from being met in 
full in the Borough, the housing requirement figure set out in Policy LPA04 
equates to the identified OAN (of 486 dwellings per annum) for new 
housing.  This requirement is net of (i.e., in addition to) dwellings required 
to replace any demolition losses that may take place during the Plan 
period.  As it is an annual average it can be expected that variations in 
delivery over this period will occur. 
Housing land supply 
4.15.10 In accordance with Policy LPA01, a key priority is to maximise housing 
delivery on previously developed (‘brownfield’) land within existing urban 
 
28 This figure is derived from the ‘economic scenario 2’, sensitivity option 3 set out in the SHMA Update 2018, albeit extended to cover the whole Plan 
period to 2037. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 50 areas.  The St Helens Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment 
(SHLAA) 2017 (as updated with the latest information as of 1 April 2021) 
identifies that sites in the urban area had a total capacity of 6,114 
dwellings.  This figure includes sites with planning permission, sites under 
construction, other sites identified as suitable for housing and an 
allowance of 93 units per annum from small windfall sites of less than 
0.25ha (based upon past delivery rates).  The largest SHLAA sites are 
allocated as sites 9HA and 10HA in Policy LPA04. 
4.15.11 Some of the SHLAA sites are subject to physical or other constraints that 
could affect their rate of development, for example due to the need to deal 
with contamination caused by previous industrial activities.  An allowance 
of 15% has been made for reduced delivery on the SHLAA sites over the 
later years of the Plan period.  Total delivery from sites in the urban area is 
expected to fall substantially short of the total housing delivery required 
under Policy LPA04.  As a result, the proposed land supply includes a 
number of allocated sites that have been released from previous 
designation as Green Belt.  This element of the supply includes a 
contingency of 20% to allow for potential delays in development, for 
example to allow for the provision of essential infrastructure in currently 
undeveloped areas and other issues that may affect supply.  The overall 
contribution from the different sources of land is summarised in Tables 4.6 
to 4.9. 
Distribution of housing 
4.15.12 In accordance with Policy LPA01, the housing land supply will be 
distributed across the Borough, albeit with a concentration in existing 
urban areas and the major urban extension planned at Bold.  In total, the 
allocated brownfield sites (6HA, 9HA and 10HA) have an estimated 
capacity of 1,611 dwellings in the Plan period.  The location of sites that 
have been released from the Green Belt has been determined by the St 
Helens Green Belt Review.  In total, the former Green Belt sites (1HA, 
2HA, 4HA, 5HA, 7HA, and 8HA) have an estimated capacity of 2,114 
dwellings in the Plan period.  Whilst this process has constrained the 
ability to identify suitable sites in some key settlements, all settlements will 
have opportunities for housing development either within them or nearby. 
Density 
4.15.13 To ensure that land is used efficiently, Policy LPA04 encourages the use 
of high densities in appropriate locations for example on sites that are 
close to town or district centres or to public transport facilities.  Densities of 
less than 30 dwellings per hectare (dph) are discouraged except where 
there is a legitimate planning reason for them, for example to ensure that 
development integrates successfully with the prevailing built form of the 
area. 
4.15.14 The density of development on each allocated site should be at or above 
the minimum figures given in Table 4.5.  The stated capacities of each site 
listed in the table are indicative, reflecting the minimum densities and 
anticipated net developable areas set out.  The actual capacity will also be 
determined having regard to the acceptability of specific proposals in 
relation to relevant national and local policies. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 51 Small sites 
4.15.15 The Council is keen to promote the role of small sites in helping to meet its 
housing requirement.  The St Helens Brownfield Register 2017 identifies 
62 sites, with a combined capacity of 852 dwellings that are no larger than 
one hectare in size.  This represents just over 10% of the total requirement 
for new housing from the date of the Register onwards.  Further 
contributions in this respect can be anticipated from small greenfield sites

Permission in Principle 
4.15.16 Under recent legislation, Permission in Principle (PiP) provides a new 
mechanism under which development, including the provision of new 
homes, may be permitted on suitable brownfield sites.  The Council can 
grant PiP for a site upon receipt of a valid application or by entering a site 
in Part 2 of its Brownfield Land Register subject to various statutory 
requirements being met.  Whilst this power has not (as at the end of 2018) 
been applied to any sites in St Helens Borough, the Council will continue 
to assess the merits of using the PiP mechanism in the future to boost 
housing delivery. 
Re-use of vacant dwellings 
4.15.17 Council tax data confirms that in October 2017, 936 dwellings in St Helens 
Borough met the Government criteria for being long term vacant for six 
months or longer.  The Council uses a number of methods in line with its 
Empty Homes Strategy to enable and encourage private owners to bring 
vacant dwellings back into use.  As a result, the Council has enabled over 
400 vacant dwellings to be brought back into use since April 2014.  
However, whilst this activity makes a contribution to meeting housing 
needs it must be balanced against the fact that the Council has only 
limited control over the overall number of vacant dwellings, which is 
affected by landowner decisions and other factors.  For this reason, the 
housing supply figures in Tables 4.6 to 4.9 do not include an assumed 
contribution to the overall supply of housing from trends in the numbers of 
vacant dwellings. 
Phasing of delivery and housing trajectory 
4.15.18 To ensure flexibility and choice in the housing market, Policy LPA04 does 
not phase the release of allocated housing sites into different parts of the 
Plan period up to 2037.  However, in accordance with Policy LPA07 the St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 53 timing of delivery of some sites is likely to be influenced by the availability 
of any necessary infrastructure to serve the needs of the development. 
4.15.19 The trajectory set out in Table 4.10 identifies at what stages delivery of 
new housing required over the Plan period can be anticipated.  It is 
assumed that the majority of housing on most sites allocated in 
Policy LPA04 will be developed within the Plan period.  Where a longer 
delivery schedule is expected (extending beyond 2037) the expected 
delivery within the Plan period has been estimated on the basis of 
assumptions concerning the number of developers who would be likely to 
be active on each site and the likely delivery rates from each.

4.15.20 A graphical representation of the year-to-year housing trajectory set out in 
Table 4.10 is shown at Figure 4.3. 
4.15.21 The delivery of housing will be monitored over the Plan period.  If at any 
stage delivery falls below 95% of the required level over the previous three 
years, the Council will prepare an action plan (in accordance with the 
Housing Delivery Test set out in national planning policy) to address the 
causes of under-delivery.  If delivery or current deliverable land supply 
falls substantially below the required level, the Council may undertake a 
Local Plan update to bring forward additional sites such as those that are 
safeguarded under Policy LPA05.

Green Belt Exceptional circumstances 
4.15.23 The following paragraphs articulate the exceptional circumstances 
justifying the removal of land from the Green Belt on a site-by-site basis.  
This builds on the exceptional circumstances strategic case as set out in 
the Reasoned Justification to Policy LPA01, and the following should be 
read in that context. 
1HA – Land south of Billinge Road, East of Garswood Road and West of Smock 
Lane, Garswood 
4.15.24 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land corresponding to 
this site to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the Green Belt purposes.  In 
summary, all sides of the site have strong boundaries, and it is therefore 
well contained.  The strategic gap between Billinge and Garswood could 
also be maintained notwithstanding the release of this site from the Green 
Belt.  It also found the site to have ‘good’ development potential.  The site 
is in a sustainable location within walking distance of a local shop and 
public transport links, including the nearby railway station.  Safe access to 
the site can be provided, and a suitable sustainable drainage scheme 
also.  Indeed, development of this site could help solve flooding issues in 
the surrounding urban area.  The Sustainability Appraisal (SA) found 
development of the site would result in a high number of positive effects. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 56 2HA – Land at Florida Farm (South of A580), Slag Lane, Blackbrook 
4.15.25 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land generally reflecting 
this site to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the Green Belt purposes, 
with strong permanent boundaries and not having a sense of openness or 
countryside character.  In summary, there is existing residential 
development on three sides of the site, and the East Lancashire Road 
(A580) on the fourth side.  It also found the site to have ‘good’ 
development potential.  The site is in a sustainable location with good 
levels of accessibility to key services and jobs (including at the Haydock 
Industrial Estate).  The site presents no technical constraints that cannot 
be satisfactorily addressed.  Indeed, the provision of flood mitigation 
measures for the site could have the beneficial effect of helping alleviate 
flooding in the wider area.  The SA found development of the site would 
have a mixed impact on achieving SA objectives, with a high number of 
positive effects, including good access to public transport and employment 
opportunities. 
4HA – Land bounded by Reginald Road / Bold Road / Travers Entry / Gorsey Lane 
/ Crawford Street, Bold (Bold Forest Garden Suburb) 
4.15.26 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcels of land that form this site 
make a ‘low’ to ‘medium’ contribution to the purposes of the Green Belt, 
with ‘good’ development potential.  The land on which the site is located 
forms a notable indent in the alignment of the southern edge of the built-up 
area of St Helens.  Whilst there are open views across the parcel, it has 
strong, robust physical boundaries including existing development to the 
north, east and west, and Gorsey Lane to the south.  The site has good 
levels of accessibility to jobs in nearby industrial areas, and to public 
transport services, including via St Helens Junction railway station. 
4.15.27 The site would be sufficiently large to include new social infrastructure (i.e. 
a new primary school, local retail centre and potentially health facilities).  It 
is a major strategic opportunity to provide a wide range of new housing in 
an area that is close to some of the more deprived parts of the Borough 
and incorporate and deliver the framework and philosophies of the Bold 
Forest Park Area Action Plan.  There are no technical constraints to 
development of this site that cannot be satisfactorily addressed.  Due to its 
scale and location, development of this site would contribute strongly 
towards meeting the strategic aims and objectives of the Local Plan. 
5HA – Land South of Gartons Lane and former St. Theresa’s Social Club, Gartons 
Lane, Bold 
4.15.28 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land generally 
corresponding to this site boundary to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to 
the purposes of the Green Belt, benefitting from a high degree of visual 
enclosure with strong, robust boundaries.  The Review also found the site 
to have ‘good’ development potential.  The site is in a sustainable location 
with good transport links, including safe, convenient access by foot to the 
nearest local centre, bus stops and a railway station.  It would form a 
natural expansion of the surrounding settlement and help deliver a range 
of housing in a relatively deprived area.  Development of the site also 
provides the opportunity to facilitate improvements in line with the Bold St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 57 Forest Park Area Action Plan.  The SA found development of the site 
would have a mixed impact on the achievement of SA objectives, with a 
high number of positive effects. 
7HA – Land West of the A49 Mill Lane and to the East of the West Coast Mainline 
railway line, Newton-le-Willows 
4.15.29 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land containing this site 
to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the purposes of the Green Belt, 
given its strong boundaries, high level of enclosure and the brownfield 
nature of much of the site.  It does not have a strong sense of openness or 
countryside character.  The Review also considered the site to have ‘good’ 
development potential.  The site is in a sustainable location within a 
convenient walking distance of a local centre, various employment areas 
(existing and planned), a railway station and other public transport 
facilities.  There are no technical constraints on the site that cannot be 
satisfactorily addressed.  The SA concluded that development of the site 
would result in a high number of positive effects.  This site is of particular 
significance given its brownfield nature, and the importance of making 
effective use of such land, where appropriate. 
8HA – Land South of Higher Lane and East of Rookery Lane, Rainford 
4.15.30 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of land reflecting this 
site boundary to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the Green Belt 
purposes given its limited role in preventing sprawl and the merging of 
settlements.  It also has strong boundaries and a high degree of visual 
containment.  The Review found the site to have ‘good’ development 
potential.  The site is sustainable, with good access to public transport, the 
local highway network and employment areas.  There are no technical 
constraints that cannot be satisfactorily addressed.  The SA found that 
development of the site will have a mixed impact on the achievement of 
SA objectives, with a high number of positive impacts.  The location of the 
site also aligns with the Plan’s spatial strategy as Rainford is identified as 
a Key Settlement.

must set out details of at least: 
 a) amount of development and proposed uses; 
 b) phasing of development across the whole site; 
 c) indicative layout and design details for the whole site that must provide for 
an attractive built form with high quality landscaping when viewed from 
within the development and elsewhere; 
 d) measures to provide good levels of accessibility to the whole site from the 
surrounding area by public transport, walking and cycling; 
 e) indicative layout promoting permeability and accessibility by public 
transport, cycling and walking;

3. Detailed development proposals within a Strategic Housing Site will be 
required, subject to compliance with Policy LPA07, to provide or make 
financial contributions towards the provision, expansion and / or enhancement 
of transport infrastructure (including road, public transport, cycling and 
pedestrian infrastructure) and / or other infrastructure to serve the needs of the 
development.  Such provision may be either on-site or off-site and must be 
provided in time to meet the needs of the development.  Where a specific 
development proposal would only cover part of a Strategic Housing Site, the 
provision and / or contributions must be in accordance with the comprehensive 
masterplan for the whole site referred to in paragraph 2 of this Policy. 
4. The masterplans for each Strategic Housing Site, and any planning application 
for development within any other allocated housing site, must address the 
indicative requirements set out in appendix 5 (in the case of sites 2HA, 5HA,

4.18 Reasoned Justification 
4.18.1 The sites in Policy LPA04.1 are considered to be strategic as, given their 
scale (with an indicative capacity of more than 300 dwellings each), they 
will play a significant role in the delivery of the overall strategy of the Plan.  
It is anticipated that during the Plan period these sites will deliver the bulk 
of housing required to meet need.  Other sites identified for allocation by 
Policy LPA04 are not considered large enough to warrant a strategic 
allocation.  Whilst it is anticipated that such sites will yield smaller numbers 
of homes compared to strategic sites, their allocation will support the 
overall delivery of housing and they will be a key part of the supply, 
balancing out the phased delivery that is likely to result from the build out 
of the large Strategic Housing Sites. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 60 4.19 Policy LPA05: Safeguarded Land 
Policy LPA05: Safeguarded Land 
1. The sites identified as Safeguarded Land on the Policies Map have been 
removed from the Green Belt in order to meet longer term development needs 
well beyond this Plan period.  Such Safeguarded Land is not allocated for 
development in this Plan period.  The future uses that the sites are 
safeguarded for are listed in Tables 4.13 and 4.14. 
2. Planning permission for the development of the safeguarded sites for the 
purposes identified in Tables 4.13 and 4.14 will only be granted following a 
future Local Plan update (full or partial) that proposes such development 
based on the evidence showing a need for additional land or issues with the 
supply of land identified by this Local Plan.  Otherwise, proposals for housing 
and employment development of safeguarded sites in this Plan period will be 
refused. 
3. Other forms of development on Safeguarded Land will only be permitted 
where the proposal is: 
 a) necessary for the operation of existing permitted use(s) on the land; or 
 b) for a temporary use that would retain the open nature of the land and 
would not prejudice the potential future development of the land for the 
purposes stated for each site in Tables 4.13 and 4.14. 
4. Development on any other site that would prevent or limit development of 
Safeguarded Land for its potential future uses identified in Tables 4.13 and 
4.14 will not be permitted.

Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Future update of Local Plan (to consider any 
need to release safeguarded land for 
development) 
4.21 Reasoned Justification 
4.21.1 In accordance with Policy LPA01, the sites listed in Tables 4.13 and 4.14 
have been safeguarded to meet potential long term development needs.  
Whilst they have been removed from the Green Belt, they are not 
allocated for development before 2037.  Their purpose is to ensure that 
the new Green Belt boundaries set by this Plan can endure well beyond 
2037.  The reasons why specific sites are safeguarded rather than 
allocated for development before 2037 are set out in the St Helens Green 
Belt Review 2018.  The safeguarded sites are protected from other forms 
of development that would prevent or significantly hinder their future 
development for the uses identified in Tables 4.13 and 4.14.  This is to 
ensure that, potentially, they could be used for these purposes in the 
future. 
4.21.2 The development of the safeguarded sites for the purposes in Tables 4.13 
and 4.14 will only be acceptable if a future Local Plan update, either full or 
partial, confirms that such development is both acceptable and required, 
and proceeds to allocate such sites for development in that update.  The 
Council may undertake and bring into effect such a Local Plan update 
within the current Plan period of 2020-2037, should this be required and 
justified by the latest evidence.  This is likely to be informed by the level of 
need for housing and / or employment development (whichever use is 
identified for the specific site) compared to site supply, infrastructure 
capacity and needs, and any other factors that may affect the delivery of 
the sites at that time. 
4.21.3 The estimated combined capacity of the two sites (1ES and 2ES) 
safeguarded for employment use is 85.88ha.  Of these sites, Site 1ES 
would form an extension to Omega North in Warrington whilst Site 2ES 
would form an easterly expansion of Haydock Industrial Estate, albeit on 
the opposite side of the M6.  The timing, form and extent of any 
development that may be acceptable in the future on these sites is likely to 
be influenced by the need to ensure a phased approach to meeting overall 
employment needs and the extent to which current constraints affecting 
these sites have been overcome.  In the case of Site 1ES, these include 
the need to ensure that the site can be satisfactorily accessed from the 
highway across land outside the site and that the site can be developed, in 
conjunction with other sites, without causing unacceptable impacts on the St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 63 highway network in Warrington.  In the case of Site 2ES, the form and 
extent of any development that may be acceptable in the future is likely to 
be influenced by its interrelationship with Junction 23 of the M6, where a 
need for substantial improvements (likely to include enlargement of the 
junction) to enhance junction capacity within the Plan period has been 
identified (see Policy LPA06). 
4.21.4 The estimated combined capacity of the sites safeguarded for housing is 
2,739 dwellings.  To this can be added the indicative post-2037 delivery of 
3,223 dwellings projected on the allocated housing sites 2HA, 4HA, 5HA, 
6HA and 10HA (see Policy LPA04, Table 4.5) the delivery of which is 
expected to continue well beyond 2037.  Further contributions are likely to 
be made from windfall sites and other sources after 2037.  It should also 
be noted that household growth rates in St Helens Borough are currently 
projected to reduce in the years up to, and after, 2037, meaning that it is 
likely that post-2037, housing needs may be lower than between 2020 and 
2037. 
4.21.5 The safeguarded housing sites have been identified in a range of locations 
across the Borough.  Although the safeguarded sites may be suitable for 
development in the future, they are not identified for development in the 
Plan period due to the need to ensure a suitably phased release of 
housing sites to meet needs, and the need to overcome specific 
constraints affecting individual sites.  Further information concerning these 
constraints is set out in the St Helens Green Belt Review 2018. 
Green Belt Exceptional circumstances 
4.21.6 The following paragraphs articulate the exceptional circumstances 
justifying the removal of land from the Green Belt on a site by site basis for 
safeguarding for development beyond the end of the plan period.  This 
builds on the exceptional circumstances strategic case as set out in the 
Reasoned Justification to Policy LPA01, and the following should be read 
in that context. 
Employment safeguarded sites 
1ES – Omega North Western Extension, Bold 
4.21.7 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of land reflecting this 
site boundary to make a ‘medium’ overall contribution to the Green Belt 
purposes as it contains no inappropriate development and has open views 
across the site, but it is bordered by large scale built development at 
Omega North and the M62 and therefore only has a moderate countryside 
character.  It should be noted that this contrasts with the scoring of other 
Green Belt parcels in this area which were found to make a ‘high’ or 
‘high+’ contribution to the Green Belt purposes. 
4.21.8 The site has potential to form a logical extension to the Omega 
employment site.  However, there are current highway and accessibility 
constraints that would require mitigation, including the provision of access 
across land in separate ownership.  Further, as Junction 8 of the M62 
experiences congestion and capacity issues, the cumulative impacts of 
development of this site would need to be addressed in conjunction with 
Warrington Borough Council and National Highways.  Due to the location St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 64 of the site within 1km of an area of 20% of the most deprived population in 
the UK, development of this site would help to reduce poverty and social 
exclusion.  This site therefore has clear potential to meet longer term 
employment needs, and by safeguarding it, there is time to address the 
highways and access issues noted. 
2ES – Land North East of Junction 23 M6 (South of Haydock racecourse), 
Haydock 
4.21.9 The Green Belt Review found the parcel of land generally reflecting this 
site boundary to make a ‘high’ overall contribution to the Green Belt 
purposes.  Whilst ordinarily a site with such a score would not be 
considered further, there is a clear need to provide sufficient land for 
employment both within the plan period, and beyond it.  Given the 
importance of meeting such needs, coupled with the potential of the site to 
meet the size and locational requirements of the market, there are 
exceptional circumstances to safeguard this site for longer term needs 
beyond the Plan period.  Whilst there are clear harms in relation to the 
development of this site, including harm to Green Belt and adverse 
landscape impacts, it should also be noted that the site is located within 
1km of an area with the 20% most deprived population in the UK, so 
development here in the longer term would help to reduce poverty and 
exclusion.  Whilst the site did not score as well as the allocated 
employment sites through the Green Belt Review, the need to make 
provision for employment land beyond the Plan period forms the basis for 
the exceptional circumstances to justify the removal of this site from the 
Green Belt for safeguarding. 
Housing safeguarded sites 
1HS – Land south of Leyland Green Road, North of Billinge Road and East of 
Garswood Road, Garswood 
4.21.10 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of Green Belt land 
containing this site to make a ‘medium’ contribution to the Green Belt 
purposes and has a ‘medium’ development potential.  The site is within 
walking distance of a local convenience shop and is readily accessible by 
bus and rail.  There are not considered to be any technical constraints to 
delivering development on this site that cannot be satisfactorily addressed 
over the necessary timeframe.  However, as the site projects further into 
the countryside than housing allocation 1HA, it is considered to be a less 
logical extension to the village within the Plan period.  On that basis, site 
1HA is allocated for development within the Plan period, and this site is 
safeguarded for development subsequent to that, beyond the end of the 
Plan period to meet longer term needs, creating a logical phased 
extension of the village both within and beyond the Plan period. 
2HS – Land between Vista Road and Belvedere Road, Earlestown 
4.21.11 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of land that contains 
this site to make a ‘medium’ contribution overall to the Green Belt 
purposes, and also found the site to have ‘good’ development potential.  
The site proposed for safeguarding sits within a notable indentation in the 
existing urban edge and benefits from clearly defined boundaries.  There St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 65 are not considered to be any technical constraints that cannot be 
addressed satisfactorily to enable this site to meet development needs 
beyond the end of the Plan period. 
3HS – Former Eccleston Park Golf Club, Rainhill Road, Eccleston 
4.21.12 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land that generally 
reflects the boundary of this site to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the 
Green Belt purposes, due to its strong boundaries and because of the 
extent of urban development around its boundaries and its limited role in 
preventing the merging of settlements.  However, the site is identified as 
being affected by a number of constraints that will have a significant 
impact on its net developable area and deliverability of development within 
it, including its use as a golf course, constraints in relation to the highway 
network and some physical constraints within the parcel itself, including 
electricity pylons, the proximity of the railway line in noise terms, woodland 
to the north of the parcel and some infrastructure assets running through 
the parcel as advised by United Utilities. 
4.21.13 Notwithstanding this, the site has good accessibility to a range of services, 
jobs, and public transport (including Eccleston Park railway station).  The 
safeguarding of this site is justified to help meet development needs 
beyond the Plan period and will provide sufficient time to satisfactorily 
address the identified constraints, and exceptional circumstances are 
therefore justified. 
4HS – Land East of Newlands Grange (former Vulcan works) and West of West 
Coast mainline, Newton-le-Willows 
4.21.14 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land that contains this 
site to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the purposes of the Green Belt 
and has ‘medium’ development potential.  The site is in a sustainable 
location, within walking distance of a local convenience shop and public 
transport facilities.  However, the highway network in the surrounding area 
has a number of constraints, and further work is required prior to 
development coming forward. Further, attenuation measures will be 
required to limit noise from the railway line running along the eastern site 
boundary.  However, the site is considered able to contribute to potential 
development needs beyond the end of the Plan period, and by 
safeguarding the site, there is sufficient time for the above issues to be 
addressed. 
5HS – Land West of Winwick Road and South of Wayfarers Drive, Newton-le-
Willows 
4.21.15 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of land within which 
this site sits to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the Green Belt purposes 
and have ‘medium’ development potential.  The site is within a sustainable 
location, close to a railway station.  The site is affected by a number of 
constraints, which will require further investigation before development can 
be brought forward, including the difficulty of providing a secondary access 
to the site, the proximity to a Local Wildlife Site and a historic landfill site in 
close proximity to the site (to the south), and associated potential 
contamination issues.  There is also a railway line to the east of the site, St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 66 so noise attenuation measures would be required.  The sub-parcel is 
considered suitable to help meet needs in the longer term beyond the Plan 
period, and the safeguarding of the site will enable the required further 
investigation in relation to the above constraints to make efficient use of 
land within the site. 
6HS – Land East of Chapel Lane and South of Walkers Lane, Sutton Manor 
4.21.16 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel of land that reflects 
this site to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the Green Belt purposes as 
it is well contained with strong boundaries and does not significantly 
contribute to the wider strategic gap.  The site has ‘medium’ development 
potential.  The site does project notably outwards into the countryside from 
the current urban edge and is considered more suitable as a longer term 
extension of the urban area, contributing to meeting housing needs after 
the end of the Plan period.  Other technical constraints on the site (such 
as the presence of protected woodland and a Local Wildlife Site) are 
considered able to be satisfactorily addressed. 
7HS – Land South of Elton Head Road (adjacent to St. John Vianney Primary 
School), Thatto Heath 
4.21.17 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the sub-parcel that broadly reflects 
this site boundary to make a ‘low’ contribution to the Green Belt purposes 
as it is well contained with strong boundaries and does not significantly 
contribute to the wider strategic gap.  The site was also considered to 
have ‘medium’ development potential.  The site is sustainably located 
within walking distance of a local convenience shop and accessible by 
public transport users and the local highway network.  As the surrounding 
area includes opportunities for redevelopment of previously developed 
sites, to ensure an appropriate phasing of development within the Thatto 
Heath area, it is appropriate to delay any development on this site until 
after the end of the Plan period.  Therefore, it is safeguarded to meet 
development needs for the longer term. 
8HS – Land South of A580 between Houghtons Lane and Crantock Grove, Windle 
4.21.18 The Green Belt Review (2018) found the parcel of land that reflects this 
site boundary to make a ‘low’ overall contribution to the Green Belt, with a 
‘medium’ development potential.  The site comprises a significant 
greenfield site that forms a sizeable outward extension of the urban area 
into the countryside.  The site also has a number of technical issues which 
would need to be addressed prior to development, including required 
significant improvements to highways infrastructure and suitable 
ecological evidence in relation to the potential of the site to provide 
functionally linked habitat for bird species, which may require a mitigation 
strategy.  Such issues could take some time to address.  Furthermore, 
given the scale of the site, some social infrastructure (such as a primary 
school) is likely to be required.  There are further physical constraints in 
relation to the site, which could likely be addressed satisfactorily.  On the 
basis of the above, this site provides the opportunity to meet longer term 
development needs and safeguarding the site will provide sufficient time to 
address the identified issues. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 67 4.22 Policy LPA06: Transport and Travel 
Policy LPA06: Transport and Travel 
1. The Council’s strategic priorities for the transport network are to facilitate 
economic growth, enable good levels of accessibility between homes, jobs 
and services, improve air quality and minimise carbon emissions.  To achieve 
these priorities, it will seek to: 
 a) Secure the delivery of new or improved road, rail, walking, cycling, and / or 
bus infrastructure where required; 
 b) Ensure that new development is sufficiently accessible by road transport, 
walking, cycling and public transport; 
 c) Secure improvements to existing motorway capacity and infrastructure 
with particular priority being given to the M6 Junction 23 and M62 
Junction 7; 
 d) Improve the accessibility to jobs, homes and services by all modes of 
transport and protect opportunities to achieve such improvements; 
 e) Secure the delivery of: 
 i) a new rail station at Carr Mill; 
 ii) any necessary improvements to local stations and rail lines; 
 iii) the proposed Skelmersdale Rail Link; and 
 iv) any infrastructure required to deliver HS2 or HS3 (Northern 
Powerhouse Rail); 
  … and 
 f) Protect former railway lines and corridors from development that could 
hinder their future re-use for sustainable modes of transport. 
2. All proposals for new development that would generate significant amounts of 
transport movement must be supported by a Transport Assessment or 
Transport Statement, the scope of which must be agreed by the Council. 
3. New development will only be permitted if it would: 
 a) maintain the safe and efficient flow of traffic on the surrounding highway 
network.  Development proposals will not be permitted where vehicle 
movements would cause severe harm to the highway network; 
 b) be located and designed to enable a suitable level of access (having 
regard to the scale and nature of the proposal) to existing and / or 
proposed public transport services; 
 c) provide appropriate provision of charging points for electric vehicles; 
 d) enable good levels of accessibility by walking and cycling between homes, 
jobs and services; 
 e) provide for safe and convenient pedestrian, cycle and vehicular access 
and movement to, from and within the development; 
 f) include adequate access arrangements for emergency, service and refuse 
collection vehicles; and St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 68  g) provide sufficient on-site parking for persons of limited mobility, service 
vehicles, and cycles that must at least meet the Council’s minimum 
standards, and adequate parking for all other vehicles. 
4. To minimise air and noise pollution and carbon emissions, non-residential 
forms of development that would generate a significant amount of transport 
movement by employees or visitors must be supported by suitably formulated 
Travel Plans. Conditions and/or legal agreements will be used to ensure that 
Travel Plans submitted in such cases are fully implemented and monitored. 
5. Development that would generate significant movement of freight must be 
located where there is a safe, convenient, and environmentally acceptable 
access route to a suitable part of the Key Route Network.  The part of the 
Network that is marked as ‘Key Route Network – non freight’ on the Policies 
Map shall not be regarded as suitable in this context.  Access into a new 
development (of any land use) directly from the Key Route Network will only 
be allowed if this would not unduly restrict the capacity of the road or cause 
harm to highway safety, and where no more suitable alternative exists or 
would be provided by the development. 
6. Direct access from new development on to the Strategic Road Network will 
only be permitted as a last resort, where agreed by National Highways and 
where the necessary levels of transport accessibility and safety could not be 
more suitably provided by other means. 
7. Where rail facilities are available or would be made so as part of a 
development generating significant movement of freight, this will be regarded 
as a benefit. 
8. Development proposals must not prevent or jeopardise the implementation of 
planned transport schemes unless it has been demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Council that: 
 a) the transport scheme is no longer required; 
 b) there is a feasible and viable alternative to it; or 
 c) the benefits of the proposed development would outweigh those of the 
planned transport scheme. 
 Planned transport schemes include but are not limited to proposals for new or 
upgraded footpath, cycle path, bridleway, road, rail, bus and / or other public 
transport facilities that would be on the same site as, adjacent to or be 
otherwise affected by the development. 
9. Further details of the operation of this Policy, for example those related to the 
Council’s vehicle and cycle parking standards, standards for vehicle charging 
point provision, and to the requirements concerning transport assessments, 
transport statements and travel plans will be set out in a future review of the 
Council’s Ensuring a Choice of Travel Supplementary Planning Document. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Liverpool City Region: A Transport Plan for 
Growth and supporting strategies 
• Merseyside Local Transport Plan 2011 
• St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
4.24 Reasoned Justification 
4.24.1 An effective transport network is needed to support a strong economy and 
a strong community.  Quality environments that are conducive to walking 
and cycling can contribute to a healthier lifestyle.  The measures and 
priorities identified in Policy LPA06 should help support economic growth, 
improve access to employment and services and support a healthier 
lifestyle.  These priorities reflect those in A Transport Plan for Growth 
(published by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority) and its 
supporting strategies. 
Carbon Emissions and air quality 
4.24.2 Transport is a major source of carbon emissions that, in turn, are a major 
cause of climate change.  Therefore, transport can play a key part in the 
development of a low carbon economy.  Many of the priorities identified in 
this Policy will play an important part in helping to reduce carbon 
emissions resulting from transport and therefore supporting the Council’s 
Climate Change Emergency declaration.  Measures to reduce the need to 
travel, widen travel choice and reduce dependence on the private car, 
alongside investment in low-carbon vehicle technologies are an important 
part of helping to meet national climate change targets.  Similarly, they 
form an important part of the Council’s drive to tackle air quality issues, 
particularly (but not exclusively) within Air Quality Management Areas, 
some of which adjoin major roads (see Policy LPD09 for further details). 
Transport Assessments 
4.24.3 Development proposals that are likely to generate a significant number of 
journeys require close scrutiny to identify the highway issues and potential 
solutions associated with them.  In such cases, a more detailed 
assessment of the extent to which the development will contribute to the 
following aims, in the form of a Transport Assessment, may be requested: 
a) Enabling access by all users or occupiers of the development to a 
suitable range of viable means of transport; 
b) Limiting any harm from traffic in respect of safety issues, noise, 
and air pollution or to local amenity; and St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 70 c) Ensuring safe and easy access to and from the development for 
all of its users. 
Travel Plans 
4.24.4 A Travel Plan can help reduce the number of car trips to a development.  
Travel Plans aim to reduce the number of journeys needed, where 
possible, and to encourage choice and the use of sustainable means of 
transport by the occupiers of new developments.  This includes, for 
example, car-sharing, working from home, awareness-raising campaigns, 
or subsidised public transport season tickets.  Travel Plans should be 
used to ensure that travel demand arising from new development will 
make the best use of sustainable transport. 
Merseyside Local Transport Plan 
4.24.5 The Merseyside Local Transport Plan 3 (LTP3) provides a long-term 
strategy and delivery programme of transport investment and service 
improvements for the period 2011-2024.  It aims to give Merseyside a 
safer, more sustainable, efficient, and integrated transport network that is 
accessible to all.  As well as St Helens Borough it covers Liverpool, 
Knowsley, Sefton, and Wirral. 
4.24.6 LTP3 has the following vision: 
“A city region committed to a low carbon future, which has a 
transport network and mobility culture that positively contributes 
to a thriving economy and the health and wellbeing of its citizens 
and where sustainable travel is the option of choice” 
A Transport Plan for Growth 
4.24.7 The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority document A Transport Plan 
for Growth, aims to improve the social, environmental, and economic 
wellbeing of the City Region, by delivering a world-class transport network.  
It brings together the existing Local Transport Plans of Merseyside and 
Halton.  The Transport Plan for Growth has been developed to provide a 
clear vision for a successful transport provision in the City Region, and act 
as an investment plan to promote and support economic growth.  The City 
Region authorities will continue to work together to produce a new Local 
Transport Plan for the whole area from 2025. 
Key Route Network 
4.24.8 The Liverpool City Region Key Route Network establishes, for its most 
important roads, the same standards of road and traffic management; 
thereby providing a consistent and integrated network.  The Key Route 
Network in St Helens Borough includes lengths of the A570, A580 and 
A58.  Whilst much of it is suitable for the movement of freight, this does 
not apply to the length of the A58 linking St Helens to Prescot.  The 
Network is substantially based upon the Strategic Freight Route identified 
in the Merseyside Freight Strategy (LTP3 Annex 4, 2011), and is shown 
on the Policies Map and illustrated on the Key Diagram. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 71 Proposed Major Road Network 
4.24.9 As part of the Transport Investment Strategy published in 2017, the 
Government committed to creating a Major Road Network (MRN). Draft 
proposals were issued for consultation, outlining how a new MRN would 
help the Government deliver a number of objectives, including supporting 
housing delivery and economic growth. The creation of an MRN will allow 
for dedicated funding from the National Roads Fund to be used to improve 
this middle tier of the busiest and most economically important local 
authority ‘A’ roads. Parts of the A58 and A570, and the whole of the length 
of the A580 which falls in St Helens, have been proposed for inclusion in 
the MRN. 
Supporting Supplementary Planning Guidance

process. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 72 4.25 Policy LPA07: Infrastructure Delivery and Funding 
Policy LPA07: Infrastructure Delivery and Funding 
Protection, improvement and provision 
1. The Council will seek to ensure satisfactory provision of all forms of 
infrastructure that are required to serve the needs of the local community by: 
 a) Protecting existing infrastructure from being lost where there is an 
identified need for it; 
 b) Supporting the improvement of existing infrastructure where there is an 
identified need for such improvement; 
 c) Safeguarding land for planned new or improved infrastructure where there 
is an identified need for it; 
 d) Seeking developer contributions in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 7 of 
this Policy; and 
 e) Requiring new community facilities and other social infrastructure to be 
located where they would be accessible by a choice of sustainable modes 
of transport and, where possible, clustered with other such facilities. 
Developer Contributions 
2. Subject to compliance with relevant legislation and national policy, 
development proposals will be expected to include or contribute to the 
provision, improvement or replacement of infrastructure that is required to 
meet needs arising from the development proposal.  This may include direct 
provision of on-site or off-site infrastructure and / or financial contributions that 
will be secured by: 
 a) Section 106 planning obligations (or other legally binding agreements); 
and / or 
 b) A tariff based system such as the Community Infrastructure Levy. 
3. Where the suitability of development depends upon the provision of additional 
or improved infrastructure or service capacity, that development should be 
phased to coincide with the provision of such infrastructure or capacity. 
4. In applying this Policy, regard will be had to relevant evidence including the 
latest version of the St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 73 Economic Viability 
5. When assessing planning proposals, the Council and other decision makers 
will pay due regard to any impact that developer contributions towards 
infrastructure provision or other policy requirements may have on the 
economic viability of new development.  In this context, consideration will be 
given to economic viability evidence including any site specific development 
appraisal that may have been submitted to determine the ability of the 
development scheme to support the required level of contributions. In light of 
the viability evidence, where a developer can demonstrate that meeting all 
policy requirements would not be viable, a pragmatic approach will be taken to 
s106 contributions on sites within zone 1. 
Hierarchy of Developer Contributions 
6. Decision makers will, as a general rule, apply the following hierarchy for 
developer contributions in cases where viability constraints can be 
demonstrated (with i) being the highest priority): 
 i) contributions that are essential for public safety (for example essential 
highway works or flood risk mitigation) or to achieve a minimum 
acceptable level of design quality; 
 ii) contributions that are necessary to provide affordable housing or to 
address a local infrastructure requirement or deficiency that would be 
caused or exacerbated by the development, depending on site 
surroundings and the level of existing infrastructure, for example education 
needs or green space provision in areas of deficit; and 
 iii) contributions that would not fall into categories i) or ii) as set out above. 
7. Decisions on planning applications may deviate from the above hierarchy 
where a specific need to do so has been identified.  The Council will provide 
further guidance in a future Developer Contributions Supplementary Planning 
Document and in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (including any future updates 
to this). St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Strategic Aims Met All 
Strategic Objectives Met All 
Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Public and private sector investment plans 
• St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
4.27 Reasoned Justification 
4.27.1 The provision of high-quality infrastructure is a key element in the delivery 
of successful, sustainable communities. In this context, the term 
‘infrastructure’ includes: 
i) physical infrastructure such as roads, railways, sewers and water 
supplies; 
ii) social infrastructure such as education and health establishments, 
neighbourhood retail or leisure uses, built sports and recreation 
facilities, cultural, emergency service and community facilities and 
institutions; 
iii) green Infrastructure such as parks and playing fields; and 
iv) digital infrastructure such as telephone and internet facilities. 
4.27.2 Working with infrastructure providers and other partner organisations, the 
Council will seek to ensure that sufficient infrastructure is available to 
support new development.  This will be done by supporting the effective 
protection and management of existing infrastructure (including effective 
demand management) and, where necessary, the provision of new or 
improved infrastructure; particularly in areas that are expected to 
accommodate major development.  This can include the provision of 
wholly new road or other infrastructure, or investment in existing 
infrastructure to cope with additional demand, for example the expansion 
of local schools to cope with additional students arising from a large new 
housing development in the local area. 
4.27.3 Where proposed development would result in the loss of built sports and 
recreational facilities, decision makers will follow the approach set out in 
the NPPF informed by the most up-to-date local needs assessment for 
built sports facilities. 
4.27.4 Infrastructure may also need to be replaced or repaired during its 
operational lifetime, or to be upgraded to take account of new 
technologies, for example in relation to energy production and digital 
infrastructure.  It will be necessary for local delivery partners to work 
closely together to ensure that a sufficient level of infrastructure provision 
is available. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 75 4.27.5 Many forms of development have some impact on the need for 
infrastructure, services and amenities and should therefore (subject to 
national legislation and policy) contribute towards their costs of provision.  
Hence, it is appropriate for the Council and other decision makers to 
consider the mechanisms by which such contributions can be sought from 
developers. 
4.27.6 The Council has no proposals, at the time of adoption of this Plan, to 
introduce a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).  This means that in most 
cases developer contributions will be sought via planning obligations 
entered into under Section 106 of the Planning Acts.  The National 
Planning Practice Guidance sets out further details of the circumstances in 
which planning obligations can be used to fund infrastructure provision.  
The Council will comply with the up-to-date version of national guidance in 
operating Policy LPA07. 
4.27.7 To support Policy LPA07 and comply with national policy, the Council, 
through a process of engagement with key infrastructure providers, has 
prepared the St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan.  This will be updated 
and revised in future years in line with opportunities to provide, and the 
Borough’s changing needs for, required infrastructure. 
4.27.8 The Mid Mersey Water Cycle Study 201133 identified that further 
investigation is required to determine headroom capacity within the St 
Helens wastewater treatment plant.  United Utilities has a responsibility to 
ensure that there is sufficient water treatment capacity to accommodate 
the needs of the area in a way that protects environmental assets, 
including the coastal and estuarine designated European ecological sites 
(see Policy LPC06 for further details).  The Council will continue to identify 
any development pressures at an early stage so that appropriate steps 
can be taken to ensure that sufficient capacity is provided for the future 
levels and locations of development identified within the Plan. 
4.27.9 To support Policy LPA07, the Council has published a Borough-wide 
economic viability assessment.  This helps to identify the level and range 
of developer contributions (including ‘in kind’ contributions or financial 
contributions) that can be sought without prejudicing the financial viability 
of different types of development in different areas.  It is anticipated that in 
some cases, development-level economic viability assessments may also 
be submitted by developers to account for site-specific circumstances and 
costs.  Developers will be expected to fund these assessments, which 
must be undertaken objectively and transparently, and will be scrutinised 
before a decision is taken on the proposal.

1. Green Infrastructure in St Helens Borough comprises a network of multi-
functional natural assets, including green space, trees, woodlands, mosslands, 
grasslands and wetlands, located within urban, semi-urban and rural areas.  
This network is capable of delivering a wide range of environmental and 
quality of life benefits for local communities and forms an important element of 
the Liverpool City Region (LCR) Ecological Network. 
2. The Council will work with other organisations where necessary to: 
 a) expand tree cover in appropriate locations across the Borough to improve 
landscape character, water and air quality and the value of trees to 
wildlife; 
 b) strengthen and expand the network of wildlife sites, corridors and stepping 
stone habitats to secure a net gain in biodiversity; 
 c) improve and increase the connectivity of the Greenway network; 
 d) increase the accessibility of open space within walking distance of 
housing, health, employment and education establishments to promote 
healthy lifestyles; 
 e) reduce the risk of flooding, improve river water quality and riverine and 
riparian habitats within the Sankey Catchment; and 
 f) ensure that development proposals on strategic employment and housing 
sites incorporate holistic Green Infrastructure Plans. 
3. Developers will be required to provide long-term management arrangements 
for new and existing green infrastructure within development sites. 
4. Development that would contribute to or provide opportunities to enhance 
the function of existing green infrastructure and its connectivity from residential 
areas, town, district and local centres, employment areas and other open spaces, 
will be encouraged.  Development that would result in the loss, fragmentation or 
isolation of green infrastructure assets will be refused.  The only exceptions to this 
will be where it has been demonstrated that:  
a) appropriate protection or retention of Green Infrastructure assets 
cannot be achieved in the pursuit of wider planning objectives;  
b) the development would bring benefits that would override the 
resultant harm; and 
c) there are no realistic alternatives to the proposed development that 
would avoid such harm.   St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 77       In such cases, mitigation, for example, in the form of incorporating the 
identified Green Infrastructure assets into the scheme design and layout 
through a masterplanning process to maintain the key Green Infrastructure 
assets and connections, and / or as a last resort compensatory provision will 
be required.

4.30 Reasoned Justification 
4.30.1 Policy LPA08 aims to protect, enhance, and sustain the Borough’s natural 
assets and increase accessibility to them and connectivity between them, 
whilst protecting and enhancing landscape character, to ensure that the 
natural environment underpins the quality of life.  The Green Infrastructure 
network in the Borough has a wide range of functions and values for 
recreation and tourism, air quality (supporting the Council’s Climate 
Change Emergency declaration), public access, health, heritage, 
biodiversity, water management and landscape character, providing a 
sense of place, distinctiveness, and quality of life.  Much of the network 
(such as Bold Forest Park and the Sankey Valley Park) is influenced by 
the town’s industrial past of coal mining, glass making and chemical 
production and has a strong heritage value.  Mossland has historically 
been drained for agriculture and the remnant stock provides multi-
functional benefits for water management, carbon storage and 
biodiversity.  The Liverpool City Region Ecological Network (see 
Policy LPC08 for further details) and the 25-year Environment Plan target 
habitat creation and restoration of mossland areas in the Borough. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 78 4.30.2 In implementing Policy LPA08 (in both urban and rural areas) the Council 
will seek to liaise closely with, and where necessary work in partnership 
with, landowners. 
4.30.3 Open space forms a part of Green Infrastructure and for the purposes of 
this policy includes formal intensively managed open space such as parks, 
sports grounds, amenity greenspace, play areas, allotments, cemeteries, 
and church yards.  It also includes natural and semi-natural open space 
that are less-intensively managed with more attention given to natural 
habitats of value to wildlife.  Many of these form greenway links between 
the countryside and urban areas.  The NPPF states that access to high 
quality open spaces and opportunities for sport and recreation can make 
an important contribution to the health and well-being of communities. 
4.30.4 St Helens Borough Council commissioned studies in 200634 and 201635 to 
examine the provision of open space in the Borough.  In accordance with 
the NPPF, the studies have identified specific needs and local standards 
of provision (that are informed by community and stakeholder consultation 
concerning existing levels of provision and accessibility).  These studies 
have also identified surpluses and deficits against these standards. 
4.30.5 The 2016 study concluded that in overall terms there is a sufficient 
quantity of open space; however, there are areas where there are 
deficiencies in the quantity, quality and / or accessibility of open spaces.  
Policy LPA08, in combination with other Plan policies (e.g., Policy LPC05) 
address this by seeking to ensure the protection and provision of open 
space to meet the communities’ needs and safeguard the visual amenity 
and character of the built-up area. 
4.30.6 The NPPF 2021 requires development plans to “take a strategic approach 
to maintaining and enhancing networks of habitats and green 
infrastructure; and plan for the enhancement of natural capital at a 
catchment or landscape scale across local authority boundaries.”   The 
local authorities in the Liverpool City Region (LCR) have worked together 
to prepare the LCR Ecological Network as a joint evidence base and to 
plan for biodiversity at a landscape-scale. 
4.30.7 The Government’s 25-year Environment Plan36 has a target to increase 
the coverage of woodland in England by up to 12% by 2060.  This would 
involve planting 180,000ha by the end of 2042.  The Government supports 
the development of the Northern Forest along the M62 Corridor, through 
the partnership of the Community Forests and the Woodland Trust.  The 
Mersey Forest Plan37 sets local targets for woodland cover including in St 
Helens Borough.  Policy LPA08 seeks to promote a joined-up approach 
that will support delivery of these other strategies.

 79 4.31 Policy LPA09: Parkside East 
Policy LPA09: Parkside East 
1. The Parkside East site (identified as Site 7EA in Policy LPA03) shall be 
considered suitable in principle for development of a Strategic Rail Freight 
Interchange (SRFI) with the primary purpose of facilitating the movement of 
freight by rail and its on-site storage and transfer between rail and other 
transport modes. 
2. The site is also considered suitable in principle for other forms of B2 and B8 
employment use provided that they would: 
 a) bring significant inward investment, local employment, and training 
benefits for the local community; and 
 b) (i) be rail served (i.e., requiring on-site access to a railway); or 
 (ii) be of a layout and scale that would not prejudice the ability to develop 
an effectively laid out SRFI or other rail served employment 
development (including any necessary rail and road infrastructure, 
buildings, and landscaping), on at least 60ha of the site, at any time in 
the future. 
3. Proposals for development within site 7EA will be required to: 
 a) satisfy the masterplanning requirements set out in Policy LPA03.1; 
 b) create safe and convenient access from Junction 22 of the M6 for Heavy 
Goods Vehicles and other vehicles; 
 c) mitigate any adverse impacts on the surrounding strategic and local road 
network; 
 d) comply with Policy LPC11 in relation to the protection of designated 
heritage assets; 
 e) achieve direct rail access to and from the Liverpool / Manchester (‘Chat 
Moss’) and the West Coast Main Lines (unless agreed otherwise by the 
Council); 
 f) be designed to minimise impacts on residential amenity; 
 g) establish and implement a Travel Plan that incorporates measures to  
encourage travel to / from the development using sustainable transport 
modes, including access by public transport, cycle and foot, in accordance 
with Policy LPA07; 
 h) make provision for the positive management of existing and new 
environmental assets;  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 80  i) put training schemes in place (where practicable) to increase the 
opportunity for the local population to obtain access to employment at the 
site; and 
      j) ensure the timely delivery of the rail terminal infrastructure of the SRFI or 
other rail served employment development, in accordance with the 
comprehensive masterplan to be prepared for the whole site as required 
by Policy LPA03.1, section 2.  Within this, details of the phasing for the 
whole site must include a clear and justified employment floorspace trigger 
for the delivery of the rail terminal infrastructure. 
4. That part of site 7EA which falls to the west of the M6 is safeguarded from all 
forms of development unless it can be shown that such development within it 
will not prejudice, or may provide, effective and deliverable future siding 
facilities in connection with the development of an SRFI or other rail-enabled 
development within the part of the site which falls to the east of the M6 (see 
Policies Map).

• St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
4.33 Reasoned Justification 
4.33.1 There is a long-standing history of developer interest in providing a 
Strategic Rail Freight Interchange (SRFI) on land within and close to the 
former Parkside Colliery.  There have been a number of planning 
applications for such a use and the area was highlighted as a potential 
location for this use in the former Regional Spatial Strategy for the North 
West (2008). 
National Policy Statement for National Networks (2015) 
4.33.2 The National Policy Statement for National Networks (NPS) 2015 
recognises that the railway network forms a vital part of the UK’s transport 
infrastructure that must: St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 81 “… provide for the transport of freight across the country, and to 
and from ports, in order to help meet environmental goals and 
improve quality of life”. 
4.33.3 The NPS strongly supports the development of an expanded network of 
SRFIs to help promote economic development (by responding to the 
changing needs of the logistics sector and addressing growth in 
movement of freight by rail) and address climate change.  The NPS also 
stresses that SRFIs should be located near to business markets such as 
major urban centres or groups of centres and be linked to key supply 
chain routes.  It suggests that SRFI capacity needs to be provided at a 
wide range of locations to provide the flexibility needed to match the 
changing demands of the market. 
Transport for the North 
4.33.4 The Transport for the North (TfN) Freight and Logistics Report (2016) 
concludes that 850ha of land should be developed for rail and / or water 
connected Multimodal Distribution Parks (MDPs) between 2016 and 2033.  
This is required to reduce the cost of freight transport, expand market 
share in the logistics sector and attract private inward investment to the 
North. 
4.33.5 The Draft TfN Strategic Transport Plan (2018) identifies that the growth of 
the freight and logistics sector will be crucial to support the 
transformational economic growth ambitions of the North.  It also identifies 
the need for improvements in the arrangements for interchanging goods 
movements between road and rail and supports the development of sites 
with multi-modal access. 
4.33.6 The TfN Freight and Logistics Enhanced Analysis Report (2018) forecasts 
that the amount of freight moved in the North of England will grow 
significantly between 2016 and 2050 (by 33% based on tonnes lifted or 
60% based on tonne kilometres).  The report identifies four main principles 
for investing in and enhancing rail freight interchange infrastructure, 
including north-south and east-west connectivity and intermodal 
connectivity.  These principles will be used to guide Strategic 
Development Corridor studies to be undertaken by TfN to produce a 
prioritised programme of investment. 
Liverpool City Region Growth Plan and Strategic Economic Plan (2016) 
4.33.7 The LCR Growth Plan and Strategic Economic Plan (2016) identifies 
logistics as one of six growth sectors.  Due to its location with good access 
to the M6 and two major railway lines, the Parkside site has substantial 
scope to help grow the logistics sector by being developed as an SRFI.  
The LCR Freight and Logistics Strategy is being prepared to maximise the 
contribution made by the freight and logistics sector to the economic 
growth of the City Region.  This is expected to present a suite of 
interventions to capitalise on this opportunity.  The LCR Combined 
Authority is also continuing to explore options to progress the design of the 
required rail connections to the Parkside site. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 82 Parkside Link Road scheme 
4.33.8 The Parkside Link Road will comprise a 3.5km length of single / dual 
carriageway road that will provide access to the Parkside East and West 
sites (sites 7EA and 8EA) from M6 Junction 22 and the local road network, 
using the existing A573 Parkside Road bridge over the M6.  The Council 
has secured funding to progress the delivery of the link road scheme. 
Parkside Logistics and Rail Freight Interchange Study (AECOM and Cushman & 
Wakefield 2016) 
4.33.9 The Parkside Logistics and Rail Freight Interchange Study 2016 
investigated delivery options for road and rail-linked logistics development 
on land at Parkside East and West.  It confirmed, having regard to the 
results of consultation with relevant industry stakeholders, that there is a 
clear demand for a new SRFI in the North West.  It also identified that, due 
to its geographical location and specific characteristics Parkside is 
uniquely placed to satisfy this demand.  In particular the opportunities for 
rail access from the site are considered to be second to none in the North 
West with access being easily achievable to both the West Coast Mainline 
and to the East-West (‘Chat Moss’) line between Liverpool and 
Manchester.  This will allow train movements to / from the north, south, 
east and west to be catered for at the site. 
4.33.10 The Study also identified that the development of an SRFI at Parkside 
would bring substantial benefits in terms of modal shift of freight 
movement (from road to rail) and therefore of reducing carbon emissions, 
when compared with the development of purely road-based logistics uses 
of an equivalent scale. 
4.33.11 Based on evidence available when it was completed, the Study indicates 
that the Parkside site could viably deliver a medium (8 trains per day) to 
large (12 trains per day) facility.  The Study concludes that to deliver a 
viable SRFI at Parkside, land on both the west and east side of the M6 
must be allocated for the SRFI use and its associated rail infrastructure. 
Other potential employment uses 
4.33.12 The strategic location of the Parkside East site next to major north-south 
and east-west rail routes also makes it attractive to a range of other 
rail-enabled uses such as the manufacture and maintenance of rolling 
stock, and other industrial uses that require access to rail to serve their 
markets.  The Parkside East site will be considered suitable in principle for 
these uses provided they bring significant inward investment and / or local 
employment and training opportunities, the benefits of which would 
outweigh any impact that the proposal would have on the scope to 
develop an SRFI at this location. 
4.33.13 The site is, due to its size (of over 124ha) also considered sufficiently large 
to accommodate other forms of Class B2 and B8 employment 
development on part of the area.  However, for such uses to be accepted 
it must be demonstrated that the layout of the site as a whole would 
enable the effective development of a nationally significant SRFI or other 
form(s) of major rail-enabled employment use(s) on at least 60ha of the 
site.  The figure of 60ha equates to the threshold above which an SRFI St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 83 use is identified as being ‘nationally significant’ under the Planning Act 
2008. 
Justification for removing Site7EA from the Green Belt 
4.33.14 Site 7EA was (until adoption of this Plan) located in the Green Belt.  
However, its development in accordance with Policy LPA09 (linked to the 
unique locational benefits set out above) would strongly support the 
Government’s aims of building a robust northern economy, promoting the 
use of the national rail infrastructure, and reducing carbon emissions and 
congestion by limiting freight movement by road.  The potential to develop 
an SRFI at this site is reflected in the TfN Northern Freight and Logistics 
Report Technical Appendices (2016) and would play a key role in 
delivering the objectives of the Liverpool City Region Growth Plan and 
Strategic Economic Plan (2016). 
4.33.15 In combination with Parkside West (Site 8EA), the Parkside East site 
provides the single largest economic development opportunity in the 
Borough.  The parts of the site that are not directly required to provide rail 
or road infrastructure or landscaping will also make an important 
contribution to meeting needs for employment development. 
4.33.16 Taking into account the above factors, the land identified in Figure 4.4 has 
been removed from the Green Belt.  Out of a total of 124.55ha of land at 
Parkside East it is estimated that 64.55ha will contribute to the Borough’s 
needs for employment development with the remaining 60ha being 
required to provide related rail and road infrastructure and landscaping.  A 
further 5.58ha of land to the west of the M6 is safeguarded to facilitate rail 
access to/from the north to the Parkside East site. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Policy LPA10:  Parkside West 
1. The Parkside West site (identified as site 8EA in Policy LPA03) shall be considered 
suitable for B2 and B8 uses. 
 
2. Proposals for development within site 8EA will be required to: 
 
a) Satisfy the masterplanning requirements set out in Policy LPA03.1; 
b) Provide safe and convenient access to and from the M6 for Heavy Goods 
Vehicles and other vehicles: 
i. Access to an initial phase of development can (subject to detailed 
assessment) be provided off the A49 (Winwick Road) 
ii. Later phases of development should be served by a new link road from 
the east (linking to Junction 22 of the M6) 
iii. The amount of development achievable within each phase must be 
determined using a comprehensive transport assessment to be 
approved by the relevant highway authorities; 
c) Suitably mitigate any adverse impacts on the M6 (Junction 22) or other parts of 
the highway network (strategic and local);  
d) Include suitable measures to control impact of increased traffic movement or uses 
within the site on residential amenity, noise and / or air quality in the surrounding 
area; 
e) Include measures to mitigate any adverse impacts on the Battle of Winwick 
Registered Battlefield and other heritage assets in the area; 
f) Secure suitable access to the site by walking and cycling, such as, the provision 
of segregated walking and cycling routes which must run through the site and link 
to nearby highways; and improved bus provision, including upgraded bus stops; 
g) Establish and implement a Travel Plan incorporating measures to encourage 
travel to / from the development by sustainable modes; 
h) Make provision for the positive management of existing and new environmental 
assets; and 
i) Put training schemes in place (where practicable) to increase the opportunity for 
the local population to obtain access to employment at the site. 
 
The development of Parkside West (site 8EA) must ensure that the part of site 7EA 
(Parkside East) which falls to the west of the M6 (as shown on the Policies Map) is 
safeguarded from all forms of development unless it can be shown that such 
development within it will not prejudice, or may provide, effective and deliverable future 
siding facilities in connection with the development of an SRFI or other rail-enabled 
development on land to the east of the M6 (site 7EA). St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

4.36 Reasoned Justification 
4.36.1 The Core Strategy (2012), Policy CAS 3.2 identified the site of the former 
Parkside Colliery and immediately adjacent land as a strategic location 
with the potential to facilitate the transfer of freight between road and rail.  
It was considered that a deliverable and viable SRFI could be developed 
on the western side of the M6, provided a number of criteria were met.  On 
that basis, the principle of delivering a Strategic Rail Freight Interchange 
(SRFI) in this location was supported. 
4.36.2 Furthermore, Policy CAS 3.2 recognised that there may be a need for a 
larger area of land, extending to the east of the M6 to accommodate an 
enlarged SRFI, on the basis of operational, viability and commercial 
reasons.  Therefore, the Policy supported the development of land to the 
east of the M6 provided that 1) the area of land to the west of the M6 was 
developed first, and 2) that the SRFI would be undeliverable without the 
additional land to the east of the M6. 
4.36.3 Since the Core Strategy, the policy in relation to Parkside has evolved to 
reflect the latest evidence.  The Council commissioned consultants 
AECOM to undertake the Parkside Logistics and Rail Freight Interchange 
Study (2016).  The findings of this Study informed the proposed approach 
to Parkside in this Plan:  The development of Parkside East as the location 
of a SRFI (together with other industrial and logistics uses), and the 
development of Parkside West as a separate, though linked, employment 
site for logistics use, which will be served by road only, although it will 
accommodate rail siding facilities for incoming trains linked to Parkside 
East.  Parkside West could also potentially be served from the SRFI by 
tractor units. 
4.36.4 Accordingly, Parkside West is allocated for 79.57ha of employment land 
for B8 and B2 uses.  This area excludes 5.58ha of land at Parkside West 
required to facilitate rail access to Parkside East (7EA) and a further 
12.1ha of land occupied by a spoil heap, which is not considered 
developable. 
4.36.5 The delivery of this site will be supported by the delivery of the Parkside 
Link Road, which will provide access to the M6 Junction 22 from both the 
Parkside West and East sites.  The Council has secured the funding to St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 87 progress the delivery of the link road scheme. On 11 November 2021, the 
SoS granted planning permission for the development of Parkside Phase 
1 and the link road. 
4.36.6 The allocation of Parkside West will contribute to meeting the identified 
employment needs over the Plan period as set out in Policy LPA03 and 
explained in the associated Reasoned Justification.  The site also contains 
a significant amount of Previously Developed Land, and so its allocation 
will contribute to the effective use of land in the Borough to meet identified 
development needs. 
4.36.7 The site is located within close proximity of an area within the 20% most 
deprived population in the UK, and therefore offers not only wider 
economic benefits, but also presents the opportunity to help reduce 
poverty and social exclusion in the local areas and provide regeneration 
benefits. 
4.36.8 The exceptional circumstances justifying the removal of this site from the 
Green Belt is set out in the Reasoned Justification of Policy LPA03.

Policy LPA11:  Bold Forest Garden Suburb 
The Bold Forest Garden Suburb site (identified as site 4HA in Policy LPA04) is allocated 
for housing development, with an indicative site capacity of 2,988 dwellings, of which a 
minimum of 510 dwellings will be delivered during the plan period. The site boundaries 
are set out in the appendix 5 site 4HA profile and on the Policies Map. 
 
1. Development of the site should deliver the following requirements: 
Housing 
a) At least 30% of homes to be delivered on site should fall within the definition of 
‘affordable housing’ in accordance with Policy LPC02, with the affordable housing 
mix reflecting Policy LPC02, part 3), unless up-to-date and robust evidence 
indicates otherwise; 
b) Provide an appropriate mix and standard of housing to meet local needs in 
accordance with policy LPC01; 
c) Deliver at least 10% of the site’s energy needs from renewable and / or other low 
carbon energy sources in accordance with Policy LPC13, part 4), unless this is 
shown to not be practicable or viable; 
Design and Layout 
d) The development of this site should be consistent with the vision, aims, objectives 
and policies of the Bold Forest Park Area Action Plan (2017); 
e) The layout must avoid causing excessive noise or disturbance to occupiers of 
existing dwellings and businesses within or around the site and for users of 
walking and cycling routes and open spaces; 
Social Infrastructure 
f) Contributions towards primary and secondary school provision in the area, to 
meet the identified need for additional school places, through the extension of 
existing schools and / or delivery of new school facilities; 
g) Provision of a new GP surgery within the development, which could be in the form 
of the relocation and expansion of an active practice onto the site; 
h) Provide a small local centre containing community and retail facilities; 
Play, Open Space and Green Infrastructure 
i) Provision of an accessible, comprehensive, high quality and connected network of 
multi-functional green spaces in accordance with a Green Infrastructure Plan to 
be provided as part of the comprehensive masterplan approach for the whole site 
as required by Policy LPA04.1, section 2 f); 
j) Retention of existing and provision of new high quality, well designed and 
accessible open space and play space provision in accordance with Policies 
LPC05 and LPD03.  Details of how open spaces will be subsequently maintained 
will need to be considered through the masterplanning process; St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 89 Landscape and Biodiversity 
k) The development must provide a well landscaped setting including extensive 
green links through and around the site, and tree planting to reduce impact on the 
landscape and promote the objective of the BFPAAP to increase tree cover by 
30% across the Bold Forest as a whole; 
l) Any adverse impacts on biodiversity interests within the existing Local Wildlife 
Site (LWS 108 as indicated on the Policies Map) and the proposed extension to 
this must be either avoided or minimised. Any resultant harm must be adequately 
mitigated; 
Access and Highways 
m) Provision of safe access arrangements for the site; 
n) Creation of a permeable layout with a range of highways provided through the site 
with access via the B5204, Neills Road and Gorsey Lane; 
o) Provision of a bus service through the site between Clock Face and St Helens 
Junction, and the layout of the site must be compatible with this; 
p) Provision of a permeable network of foot, bridleway, and cycle routes through the 
site to facilitate access between homes, workplaces, recreational facilities, and 
other key services in the area.  These must, where necessary, be segregated to 
ensure safety and include new provision in line with Policy INF6 “Creating an 
Accessible Forest Park” of the Bold Forest Park Area Action Plan 2017; 
q) Provision of any other measures necessary to secure suitable access to the site 
by walking, cycling and public transport such as: 
i. The provision of new accessible bus stops to an agreed specification 
through the site so that none of the proposed dwellings are more than 
400 metres walking distance from a bus stop; and 
ii. A financial contribution towards the improvements of St Helens 
Junction station; 
r) Masterplanning of site must take into account the opportunity to expand the 
Greenway network, and make provision for this in line with Policy LPC07, and the 
accompanying Figure 7.1; and 
s) Masterplanning of the site must be informed by the findings of the Bold Forest 
Garden Suburb Transport Review (August 2019) and any other relevant 
evidence. 
 
2. As above, financial contributions or the provision of on-site infrastructure for 
education, health and offsite highway works may be required.  The detailed 
infrastructure requirements to support the delivery of the site will be further assessed 
through the comprehensive masterplanning process. 
 
3. In accordance with Policy LPA04.1, section 2), any planning application for 
development within the site will need to accord with a single comprehensive masterplan 
covering the whole of the Bold Forest Garden Suburb site, and to be approved by the St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 90 Council, which will need to set out the listed details in sub-sections a) to i) as a 
minimum.  Any proposal will need to demonstrate how it complies with this masterplan in 
order to ensure a comprehensive, co-ordinated, and well-designed development is 
delivered with the necessary supporting infrastructure.

4.39 Reasoned Justification 
4.39.1 The Bold Forest Garden Suburb (BFGS) is the largest allocation identified 
in the Plan. It comprises a large area of undeveloped agricultural land, 
located on the urban edges of Clock Face, Sutton and Bold. The site 
contains a scattering of farm buildings, a transmitter station and some 
limited areas containing trees and hedges. A line of electric pylons run 
through the site along the north-western boundary, and a Local Wildlife 
Site 108 (LWS) (Tunstalls Farm), lies to the north-western side of the site, 
beyond the site boundary. Existing residential development surrounds the 
site on three sides, including Reginald Road Industrial Estate; the 
southern edge, for the most part, is defined by Gorsey Lane. 
4.39.2 The Green Belt Review (2018) informed this allocation. The Review 
identified that land at Bold forms a major strategic opportunity to provide a 
wide range of new housing in an area that is close to some of the more 
deprived parts of the Borough, contributing to the balanced growth of the 
Borough. It also has good accessibility to jobs and services and high 
levels of compliance with other aspects of the Green Belt Review 
methodology.  This land therefore forms a substantial element within the 
overall housing strategy, striking the right balance between meeting 
housing and employment development needs, while protecting the most 
valuable environmental resources and the overall function of the Green 
Belt. 
4.39.3 The Review concluded that the BFGS site as a whole should be allocated 
for development, noting that it “ forms a notable indent in the alignment of 
the southern edge of the built-up area of St Helens .” It added that due to 
“the size of the parcel, it has the potential to form a ’garden suburb’ 
extension to the south of Bold, which would be sufficiently large to include St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 91 new social infrastructure (such as a new primary school, local retail centre 
and potentially health facilities). It would constitute a major strategic 
opportunity to provide a wide range of new housing in an area that is close 
to some of the more deprived parts of the Borough .” 
4.39.4 The BFGS is located within the Bold Forest Park, and therefore the 
development of this site allocation must be consistent with the vision, 
aims, objectives and policies of the Bold Forest Park Area Action Plan 
(BFPAAP) (2017), which forms part of the Development Plan. The 
requirements set out in this policy provide a strong and robust foundation 
in developing the vision and objectives for the Bold Forest Garden Suburb, 
which will be further refined through the masterplanning process. 
4.39.5 Throughout the preparation of the Local Plan, the Council have consulted 
with various internal and external infrastructure providers, including the 
Council’s Schools Support Services Team, National Highways, and St 
Helens Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to ascertain the level of 
infrastructure required to support the BFGS.  This work will continue 
through the masterplanning process for the site. 
Housing 
4.39.6 The site has an indicative capacity of 2,988 dwellings (in accordance with 
Table 4.5), of which it is anticipated that some 510 dwellings would be 
completed within the Plan period (i.e., by 31 March 2037). 
4.39.7 Given the size of the BFGS site, a lead in time of seven years on adoption 
of the Plan has been applied for the BFGS to allow for a thorough 
masterplanning process. This work may then form the basis of a site-
specific SPD. 
4.39.8 A build-out rate assumption of 60 units per annum has been used for the 
BFGS, reflecting a cautious approach due to uncertainties in relation to 
uncertainty on the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 
supporting infrastructure required to deliver the site. Actual build-out rates 
will depend on the number of housebuilders and sale centres that are 
operational at any one time on the site. 
Social Infrastructure 
4.39.9 The Council’s School’s Support Services Team have considered capacity 
at the existing schools in the area, both in terms of primary and secondary 
provision.  It is likely that the BFGS will necessitate the expansion and / or 
provision of new school facilities.  Work to consider school needs is 
ongoing in terms of determining which schools may be capable of 
extension and where a new school may be required, and this will feed into 
the BFGS masterplanning process. 
4.39.10 St Helens CCG advised that there is a deficiency of healthcare 
practitioners to the south of the Borough, particularly in Bold. Therefore, 
there could be a need for a new general practice surgery to be constructed 
within the BFGS to accommodate the increased demand for healthcare in 
Bold (and from surrounding areas). The CCG have indicated that this new 
practice could be in the form of relocating and expanding an active 
practice onto the site.  This need will be further refined through the 
masterplanning process. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 92 4.39.11 The BFGS is not within walking distance of a local or district centre.  
However, due to its size it is considered that it could support a small local 
centre containing community and retail facilities, which will make the 
development more sustainable. Retail provision will be looked at in more 
detail through the comprehensive masterplanning process and in any 
subsequent SPD. 
Transport 
4.39.12 Consultants WSP undertook an initial transport review to understand the 
likely impact of the BFGS on the wider highways network and to consider 
transport initiatives that could support development of the site. The Review 
consists of two key elements: a) examination of the likely trip generation, 
distribution, and route assignments on the local highway network, based 
on a core and alternative scenario; and b) preparation of a study report 
setting out the findings of a review of local transport infrastructure. It also 
identifies strategic network improvements and likely masterplanning 
design requirements. 
4.39.13 In its initial findings, the Review anticipates that there will be highways 
junctions that will experience impact in terms of traffic flow as a result of 
development but that there are opportunities to achieve a significant modal 
shift towards sustainable travel that would reduce the impact of the 
proposed development on the local highway network. National Highways 
have provided initial comments on the Review and the Council will 
continue to engage with National Highways throughout the BFGS 
masterplanning process. 
4.39.14 The Review is an initial element of the masterplanning process that will be 
required prior to the site being developed.  
Masterplanning 
4.39.15 The site is under the control of multiple landowners, and it is therefore 
particularly important that an appropriate mechanism is in place to ensure 
a comprehensive, well connected, and well-designed development is 
delivered on the site, with the necessary supporting infrastructure.  Section 
2 of Policy LPA04.1 provides for this mechanism in the form of any 
planning application for development within the site needing to accord with 
a comprehensive masterplan covering the whole site, which sets out a 
wide range of details, as listed in sub-sections a) to i).  This masterplan 
will need to be approved by the Council in advance of any planning 
applications and will be prepared in consultation with a range of 
stakeholders.  In the case of the BFGS, this is particularly critical to ensure 
that a high quality development is delivered in a comprehensive manner, 
and the various phases of development can be delivered in accordance 
with an overarching, agreed masterplan, and in a timely manner. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 93 4.40 Policy LPA12: Health and Wellbeing 
Policy LPA12: Health and Wellbeing 
The Council will work with its health and wellbeing partners to promote public 
health principles, maximise opportunities for people to lead healthy and active 
lifestyles, and reduce health inequalities for residents within the Borough.  Through 
the planning system, the Council will seek to: 
1. encourage improved access to a choice of homes and jobs that meet the 
needs of the area; 
2. ensure the provision of easy-to-maintain, safe and attractive public areas and 
green spaces to serve new development that minimise the opportunity for and 
fear of crime and anti-social behaviour and that promote social cohesion and 
mental wellbeing; 
3. encourage people to be physically active by providing opportunities for 
walking, cycling, outdoor recreation and sport including, where appropriate, 
the provision of opportunities for physical activity within the design of new 
development; 
4. guide the location of food and drink uses such as hot food takeaways, drinking 
establishments, restaurants, cafes and other uses that may have negative 
health impacts having regard to their impact on other land uses in the local 
area; 
5. maximise the levels of accessibility between homes, educational 
establishments, jobs, public transport services, health and other services, 
recreational opportunities and community, cultural and leisure facilities; 
6. encourage measures to achieve affordable warmth; 
7. promote Active Design principles as established by Sport England; and 
8. manage air quality and pollution. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

4.42 Reasoned Justification 
4.42.1 Decisions that influence how the built and natural environment is managed 
and developed can have both negative and positive impacts on the health 
and wellbeing of local people.  The planning process can help to promote 
the health and wellbeing of residents, workers, and visitors in the Borough 
through its role in shaping the built and natural environment.  This can 
influence people’s ability to follow healthy behaviours and can have 
positive impacts by reducing inequalities.  Therefore, it is important that 
health matters are considered at an early stage in the design of 
development schemes. 
4.42.2 The NPPF requires Local Plans to enable and support healthy lifestyles 
and encourages local planning authorities to engage relevant health 
organisations in the preparation of Local Plans. 
4.42.3 Key health and wellbeing issues faced by the Borough’s residents include: 
 life expectancy levels that are lower than the national averages; 
 an ageing local population (which is associated with a variety of 
health related problems); 
 economic activity rates that are lower than regional and national 
averages; 
 limited levels of physical activity and rising levels of obesity (in 
adults and children); 
 mental health issues; 
 in-work poverty; and 
 incidences of alcohol-related harm. 
4.42.4 There are also significant inequalities in health outcomes and lifestyle 
factors between people living in different areas of the Borough38.  The St 
Helens People’s Board (which covers the statutory functions of the Health 
and Wellbeing Board and the Community Safety Partnership) is 
responding to these issues in a variety of ways.  These include the 
implementation of the St Helens People's Plan 2017-2020, within which a 
 
38 As set out in the St Helens Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (2017): https://info4.sthelens.gov.uk/strategic-assessments/jsna  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 95 key focus is the establishment of the “St Helens Cares”  integrated 
operating model for health and social care in the Borough. 
4.42.5 Policy LPA12 sets out a range of measures that the Council will use to 
address health and wellbeing related issues.  In combination with other 
policies within this Plan, such as LPA01, LPA06, LPA07, LPA10, LPD09 
and LPD10, Policy LPA12 seeks to promote healthier communities and 
reduce health inequalities in the Borough. 
4.42.6 Active Design has been developed by Sport England supported by Public 
Health England and sets out ten principles.  These are arranged under the 
headings of: 
 Activity for all; 
 Walkable communities; 
 Connected walking & cycling routes; 
 Co-location of community facilities; 
 Network of multifunctional open space; 
 High quality streets and spaces; 
 Appropriate infrastructure; 
 Active buildings; 
 Management, maintenance, monitoring & evaluation; and 
 Activity promotion & local champions. 
4.42.7 Further details of Active Design are set out in the Sport England document 
Active Design: Planning for Health and Wellbeing through Sport and 
Physical Activity 2015.  Active Design principles will be applied as 
appropriate to new development proposals in the Borough to help provide 
opportunities for active and healthy lifestyles. 
4.42.8 Further guidance to support the implementation of Policy LPA12 may be 
set out in a future SPD.

 96 5. Area Policies 
5.1 Policy LPB01: St Helens Town Centre and Central Spatial Area 
Policy LPB01: St Helens Town Centre and Central Spatial Area 
1. The Council will promote the Central Spatial Area as an accessible and 
welcoming destination for new development that accords with paragraphs 2 to 
9 of this Policy and that would help create a high quality built environment. 
Development that would support the delivery and implementation of the 
Council-led strategy for the future regeneration and development of St Helens 
Town Centre will be supported. 
2. The English Cities Fund Regeneration Partnership will help deliver a 
comprehensive redevelopment of the Town Centre and Central Spatial Area, 
including new commercial activity, upgraded infrastructure, the provision of 
quality housing, and the overall improvement of the social and economic 
viability of the area. 
3. Proposals for retail and leisure development will be directed to suitable 
locations within the Town Centre and then other sequentially preferable sites 
in line with Policy LPC04 and national policy.  A town centre ‘area of 
opportunity’ for future retail, leisure and cultural development is shown 
indicatively on the Policies Map.  Development that would result in significant 
harm to the Town Centre’s vitality and viability or prejudice planned investment 
within it will be resisted. 
4. Proposals for change of use of units in the Primary Shopping Area in St 
Helens Town Centre will be refused unless they would be to a main town 
centre use or uses that would contribute positively to the overall vitality and 
viability of the centre.   
5. New development proposals will be required, where appropriate having regard 
to their location, nature, and scale, to facilitate linked trips between the 
Primary Shopping Area and other existing and proposed developments within 
the St Helens Central Spatial Area, including Asda on Kirkland Street; The 
Range on Chalon Way; St Helens and Ravenhead Retail Parks; Linkway 
West; Tesco Extra on Linkway; and St Helens RLFC Stadium. 
6. Regular health checks will be undertaken to monitor the vitality and viability of 
St Helens Town Centre. 
7. Proposals for housing or a mix of housing and other suitable use(s) within or 
on the edge of the Town Centre will be supported where they would avoid 
prejudicing the retail and service role of the Town Centre. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 97 8. New development in the vicinity of St Helens Canal will be required to, as 
appropriate, improve the public realm by retaining and enhancing the existing 
waterway, positively integrating with the canal, and securing improvements to 
Green Infrastructure in line with Policy LPA08. 
9. Pedestrian and vehicular accessibility within and around the Town Centre will 
be managed in line with the road-user hierarchy set out in the Liverpool City 
Region: Transport Plan for Growth in order to: 
 a) maintain pedestrian priority within the Town Centre and extend pedestrian 
links to adjacent areas; 
 b) make suitable provision for cyclists; 
 c) support the Town Centre as the hub of the public transport network in St 
Helens Borough; and 
 d) make appropriate provision for cars and service vehicles.

5.3 Reasoned Justification 
5.3.1 The St Helens Central Spatial Area (as shown in appendix 11 and on the 
Policies Map) includes the Town Centre and its surrounding hinterland.  
This includes residential, retail and leisure uses’ that link to the central 
retail core. 
5.3.2 The St Helens Borough Council Retail and Leisure Study Final Report 
May 2017 assessed the Borough’s future retail and leisure needs.  It found 
that the Town Centre’s market share for comparison goods expenditure 
has decreased from 28.2% in 2011 to 20.4% in 2017 whilst the market 
shares for Ravenhead and St Helens Retail Parks have increased 
significantly. 
5.3.3 Based on an assessment of the expected levels of population and 
expenditure growth, a requirement for additional comparison goods 
floorspace across the Borough is identified from 2023 onwards. This will 
correspond to an approximate need for between 3,000m2 and 6,200m2 of 
new floorspace by 2028 rising to between 9,200m2 and 21,200m2 by 2033 St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 98 (it should be noted however that long term estimates should be viewed 
cautiously due to the difficulties in predicting the economy’s performance 
over time). 
5.3.4 To meet this need and address the weakening of the town centre’s 
comparison goods market share in recent years, the Council will continue 
to pursue ‘town centre first’ principles in line with national policy and seek 
to accommodate as much of this additional floorspace within St Helens 
Town Centre as possible.  A health check of the town centre carried out as 
part of the study reported that 15.8% of the total units were vacant, which 
is significantly greater than the national average vacancy rate of 11.2%.  
Therefore, it is sensible in the first instance to prioritise the re-occupation 
of vacant units to boost the health of the town centre. 
5.3.5 The same ‘town centre first’ approach will apply to locating future 
leisure-based development to provide for diversification in the town 
centre’s offer to the public and so improve its vitality and viability. 
5.3.6 A Town Centre Strategy39 to provide a comprehensive approach to the 
future of St Helens Town Centre underwent public consultation during 
August - October 2017.  The Strategy set out a vision for the future of the 
town centre detailing thematic initiatives to deliver this. In January 2020 
the Council successfully received an initial £173,029 capacity fund as part 
of the Governments Town Deal initiative. The Council has now 
successfully secured significant investment of up to £25 million. This 
funding will be used to help increase economic growth with a focus on 
land use and regeneration, improved connectivity (both transport and 
better broadband connectivity), skills and employment, and heritage, arts, 
and culture. A Town Investment Plan will be developed and will sit 
alongside the Town Centre Strategy. 
5.3.7 The Council’s future aspirations to improve the offer of St Helens Town 
Centre as set out within the Strategy include the provision of new retail 
and leisure floorspace, subject to the appropriate policy tests.  It is 
considered that this approach, along with steps to encourage the reuse of 
vacant floorspace, will address the identified quantitative and qualitative 
needs of residents in the Borough. 
5.3.8 The Council will support initiatives and schemes that will help to implement 
the Strategy by revitalising and enhancing the Town Centre’s retail, 
leisure, and cultural offer. The 'Area of Opportunity', referred to in the 
Strategy, has been identified due to the potential to reconfigure and / or 
redevelop land and premises close to Church Square and Chalon Way for 
suitable town centre uses. To support this initiative and to assist in the 
regeneration of the area, the Council has entered into a regeneration 
partnership with the English Cities Fund to deliver a comprehensive 
redevelopment of the Town Centre (and wider Borough on a phased 
basis). 
5.3.9 The first preference for the location of new Class E and Sui Generis retail 
main town centre uses development is within the Primary Shopping Area.  
 
39 St Helens Transforming our Town - Planning for the future of St Helens Town Centre (Sept 2017) St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 99 Proposals for Class E and Sui Generis retail main town centre uses that 
are in an edge-of-centre or out-of-centre location in relation to the Primary 
Shopping Area will require a Sequential Assessment in accordance with 
national policy and Policy LPC04. 
5.3.10 For all non-retail Main Town Centre uses (as defined by the NPPF) the 
preferred location is within the Town Centre.  Proposals for such uses in 
an edge-of-centre or out-of-centre location in relation to the Town Centre 
boundary will require a Sequential Assessment in accordance with 
national policy and Policy LPC04. 
5.3.11 All Main Town Centre uses in an edge or out-of-centre location that meet 
the thresholds in Policy LPC04 will also require an Impact Assessment in 
accordance with national policy. 
5.3.12 Within the Central Spatial Area, facilities such as the Asda on Kirkland 
Street, The Range on Chalon Way, Ravenhead Retail Park, St Helens 
Retail Park, Linkway West, Tesco Extra on Linkway and St Helens Rugby 
League Football Club's Stadium perform a key function in retaining local 
retail expenditure and attracting visitors to the town.  The Council will 
continue to promote better integration of these outlying facilities with the 
Town Centre and its retail core by, for example, encouraging the provision 
of improved pedestrian routes and bus services. 
5.3.13 Continuous monitoring of the vitality and viability of the Town Centre will 
provide the Council with regular and up-to-date data on occupancy and 
vacancy rates and enable effective monitoring of policies to ensure they 
are performing effectively. 
5.3.14 To enhance the vitality of the Town Centre and promote the health of the 
local community in line with the NPPF, the Council will support mixed-use 
schemes where they would not restrict the availability of viable retail 
floorspace.  In particular, schemes that would upgrade the quality of the 
existing office stock will be encouraged even where this would lead to an 
overall net loss of office floorspace. 
5.3.15 The Liverpool City Region: Transport Plan for Growth and associated 
documents set out a road-user hierarchy in order to reduce carbon 
emissions, reduce the risk of road traffic incidents and promote active 
travel.  In line with this hierarchy the Council will, insofar as this is 
practicable and consistent with safety considerations, promote measures 
to prioritise road traffic within and around the town centre in the following 
order (highest priority first): 
a) pedestrians; 
b) cyclists; 
c) public transport users; and 
d) access traffic. 
The objectives of this approach are to support the amenity of the town 
centre, encourage visitors and attract further businesses to the area. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Policy LPB02: Earlestown Town Centre 
1. The Council will seek to safeguard and enhance the function and role of 
Earlestown Town Centre as the second town centre within the Borough. 
2. Main town centre uses will be directed to suitable locations within the defined 
Town Centre first and then other sites in accordance with the sequential 
approach set out in Policy LPC04 and national policy.  The preferred location 
for new retail development shall be within the defined Primary Shopping Area. 
3. Development that would result in a significant adverse impact on the Town 
Centre’s vitality and viability or planned investment within it will be resisted in 
accordance with Policy LPC04 and national policy. 
4. The delivery and implementation of a Council-led strategy to provide a 
framework for the future regeneration and development of the town centre will 
be supported. The English Cities Fund Regeneration Partnership will help 
deliver a mix of residential, leisure, business and retail development all 
centred around the Town Centre.

Strategic Objectives Met SO 1.1, SO 5.3 
Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Earlestown Town Centre Strategy 
5.6 Reasoned Justification 
5.6.1 Earlestown is recognised as the second town centre in the Borough’s 
hierarchy of centres as set out in Policy LPC04.  It is highly accessible 
from the surrounding residential areas and from other parts of the Newton-
le-Willows area.  Earlestown Town Centre contains a railway station and 
bus station that provide access to local and regional destinations. 
5.6.2 The St Helens Retail and Leisure Study (WYG, 2017) identified that the 
town has a reasonable provision of goods and services for a centre of its 
size, although it has a relatively limited comparison goods offer.  Its 
convenience goods offer is significantly strengthened by the presence of 
the Tesco supermarket in the town centre that generates linked trips to 
other activities.  Earlestown is, however, poorly represented by national 
multiple retailers.  The Study concluded that the town centre provides a St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 101 local community focus, and its retail and service offer is sufficient to meet 
the day to day needs of the surrounding community. 
5.6.3 The Council will seek to safeguard and build upon this important role and 
function by applying the 'town centre first' approach to ensure that 
Earlestown remains the Borough's second centre providing a highly 
sustainable location for retail and other services. Through its partnership 
with the English Cities Fund the Council will work towards creating a mix 
of residential, leisure, business and retail development all centred around 
the Town Centre. 
5.6.4 A Primary Shopping Area (PSA) has been defined to direct retail uses, in 
the first instance, to the ‘heart’ of the town centre, this is considered 
important for Earlestown.  The PSA reflects Earlestown's core shopping 
area, which is situated along the pedestrianised Market Street and the 
adjoining Bridge Street.  These two streets contain the highest density of 
retail and service uses within the town centre.  The PSA also includes 
Tesco, Wilkinsons and Home Bargains and incorporates Market Square.  
These retailers act as key drawing factors to the centre and are 
considered to function as part of the retail core. 
5.6.5 The preferred location for new retail development is within the Primary 
Shopping Area.  Proposals for retail uses that are in an edge-of-centre or 
out-of-centre location in relation to the PSA will require a sequential 
assessment in accordance with national policy and Policy LPC04. 
5.6.6 The preferred location for all non-retail main town centre uses (as defined 
in Annex 2 of the NPPF) is within the town centre boundary.  Proposals for 
non-retail main town centre uses that are in an edge-of-centre or 
out-of-centre location in relation to the town centre boundary will require a 
sequential assessment in accordance with national policy and 
Policy LPC04. 
5.6.7 All main town centre uses in an edge-of-centre or out-of-centre location 
that meet the thresholds in Policy LPC04 will also require a town centre 
impact assessment in accordance with national policy and Policy LPC04. 
5.6.8 To provide a focus for future development of the town centre and 
positively promote Earlestown as a location to live, through the English 
Cities Fund Regeneration Partnership, the Council and its partners intend 
to bring forward a dedicated Town Centre strategy, which may form the 
basis for an SPD.  This will include initiatives to: 
 enhance the Town Centre as a shopping destination and increase 
the vibrancy of the town's market; 
 protect and enhance the town's built heritage; 
 promote Earlestown as a key commuter settlement with direct rail 
connectivity to Liverpool, Manchester and Chester; 
 increase the number and variety of residential units by encouraging 
mixed use development that makes a positive contribution to the 
economic role of the town centre; and 
 link the town centre with the new homes to be provided through the 
residential redevelopment of Deacon Trading Estate and other 
housing developments. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 102 6. Homes and Communities 
6.1 Policy LPC01: Housing Mix 
Policy LPC01: Housing Mix 
1. New market and affordable housing should be well designed to address local 
housing need and include a range of types, tenures and sizes of homes as 
informed by up-to-date, relevant evidence including the Borough’s latest 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). 
2. Where a proposal for new housing would be on a greenfield site on which the 
site as a whole would deliver 25 or more new homes, the Council will apply 
optional standards as set out in Parts M4(2) and M4(3)(2)(a) of the Building 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) so that: 
 a) at least 20 % of the new dwellings across the whole site must be designed 
to the “accessible and adaptable”  standard set out in Part M4(2); and 
 b) at least 5% of the new dwellings across the whole site must be designed 
to the “wheelchair user adaptable”  dwellings standard set out in Part 
M4(3)(2)(a). 
 If the standards in Part M4(2) or Part M4(3)(2)(a) are amended or superseded 
by new standards, the Council will apply the relevant amending or superseding 
provisions in the same proportions as set out above. 
3. Exceptions to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Policy may be made where the 
applicant has submitted an independent viability assessment, prepared by a 
suitably qualified person, which clearly demonstrates that meeting the 
requirements would render the scheme un-viable.  In such cases the Council 
will weigh any benefits of allowing the scheme in the form submitted against 
the extent of any failure to meet the requirements in full. 
4. The Council will work with partners to facilitate the provision of bungalows, and 
specialist and supported housing for elderly and vulnerable people.  Provision 
of sheltered housing, extra care housing, retirement accommodation and 
residential care homes should be easily accessible by walking and public 
transport to a suitable range of services to meet the needs of future occupiers. 
5. The Council will support the delivery of suitably designed and located 
self-build and custom-build schemes in the Borough where they would 
conform with all relevant local and national policies. 
6. Proposals for the change of use or sub-division of existing buildings to form 
flats or Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) will be granted permission 
provided they would: 
 a) retain a suitable mix of housing types to meet needs in the area; St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 103  b) avoid harming the character and / or appearance of the area; 
 c) avoid harming the amenities enjoyed by occupiers of neighbouring 
residential properties; 
 d) provide satisfactory levels of amenity for their future occupier(s) in terms of 
outlook and natural light; and 
 e) comply with parking standards referred to in Policy LPA06 and to be set 
out in the future review of the Council’s Ensuring a Choice of Travel 
Supplementary Planning Document.

Strategic Aims, Objectives and Key Delivery Mechanisms 
Strategic Aims Met SA 4 
Strategic Objectives Met SO 4.1 
Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Responding to housing needs identified in 
SHMA updates 
• Partnership working e.g., with Registered 
Providers 
6.3 Reasoned  Justification 
6.3.1 National planning policy requires the Council to plan for the delivery of a 
wide choice of high-quality homes within sustainable, inclusive, mixed 
communities, based on sound evidence and to identify the size, type, 
tenure and range of housing that is required.  The Council is seeking to 
achieve a mix of housing that reflects St Helens Borough’s housing needs.  
In accordance with national planning policy, this includes providing 
housing for different groups including those who require affordable 
housing, families with children, older people, people with disabilities and 
people wishing to commission or build their own homes. 
6.3.2 The Mid Mersey Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2016 
assessed the need for different types of housing in the Borough.  This has 
been updated by the St Helens SHMA Update 201840. 
Split between market and affordable homes 
6.3.3 The St Helens SHMA Update 2018 identifies that there is a need for 1,987 
affordable housing units to be delivered in the Borough between 2016 and 
2033 at an average of 117 units per year.  It is considered reasonable at 
this stage to extend this assessment of annual need up until the end of the 
 
40 St Helens Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) Update, GL Hearn 2018 St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 104 Plan period (2037).  Of the overall housing provision of 10,206 dwellings 
(set out in Policy LPA04) it is therefore anticipated that about 2,457 (24%) 
should be affordable.  The amount of affordable housing to be delivered is 
also likely to be affected by economic viability issues.  Policy LPC02 sets 
out in further detail the requirements for affordable housing of different 
tenures and in different areas of the Borough. 
Size of homes needed 
6.3.4 The St Helens SHMA Update 2018 identifies that the greatest need within 
the market and affordable home ownership sectors is for dwellings of 2 
and 3 bedrooms; whilst within the affordable rented sector the greatest 
need is for dwellings of 1 or 2 bedrooms.  It is acknowledged, however, 
that these are minimum sizes to meet the range of needs that are 
identified.  Table 6.1 summarises the range of sizes identified as being 
needed in the SHMA update that will guide the Council’s assessment of 
planning applications in line with paragraph 1 of Policy LPC01.  These 
needs will be kept under review as the Plan period progresses and each 
planning application will be considered on its own merits, taking into 
account relevant evidence including the most up-to-date SHMA. 
Table 6.1: Estimated Size of Homes Needed 2014-203741

Affordable housing  
(rented) 30-35% 30-35% 25-30% 5-10% 
Special needs housing (including ‘accessible and adaptable’ and ‘wheelchair user’ 
housing) 
6.3.5 National planning policy and legislation also encourages the Council to 
ensure that a proportion of new homes are accessible and can be readily 
adapted for the needs of all population groups.  The St Helens SHMA 
update 2018 identifies that, between 2016 and 2033, the population of the 
Borough that is aged 65+ is likely to increase by 27.3% and that at least 
85% of the Borough’s population growth over this period will be in this age 
group (Table 6.2). 
6.3.6 The SHMA Update 2018 also identifies that between 1,215 and 1,241 
specialist housing units for older people are needed between 2016 and 
2033 and that there is a need for 6-7% of all dwellings to be for wheelchair 
users. 
6.3.7 National Planning Practice Guidance advises that, to effectively address 
the needs for specialist housing, it is necessary to balance the scale of the 
needs against the impact that making suitable provision can have on the 
viability of new housing development.

England 2.6% 26.2% 44.5% 73.1% 9.0% 38.3% 
6.3.8 Having regard to these factors (including the findings of the St Helens 
Local Plan Economic Viability Assessment 2018), Policy LPC01 requires 
that in new developments on a greenfield site of 25 or more dwellings, at 
least 20% of the new homes will be constructed to ‘accessible and 
adaptable’ standards, as contained in Part M4(2) of the Building 
Regulations, and that at least 5% of the new homes should be designed to 
the ‘wheelchair user adaptable’ dwellings standards set down in Part 
M4(3)(2)(a) of the Building Regulations.  This will ensure that a proportion 
of all homes available in the Borough will be suitable and / or can be 
adapted, without undue difficulty, for occupation by residents who are 
wheelchair users and to ensure that these homes will also be accessible 
to visitors with limited mobility. A 12-month transition period will be applied 
from the adoption date of the Plan, following which time this requirement 
will apply to all relevant sites subject to a planning application, unless an 
exception as outlined in section 4 of the Policy is demonstrated by site 
specific evidence. 
6.3.9 The SHMA Update 2018 also identifies that bungalows are often the first 
choice for older people seeking suitable accommodation and there is 
generally high demand for such accommodation when it becomes 
available.  As the population ages, many older residents wish to downsize 
locally but have a limited range of suitable housing stock to move into.  
Therefore, the Council will require that, as a general guideline, at least 5% 
of the market homes provided on developments of 25 or more dwellings 
on greenfield sites should be bungalows. 
Self and Custom Build 
6.3.10 Self-build and custom house-building are defined in the Housing and 
Planning Act 2016 as: 
“ … the building or completion by— (a) individuals, (b) associations 
of individuals, or (c) persons working with or for individuals or 
associations of individuals, of houses to be occupied as homes by 
those individuals …” 
6.3.11 Although the terms are used interchangeably, “custom build”  is where a 
person commissions a specialist developer to help to deliver their home, 
while “self-build”  is where a person is more directly involved in organising 
and constructing their home.  Both routes require significant input from the 
prospective homeowner in the design of the dwelling. 
 
42 St Helens SHMA update 2018 table 19 St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 106 6.3.12 In accordance with the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015, the 
Council maintains a register of individuals and associations of individuals 
who wish to acquire serviced plots of land to bring forward self-build and 
custom housebuilding projects43. 
6.3.13 The Mid Mersey SHMA 2016 and the St Helens SHMA update 2018 did 
not identify a specific quantum of demand for self-build in the Borough and 
as of August 2018 there has been very limited demand to be included on 
the Self-Build Register.  However, it is anticipated that as the Register 
becomes more established, demand for self and custom build plots could 
increase.  Further evidence of need for self and custom build plots will be 
informed by future SHMAs and updates to the Register.  In accordance 
with national planning policy, legislation and guidance, the Council will 
support the delivery of housing to meet the needs of people wishing to 
build their own homes on suitable sites that meet all other applicable 
policy requirements. 
Flats and Houses in Multiple Occupation 
6.3.14 The sub-division of existing dwellings into flats or to form Houses in 
Multiple Occupation (HMOs) can make an important contribution to 
meeting specific needs, for example for single persons or couples.  
However, it is important that such proposals should be consistent with the 
latest evidence of housing needs in the area and avoid causing an 
unacceptable loss of family housing.  It is also important that they avoid 
harming the character or appearance of the area for example by leading to 
excessive hard surfacing of garden areas to form car parking.  Such 
proposals should also be suitably designed to provide acceptable living 
conditions for their occupants, for example in terms of outlook and 
daylight/sunlight and avoid harming the living conditions of neighbouring 
occupiers.  Further guidance concerning such proposals will be set out in 
a future SPD. 
 
43 The Council’s Self-Build and Custom Build Register is available on its website and further information is available via the Government endorsed self-
build portal  at  http://www.selfbuildportal.org.uk/custombuild St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 107 6.4 Policy LPC02: Affordable Housing 
Policy LPC02: Affordable Housing 
1. The Council will support the delivery of affordable housing by encouraging 
new provision by Registered Providers of Social Housing. 
2. Proposals for new open market housing developments of 10 units or more, or 
when the number of units is not known, sites of 0.5ha or more, will be required 
to contribute as follows: 
 i) at least 30% of new dwellings provided on greenfield sites in Affordable 
Housing Zones 2 and 3 must fall within the definition of ‘affordable 
housing’; or 
 ii) at least 10% of new dwellings provided on brownfield sites in Affordable 
Housing Zone 3 must fall within the definition of ‘affordable housing’. 
3. The types of affordable housing to be provided on any site must be informed 
by the latest evidence concerning need.  Where an affordable housing 
requirement is triggered in line with paragraph 2 of this Policy: 
 a) at least 10% of the overall number of homes to be provided should be 
available for affordable home ownership44 (unless this would significantly 
prejudice the ability to meet the identified needs of specific groups); and 
 b) any remaining proportion of the affordable housing to be provided should 
be for affordable rented accommodation. 
4. The provision of affordable housing may vary on a site-by-site basis taking into 
account evidence of local need and where appropriate, the economic viability 
of the development.  Any relaxation of the affordable housing requirements set 
out in paragraphs 2 or 3 of this Policy will only be supported if: 
 a) it is fully justified by an independent site-specific viability appraisal; and 
 b) the benefits of proceeding with the development outweigh the failure to 
provide the full affordable housing contribution. 
5. Any affordable housing provision must be within the application site unless the 
applicant has demonstrated either that: 
 a) insufficient local need exists to justify on-site provision; or 
 
44 The term ‘affordable home ownership’ as defined in Annex 2 of the National Planning Policy Framework (July 2021) includes ‘starter homes’, 
‘discounted market sales housing’ and ‘other affordable routes to home ownership’. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 108  b) there would be overriding benefits by making alternative provision ‘off site’ 
in which case a commuted sum in lieu of on-site provision will be required.  
The level of any such commuted sum should be in accordance with 
guidance set out in the Affordable Housing Supplementary Planning 
Document. 
6. Where affordable housing is to be provided on site, adequate provisions must 
be made, for example through conditions and / or a Section 106 agreement, to 
ensure that such housing is made available in perpetuity for occupation by 
persons who are in affordable housing need, or for any subsidy to be recycled 
to support affordable housing provision elsewhere.

Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Partnership working e.g., with Registered 
Providers 
• Affordable Housing SPD 
6.6 Reasoned Justification 
6.6.1 The National Planning Policy Framework confirms that planning policies 
should identify the amount and type of affordable housing that is required.  
It also confirms that policies for developer contributions (including towards 
affordable housing) should not undermine the deliverability of the Plan.  As 
stated earlier45, the St Helens SHMA Update 2018 has identified a need 
for 117 new affordable units per year between 2016 and 2033.  
Policy LPC02 sets out the circumstances in which affordable housing 
provision to help meet this need will be required and indicates the 
quantities that will be sought from open market housing development. 
Economic Viability 
6.6.2 The provision of affordable housing linked to open market housing 
development must be realistic with regard to economic viability, but flexible 
to variations between sites and changes in market conditions over the 
Plan period. 
6.6.3 The St Helens Local Plan Economic Viability Report 2018 demonstrates 
that there are geographical disparities in viability, and this has informed 
 
45 See the Reasoned Justification to Policy LPC01 St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Tenure of affordable housing to be provided 
6.6.4 Annex 2 of the NPPF defines the term ‘affordable housing’ as including (in 
summary): affordable housing for rent; starter homes; discounted market 
sales housing; and other affordable routes to home ownership. 
6.6.5 St Helens has for many years had an identified need for further provision 
of social and affordable rented housing.  This is confirmed in the St Helens 
SHMA 2016 and SHMA update 2018.  More recently, however, the revised 
NPPF (July 2021) has widened the definition of affordable housing to 
include a greater range of affordable home ownership products.  The 
revised NPPF (July 2021) also states that where major development 
involving the provision of housing is proposed (subject to various 
exclusions) at least 10% of the homes should be available for starter 
homes or other forms of affordable home ownership.  The Housing and 
Planning Act 2016 requires the Council to promote the delivery of starter 
homes in its area.  Currently starter homes are broadly defined as market 
housing with a 20% reduction on the normal market price, with specific 
age restrictions and the cost of which is capped at £250,000. 
6.6.6 The St Helens SHMA update 2018 indicates that the additional categories 
of affordable home ownership introduced in the revised NPPF (July 2021) 
are likely to make only a limited contribution towards meeting affordable 
housing needs in the Borough (due to the availability of existing second-
hand homes at affordable prices).  However, it acknowledges that 
providing some affordable home ownership properties could assist in 
helping households move out of the private rented sector.  The SHMA 
2016 also identified a need for intermediate housing (that can provide a 
form of affordable home ownership). 
6.6.7 Having regard to all these factors Policy LPC02 requires that – where 
affordable housing is to be required (or contributed towards) as part of a 
wider scheme – at least 10% of the overall housing provision resulting 
from the proposals should be for affordable home ownership.  In 
assessing the precise types of affordable housing to be provided on each 
site, the Council will take into account the SHMA, any other evidence of St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 112 need, and the latest definition of affordable housing set by the 
Government.  It is anticipated that there will be an on-going need for 
affordable rented housing, as starter homes and other forms of affordable 
home ownership are unlikely to replace the need for these forms of rented 
accommodation. 
Site specific viability assessments 
6.6.8 If a developer considers that the affordable housing requirements set out 
by this policy are not viable on a specific site, then this will need to be 
justified through a robustly prepared, transparent, and independent 
financial appraisal. 
Implementation of Policy LPC02 
6.6.9 The St Helens Affordable Housing SPD (2010) will be updated as 
necessary to assist the implementation of Policy LPC02. Furthermore, it is 
acknowledged that ‘First Homes’ have been introduced by the 
Government and fall within the definition of ‘affordable housing’.  However, 
as this Plan is being progressed under the First Homes transitional 
arrangements, it is not required to reflect the First Homes policy 
requirement.  Instead, this will be addressed in a future update of the Plan. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

2. Site GTA01 is suitable for the provision of permanent Gypsy and Traveller 
pitches including amenity buildings.  Site GTA02 is suitable for the provision of 
transit (limited length of stay) accommodation for Gypsies and Travellers.  
Development, either within these sites or on adjacent land, will not be 
permitted if it would not be compatible with the intended use of site GTA01 or 
GTA02 for Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation. 
3. The loss of an existing site or pitch that is or was last used to provide 
accommodation for Gypsies or Travellers, or for Travelling Showpeople, to 
another land use will not be permitted unless: 
 a) The level of provision of the type of facility that would be lost would, 
following implementation of the proposal, significantly exceed the 
Council’s latest assessment of need (across the Borough as a whole) and 
remain so for the remainder of the Plan period, and the site has been 
marketed for its existing or most recent use for a substantial period of time 
and in a manner agreed with the Local Planning Authority; or 
 b) The proposed loss of the existing site, pitch or plot is necessary to provide 
essential improvements to the accommodation for gypsies, travellers or for 
travelling show-people within the site; or 
 c) The site is unsuitable for its existing use and alternative accommodation, 
of a scale, quality, and suitability to meet needs at least equivalent to 
those that would be lost, would be provided. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 114 4. Proposals for new, re-configured or expanded sites for Gypsies and Travellers 
or Travelling Showpeople will only be permitted where they would: 
 a) have a suitable and safe site layout and design, including adequate 
internal circulation, parking and amenity spaces, marked pitches and 
amenity buildings/facilities, all of which should accord with any relevant 
national government guidance and be informed where possible by the 
outcome of consultation with local users; 
 b) provide for suitable physical environmental conditions within the site for 
example in relation to ground conditions and flood risk; 
 c) provide adequate levels of amenity and privacy for occupiers of each 
plot/pitch; 
 d) avoid causing harm to the living conditions of occupiers of neighbouring 
properties; 
 e) respect the character of the local built and / or natural environment; 
 f) provide for access by road that would be suitable for all types of vehicles 
and caravans likely to access the site; and 
 g) be served by safe and convenient access by walking or public transport to 
a local, district or town centre, education and health facilities, and 
employment opportunities in the surrounding area. 
5. In addition to meeting the criteria in paragraph 4 of this Policy, any proposals 
to provide accommodation for Travelling Showpeople must: 
 a) be located and designed so as to avoid causing disturbance to occupiers 
of adjacent properties for example due to noise from the maintenance 
and / or testing of equipment;  
 b) avoid prejudicing the operations of any existing employment uses; and 
 c) allow for the provision of suitable space and storage for rides and 
associated equipment, where applicable. 
 Conditions and / or Section 106 obligations may be used to limit the hours 
within which equipment can be tested. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

6.9 Reasoned Justification 
6.9.1 National Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) requires local 
authorities to assess Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
accommodation needs and ensure steps are taken to meet those needs, 
including where necessary through the allocation of sites in the Local Plan. 
6.9.2 The Merseyside and West Lancashire Gypsy & Traveller Accommodation 
Assessment (GTAA) was undertaken in 2014 and included extensive 
fieldwork by interviewers to understand current and future housing need 
from the members of the Gypsy & Traveller community living in caravans 
and in “bricks and mortar”  houses. 
6.9.3 The GTAA found that across Merseyside and West Lancashire as a whole 
there was a need for 42 net additional permanent pitches between 
2013/14 and 2032/33, of which 8 should be in St Helens Borough.  Of the 
8 permanent pitches required in the Borough: 6 were required between 
2013 and 2018; 1 between 2018 and 2023; and 1 between 2023 and 
2033.  The GTAA also found a need for 3 transit pitches to be provided 
(capable of accommodating 6 touring caravans) for Gypsies and 
Travellers for the period 2013 to 2033.  The GTAA did not identify a need 
for accommodation for Travelling Showpeople. 
6.9.4 A permanent pitch acts as a main place of residence, with the occupier 
being able to go off site to travel for periods of time during the year.  Each 
pitch should have enough space on which to site a permanent static 
caravan and a touring caravan, and adequate access to utilities and an 
amenity building (containing a toilet, bathroom and possibly a utility/sitting 
room) and space for vehicles (including a commercial vehicle).   A transit 
pitch is for occupation on a short term, temporary basis by Gypsies and 
Travellers who are travelling away from their ‘home’ pitch.  A transit pitch 
needs to have enough space for a touring caravan plus a towing vehicle 
and access to utilities provision. 
6.9.5 In August 2015, the Government changed the definition of ‘travellers’ for 
planning purposes so that it no longer includes persons who have given 
up a nomadic way of life.  However, it is still necessary to give adequate 
weight to the preferences of many Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople to live in caravans.  Whilst the Housing and Planning Act St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 116 2016 removed the need for a separate GTAA to be undertaken, it did not 
remove the need to assess the accommodation needs of Gypsies, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople as part of the plan-making process.  
The Merseyside and West Lancashire GTAA remains an important source 
of evidence to underpin the St Helens Borough Local Plan. 
6.9.6 Planning permission was granted in 2016 for 12 pitches on land east of 
the Sherdley Road Caravan Park.  This would more than meet the need 
for 8 permanent pitches identified in the GTAA.  However, the net need for 
new pitches changes each year as occupancy of sites alters and pitches 
are gained and lost, and a rise in the numbers of occupiers on non-
authorised sites indicates that the overall (net) need for new pitches in the 
Plan period is likely to have risen to about 18 by 2016.  This is comprised 
of the 8 pitches identified within the GTAA, 4 private pitches which are not 
authorised but tolerated, an additional 2 unauthorised pitches and 4 
pitches provided for the loss of pitches at Berry’s Lane which is a closed 
site and at Suez Street due to the construction of a bungalow on the site.  
The existing permission for 12 pitches would therefore be likely, on its 
own, to fall short of meeting needs.  For this reason, Policy LPC03 
allocates an additional site (referenced GTA01 - to the west of the existing 
Council owned Sherdley Road Caravan Park) for the delivery of additional 
permanent provision. 
6.9.7 Site GTA01 satisfies the criteria for site provision set out in Policy LPC03 
and is considered to be deliverable by the Council.  Its estimated capacity 
of 8 pitches is capable, in combination with the site with existing planning 
permission, of meeting the total estimated net need for permanent site 
provision over the Plan period.  However, the Council will keep the need 
and supply of sites under regular review to ensure that needs can be met 
over the Plan period.  Site GTA02 has been allocated to meet the need for 
transit site provision set out in the GTAA. 
6.9.8 No provision has been made to meet needs beyond the Plan period as the 
GTAA found that looking ahead that far to assess needs was difficult.  
Accordingly, the preferred approach is for needs beyond the Plan period to 
be reviewed in the future taking account of relevant circumstances at the 
time. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

2. The development of main town centre uses within the defined centres will be 
supported.  Proposals for other uses in such locations will be considered 
having regard to the scale and nature of the proposal and the role and function 
of the centre. Planning permission will be granted for development that is 
appropriate in terms of its scale and nature relative to the role and function of 
each centre. 
3. Proposals for main town centre uses will be subject to a sequential approach 
to development in line with national policy.  This will require development for 
such uses to be located as a first preference in suitable locations within town, 
district, or local centres and then (as a second preference) in edge-of-centre 
locations.  Only if suitable sites in such locations are not available should 
out-of-centre sites be considered.  The Primary Shopping Area (PSA) shall be 
the preferred location for proposed retail development in St Helens and 
Earlestown, with edge-of-centre in the context of such proposals being defined 
as locations that are well connected to and up to 300m from the PSA. 
4. When considering proposals in out-of-centre locations, preference will be 
given to accessible sites that are well connected to a defined centre as listed 
in paragraph 1 of this Policy. 
5. The sequential approach will not apply to applications for small scale rural 
offices or other small scale rural development. 
6. All proposals for retail development that would not be located within a defined 
centre must be accompanied by an assessment of their likely impact on 
existing centre(s) if they would be above the floorspace threshold for the area 
in which they would be located as set out below: St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Earlestown Town Centre Strategy 
• St Helens Town Centre Strategy 
• Town centre health checks 
6.12 Reasoned Justification 
Network and Hierarchy of Centres 
6.12.1 In defining the Borough’s Town, District and Local centres, the Council 
recognises the importance that these centres play at the heart of local 
communities, and it will seek to support appropriate investment within 
them.  The boundaries of each centre are shown on the Policies Map and 
in appendix 11.  The network and hierarchy of centres within the Borough 
are defined in accordance with the findings of the St Helens Retail and 
Leisure Study 2017, which undertook health checks of each centre to 
assess their role and functionality.  Centre boundaries will be kept under 
review, in line with the NPPF, to reflect changing needs. 
6.12.2 St Helens remains the top tier town centre performing an important role 
and containing a good representation of retail, leisure, and civic uses that 
cater for many of the needs of the Borough’s residents.  As such, it forms 
the Principal Town Centre in the Borough.  Earlestown, as a second tier 
Town Centre, contains a reasonable provision of goods and services, and 
is highly accessible from the surrounding residential areas.  Rainhill and 
Thatto Heath District Centres provide accessible locations with sufficient 
levels of retail and service provision and community facilities to meet 
day-to-day needs of local residents.  The 11 Local Centres cater for day to 
day shopping needs of the local communities providing an important local 
service to meet the needs of residents within the surrounding catchments. 
Sequential Approach 
6.12.3 To ensure the vitality and viability of the Borough’s centres are maintained 
and enhanced the Council will continue to apply the ‘town centre first’ 
principle.  When considering development proposals for retail and other 
main town centre uses, that will be directed to defined centres in the first 
instance. 
6.12.4 In line with the NPPF, a sequential assessment will be required to support 
any planning application for a main town centre use that is not in an 
appropriate location within an existing centre. 
6.12.5 The preferred location for retail proposals in St Helens or Earlestown (i.e., 
the ‘in-centre’ location for the purposes of operating the sequential 
approach) shall be the Primary Shopping Area.  Within the District and St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 120 Local Centres, the preferred location for retail development shall comprise 
all areas within the defined centre boundary.  For all non-retail main town 
centre use proposals, the preferred location shall comprise all areas within 
the defined Town, District or Local Centre boundaries. 
6.12.6 This approach is consistent with NPPF definitions. A sequential 
assessment must, where required, set out why sequentially preferable 
(i.e., more central) locations have been ruled out.  When considering 
alternative sites, the suitability, availability, and viability of the site should 
be assessed, with particular regard to the nature of the need that is to be 
addressed. 
6.12.7 When considering how the sequential test should be applied, the Council 
will take account of planning practice guidance and only require 
assessments that are proportionate and appropriate to the size and scale 
of the development proposed. 
6.12.8 It is recognised that certain main town centre uses have particular market 
and locational requirements that mean that they may only be 
accommodated in specific locations.  In the case of proposals for small 
scale shops and services in predominantly residential areas serving a 
localised catchment, it may not be reasonable to expect the same 
customer base or market to be served from premises within a defined 
centre or on the edge of it.  Where this can be fully justified, and the 
proposal is in a highly and safely accessible location (including by walking 
and cycling) a sequential assessment of alternative locations may not be 
required. 
Impact Assessment 
6.12.9 In line with the NPPF, the St Helens Retail and Leisure Study 2017 
recommends that a range of locally set thresholds be used to identify 
when proposals for main town centre uses outside existing centres must 
be accompanied by a town centre impact assessment. These thresholds 
relate to the size and proximity of the proposal to the centres as set out in 
paragraphs 6 and 7 of Policy LPC04. 
6.12.10 In the case of District and Local Centres the lower local impact thresholds 
of 200m2 and 300m2 referred to in Policy LPC04 will apply to proposals on 
sites that are less than 800m from the nearest part of the boundary of the 
relevant centre.  The distance of 800m is broadly commensurate with the 
potential walk-in catchments of smaller centres and is identified by 
Guidelines for Providing for Journeys on Foot (The Institution of Highways 
& Transportation, 2000) as being the ‘preferred maximum’ acceptable 
walking distance to a centre.  Beyond 800m from the District and Local 
centres, the higher threshold of 500m2 will apply. 
6.12.11 Where an impact assessment is required, the applicant should agree its 
scope with the Council at an early stage to ensure it is proportionate to the 
scale of the proposed development and provides the required information 
to identify the effects of the development on the centre.  The Council will 
take account of planning practice guidance when considering such 
assessments. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 121 7. Environment and Resources 
7.1 Policy LPC05: Open Space 
Policy LPC05: Open Space 
1. The Council will seek to ensure that the Borough’s network of open spaces is 
protected, managed, enhanced and where appropriate expanded.  To achieve 
this, it will support the implementation of programmes and strategies to 
manage and enhance all forms of open space, including where applicable 
through the use of Green Flag or similar designations. 
2. Development proposals that would result in the loss of open space will only be 
permitted where: 
 a) it has been clearly demonstrated that the open space (having regard to the 
standards referred to in Table 8.1) is surplus to requirements; or 
 b) the open space that would be lost would be replaced by new provision that is 
equivalent or better in terms of quantity and quality in a suitable location; or 
 c) the proposed development is for alternative sports and / or recreational 
provision, the benefits of which would clearly outweigh the loss of the 
existing open space. 
3. New residential development will be required to contribute towards the 
provision, expansion and / or enhancement of open space to meet needs in 
accordance with Policies LPA07 and LPD03. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Assessment (OSSRA) and the St Helens 
Playing Pitch Strategy 
7.3 Reasoned Justification: 
7.3.1 Policy LPC05 seeks to ensure the protection and management of the 
Borough’s existing open spaces in the most effective way.  It also enables 
the provision and / or enhancement of open space where this is needed.  
Planning can be a key mechanism in the delivery and implementation of 
strategies and programmes to maintain and enhance open spaces, 
directing any improvements to the right places.  Where relevant, the 
Council will seek to ensure that development proposals support the vision, 
aims and objectives of any such strategy or programme. 
7.3.2 Open space fulfils a variety of important functions of value to the public.  
For example, it provides opportunities for: formal and informal recreation 
and activities; play and social interaction; environmental enhancement and 
attractiveness; wildlife conservation; education; food growing; and quiet 
contemplation.  It provides strong health and well-being benefits for local 
people. Furthermore, provision of new and / or enhancement of existing 
open spaces will support the Council’s Climate Change Emergency 
declaration. 
7.3.3 The Borough’s open spaces, many of which are identified on the Policies 
Map, are categorised under the following typologies: 
 parks and gardens; 
 natural and semi-natural greenspaces; 
 amenity greenspace; 
 provision for children and young people (including equipped play 
areas); 
 allotments; 
 cemeteries and churchyards; and St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 123  outdoor sports and recreation facilities (such as playing fields, 
golf courses, bowling greens, tennis courts and recreational water 
bodies). 
7.3.4 The Council will resist development proposals that would result in the loss 
of open space unless at least one of the criteria in paragraph 2 of 
Policy LPC05 has been satisfied.  When assessing if a proposal would 
comply with these criteria, the Council will take account of the most recent 
assessment of the Borough’s open space, sports and recreation provision 
and needs.  As at the date of this Local Plan’s adoption, the St Helens 
Open Space Sport and Recreation Assessment (OSSRA), completed in 
2016, provides the most up-to-date evidence.  It comprises: an Open 
Space Assessment; a Playing Pitch Assessment, Strategy and Action 
Plan; and a Built and Indoor Sports Facilities Assessment with Golf 
Course Addendum. 
7.3.5 With regard to criterion 2a), the onus will be on the applicant to 
demonstrate clearly that the open space is surplus to requirements.  To 
decide whether a surplus exists, consideration will be given to the quantity, 
quality, and accessibility of existing open space provision in relation to the 
application site, having regard to the standards set out in Table 8.1 and 
the most recent open space assessment.  Proposals for new development 
on open space, that is in use or was most recently used for outdoor sport, 
will be determined with regard to the most recent assessment of existing 
and future demand for the sport(s) concerned within an appropriate 
catchment and the current capacity to meet this demand.  For residential 
development proposals, any impact on existing open space provision that 
would be caused by the resultant increased population must be factored 
into the assessment.  The Council will keep the standards of provision 
referred to herein under review and if necessary publish revised standards 
in a future Local Plan or SPD. 
7.3.6 With regard to criterion 2b), any replacement open space provision will be 
expected to be of equivalent (or greater) quantity and quality, and capable 
of serving a similar catchment in terms of accessibility to that which would 
be lost.  In determining if a proposal to provide replacement open space 
would be acceptable, consideration will be given to the most up-to-date 
qualitative and quantitative assessment of open spaces and accessibility 
levels.  For proposals involving replacement outdoor sports provision, the 
latest evidence on sports facilities provision and needs (including, where 
relevant, the most up-to-date playing pitch strategy) will be considered to 
determine if the new provision is appropriate to meet any displaced 
demand for the sport(s) involved.  Where appropriate, the Council may 
seek to secure replacement open space provision through a Section 106 
agreement in line with Policy LPA07. 
7.3.7 With regard to criterion 2c), proposals for the replacement of existing 
outdoor sports provision with alternative sports facilities will need to 
demonstrate that sufficient benefits to sport will result that clearly outweigh 
any harm caused by loss of the existing facility.  In determining the 
acceptability of such proposals, consideration will be given to the most 
recent evidence on sports facilities provision and needs (including, where St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 124 relevant, the most up-to-date playing pitch strategy), to ensure that the 
new alternative provision is appropriate to meet identified sport facilities 
needs of the Borough. 
7.3.8 As a matter of good practice and in accordance with legal requirements, 
the Council will consult Sport England concerning relevant development 
proposals affecting playing fields and other sporting facilities. 
7.3.9 It should be noted that some open space sites, including for example 
many small areas of amenity greenspace or natural and semi-natural 
greenspace of under 0.2ha in size, are not shown on the Policies Map.  All 
open spaces that are of public value, whether or not they are shown on 
the Policies Map, are protected by Policy LPC05.  This will also apply to 
any new areas of open space to be created as a result of new residential 
development. 
7.3.10 Although Policy LPC05 only applies to outdoor areas and facilities, in 
accordance with national planning policy, built (i.e., indoor) sports and 
recreation facilities are afforded equal protection.  Where development 
proposals would result in the loss of built sports and recreational facilities, 
Policy LPA07 will apply, and the Council will follow the approach set out in 
the NPPF informed by the most up-to-date local needs assessment for 
built sports facilities. 
7.3.11 The Council intends to set out further guidance regarding its requirements 
for open space provision and enhancement in a future SPD. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 125 7.4 Policy LPC06: Biodiversity and Geological Conservation  
Policy LPC06: Biodiversity and Geological Conservation 
1.      In accordance with NPPF paragraph 174, the Council is committed to ensuring the    
protection and enhancement of St Helen’s biodiversity and geological assets and 
interests. In order to do this, the Council will have regard to the following hierarchy of 
nature conservation sites when making planning decisions, according to their 
designation as follows:  
- International and European Sites 
- Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
- Local Wildlife Sites 
- Local Nature reserves 
- Local Geological Sites 
- Priority Habitat(s) 
- Impact on Legal Protected Species and/or priority Species 
The following hierarchy of sites and habitats are found in the Borough: 
I) International 
 Functionally Linked Land (FLL) for sites of international nature importance 
(European Sites) including the Ribble and Alt Estuaries Special Protection Area 
(SPA), Martin Mere SPA, the Mersey Estuary SPA, Liverpool Bay SPA.  
II) National 
 Sites of national nature importance, which in St Helens Borough include 2 Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest, Stanley Bank Meadow and Highfield Moss. 
III) Local 
 Sites of local nature and geological importance, which in St Helens Borough 
include Local Nature Reserves (LNRs), Local Wildlife Sites (LWSs) and Local 
Geology Sites (LGSs). 
In addition, priority habitats and species, and legally protected species. 
European sites 
2. Development that is likely to have a significant effect (either alone or in 
combination with other plans or projects) on one or more internationally important site(s), 
including any areas of supporting habitat that are functionally linked to the site(s), must 
be accompanied by sufficient evidence to enable the Council to make a Habitats 
Regulations Assessment.  Adverse effects should be avoided, or where this is not 
possible, be mitigated to protect the integrity of the site(s).  Development that would 
adversely affect the integrity of one or more internationally important site(s) will only be 
permitted where there are no alternative solutions and there are imperative reasons of 
overriding public interest, and where suitable compensatory provision has been made.  
Any mitigation or compensatory provision must be assessed in a project–related 
Habitats Regulations Assessment and be fully functional before any likely adverse effect 
arises. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 126 Other protected sites, habitats and species 
3. Development that would cause significant harm to a Site of Special Scientific 
Interest (SSSI), Local Wildlife Site, Local Nature Reserve, Local Geological Site, Priority 
Habitat(s), legally Protected Species and / or Priority Species, without adequate 
mitigation, will be refused. 
4. Development that would be likely to cause any harm to ecological or geological 
interests will only be permitted in: 
 a) Sites of Special Scientific Interest where there are no alternatives 
and where the benefits of the development would clearly outweigh any harm to 
the nature conservation value of the site and its broader contribution to the 
Liverpool City Region (LCR) ecological network; and 
 b) Local Sites (Local Wildlife Sites, Local Nature Reserves and Local 
Geological Sites) and Priority Habitats: where the benefits of the development 
would clearly outweigh any harm to the nature conservation value of the site (or 
Priority Habitat) and its broader contribution to the LCR Ecological Network. 
Mitigation, replacement or other compensatory provision 
5. Where necessary to avoid harm, appropriate mitigation, replacement or other 
compensatory provision will be required.  The location of such measures will be 
targeted, using the following sequential approach (with (a) being the preferred approach 
and (d) being the least preferred): 
 a) on the development site; 
 b) locations within the immediate locality and /or supporting LCR 
Ecological Network; 
 c) locations that fall within the LCR Nature Improvement Area and 
within the Borough; and lastly 
 d) locations that fall within the LCR Nature Improvement Area but 
outside the Borough. 
 
This sequential approach will also apply to the delivery of Biodiversity Net Gain 
improvements to be delivered in line with new development, in accordance with the 
Environment Act. 
Evidence requirements 
6. Development proposals that would affect a nationally or locally designated nature 
conservation site, Priority Habitat(s), legally protected species or Priority Species must 
be supported by an Ecological Appraisal and include details of any necessary 
avoidance, mitigation and / or compensation proposals, and of any proposed 
management measures. 
7. Further details concerning the implementation of this policy will be set out in the 
Council's proposed Nature Conservation Supplementary Planning Document.  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

• St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
7.6 Reasoned Justification: 
7.6.1 The Liverpool City Region (LCR) authorities have identified an Ecological 
Network that includes a Core Biodiversity Area of designated nature and 
geological sites, Priority Habitats, wildlife corridors and stepping stone 
habitats.  The LCR Nature Improvement Area (NIA) identifies opportunities 
for further habitat restoration, creation, or enhancement, focussed within 
17 Nature Improvement Focus Areas, 2 of which are located wholly or in 
part within St Helens Borough.  
7.6.2 Policy LPC06 sets out how the hierarchy of sites, habitats and species will 
be protected and managed with the objective of ensuring that there will be 
no net loss of the ecological resource.  The policy will also guide how 
appropriate mitigation, replacement or other compensation measures 
should be identified. 
Internationally important sites 
7.6.3 Paragraph 1 of Policy LPC06 sets out the requirements for developments 
that fall within St Helens Borough but that may affect the internationally 
important nature sites in nearby districts.  Any development that may 
affect such a habitat (for example by affecting an area of supporting 
habitat, some of which cover parts of the Borough) must be accompanied 
by sufficient information to enable a Habitat Regulations Assessment to be 
undertaken.  This process includes ‘Appropriate Assessment’ of any 
significant effects and specific monitoring and / or mitigation or 
compensation where required.  Alternative solutions to be considered may 
include alternative locations for the proposed development, different 
scales or designs of development, alternative processes, or not going 
ahead with the development and should be considered at the earliest St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 128 stage.  Planning proposals should also consider potential impacts arising 
from, for example, other sources of pollution, increased human 
disturbance (including the impact of cumulative recreational pressure on 
the internationally important sites) or hydrological changes. 
7.6.4 The Local Plan includes several site allocations for development that have 
been identified (in the Habitats Regulations Assessment of the Plan) as 
being most likely to provide functionally linked land connected to an 
internationally important site.  These include sites 6EA, 7EA and 8EA 
(allocated for employment development), site 8HA (allocated for housing 
development) and sites 1HS, 4HS, 5HS, 7HS and 8HS (safeguarded for 
housing development).  It is possible that other sites may also provide 
such habitat. Where it is possible that a site may provide supporting 
habitat, proposals for development will be required to contain sufficient 
evidence (such as a wintering birds survey), to enable their significance to 
the European sites to be ascertained, and any necessary mitigation or 
compensation measures to be identified. 
7.6.5 It has been identified that new housing development in the Liverpool City 
Region, particularly when considered cumulatively, is likely to cause 
significant ecological effects on the Sefton Coast SAC and other 
designated European sites around the City Region due to increased 
recreational pressure.  The Council is working with other local authorities 
and partner organisations in the City Region to quantify these effects and 
to identify, through the preparation of a City Region wide Recreation 
Mitigation Strategy, a consistent approach to any mitigation that is 
required.  This may include the use of developer contributions (if these are 
shown to be necessary to mitigate the effects of development in different 
parts of the City Region on the European sites).  Any such contributions 
linked to development in St Helens Borough will be proportionate to the 
identified scale of its impacts.  The Council will use this approach, subject 
to agreement of its details, to address this issue. 
7.6.6 The City Region Recreation Mitigation Strategy referred to in paragraph 
7.6.5 above has yet to be completed.  However, within St Helens any 
developer contributions are likely to be focussed at least in part on the 
delivery of strategic greenspace enhancements in the local area, for 
example at Bold Forest Park. The Bold Forest Park (BFP) Area Action 
Plan forms part of the St Helens Development Plan and provides a 
framework for the development of the BFP area, which covers about 
1,800ha of land in the southern part of the Borough. Due to its location on 
the urban fringe of St Helens, the BFP is potentially accessible to a large 
sub-regional population and is capable of playing an important role as an 
alternative recreational destination. The Council will continue to promote 
the BFP as a sub-regional greenspace and to seek opportunities for 
additional funding to help improve the functionality and management of the 
BFP. 
Nationally and locally important sites and species 
7.6.7 Paragraphs 3-5 of Policy LPC06 set out the requirements for development 
that would affect nationally and locally important sites and species, 
including how any benefits from such development will be weighed against St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 129 its impact on nature conservation interests and the ecological network as a 
whole. 
7.6.8 As of October 2020, there are seven LNRs in St Helens Borough which 
collectively cover an area of 11.27ha. These are listed below.

St Helens Borough includes 116 Local Wildlife Sites. These are listed in 
appendix B of the Nature Conservation SPD. 
7.6.9 For Sites of Special Scientific Interest, significant harm includes adverse 
effects on the site’s notified special interest features.  The advice of 
suitably competent persons should be sought by applicants and the 
decision maker in relation to this policy.  The focus of significant harm and 
the approach regarding avoidance, mitigation, replacement, or other 
compensatory provision to secure no net loss of biodiversity is in line with 
principles set out in the NPPF, Planning Practice Guidance 06/2005 
Biodiversity and Geological Conservation, and Biodiversity 2020: A 
strategy for England’s wildlife and ecosystems services. 
7.6.10 The Priority Species in St Helens Borough include Great Crested Newt, 
Brown Hare, Hedgehog, and Common Lizard.  Legally protected species 
are those that have specific protection under legislation and include 
badgers, bats, and water voles. 
7.6.11 Development proposals and decisions on planning applications should 
also take into account the fact that some habitats such as ancient 
woodland and veteran trees are irreplaceable because of their age and 
complexity and cannot be re-created once they are lost. 
Mitigation and Compensation 
7.6.12 Paragraph 5 of Policy LPC06 sets out the approach to mitigation, and as a 
last resort, compensation.  Here, compensation means compensatory 
provision and may include a financial contribution towards delivery of 
compensatory measures where appropriate.  It is crucial to the priority of St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 130 ‘no net loss’ that appropriate mitigation or, as a last resort, compensatory 
provision is made.  The Nature Conservation SPD will set out in more 
detail how this should be achieved. 
7.6.13 It is important that the location of appropriate mitigation, replacement or 
other compensatory provision follows the sequential approach set out in 
the Policy.  This seeks to target measures as closely as possible to the 
development site.  In some instances, the immediate locality may include 
nearby sites outside the Borough. 
7.6.14 As stated earlier, some proposed development sites have been identified 
as supporting species important to the designation of internationally 
important sites.  The Nature Conservation SPD will set out more detail 
about how the provision of functionally linked compensatory habitat for the 
loss of supporting habitat for Pink Footed Geese and other bird species 
should be achieved. 
7.6.15 To comply with the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 
2017, compensation for internationally important sites must be made 
before development begins.  More information is set out in the Habitats 
Regulation Assessment of the Local Plan and will be included in the St 
Helens Nature Conservation SPD.  For other designated sites, habitats or 
species, mitigation, replacement, or compensation can take place during 
the development process.  This compensation may be provided by the 
applicant or through another person or organisation, such as a local land 
manager and is sometimes termed ‘biodiversity offsetting’.  The Nature 
Conservation SPD will include examples of how habitat for mitigation or 
compensation can be provided and managed. 
Enhancement 
7.6.16 The Local Plan encourages opportunities to secure measurable 
biodiversity gain within development sites, for example through the design 
of open space, landscaping, or sustainable drainage schemes.  These 
opportunities range, for example, from significant habitat creation within 
larger sites to bat boxes or tree planting on smaller urban sites.  The 
sequential approach for the location of appropriate mitigation, replacement 
or other compensatory provision should be followed for such 
enhancements. The LCR ecological framework provides more information 
about the LCR Nature Improvement Area (NIA) and NIA Focus Areas. 
Information requirements and further guidance 
7.6.17 An Ecological Appraisal, which should be carried out in accordance with 
up-to-date British Standards by a suitably experienced ecologist, must 
support planning applications for development that would affect one or 
more of: a site that is designated for its nature importance; a Priority 
Habitat; or a Priority or Protected Species.  Further guidance concerning 
the operation of Policy LPC06 will be set out in the Council’s Nature

 131 7.7 Policy LPC07: Greenways 
Policy LPC07: Greenways 
1. The Council will work with other organisations to protect and enhance the 
strategic network of greenways shown on the Policies Map. Its objectives in 
this regard will be to: 
 a) provide a continuous off-road network of footpath, cycle and bridleway 
routes that will be publicly accessible and that will provide linkages 
between main urban areas and between urban areas and the countryside; 
 b) give additional definition and protection to the network of wildlife corridors 
and historic and archaeological resources; 
 c) contribute to the sub-regional network of cross boundary green 
infrastructure corridors; and 
 d) support economic development by improving the appearance of the area 
and helping people to travel sustainably between homes and workplaces. 
2. Development proposals that would affect a Greenway will be refused if they 
would: 
 a) prejudice the continuity of public access to the greenway; 
 b) harm the integrity of the Greenway in terms of off-road linkages, character 
or amenity; 
 c) harm the appearance of the Greenway; or 
 d) impair the integrity of the Greenway as a wildlife corridor or its resilience to 
development pressures and climate change. 
3.    The Council will support the expansion of the Greenway network, including 
through the provision of new routes, such as those set out in Figure 7.1, 
subject to the availability of funding and other feasibility requirements being 
met. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

• Funding for new greenways 
7.9 Reasoned Justification 
7.9.1 The Borough has a long association with Greenways.  The initial network 
was identified in the St Helens Unitary Development Plan adopted in 1998.  
Greenways provide the fundamental connectivity to the Green 
Infrastructure Network in St Helens Borough and are also key components 
of its ecological network. 
7.9.2 The NPPF advises that local planning authorities should plan positively for 
the creation, protection, enhancement and management of networks of 
biodiversity and green infrastructure. 
7.9.3 Greenways provide a range of benefits to the community such as 
sustainable access between homes, local services and employment sites 
and a healthy form of recreation.  They also provide wildlife habitat and 
corridors, enhance the landscape and townscape, and help the Borough to 
adapt to the effects of climate change.  Collectively, greenways support 
the Council’s Climate Change Emergency declaration through providing 
opportunities to travel by sustainable modes. The European Greenways 
Association defines greenways as “communications routes”  reserved 
exclusively for non-motorised journeys, developed in integrated manners 
that enhance both the environment and the quality of life of the 
surrounding area (Lille Declaration: European Greenways Association 12 
September 2000). 
7.9.4 Existing greenways are shown on the Policies Map.  The Council will also 
use its planning and other powers to expand the network.  Such expansion 
is likely (subject to the availability of funding and other feasibility 
requirements being met) to include new routes between Colliers Moss 
Common and the Sankey Valley, and between Maypole Wood and 
Colliers Moss Common.  These potential new routes are shown 
indicatively on Figure 7.1.  The Council will also continue to consider the 
scope for other new greenways to be created. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

 134 7.10 Policy LPC08: Ecological Network 
Policy LPC08: Ecological Network 
1. The Council will, working where necessary with other organisations, seek to 
ensure greater resilience of the natural environment and secure a net gain in 
biodiversity.  To this end it will seek to strengthen those elements of the 
Liverpool City Region (LCR) Ecological Network, including wildlife sites, 
wildlife corridors, and ‘steppingstone’ habitats that fall within the Borough. 
2. The LCR Nature Improvement Area (NIA) is an area within which particular 
priority will be given to habitat management, enhancement, restoration, and 
creation.  Development within the part of the NIA that lies within St Helens 
Borough will be permitted where it would: 
 a) enable or contribute towards the effective functioning of the NIA; and 
 b) contribute to the creation and / or management of habitats as set out in the 
NIA Focus Area Profiles.

7.12 Reasoned Justification 
7.12.1 Policy LPC08, together with other Plan policies and the St Helens Nature 
Conservation SPD will seek to enhance the Borough’s natural assets by 
encouraging the restoration or enlargement of natural habitats and other 
landscape features, and the creation of new habitats where appropriate. 
7.12.2 The Liverpool City Region Ecological Network46 draws together the 
evidence (for example concerning site designated for their nature 
 
46 http://www.lcreconet.uk/  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 135 conservation value and Priority Habitats) and indicates strategic priorities 
and opportunities in St Helens Borough and across the Liverpool City 
Region. 
7.12.3 Nature Improvement Areas (NIAs) have been recognised by the 
Government as a principal mechanism for restoring and managing wildlife.  
They are intended to achieve significant enhancement to ecological 
networks by providing opportunities to improve existing nature 
conservation sites, build ecological connectivity through habitat creation 
and restore ecological processes.  Delivering at a landscape-scale, these 
areas should connect with their local economies and communities. 
7.12.4 The Liverpool City Region NIA, in line with national planning policy is an 
integrated and prioritised framework for targeting opportunities for habitat 
creation and enhancement in the area where greatest gains are likely to 
be achieved.  This may include biodiversity offsetting, mitigation, 
compensation, or changes in land management.  Therefore, the NIA offers 
a solution that will enable sustainable growth and housing needs to be met 
without compromising the natural assets of the Borough or the Liverpool 
City Region. 
7.12.5 There are seventeen NIA Focus Areas across the city region, two of which 
are in St Helens Borough, namely: Knowsley and St Helens Mosslands; 
and Blackbrook and Sankey Valley Corridor.  When taken together they 
combine to form the LCR NIA.  The LCR Ecological Network and NIA 
boundary will be kept up-to-date, thereby enabling future opportunities for 
suitable ecological off-setting and enhancement to be taken into account.  
Future reviews of the LCR Ecological Network will be in accordance with 
an agreed monitoring process.  Each NIA Focus Area has been mapped 
and is also supported by a detailed NIA Focus Area Profile that will be 
used to inform decisions on planning applications.  The NIA Focus Area 
maps and profiles are included within the Ecological Network evidence 
base. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 136 7.13 Policy LPC09: Landscape Protection and Enhancement 
Policy LPC09: Landscape Protection and Enhancement 
1. Proposals for new development must, as appropriate having regard to their 
scale and nature: 
 a) seek to conserve, maintain, enhance and / or restore any landscape 
features that are important to the character of the local area; 
 b) demonstrably form the best option for meeting the aims of the 
development whilst minimising impacts on the landscape and appearance 
of the area and respecting local distinctiveness; 
 c) be informed by relevant guidance including the St Helens Landscape 
Character Assessment and the Merseyside Historic Character Study; and 
 d) include assessments of the impact of the proposal on the landscape and 
appearance of the area, carried out in accordance with any relevant best 
practice guidelines. 
2. Where a development would lead to harm to the landscape or visual character 
of the area, mitigation measures will be sought to reduce the scale of such 
harm.  Where the development would (despite any such measures) cause 
significant harm but also bring significant benefits, suitable compensation 
measures may be sought.  If significant harm cannot be avoided, suitably 
mitigated, or compensated, planning permission will be refused unless the 
development would bring exceptional benefits that would outweigh the harm.

Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
7.15 Reasoned Justification 
7.15.1 The NPPF states that planning policies and decisions should contribute to 
and enhance the natural and local environment by recognising the intrinsic 
character and beauty of the countryside and the wider benefits from 
natural capital.  The European Landscape Convention was ratified by the 
UK Government and came into force in 2007.  The Convention 
acknowledges that the landscape is an important part of the quality of life 
for people everywhere: in urban areas and in the countryside, in degraded St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 137 areas as well as in areas of high quality, in areas recognised as being of 
outstanding beauty as well as everyday areas.  The Convention’s 
definition of landscape protection is “to conserve and maintain the 
significance or characteristic features of a landscape, justified by its 
heritage value derived from its natural configuration and / or from human 
activity.” 
7.15.2 Natural England’s National Character Areas (56) Lancashire Coal 
Measures, (32) Lancashire and Amounderness Plain and (60) Mersey 
Valley provide a high level overview of the landscape around the Borough 
and act as a starting point to the understanding of the area’s landscape 
character and heritage. 
7.15.3 The St Helens Landscape Character Assessment (2006) provides a more 
detailed overview of the landscape character of the Borough and provides 
borough-wide guidance on landscape and visual sensitivity, woodland 
planting, and landscape strategies.  The Character Assessment (or any 
future replacement) should be used as a context for site-specific 
assessments of development proposals. 
7.15.4 The Merseyside Historic Landscape Character Study provides further 
context for how development should reflect, safeguard, and enhance 
landscape heritage and local distinctiveness. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 138 7.16 Policy LPC10: Trees and Woodland 
Policy LPC10: Trees and Woodland 
1. The Council will, working where necessary with the Mersey Forest and other 
partner organisations, seek to increase the extent of tree cover across the 
Borough and to protect and enhance the multi-purpose value of trees, 
woodlands, and hedgerows. 
2. New development, as appropriate having regard to its scale and nature, will be 
required to include the planting of new trees, woodlands, hedgerows and / or 
financial contributions towards off-site provision. Arrangements should be 
made for any tree(s) or hedgerow(s) that are planted to be replaced in the 
event of failure or damage within a prescribed period. 
3. Proposals for new development will only be permitted if they would conserve, 
enhance and / or manage existing trees, woodlands, and hedgerows as 
appropriate, for example by being laid out to provide adequate spacing 
between existing trees and buildings and including long term management 
proposals. 
4. Any development proposal that would affect a site containing tree(s) or 
woodland must be accompanied by a tree survey and an arboricultural 
constraints/implications report, produced to the current British Standard, to 
enable the effect of the development on the tree(s) to be properly assessed 
and appropriate tree protection measures to be identified. Any approved tree 
protection measures must then be maintained throughout the period of any 
demolition and / or construction works. 
5. Development resulting in the loss or deterioration of any area of ancient 
woodland or of any ancient or veteran tree will be refused unless there are 
wholly exceptional circumstances in which the need for, and benefits of, the 
development would clearly outweigh any resultant loss and a suitable 
mitigation strategy exists. 
6. Development proposals should be designed and laid out in a manner that 
would retain any tree subject to a Tree Preservation Order, any other 
protected tree, any other tree of value including any veteran tree, trees of 
value as a group, any tree of substantive heritage value or any length of 
hedgerow, unless it can be justified for good arboricultural reasons or there is 
a clearly demonstrated public benefit that would outweigh the value of the 
tree(s) and or hedgerow(s).  Where any tree is justifiably lost its replacement 
will normally be required on at least a 2 for 1 ratio, with impacts on woodlands 
mitigated in line with Policy LPC06.  Any tree(s) planted must be replaced in 
the event of failure or damage during a prescribed period. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 139 7. Proposals that would enhance the value and / or contribution of woodland in 
respect of recreational or educational needs; health; the landscape or 
townscape; heritage; biodiversity; tourism; and / or economic regeneration will 
be supported.

7.18 Reasoned Justification 
7.18.1 The Council supports the development of the Mersey Forest as part of the 
wider Northern Forest along the M62 corridor, as a key measure to ensure 
the Borough and the wider region is attractive and resilient to climate 
change. 
7.18.2 Trees and woodlands are an integral component of Green Infrastructure 
forming part of the network of natural habitats and improving the visual 
appearance of the countryside and urban areas.  They also provide 
opportunities for the positive use of the Green Infrastructure for recreation, 
education, health, biodiversity, regeneration, and mitigation of adverse 
effects caused by climate change, air pollution and water run-off.  
Therefore, the retention of existing, and the planting of new trees and 
woodland areas will support the Council’s Climate Change Emergency 
declaration. Their value is recognised in the Regional Forestry Framework 
Woodland Strategy, St Helens Landscape Character Assessment, North 
Merseyside Biodiversity Action Plan and Targets, Town in the Forest 
Initiative and Policy for Nature St Helens. 
7.18.3 The successful retention of healthy trees and planting of new trees as part 
of a new development can have numerous benefits for the community. In 
particular, trees can: St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 140  enhance landscape character (in areas where trees are appropriate 
as guided by the St Helens Landscape Character Assessment); 
 be a vital component of Green Infrastructure; 
 help to create a more positive image of an area and thereby 
encourage economic regeneration and inward investment; 
 soften and screen buildings; 
 enhance property prices; 
 provide a vital role in respect of biodiversity and the urban 
ecosystem by helping to support a great variety of wildlife; 
 save energy consumption through their moderation of the local 
climate; 
 produce oxygen and help to lock up carbon emissions that 
contribute to global warming; 
 help to stabilise ground; 
 absorb water, control run-off and so help reduce flood risk; 
 reduce noise by acting as a sound barrier; 
 help to filter out pollution; 
 provide shade; 
 help alleviate the effects of extreme temperature and help to filter 
out harmful ultra violet radiation; 
 help to improve mental wellbeing and reduce the stress of urban 
living; and 
 form an important part of the heritage of an area. 
7.18.4 The Council is a longstanding partner in the Mersey Forest, that was 
established in 1991 with a vision to “get more from trees”  to help make 
Merseyside and North Cheshire one of the best places in the country to 
live. Since then, around 3,000ha of woodland or nine million trees have 
been planted.  Woodland cover has doubled, from 4% to 8%, at a rate of 
three times the England average.  The maturing woodland, including the 
former colliery sites now collectively known as Bold Forest Park, provides 
a recreation resource for much of the Borough and neighbouring 
authorities.  The Mersey Forest Plan is a long term and strategic guide to 
the work of the Forest and its partners.  In accordance with national 
planning policy, it forms a material consideration in deciding planning 
applications. 
7.18.5 National policy also requires local planning policies and decisions to 
contribute to and enhance the natural local environment by recognising 
the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside, and the wider 
benefits from natural capital – including the economic and other benefits of 
trees and woodland. 
7.18.6 Woodlands have a wide range of benefits recognised in both the Mersey 
Forest Plan and the North West Regional Forestry Framework.  Of St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 141 particular significance in St Helens is the contribution to urban 
regeneration.  The Local Plan will be instrumental in delivering the St 
Helens Woodland Strategy that was prepared in response to the City 
Growth Strategy objective of creating the Town in the Forest. 
7.18.7 The North West Regional Forestry Framework is part of a wider national 
agenda on the protection, conservation and management of trees and 
woodlands across the UK.  The Framework recognises the diverse, habitat 
rich and thriving 'green tourism' opportunities of trees and woodlands and 
sets out 'An Agenda for Growth' to help shape the woodland and forestry 
sector over the next 20 years. 
7.18.8 Town in the Forest (2006) recognises the importance of St Helens 
Borough undergoing an urban renaissance and utilising the urban fringe 
as a mechanism for urban renewal, through the development of linear 
forests in urban areas and connecting to community woodlands on the 
periphery. 
7.18.9 All trees have a potential value to the character and amenity of the area. 
While particularly important trees will continue to be protected by Tree 
Preservation Orders, Policy LPC10 recognises that other trees affected by 
development should be identified, safeguarded, and where necessary, 
replaced. 
7.18.10 Biodiversity 2020: A Strategy for England’s Wildlife and Ecosystem 
Services (2011) builds on the Natural Environment White paper and 
provides a comprehensive picture of how the Government will implement 
our international commitments.  It aims to halt overall biodiversity loss and 
support healthy, well-functioning ecosystems and establish coherent 
ecological networks.  In relation to forestry, it aims to bring a greater 
proportion of existing woodlands into sustainable management and 
expand the area of woodland in England. 
7.18.11 The Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan (2018) has policies that 
include embedding an environmental net gain principle for development, 
including housing and infrastructure.  As well as a focus on woodland to 
maximise its many benefits, including supporting the development of a 
new Northern Forest and larger scale woodland creation, it aims to create 
more green infrastructure and secure more tree planting in and around 
towns and cities.  The value of trees in the landscape is also recognised in 
the St Helens Landscape Character Assessment (2006). 
7.18.12 All trees that are to be retained on site should be protected throughout the 
period of development activity by protection measures.  Proposals must 
also be supported by clear tree surveys, arboricultural implications / 
constraints plans, and tree protection plans.  All work must comply with 
relevant British Standards that are extant at the time that the development 
is proposed and / or takes place. 
7.18.13 The St Helens Trees and Development SPD (2008) sets out further 
guidance to enable delivery of high-quality developments that include new 
tree planting and the protection of existing trees as an integral part of their 
design.  As woodlands are an important natural asset, they are also 
subject to the controls set out in Policy LPC06.  The St Helens Nature St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 142 Conservation SPD will provide further guidance on the Council’s 
approach, crucial parts of which are to ensure that appropriate mitigation 
or, as a last resort, compensation for any harm or loss to habitat(s) is 
made. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 143 7.19 Policy LPC11: Historic Environment 
Policy LPC11: Historic Environment 
1. The Council will promote the conservation and enhancement of the Borough’s 
heritage assets and their settings in a manner that is appropriate to the 
significance of each asset.  These include designated heritage assets such as 
Scheduled Monuments, Registered Battlefields, Listed Buildings, Conservation 
Areas, Registered Parks and Gardens, and non-designated above ground 
assets and areas of archaeological interest. 
2. All proposals for development that may affect a heritage asset, or its setting 
should be accompanied by an Assessment of Significance that should form 
part of a Design and Access Statement and / or a Heritage Impact 
Assessment and clearly set out the significance of the heritage asset including 
any contribution made by its setting.  The proposals should demonstrate how 
they respond to the significance of the asset.  Merseyside Historic 
Environment Record (HER) should be consulted as a minimum. 
3.   The impact of development proposals on the significance of heritage assets 
and their settings will be considered in accordance with case law, legislation, 
and the National Planning Policy Framework. 
 Development affecting heritage assets 
4. Development proposals that would lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of 
significance of) a designated heritage asset will be refused permission unless 
it can be demonstrated that: 
 a) the substantial harm or total loss is necessary to achieve substantial public 
benefits that outweigh that harm or total loss; or 
 b) all the other exceptions set out in paragraph 195 of the National Planning 
Policy Framework (or any successor national policy that supersedes this 
paragraph) apply. 
5. Development involving harm to or loss of any non-designated heritage asset 
(such as any building identified on a Local List prepared by the Council) will 
only be permitted where the benefits are considered sufficient to outweigh the 
harm, having regard to the scale of the harm and the significance of the 
heritage asset. 
6. Where the complete or partial loss of any heritage asset is justified, the asset’s 
significance must be recorded to a standard agreed by the Council and made 
publicly available. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 144  Areas of archaeological interest 
7. Any development proposal that may affect one or more asset(s) of 
archaeological interest (whether designated or not) must include an 
appropriate desk-based assessment and where necessary a field evaluation, 
carried out by a suitably qualified person(s).  Such evidence should identify 
any likely features of archaeological interest within or close to the site and how 
these would be affected by the proposal. 
8. Development proposals affecting archaeological remains may be required 
(depending on the significance of the remains) to preserve the remains in situ 
or to secure the appropriate excavation and recording of the significance of the 
remains by a suitably qualified person. 
 Other implementation measures 
9. The Council will: 
 a) prepare, update and promote the implementation of Heritage Asset 
Appraisals and Management Plans and give appropriate weight to these in 
development control decisions; 
 b) work with partner organisations to interpret and educate the public about 
the heritage of the Borough; 
 c) take appropriate measures to improve public access to heritage assets; 
and 
 d) seek to secure the effective conservation and use of all heritage assets 
that are ‘at Risk’ within the Borough.

7.21 Reasoned Justification 
7.21.1 St Helens Borough has a unique heritage, based upon its history 
connected with the railways, mining, glass and other industries.  The Local St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 145 Plan has a key role in improving the appearance and character of the built 
environment and ensuring that it can be used in a way that adapts to 
changing social, economic, and environmental requirements.  
Policy LPC11 sets out how the Council will seek to conserve the 
Borough’s historic environment and promote awareness of its shared 
heritage. 
7.21.2 National planning policy requires the Local Plan to set out a positive 
strategy for the conservation and enjoyment of the historic environment, 
and that planning applications should describe the significance of any 
heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting.  
Development that would cause substantial harm to a designated heritage 
asset must be refused unless such harm would be necessary to achieve 
substantial public benefits or other very specific circumstances set out in 
national policy apply.  Designated heritage assets in St Helens Borough 
include those set out in paragraph 1 of Policy LPC11. 
Listed Buildings 
7.21.3 The Borough of St Helens contains 148 Listed Buildings.  Whilst 
Earlestown railway viaduct is the only Grade I structure; the Borough has 
12 Grade II* structures including Scholes Hall and the Statue of Queen 
Victoria in Victoria Square.  The Council has a statutory duty to ensure the 
preservation of buildings listed under Part 1 of the Planning (Listed 
Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as being of special 
architectural or historic interest.  Buildings and structures within the 
curtilage of listed buildings are also protected under the Act. 
7.21.4 There are tight planning controls over development involving the alteration 
or loss of a listed building or land in its curtilage.  Most new development 
affecting the exterior of a listed building or within the curtilage of a listed 
building requires planning consent.  Works affecting the interior or exterior 
of a listed building, curtilage building or structure, normally require listed 
building consent.  A comprehensive description and list of all listed 
buildings and other nationally designated heritage assets is set out on 
Historic England’s website47. 
Scheduled Monuments 
7.21.5 A scheduled ancient monument is defined by the Ancient Monuments and 
Archaeological Areas Act 1979 as any structure, or site of a structure, 
above or below ground that is considered by the Secretary of State to be 
of public interest by reason of its historic, architectural, traditional, artistic, 
or archaeological importance.  An application must be made to Historic 
England for any proposed works affecting a scheduled monument, in 
addition to any need for planning permission.  All scheduled monuments, 
and non-designated heritage assets of archaeological interest that are 
demonstrably of equivalent significance, will be given the strictest 
protection.  Development proposals that would result in substantial harm 
to or total loss of significance of any scheduled monument, or any 
 
47 https://historicengland.org.uk  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 146 associated feature contributing to their significance including their setting, 
will be refused except in wholly exceptional circumstances.  Historic 
England’s Heritage List for England identifies 12 Scheduled Monuments in 
the Borough, four of which are on their ‘at risk’ list. 
Registered Battlefield – Battle of Winwick 
7.21.6 The Battle of Winwick (also known as Battle of Red Bank) took place in 
1648 and has been identified as being an important component of Oliver 
Cromwell’s victory in Lancashire, which ended the Second English Civil 
War.  The site of the battle has been designated as a registered battlefield 
by Historic England, recognising its significance as a turning point at this 
key moment in British history, and reflecting the military tactics of the time 
and comprising a likely final resting place for those that died during the 
battle.  The battlefield is subject to the strong protection given to 
designated heritage assets set out in national policy and paragraphs 3 and 
4 of Policy LPC11. 
Registered Parks and Gardens 
7.21.7 Parks and gardens of national historic importance are designated as 
Registered Parks and Gardens and included in a register maintained by 
Historic England.  There are currently three Registered Parks and 
Gardens in the Borough at Taylor Park (which was part of the former 
Eccleston Estate), St Helens Cemetery in Windle and a landscape 
associated with the Former Pilkington Headquarters Complex. 
7.21.8 New development must promote the enjoyment, landscape character and 
interest of these areas by respecting their layout, design, character, 
appearance, and setting.  It should also avoid causing harm to key views 
from or towards these landscapes or prejudicing their future restoration. 
Conservation Areas 
7.21.9 The Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 places 
statutory duties on Local Planning Authorities relating to the designation 
and ongoing review of Conservation Areas and adoption of policies to 
ensure their conservation and enhancement.  There are currently eight 
Conservation Areas in St Helens Borough.  Proposals for development 
affecting a Conservation Area should preserve or enhance those elements 
that have been identified as making a positive contribution to the character 
and special architectural or historic interest of the area.  These elements 
may include buildings, boundary features, other structures, landscape 
features, open spaces, and the setting.  Where proposals would lead to 
harm to a Conservation Area, then the harm will be identified as being 
either substantial or less than substantial based on the relative 
significance of the element affected and its contribution to the significance 
of the Conservation Area as a whole.  Development causing such harm 
will be subject to the tests set out in Policy LPC11 and national policy. 
Non-designated buildings and other structures 
7.21.10 The Borough contains a number of buildings and other structures that are 
not formally designated as heritage assets, but that nevertheless 
contribute to the character of the area.  Policy LPC11 confirms that 
development that would cause harm to or loss of non-designated assets 
will be refused unless any public benefit from the development would St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 147 outweigh such harm or loss.  Development proposals that are likely to 
affect one or more non-designated assets will be required to include the 
evidence referred to in paragraph 2 of Policy LPC11. 
Archaeological sites 
7.21.11 Due to the long and complex history of the area, some sites (in addition to 
those affected by the formally designated Battlefield and Scheduled 
Monuments referred to earlier) are likely to contain remains of 
archaeological interest.  Where a development would be likely to affect 
any site with potential to include archaeological interest (whether the site 
is formally designated or not), the Council will require the submission of an 
appropriate desk-based assessment and, where necessary, a field 
evaluation, demonstrating the level of such interest and how it would be 
affected.  Planning conditions and / or agreements will be used as 
necessary to secure the appropriate preservation and / or recording of any 
remains, with the preferred solution depending upon the degree of 
significance of the asset. 
Design of development affecting heritage assets 
7.21.12 Particular attention must be paid to the design of any works affecting a 
heritage asset.  For example, on Listed Buildings and buildings in a 
Conservation Area, particular attention must be paid to the design and 
materials used in the walls, roof, doors, and other detailing.  The design of 
any windows must be carefully assessed, having regard to the importance 
of the building, the character and appearance of the area, the details of 
any opening mechanism, the appearance of ‘joints’ and the design of 
glazing bars and horns. 
Historic environment records and the interpretation of heritage assets 
7.21.13 The Merseyside Historic Environment Record48 is the central heritage 
asset database for the Liverpool City Region and should be consulted by 
developers when designing their proposals. 
7.21.14 St Helens Borough Council has a strong record of working with partner 
organisations to engage communities in their local heritage and further the 
understanding of the development of St Helens as a town of the industrial 
revolution.  Key partners in this context include Community Archaeology, 
the Museum of Liverpool, Merseyside Archaeological Society, Merseyside 
Industrial Heritage Society, Sankey Canal Restoration Society, St Helens 
History Society, and developers. It will continue to work with these bodies 
in this regard.

 148 7.22 Policy LPC12: Flood Risk and Water Management 
Policy LPC12: Flood Risk and Water Management 
 Flood Risk  
1. The impact of development proposals on flood risk and water management 
assets will be considered in accordance with case law, legislation, and the National 
Planning Policy Framework. 
2. Measures to manage or mitigate flood risk associated with or caused by new 
development must (as appropriate having regard to its scale and nature): 
 a) be designed to contribute to the biodiversity of the Borough unless it has 
been demonstrated that this would not be technically feasible; 
 b) protect heritage assets (such as buried archaeology); 
 c) be fully described in the development proposal; and 
 d) be funded by the developer, including long-term maintenance. 
3. Any proposal for major development49 on a site that would abut, run alongside, or 
straddle any watercourse50 in the Borough, must include measures to temporarily 
attenuate and filter flood water in order to: improve water quality; reduce peak flows 
during flooding; and reduce downstream flood risk, unless it has been demonstrated that 
this is not feasible or viable.  In cases where measures are not currently feasible or 
viable, the development must not compromise the ability to implement such measures in 
the future. 
4. The Flood Water Storage Safeguarding Areas as defined on the Policies Map 
shall be safeguarded for the provision of flood storage.  Development within or adjacent 
to these areas that would have a negative impact on their function as a flood storage 
area or on their potential to be developed for flood storage infrastructure will not be 
permitted. 
 Water Quality  
5. Development that would adversely affect the quality or quantity of water in any 
watercourse or of groundwater or cause deterioration in water body or element 
classification levels defined in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (or in any national 
regulations covering this matter) will not be permitted.  Any planning application for 
development that could (without effective mitigation) cause such harm must be 
 
49 ‘Major development' in this context has the same meaning as set out in the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) 
(England) Order 2015, or any Order which amends or supersedes it. It includes, for example, proposals for 10 or more new dwellings 
50 The definition of “watercourse” in this policy is the same as that in the Land Drainage Act 1991 [section 72(1)] and includes “Main Rivers” identified 
by the Environment Agency and also “Ordinary Watercourses” St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 149 supported by a Construction Management Plan that sets out how the water environment 
will be protected during the construction process. 
 Sustainable Drainage Systems  
6. Inclusion of sustainable drainage systems within proposed major development 
sites will be assessed in accordance with national policy. Surface water should be 
managed in accordance with the following hierarchy (with a) being the preferred option 
and d) being the least favourable option): 
 a) an adequate soakaway or other form of infiltration system; 
 b) an attenuated discharge to watercourse; 
 c) an attenuated discharge to public surface water sewer; 
 d) an attenuated discharge to public combined sewer. 
7. Surface water management infrastructure within new developments should, 
where feasible, include above ground features designed to deliver benefits to 
biodiversity and / or landscape. 
8. Discharge of surface water to a public sewer will not be permitted unless clear 
evidence has been submitted demonstrating why no suitable alternative option(s) exist.  
Development proposals should identify how any necessary surface water drainage 
infrastructure will be appropriately maintained.  The drainage proposals on all sites 
should be designed to address the drainage needs of the whole site.  Where 
development would proceed in different phases or with multiple developers involved, the 
drainage proposals should cover all phases and the full construction period. Any 
development proposal should demonstrate unfettered rights to discharge between 
various phases. 
9. If a development on a greenfield site would discharge to a public sewer, the rates 
of proposed discharge (peak flow and overall volume) from the development should not 
exceed the existing greenfield run-off rates.  If a development on a previously developed 
site would discharge to a public sewer, the discharge rates (peak flow and overall 
volume) must be as close as reasonably practicable to those that would apply if the site 
were a greenfield site.  As a guideline, a reduction of at least 30% may be sought, rising 
to at least 50% in Critical Drainage Areas or in areas identified as having an intermediate 
or high risk of surface water flooding.  Storm water storage capacity should normally 
include an allowance of 40% to address the likely future effects of climate change. 
10. Proposals for the soft or hard landscaping of any development site should, where 
practicable, demonstrably reduce the expected rate of surface water discharge from the 
site. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 150 11. Applications for planning permission should have regard to the St Helens 
Borough Council Sustainable Drainage Systems Guidance. 
 Protection of water and wastewater assets 
12. Development that would compromise the physical integrity or the effective 
maintenance of any water or wastewater infrastructure asset will not be permitted.

Strategic Objectives Met SO 2.2, SO 6.2, SO 7.1 
Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Enhancement and restoration of the 
Liverpool City Region (LCR) Ecological 
Network and the LCR Nature Improvement 
Area 
• Sankey Catchment Action Plan 
7.24 Reasoned Justification 
Flood Risk 
7.24.1 Flood risk has potential impacts on public safety, human health, social and 
economic wellbeing, and the environment.  Policy LPC12 aims to ensure 
that development is directed to locations with the lowest risk of flooding 
and to locations with the least impact on water quality in accordance with 
the NPPF and the St Helens Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. 
7.24.2 The policy seeks to ensure that where development is necessary in high 
or medium flood risk areas that appropriate adaptation and mitigation 
measures are put in place to ensure that the development is safe without 
increasing flood risk elsewhere.  Key terms within the policy (for example, 
flood risk zones 1, 2 and 3, and Critical Drainage Areas) are explained in 
the glossary and in National Planning Practice Guidance. 
7.24.3 The vast majority of the Borough lies within the catchment of the River 
Mersey and the River Sankey sub catchment.  The remainder is located 
within the Alt Catchment. 
Sankey Catchment Action Plan 
7.24.4 Sankey Brook is the primary watercourse draining St Helens Borough 
running from the central low-lying landscape of the Borough before 
heading east and then south into the River Mersey at Sankey Bridges in 
Warrington.  The central area of the Borough is drained by a radial pattern St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 151 of tributaries including Black Brook draining the north and running west of 
Billinge Hill; Rainford Brook and Windle Brook to the northwest and west 
respectively, and Sutton Brook to the south draining Rainhill.  Some areas 
of the Borough are at significant risk of surface water flooding. 
7.24.5 As part of a catchment based approach, the Sankey Catchment 
Partnership51 has produced the Sankey Catchment Action Plan52.  This 
identifies that there is an overall need within the catchment to attenuate 
approximately 720,000m3 of flood water in a 1 in 100-year event. The 
Action Plan aims to: 
 reduce the reactive nature of the catchment by “Slowing the 
Flow” in the rural headwaters, filtering agricultural run-off and 
improving water quality and wildlife habitats; 
 address issues in the urban areas of the catchment such as 
inadequately designed connections; and 
 remove pinch-points that can contribute to poor water quality 
and localised flooding. 
7.24.6 The Liverpool City Region Ecological Network Nature Improvement Area 
(NIA) identifies the Black Brook and Sankey Valley Corridor and the 
Knowsley and St Helens Mosslands as NIA Focus Areas (see 
Policy LPC08 for further details).  The Focus Area profiles53 identify re-
naturalising rivers and brooks and restoration of mossland as habitat 
creation priorities along with enhancing the biodiversity value of 
watercourses through habitat management and creation. 
7.24.7 Development alongside or close to water courses can make a significant 
contribution to slowing the flow by temporarily attenuating flood water.  For 
this reason, proposals for major development that would abut, straddle or 
run alongside any watercourse will (unless this is not feasible or viable) be 
expected to include suitable measures in accordance with the Sankey 
Catchment Action Plan.  The measures that are likely to be considered 
suitable will vary according to the part of the Borough and the site type – 
with “Slow the Flow”  measures, such as off-line flood storage, being 
generally suitable in the north of the borough and “Urban Intervention 
Zone” measures such as “daylighting”  (opening up to the surface) of 
culverts being generally suitable in the centre and south of the Borough. 
7.24.8 The “Slow the Flow”  and “Urban Intervention”  Zones are shown on the 
Policies Map and indicatively in Figure 7.2.  It should be noted that, whilst 
paragraph 3 of Policy LPC12 relates to all water courses, Figure 7.2 only 
shows main rivers. 
7.24.9 In addition, due to the volumes to be attenuated, the Council has identified 
two Flood Water Storage Safeguarding Areas on the Policies Map.  These

 152 are areas that will be safeguarded for the future development of significant 
flood storage facilities, in accordance with and to complement other 
measures set out in the Sankey Catchment Action Plan.  This approach 
also accords with the advice in paragraph 161 of the NPPF that Local 
Plans should manage flood risk by, inter alia, “safeguarding land from 
development that is required ( … ) for current and future flood 
management” . 
7.24.10 As the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA), the Council, working with the 
Environment Agency and the wider Sankey Catchment Partnership, may 
identify additional areas for flood water storage through the Local Flood 
Risk Strategy.  If so, these additional areas may be safeguarded for this 
use as part of an update of the Local Plan. 
Figure 7.2: Sankey Catchment Action Plan - Strategic Approach 
 
 
7.24.11 The St Helens Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) 2014 has 
informed the sequential, risk-based approach taken by the Council to the 
proposed geographical distribution of new development in the Local Plan.  
A preliminary Flood Risk Assessment of the Sankey Catchment carried 
out in 2017 helped to update the flood risk database.  The Lead Local 
Flood Authority also holds records of incidents of flood events within the 
Borough as required by the Flood Water Management Act 2010.

 153 Site Specific Flood Risk Assessment 
7.24.12 National planning policy sets out the circumstances in which developers 
will need to undertake site specific Flood Risk Assessments.  They include 
where the site is: within Flood Zone 2 or 3; is above 1ha in area and in 
Flood Zone 1; or is above 0.5ha and in a Critical Drainage Area (which is 
an area notified by the Environment Agency as having critical drainage 
problems).  Whilst no Critical Drainage Areas have been identified in the 
Borough at the time of writing it is possible that this situation may change 
in the future. 
7.24.13 Where a site-specific flood risk assessment is required, applicants should 
enter into early discussions with the Council and the Environment Agency 
to establish the requirements of the assessment.  It will be the applicant’s 
responsibility to fully assess flood risk and to propose measures to 
mitigate and manage flood risk during the lifetime of the development. 
Sequential and Exception Test 
7.24.14 The aim of the Sequential Test is to steer new development to areas with 
the lowest probability of flooding.  Development will not be permitted in 
areas of medium or high risk if there are reasonably available sites 
appropriate for the proposed development in areas with a lower risk of 
flooding.  If, following application of the Sequential Test, it is not 
considered reasonably possible, consistent with wider sustainability 
objectives, for the development to be located in zones with a lower 
probability of flooding, the Exception Test will be applied. 
7.24.15 For the Exception Test to be passed: 
a) it must be demonstrated that the development provides wider 
sustainability benefits to the community that outweigh flood risk; and 
b) a site specific flood risk assessment must demonstrate that the 
development will be safe for its lifetime, without increasing flood risk 
elsewhere, and, where possible will reduce overall flood risk. 
7.24.16 Further information in relation to the application of the Sequential and 
Exception Test is available in the St Helens Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment and in National Planning Practice Guidance. 
Water Quality 
7.24.17 There is increasing concern for the protection of the water environment, 
which not only serves as a source of water but provides essential habitats 
and a valued resource for leisure and recreation. Under the European 
Union Water Framework Directive (relevant requirements of which have 
been incorporated into national regulations54) water bodies must meet a 
range of chemical and ecological criteria to protect aquatic ecosystems 
and drinking water resources.  All water bodies in the country are required 
to achieve a ‘good’ ecological status by 2027 at the latest. Therefore, it is 
important that new development does not cause detrimental

Borough to meet this target. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 155 7.25 Policy LPC13: Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Development 
Policy LPC13: Renewable and Low Carbon Energy Development 
1. Proposals for development that would produce and / or distribute decentralised, 
low carbon or renewable energy will be permitted provided that they would: 
 a) avoid causing unacceptable harm to the appearance or character of the 
surrounding landscape; natural resources; biodiversity; geodiversity; water or 
air quality; aviation or road safety; public amenity; or the living conditions of 
occupiers of any nearby dwellings; 
 b) comply with relevant national and local policies concerning new development 
in the Green Belt; and 
 c) comply with Policy LPC11 ‘Historic Environment’. 
 When proposals are being assessed against these criteria, regard will be had to 
any environmental, social and / or economic benefits that the proposals would 
provide, and their number, scale, siting, design, and any cumulative impact in 
conjunction with other proposals. 
2. Proposals that would otherwise result in an unacceptable impact under 
paragraph 1 of this Policy must be mitigated by appropriate measures agreed by 
the Council.  All proposals must be accompanied by information that shows how 
the local environment would be protected, and how the site would be restored 
when energy production or distribution ends. 
3. Relevant evidence that will be taken into account in assessing the suitability of 
any proposals under paragraph 1 of this Policy will include (alongside any other 
relevant material): the Liverpool City Region Renewable Energy Capacity Study 
2010; any document(s) that may supersede this; the Merseyside Historic 
Landscape Characterisation Study; the evidence base for the Merseyside and 
Halton Joint Waste Local Plan; and the St Helens Landscape Character 
Assessment. 
4. New developments for housing, employment or other uses will be required to 
meet high standards of sustainable design and construction and minimise carbon 
emissions equivalent to CSH level 4, i.e. 19% carbon reduction against Part L 
2013 unless proven unviable.  To this end they should use energy efficiently and 
where feasible incorporate decentralised energy systems that would use or 
generate renewable or other forms of low carbon energy.  Large scale schemes 
that would generate a significant source or demand for heat should also be 
supported by evidence considering the feasibility of serving the development by 
means of a district heating scheme.  Proposals for new development within a 
strategic employment site or a strategic housing site (as defined in Policies 
LPA03.1 and LPA04.1) must, unless this is shown not to be practicable or viable, 
ensure that at least 10% of their energy needs can be met from renewable 
and / or other low carbon energy source(s). St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Strategic 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Funding of low carbon energy initiatives 
• Liverpool City Region Renewable Energy 
Capacity Study 2010 
• St Helens Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
7.27 Reasoned Justification 
7.27.1 One of the core principles set out in the NPPF is to support the transition 
to a low carbon future in a changing climate and to encourage the use of 
renewable energy resources.  The NPPF indicates that planning has a key 
role to play in supporting the delivery of renewable and low carbon energy 
by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging energy 
production from such sources, and this Policy, in conjunction with a 
number of other Policies in this Plan, will support the Council’s Climate 
Change Emergency declaration. 
7.27.2 Proposals for renewable energy related development can in some cases 
have a significant effect on the local area.  For example, large scale 
renewable energy developments are likely to be prominent in the 
landscape.  In such cases the Council will carefully weigh up the 
environmental, social, and economic benefits of the proposals against any 
effects on the local area for example on the landscape, heritage assets or 
Green Belt.  The NPPF recognises that many forms of renewable and low 
carbon energy related developments will constitute inappropriate 
development in the Green Belt, requiring the developer to demonstrate 
that special circumstances, such as major benefits to the environment, 
exist. 
7.27.3 Planning permissions for renewable energy schemes will, in most cases, 
be conditioned to require the removal of infrastructure and reinstatement 
of the development site should the development cease to be operational 
and where it is not feasible for the infrastructure to be re-used thereafter, 
for example for a commercial or community renewable or decentralised 
energy scheme. 
Wind Energy 
7.27.4 National planning policy states that proposals involving one or more wind 
turbines should not be considered acceptable unless they are in an area 
identified as suitable for wind energy development in a Local or 
Neighbourhood Plan and (following consultation) it can be demonstrated 
that the planning impacts identified by the affected local community have 
been fully addressed and the proposal has their backing. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 157 7.27.5 The Liverpool City Region Renewable Energy Capacity Study 2010 
assessed the scope for large scale wind and other forms of renewable 
energy generation across the City Region.  Although it identified some 
areas of search for wind energy development, none of these were in St 
Helens Borough.   
Use of low carbon and renewable energy in new housing and employment sites 
7.27.6 The Building Regulations set out requirements concerning the 
conservation of fuel and power in buildings.  However, to support the 
transition to a low carbon economy it is also necessary to encourage the 
greater use of renewable and low carbon energy in new development.  
This is generally more viable and feasible in larger developments.  For this 
reason, whilst paragraph 4 of Policy LPC13 encourages use of renewable 
and low carbon energy as appropriate in all new development, it requires 
that at least 10% of energy needs in strategic employment and housing 
sites should be met in this way unless this is shown not to be feasible or 
viable. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 158 7.28 Policy LPC14: Minerals 
Policy LPC14: Minerals 
1. The Council will seek to ensure that the Borough of St Helens provides a 
steady and adequate supply of minerals to contribute towards local, regional, 
and national needs.  To minimise the need for primary mineral extraction, 
provision of substitute, secondary or recycled sources will be encouraged in 
preference to land-won resources.  This will include the provision of suitably 
designed and located temporary materials-recycling facilities on the sites of 
major demolition or construction projects and suitably designed and located 
permanent recycling plants for construction and demolition waste. 
2. A Mineral Safeguarding Area has been defined around deposits of coal, clay 
(including brick clay and fire clay) and sandstone, considered to be of current 
or future economic importance.  Proposals for non-mineral related 
development will be permitted (subject to compliance with other Plan policies) 
within the Mineral Safeguarding Area where it has been demonstrated that: 
 a) the mineral resource would be extracted satisfactorily prior to the non-
mineral development taking place (in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 
of this Policy, and other relevant policies); or 
 b) the minerals are either not present, are no longer of any economic value, 
or have already been fully extracted; or 
 c) the prior extraction of minerals is not feasible, for reasons such as the 
depth of the deposit or because extraction would lead to or exacerbate 
ground instability; or 
 d) the prior extraction of minerals would have unacceptable impacts on 
neighbouring uses, the amenity of local communities or on the 
environment; or 
 e) the prior extraction of minerals would result in abnormal costs and / or 
delays that would jeopardise the viability of the development; or 
 f) the need for the proposed development outweighs the need to safeguard 
the mineral resource; or 
 g) the proposed development is compatible with the purposes of 
safeguarding the mineral; or 
 h) the proposed development is of a temporary nature and can be completed 
and the site restored to a condition that does not inhibit future extraction of 
the minerals; or 
 i) the development is included on the list of exempt developments (as set 
out in the reasoned justification of this policy). St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 159 3. Development for non-mineral related use(s) on or close to existing mineral 
workings or existing or planned mineral infrastructure will be permitted 
provided it would not have an unacceptable impact on the continuation of 
mineral workings or on the operation of the mineral infrastructure.  Where the 
development is likely to have a significant impact on the continuation of 
mineral working or on the operation of the mineral’s infrastructure, the 
applicant will be required to clearly demonstrate that either: 
 a) the mineral working and / or mineral infrastructure is no longer required to 
meet the current or anticipated future needs of the minerals, construction, 
or waste management industries; or 
 b) the need for the proposed development outweighs the need to continue 
the mineral working and / or the need to safeguard the mineral 
infrastructure; or 
 c) an alternative site within an acceptable distance would be provided for the 
mineral working or infrastructure that is at least as appropriate for the 
relevant mineral working or infrastructure use(s) as the safeguarded site. 
4. Proposals for the exploration, extraction, storage, processing and / or 
distribution of minerals will be permitted if it has been demonstrated that: 
 a) any adverse impacts relating to any of the criteria set out in paragraph 5 of 
this Policy would be avoided or appropriately mitigated; 
 b) the location of the proposed development would be suitable, taking into 
account all relevant environmental, geological and technical 
considerations; and 
 c) provisions for the restoration and aftercare of the site have been made 
and will be implemented at the earliest opportunity to an agreed timescale 
and to a standard and manner consistent with an agreed end use and the 
character, setting and landscape context of the surrounding area. 
5. The criteria referred to in paragraph 4(a) of this Policy include: 
 a) amenity (e.g., dust, noise, visual intrusion, vibration or other nuisance); 
 b) air and water quality; 
 c) lighting; 
 d) landscape character and setting; 
 e) traffic, including air and rail, and access; 
 f) risk of contamination to land; 
 g) soil resources and the impact on best and most versatile agricultural land; 
 h) flood risk and drainage; 
 i) disposal of mineral waste; St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 160  j) land stability, including subsidence and risk of damage to buildings, 
structures and land; 
 k) ecology, including habitats, species and designated sites (particularly the 
internationally important nature sites); and 
 l) heritage assets and their setting. 
6. Proposals for the development of onshore oil and gas resources (including 
coal bed methane, coal mine methane, shale gas and oil) must clearly 
demonstrate that the highest levels of environmental, health and social 
protection and benefit consistent with prevailing national policy and regulation 
and industry best practice standards, including those relating to Environmental 
Impact Assessment and Habitats Regulations Assessment, will be provided.

• Minerals related planning permissions 
7.30 Reasoned Justification 
7.30.1 St Helens Borough has been a location of significant minerals production 
in the past, including the extraction of coal (both deep-mined and open 
cast), clay, sandstone and sand and gravel.  Whilst reserves of these 
minerals remain, much of this activity has now ceased.  There is now only 
one quarry site in the Borough with an active planning consent – Bold 
Heath Quarry – that produces crushed sandstone for use in the 
construction industry.  In addition, there is active permission for methane 
extraction from the workings of the former Sutton Manor Colliery near 
Union Bank Farm.  There have been no major proposals for new mineral 
extraction in recent years and the level of future industry interest in 
exploiting the Borough’s minerals resources remains uncertain. 
7.30.2 Many minerals can only be worked at locations where they occur, whilst 
others, particularly where deep extraction by drilling is involved, allow for 
more flexibility to choose locations for surface development.  The Council 
seeks to ensure that all future minerals workings will be located in 
appropriate places. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 161 Mineral Supply 
7.30.3 The principal evidence base informing the Borough’s future role in 
facilitating an appropriate supply of aggregate minerals is the annual Local 
Aggregate Assessment (LAA).  The LAA is produced jointly with other 
local authorities to reflect an aggregate producing sub-region comprising 
Merseyside, Warrington, and Greater Manchester.  Matters relating to 
aggregate production, reserves, land-banks, and future supply are 
reported annually at this sub-regional level through the LAA. 
7.30.4 St Helens Borough Council, as part of Merseyside, is represented as a 
North West Aggregates Working Party (NWAWP) member and subscribes 
to the national Managed Aggregate Supply System (MASS) through 
market monitoring and production of annual LAAs.  The Council intends to 
maintain its commitment to the MASS through continued representation on 
the NWAWP. 
7.30.5 Bold Heath Quarry is the only quarry in Merseyside with an active planning 
consent for production of crushed rock (sandstone) aggregate.  Whilst 
production levels at the quarry have been affected by economic conditions 
in recent years, its reserves make it capable of contributing to sub-regional 
supply for some time into the future. 
7.30.6 Paragraph 1 of Policy LPC14 aims, by prioritising the use of secondary 
and recycled materials, to reduce the need for production of new primary 
(land-won) aggregates and for disposal to landfill of Construction 
Demolition and Excavation (CD&E) waste materials.  This approach is 
consistent with the NPPF that strongly promotes the use of secondary and 
recycled materials as an alternative to primary aggregate. 
Mineral Safeguarding 
7.30.7 Mineral resources are finite and are vulnerable to being lost when building 
or other forms of development take place.  Resources that are scarce or 
economically important should therefore be safeguarded from sterilisation.  
Where it is necessary for development to take place, the prior extraction of 
mineral resources will be encouraged, where this is feasible in terms of 
site size and location, and subject to compliance with the other plan 
policies and proposals including paragraphs 4 and 5 of Policy LPC14.  
Prior extraction of mineral resources can also have the benefit of removing 
land instability issues on certain sites. 
7.30.8 To alert developers to the presence of known mineral resources and 
ensure their potential sterilisation is considered as part of the planning 
process, a Mineral Safeguarding Area (MSA) has been defined.  Whilst 
the designation of the MSA does not indicate a presumption that mineral 
resources within it will be worked, Policy LPC14 seeks to avoid their 
unnecessary sterilisation. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 162 7.30.9 In line with best practice guidance55, the MSA has been drawn around the 
following mineral resources found in the Borough that are considered to be 
of economic importance, based on current evidence56: 
 Shallow coal; 
 Clay (including brick clay and fire clay); and 
 Sandstone (centred around existing workings at Bold Heath 
Quarry). 
7.30.10 The MSA is shown on the Policies Map as a single area.  Given the 
complexity of the mineral deposits within the Borough, it is not possible to 
show each mineral resource separately alongside all the other 
designations and maintain an acceptable degree of clarity.  To give clear 
guidance on where the different mineral resources may be found within 
the Borough, the extent of each resource is shown in appendix 10. 
7.30.11 Where supporting information is required from the applicant to comply with 
paragraph 2 of the Policy, this will be proportionate to the scale and nature 
of the proposal.  Where the Council considers that a proposal may lead to 
the significant sterilisation of mineral resources, a detailed Minerals 
Assessment must be submitted, prepared by a qualified mineral surveyor 
or geologist.  This should include information relating to the extent or 
quality of the mineral resource and any geotechnical issues informed by 
the most up-to-date mineral resource information available for the site or 
area. 
7.30.12 In line with best practice guidance, the MSA does not exclude urban or 
built up areas. It therefore does not rule out the potential for prior 
extraction as part of larger urban regeneration schemes.  However, given 
the abnormal costs associated with many development sites in the 
Borough it would be unreasonable to apply a mineral safeguarding 
requirement to small scale schemes.  For this reason, whilst prior 
extraction of minerals will be encouraged subject to compliance with 
Policy LPC14 and other relevant policies, the requirement to demonstrate 
that minerals will not needlessly be sterilised will apply only to 
development proposals on sites of more than 0.5ha in area. 
Mineral Safeguarding Area - Exempt Development 
a) The site or area is 0.5ha or less; 
b) Applications for householder development; 
c) Applications for alterations and extensions to existing buildings and / or for 
change of use of existing buildings; 
d) Applications for advertisement consent;

Certificates of Lawfulness of Proposed Use or Development (CLOPUD); 
h) Applications for works to trees; and 
i) Applications for temporary planning permission. 
Mineral infrastructure safeguarding 
7.30.13 Development for other uses (such as housing) either on or close to 
existing or planned mineral extraction sites or mineral infrastructure can 
lead to the mineral operations or infrastructure becoming incompatible with 
surrounding uses.  For this reason, proposals for housing or other 
sensitive forms of development that could suffer nuisance or other 
problems will not be permitted unless it is demonstrated that they would 
satisfactorily co-exist with the existing or planned minerals related 
operations. 
7.30.14 Minerals related infrastructure includes strategic rail freight links and sites 
for concrete batching, the manufacture of coated materials, other concrete 
products and the handling, processing, and distribution of substitute, 
recycled and secondary aggregate material. 
Development Management requirements 
7.30.15 All proposals for exploration, extraction, storage, processing and / or 
distribution of mineral resources, including energy minerals, should be 
accompanied by supporting information to demonstrate compliance with 
paragraphs 4 and 5 of Policy LPC14 and other relevant policies in the 
Plan.  The level of information should be proportionate to the scale and 
nature of the proposal.  Applicants will be expected to agree with the 
Council at pre-application stage the scope of any assessments of potential 
impact, including any Environmental Impact Assessment or Habitats 
Regulations Assessment that may be needed. 
Energy minerals 
7.30.16 Energy minerals include coal and other hydrocarbons such as oil and 
natural gas used to generate power.  They can either be extracted using 
‘conventional’ or ‘unconventional’ methods.  Unconventional methods 
include the extraction of oil and natural gas from sources such as 
underground shale or coal seams using horizontal drilling and / or 
hydraulic fracturing (or ‘fracking’). 
7.30.17 Previous interest in energy mineral extraction within St Helens Borough 
(with the exception of coal) has primarily involved capturing methane from 
former coal working or landfill sites.  As an indication of future industry 
interest, the government has issued a number of Petroleum Exploration 
and Development Licences (PEDLs) for onshore hydrocarbon extraction 
under the Petroleum Act 1998, covering different parts of the Borough.  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 164 These licence areas are shown on the Policies Map.  Whilst the Council is 
required to show these areas they are not subject to any local authority 
control and the Local Plan cannot influence them. 
7.30.18 There are three phases of onshore hydrocarbon extraction: exploration, 
testing (appraisal) and production.  Applications for energy related mineral 
development can relate to all or any combination of these phases.  The 
Council will advise applicants on the evidence, issues and scope of 
information required as part of the pre-application process.  In all cases, 
full compliance with prevailing industry standards, best practice and 
national regulatory requirements will be expected. 
7.30.19 Some exploration work or testing, such as initial seismic work, may not 
require consent from the planning authority.  The exploratory, appraisal or 
production phase of hydrocarbon extraction can only take place in areas 
where a PEDL licence has been issued57. 
 
57 Older licences issued by the Department of Energy from the First Onshore Licensing Round (1986) until the Sixth (1992) carry the prefix ‘EXL’.  
EXLs that have not expired or been relinquished have been converted to the same terms as a PEDL.  Further information on EXL and PEDL areas is 
available on the  Oil & Gas Authority website: https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/data-centre/interactive-maps-and-tools/  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 165 7.31 Policy LPC15: Waste 
Policy LPC15: Waste 
The Council will promote the sustainable management of waste in accordance 
with the waste hierarchy (as defined in national planning policy).  In accordance 
with the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan 2013 (or any Plan that 
may supersede or supplement this) it will work to: 
a) identify and safeguard (where appropriate) waste management sites in 
appropriate locations; 
b) assist in the implementation of a resource-recovery led strategy for 
sustainable waste management; 
c) ensure that the Borough contributes to meeting the identified sub-regional 
needs for waste management facilities and sites; 
d) encourage good design in new development in order to minimise waste, 
promote the use of reclaimed and recycled materials and to facilitate the 
storage, collection and recycling of waste; 
e) encourage the sustainable transport of waste and promote the use of 
mechanisms such as waste audits and waste management plans to minimise 
the generation of waste; and 
f) ensure that waste management facilities are developed whilst minimising any 
negative impacts on the environment and communities of the Borough.

7.33.2 Decisions regarding planning for waste management facilities or other 
waste related uses should comply with policies in the Merseyside and 
Halton Joint Waste Local Plan (the ‘Joint Waste Local Plan’) adopted in 
2013, Policy LPC15 and any other relevant policies in the Local Plan.  The 
Joint Waste Local Plan sets out site allocations and development 
management policies for waste facilities and uses. 
7.33.3 Under Policies WM2, WM3 and WM4 of the Joint Waste Local Plan, a 
range of sites across Merseyside and Halton are allocated for different 
waste management uses, details of which are set out in those Policies.  
These include the following sites in St Helens Borough: 
 Site S1a - Former Transco Site, Pocket Nook (Sub-regional Site); 
 Site S2 - Land North of T.A.C., Abbotsfield Industrial Estate (District Level 
Site); and 
 Site S3 - Bold Heath Quarry (Inert Landfill Site). 
7.33.4 Policy WM5 of the Joint Waste Local Plan defines areas of search for 
small-scale waste management operations and re-processing sites, of 
which one area (including Abbotsfield Industrial Estate and industrial areas 
in its immediate vicinity) is in St Helens Borough.  Policy WM5 also sets 
out policy criteria used to assess proposals for these types of waste uses 
in this area. 
7.33.5 The Joint Waste Local Plan will need to be reviewed in the future in 
accordance with relevant planning legislation.  Policy LPC15 should 
therefore be read in conjunction with any future Plan document(s) that 
may supersede or supplement the Joint Waste Local Plan. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 167 8. Development Management Policies 
8.1 Policy LPD01: Ensuring Quality Development 
Policy LPD01: Ensuring Quality Development 
All proposals for development will be expected, as appropriate having regard to 
their scale, location, and nature, to meet or exceed the following requirements: 
1. Quality of the Built Environment 
 a) Maintain or enhance the character and appearance of the local 
environment, with a focus on the importance of local distinctiveness, as 
well as using good design to improve the quality of areas that may have 
become run down and be in need of regeneration, for example with regard 
to the siting, layout, massing, scale, design and materials used in any 
building work, the building-to-plot ratio and landscaping; 
 b) Avoid causing unacceptable harm to the amenities of the local area and 
surrounding residential and other land uses and occupiers; 
 c) Ensure that the occupiers of new developments will enjoy a high standard 
of amenity and will not be unacceptably affected by neighbouring uses and 
vice versa; 
 d) Link in with surrounding movement patterns and not be prejudicial to the 
development of neighbouring land for example by creating landlocked 
sites; 
 e) Be located and designed so as to minimise opportunities for crime, for 
example by maximising natural surveillance; 
 f) Respect any existing natural features of the site by conserving, restoring 
or enhancing biodiversity and minimising any adverse impact on important 
natural features; 
 g) Provide landscaping, including tree-lined streets, as an integral part of the 
development, protecting existing landscape features such as trees, 
hedges and watercourses and enhancing the public realm; 
 h) Encourage the inclusion of, or make a contribution to public art within 
appropriate schemes (for example where the development would be of a 
substantial size and / or in a prominent gateway or town centre location); 
 i) Provide for the needs of special groups in the community such as the 
elderly and those with disabilities as identified in Policy LPC01; and 
 j) Protect the setting, integrity, and character of heritage assets in 
accordance with Policy LPC11. 
2. Environmental Quality St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 168  a) Ensure protection of watercourses and other water bodies from 
encroachment, modification and degradation and enable water bodies that 
are already modified or degraded to be improved to form sustainable, 
natural environments where feasible; 
 b) Minimise and mitigate to acceptable levels any effects that the 
development may have on air quality; light, land and / or water pollution 
(including contamination of soil, surface water and groundwater 
resources); and levels of noise, vibration, smells, dust and electromagnetic 
fields in the area; 
 c) Ensure that any contamination or ground stability issues that exist on the 
site of the proposed development would be remediated to an appropriate 
standard, taking into account its intended use and making use of 
sustainable remediation technologies; and 
 d) Include satisfactory arrangements for the disposal of foul sewage, liquid 
waste, trade effluent and contaminated surface water. 
3. Resource Management 
 a) Ensure that development involving demolition and / or construction works 
minimises the generation of waste and promotes the use of recycled 
and / or locally sourced building materials in accordance with policy WM8 
of the Merseyside and Halton Joint Waste Local Plan 2013 (or any 
equivalent policy in a successor document); 
 b) Avoid prejudicing the delivery/improvement of utility infrastructure; 
 c) Promote energy efficiency and the generation and use of low carbon and 
renewable energy in accordance with Policy LPC13; and 
 d) Avoid loss of or damage to high quality agricultural land and / or soils 
(except where clearly justified by wider public benefits) and minimise such 
loss or damage where this is shown to be unavoidable. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Local 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
8.3 Reasoned Justification 
8.3.1 In accordance with national policy, Policy LPD01 seeks to ensure that new 
development is of a high quality and provides buildings and places that will 
function well and be visually attractive and resource efficient.  In doing so, 
it seeks to protect the many areas of St Helens Borough that have a good 
quality environment and also promote the regeneration of areas that have 
become run down or have a less distinctive townscape. 
Quality of the Built Environment 
8.3.2 Policy LPD01 requires all new developments, having regard to its scale, 
nature, and location to be well-designed, taking account of local 
distinctiveness and the need to respond positively to the Borough’s 
character and history.  Through good architectural design, new 
development should – without necessarily replicating existing development 
in the area - optimise the potential of the site in terms of form, height, 
scale, siting, layout, density, orientation, materials, parking, and open 
space/green infrastructure. 
8.3.3 Good design relates both to the appearance of a development and how 
well it will work in practical terms.  All new development must be designed 
to enable safe and easy movement and passage into and through the 
development for all potential users, including those of limited mobility, 
pedestrians, cyclists, public transport users, car users, and for servicing, 
deliveries, and collection.  New development should establish a strong 
sense of place through the arrangement of streets, open spaces, and 
materials, providing attractive public areas that promote and enhance 
biodiversity and healthy lifestyles. 
8.3.4 A coordinated approach should be taken to the use of materials and the 
design and siting of street furniture, boundary treatments, lighting, 
signage, and public art, all of which contribute towards creating a sense of 
place.  Trees and other planting appropriate to the scale of development 
and space available should be incorporated in order to soften the 
streetscape and reduce the visual impact of car parking. 
8.3.5 Wherever possible, new development proposals should incorporate 
existing landscape features, such as landform, trees, hedges, 
watercourses etc.  These should be used to inform and guide how the 
development is designed and should be incorporated in a way that 
ensures they will contribute positively to the development and surrounding 
area, maximising the amenity and visual value that such features can 
provide. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 170 8.3.6 Development should be flexible, accessible to all and should be able to 
respond to the challenges of climate change.  New residential 
development should be built to a standard capable of adaptation to enable 
people to remain in their homes until old age. 
8.3.7 Safety and security can be provided through careful design of buildings 
and spaces, by promoting ‘natural surveillance’.  Good use of ‘natural 
surveillance’ can improve the layout of an area, reduce perceived and 
actual crime and opportunities for anti-social behaviour, and create places 
that are safe, inclusive, accessible, and pleasant to live in and use. 
Environmental Quality 
8.3.8 Given St Helens Borough’s industrial past some of the land within it is 
affected by contamination and / or land stability issues (for example due to 
subsidence from the legacy of coal mining operations).  In accordance 
with national planning policy where a site is affected by such issues, 
responsibility for securing a safe development will rest with the developer 
and / or landowner.  A desk study report and site survey, and potentially 
more detailed site investigation, will typically be required with a planning 
application.  Where development is proposed on land within the Coal 
Authority Development ‘High Risk’ Area, a Coal Mining Risk Assessment 
should accompany any planning application. 
8.3.9 Developers should undertake early discussions with United Utilities (or 
other relevant utilities provider) and relevant pollution control bodies to 
ensure adequate arrangements can be made for the disposal of any foul 
sewage, liquid waste, trade effluent or contaminated surface water. 
Resource Management 
8.3.10 It is important that the landscaping and materials used within the public 
realm are durable and functional in order to accommodate every day and 
infrequent uses such as the movement of vehicles and people for the 
lifetime of the development.  Consideration must also be given to the cost, 
practicalities, and responsibilities for the maintenance of landscaping and 
materials in the long term. 
8.3.11 Greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced through the location of new 
development, orientation, and design.  New development, including the 
construction of buildings and the redevelopment of existing buildings (with 
the exception of householder extensions), should be designed to minimise 
energy consumption.  This requirement encompasses landform, layout, 
building orientation, massing, materials, and landscaping.  These 
elements need to respect the local context and any relevant heritage 
assets.  As part of the Council’s positive strategy to promote energy from 
renewable and low carbon sources, new development should also, subject 
to the requirements of Policy LPC13, be designed to facilitate the 
incorporation of renewable and / or other low carbon technologies. Taken 
together, this approach will support the Council’s Climate Change 
emergency declaration, particularly in respect of delivering energy efficient 
and low-carbon developments. 
8.3.12 The Borough has a significant amount of the best and most versatile 
(BMV) agricultural land.  New development should avoid causing loss of or St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 171 damage to BMV agricultural land or high quality soils unless such loss is 
clearly justified by wider public benefits arising from the proposal.  Where 
a development would bring benefits that have been shown to justify some 
loss of or damage to high quality agricultural land or soils the extent of 
such loss or damage should be minimised. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 172 8.4 Policy LPD02: Design and Layout of New Housing 
Policy LPD02: Design and Layout of New Housing 
New residential developments will be required to: 
1. be of a high quality design and use good architecture that respects and / or 
enhances the character of the surrounding area in terms of appearance, 
materials used, scale, mass, and pattern of structures, spaces and streets; 
2. enhance local distinctiveness by reflecting good aspects of the character and 
environment of the local area, maintaining a strong sense of place, improving 
any poorer aspects and adding new features that benefit the local environment 
over the full lifetime of the development; 
3. provide appropriate landscaping, including tree-lined streets, using native tree 
and shrub species and where appropriate other boundary treatments, thereby 
providing a strong Green Infrastructure in line with Policy LPA08; 
4. provide a safe, secure, attractive, permeable, legible and useable environment 
for all users, that reinforces existing connections and creates new ones where 
necessary, including for pedestrians, cyclists, less mobile people and the 
elderly; 
5. promote safe living environments that encourage natural surveillance and 
reduce the levels and fear of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour; 
6. ensure heritage assets are treated in accordance with Policy LPC11 to support 
the Council’s ambition to promote the conservation and enhancement of the 
Borough’s heritage assets and their settings in a manner appropriate to their 
significance; 
7. consider the Borough’s environmental assets (including, but not limited to, 
biodiversity and associated habitats, landscapes, trees, woodland and 
hedgerows) in accordance with policies LPC06, LPC08, LPC09 and LPC10, 
and where practicable incorporate positive aspects of these features into its 
design and layout; 
8. provide a satisfactory level of privacy, outlook and natural lighting for its future 
residents and for occupiers of neighbouring properties; 
9. incorporate waste storage and recycling facilities, public transport 
infrastructure and car parking for residents and visitors (in line with 
Policy LPA06), all designed and integrated in a way that will preserve or 
enhance the street scene and safeguard amenity; and 
10. be laid out and designed to ensure that the development is inclusive and 
accessible to all intended and future users, consistent with Policy LPC01. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

8.6 Reasoned Justification 
8.6.1 National planning policy requires new housing developments to achieve 
high standards of design and environmental sustainability and provide a 
good standard of amenity for all existing and future occupants and those 
of neighbouring land and buildings.  The Government also stresses the 
need for local authorities to develop robust and comprehensive policies 
that will ensure that new development will function well and provide a 
strong sense of place reflecting local character and distinctiveness, where 
residents will feel safe and comfortable, with a good quality of life and level 
of community cohesion. 
8.6.2 To successfully accommodate the levels of projected growth in the 
Borough over the Plan period, all new housing layouts in the Borough 
must be well designed.  This approach will benefit the local economy, 
environment and quality of life, the sustainability and character of the 
Borough, and the health and wellbeing of its residents.  Factors such as 
scale, massing, existing pattern of development, materials, topography, 
trees and hedgerows, watercourses and wildlife habitats should all be 
considered at the outset when designing new residential layouts. 
8.6.3 The type of highway access should reflect the type of road involved and 
the volume and character of traffic likely to use it; good visibility is 
essential.  The level and type of traffic associated with any new 
development will be examined to assess the likely impact on the character 
and amenity of the existing and proposed development.  In order to 
minimise road congestion and consequent reduction in the quality of the 
environment, sufficient off-street parking and servicing must be provided to 
meet the needs of new development on site and to avoid any negative 
impacts on existing roads and residential areas.  Generally, development 
of back-land sites will be discouraged where this would lead to loss of 
privacy, amenity, or levels of greenery etc. 
8.6.4 Any proposals for new housing will only be allowed where they would 
satisfy the relevant criteria in Policy LPD02.  Supporting guidance is set 
out in the St Helens New Residential Development SPD (2011) that will be 
updated as necessary within the Local Plan period. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 174 8.7 Policy LPD03: Open Space and Residential Development 
Policy LPD03: Open Space and Residential Development 
1. Proposals for new residential development of 40 dwellings or more will be 
required to make provision for new open space, or the expansion or 
enhancement of existing open space provision, where: 
 a) there are existing deficiencies in the quantity, accessibility or quality of 
open space(s) in the area;  
 b) the development would generate a need for open space that cannot be 
satisfactorily or fully met by existing provision in the area; or 
       c)   it is appropriate to provide certain typologies of open space as part of the 
design to provide accessible children’s play areas and create a visually 
attractive development. 
2. The standards set out in Table 8.1 will be used to guide the type, quantity and 
quality of open space that is required.  The following matters will be 
considered: 
 a) the estimated number of residents who would occupy the development 
(based upon the number of new residential bed spaces that would be 
provided); and 
 b) the quantity, accessibility, and quality of existing provision in the area. 
3. Provision for outdoor sports facilities will be achieved through contributions to 
enhance existing facilities or the provision of new facilities, which will be 
informed by the Council’s latest Playing Pitch Strategy and Action Plan. 
4.   The required amount of open space should be provided on the development 
site unless it has been demonstrated that developer contributions towards the 
provision, expansion, or enhancement of off-site open space within the locality 
would be more suitable.  The appropriate balance between provision of new 
open space and the expansion or enhancement of existing open space will be 
determined having regard to: 
 a) the amount, proximity and quality of existing open space in the area; 
 b) the type and density of the proposed housing development; 
 c) the numbers of new dwellings to be created; and 
 d) any other practical site-specific factors. 
5. Development proposals that would include new open space must incorporate 
suitable arrangements for its long-term management and maintenance and 
ensure that it will have continued public access. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 175 6. Any new open space created will be afforded protection in accordance with

Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Local 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Developer Contributions SPD 
• Development Management process 
8.9 Reasoned Justification 
8.9.1 It is important that residential development proposals that would increase 
demands on the Borough’s open spaces either make new provision to 
meet this demand or contribute towards the expansion or enhancement of 
existing open spaces in line with the Councils open space standards as 
set out in Table 8.1. 
8.9.2 To determine the most appropriate form and amount of open space 
provision required, the Council will consider the anticipated new population 
generated by each development proposal alongside the latest evidence 
concerning the quantity, accessibility, and quality of existing open space in 
proximity to the proposed development. 
8.9.3 In some circumstances, it may be acceptable for lower density 
development with larger garden sizes or sites in areas close to sufficient 
existing open space to make an appropriate compensating contribution to 
the extension or enhancement of open space in the vicinity, whether by 
provision of land, direct funding of equipment or commuted payments.  
The findings of the Council’s latest open space study and local standards 
set out in Policy LPC05 (Open Space, Sports and Recreation) will be used 
when considering existing levels of open space provision and its proximity. 
8.9.4 The Council has used a threshold of 40 dwellings for on-site public open 
space contributions for a number of years in line with saved policy GEN6 
of the St Helens Unitary Development Plan 1998.  This has worked well in 
practice, and there is no more recent evidence indicating that the 
threshold should be changed.  The threshold of 40 dwellings is also 
appropriate having regard to the limited number of occupants that smaller 
developments would have, and the limited size of on-site provision that 
would be justified to meet their needs. 
8.9.5 The required layout of any new open space will depend on the nature of 
the proposed development.  However, any areas provided on site should 
be able to function effectively as open space and be accessible, safe, 
overlooked and strategically located within the site and, where possible, 
well integrated into the wider green infrastructure network.  In some cases, St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 176 the open space(s) provided may need to be designed and laid out in a way 
that would contribute towards flood risk mitigation and management in 
accordance with Policy LPC12.  The calculation of the amount of open 
space needed should not include areas such as landscaping, verges, or 
inaccessible areas such as permanent water storage facilities, for which 
separate provision will in many cases be needed under Policy LPC12 or 
other relevant Plan policies. 
8.9.6 Suitable arrangements must be made to ensure that any new or enlarged 
open spaces are managed and maintained and remain accessible to the 
general public.  In some circumstances, the Council may be willing to 
accept a commuted sum (factoring in inflation) and make its own 
arrangements for management of the open space. 
8.9.7 The Council intends to set out further guidance on its expectations 
regarding open space provision (whether on-site or as contributions 
towards off-site provision) in its proposed Developer Contributions SPD. 
8.9.8 Where new residential development would result in a deficiency of open 
space or sports and recreation facilities in the locality or be in a location 
where a deficiency already exists, it will be expected to include new, 
expanded or enhanced open space provision in accordance with Policy 
LPD03 (Open Space and Residential Development).  Any requirement for 
new sports facilities will be additional to this. Further, even where there is 
considered to be sufficient open space in quantitative terms, larger 
residential developments may be expected to provide certain types of

relief as part of an attractive and well-designed development. 
8.9.9 Where identified shortfalls in outdoor sports and recreation provision 
would be exacerbated by the additional demand generated by housing 
development, contributions will be sought towards the enhancement of 
existing facilities or provision of new facilities in the area to address this 
shortfall, as informed by the Playing Pitch Strategy and Action Plan (or any

Policy LPD04: Householder Developments 
Proposals for the alteration and / or extension of an existing dwelling will be 
approved where: 
1. They would respect and / or enhance the appearance and character of the 
existing dwelling and any other buildings within the site or the surrounding 
area in terms of scale, size, design, and facing materials; 
2. There would be no significant impact on the living conditions of any 
occupier(s) of neighbouring properties caused by overlooking, or reduction of 
daylight / sunlight in habitable rooms or garden areas; 
3. They would not have an overbearing or over-dominant effect on the outlook 
from any habitable room(s) or gardens in any neighbouring dwelling; 
4. They would not cause harm to the safety of users of any highway (including 
drivers, cyclists, or pedestrians) for example due to inadequate provision for 
off road parking, or lack of visibility; and 
5. Any car parking or other features associated with the development would 
avoid causing harm in respect of visual appearance, character or any of the 
other factors set out above.

8.12 Reasoned Justification 
8.12.1 Extensions to residential properties allow householders to increase their 
living space and add value to a property.  However, badly designed 
extensions can have a negative impact on the character and appearance 
of the property and street scene and can affect the residential amenity 
enjoyed by neighbours.  The St Helens Householder Development SPD 
(2011) will be updated to incorporate the requirements of Policy LPD04. 
8.12.2 The Council wishes to significantly raise the standard of design in the 
Borough to help create sustainable and inclusive communities and 
improve the quality of people’s lives.  This approach will apply in all areas St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 179 including where the existing environment is of a less high quality than 
elsewhere. 
8.12.3 Opportunities to use existing materials and characteristics as part of any 
new development proposal should be the starting point of any design.  
Where there is no established character, or the character is poor quality 
there may be a clear and justifiable need to improve the existing building 
stock.  Proposals that demonstrate high quality design, reflect the 
requirements of Policy LPD04 and enhance the built environment may be 
considered acceptable even where they divert from current characteristics. 
8.12.4 Any proposals brought forward within or immediately adjacent to a 
Conservation Area or would have an impact on the character or setting of 
a listed building or other heritage asset will also be considered against the 
requirements of Policy LPC11.  Specific requirements also apply to 
proposed development in the Green Belt, as set out in Policies LPA01, 
LPA05 and LPD05 and in relevant national policy. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 180 8.13 Policy LPD05: Extension, Alteration, Reuse or Replacement of 
Buildings in the Green Belt 
Policy LPD05: Extension, Alteration, Reuse or Replacement of 
Buildings in the Green Belt 
Proposals for the alteration, conversion, extension, or replacement of an existing 
building in the Green Belt will be allowed subject to the following criteria: 
1. The proposal must not have a materially greater impact on the openness or 
purposes of the Green Belt than the existing building.  As a general guideline, 
proposals should not extend an original building by more than 30% (by 
volume) either individually or cumulatively with other extension(s).  A 
replacement building should generally be no more than 30% larger (by 
volume) than the original building it would replace; 
2. Garaging, storage or other ancillary structures will not be allowed unless, in 
conjunction with the remainder of the existing and any other proposed 
development, they fall within the requirements set out above; 
3. The proposal would not result in a need for any additional building(s) that 
would have a harmful effect on the openness or purposes of the Green Belt; 
4. Any existing building to be converted must be permanent and of substantial 
construction, capable of conversion without the need for major or complete 
reconstruction.  As a guideline if the proposals would result in a need for more 
than 30% (by volume) of the existing structure to be replaced this is likely to 
contravene this requirement; 
5. The curtilage of the development should relate appropriately to the size and 
form of the existing building(s) and landscape features, and avoid causing 
unnecessary further impact on the openness and purposes of the Green Belt; 
and 
6. Vehicular access must be capable of being provided, does not lead to a need 
for highway improvements or other works that would have a harmful effect on 
the openness and purposes of Green Belt. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

8.15 Reasoned Justification 
8.15.1 The NPPF requires that extensions to existing buildings must “not result in 
disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building”.  
The threshold of 30% is considered appropriate in achieving a sensible 
balance in most circumstances.  Any departure from this would need to be 
clearly and robustly justified. 
8.15.2 In relation to paragraph 1 of Policy LPD05, to calculate the volume of the 
original, existing or any proposed building(s), external measurements of 
the building(s) must be used.  The calculation of volume must include the 
roof space, and any extension(s) to the building.  It must not include any 
parts of the building(s) that are or would be below ground level or the 
volume of any part of them that is or would be enclosed by walls but does 
not have a roof.  Outbuildings are not normally considered part of the 
original building.  “Original building” means a building as it was built or, if it 
was built before 1 July 1948, as it existed on that date. 
8.15.3 The NPPF also identifies limited exceptions where the construction of new 
buildings or other forms of development can be regarded as ‘not 
inappropriate’ in the Green Belt.  These include (subject to specified 
conditions) the conversion or replacement of existing buildings. 
8.15.4 There are often opportunities to convert or re-use buildings in rural areas, 
especially as changes in agricultural practices have rendered some barns 
and other buildings redundant for their original use.  Such re-use or 
adaptation can help reduce demand for new buildings in the countryside 
and can help conserve traditional buildings that are a distinctive feature in 
the rural landscape.  However, all such works must satisfy the 
requirements of Policy LPD05. 
8.15.5 National policy also allows for replacement buildings in the Green Belt 
“provided the new building is in the same use and not materially larger 
than the one it replaces”.  The threshold of 30% for assessing “materially 
larger” buildings is regarded as achieving the appropriate balance 
between modern building requirements and preserving the openness of 
the Green Belt in most circumstances.  Similarly, any departure from this 
criterion would need to be clearly and robustly justified. 
8.15.6 In addition, in designing new layouts careful consideration should be given 
to any ancillary needs, such as garages and storage facilities as any 
additional buildings on site may, under the requirements of Policy LPD05, 
be resisted. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 182 8.16 Policy LPD06: Prominent Gateway Corridors 
Policy LPD06: Prominent Gateway Corridors 
1. The prominent gateway corridors include the lengths of motorways, ‘A’ roads, 
waterways, and railway lines that cross the Borough. 
2. Along the prominent gateway corridors, priority will be given as appropriate to 
the delivery of measures that will improve the visual appearance of the area 
(with particular priority to any areas that are of poor or mediocre visual quality, 
prominent road junctions and railway stations).  Priority will also be given to 
delivering any necessary measures to improve access to railway stations. 
3. All proposals for new development that would be within or visible from one or 
more prominent gateway corridor(s) must, as appropriate, having regard to its 
scale and nature: 
 a) be of high architectural quality, ensuring that the density, design, height, 
and layout of any building(s) respond positively to the site and its setting; 
and 
 b) provide appropriate landscaping as an integral part of their design and 
layout.

8.18 Reasoned Justification 
8.18.1 St Helens Borough contains several major regional and national highways 
and railways, and 10 railway stations that provide businesses, commuters, 
students, and visitors with direct and frequent access to and from 
Liverpool, Wigan, Manchester, Preston, Blackpool, Warrington, Chester, 
and parts of North Wales.  It also contains other routes (including a 
number of ‘A’ class roads) that provide important links between the 
strategic routes and the Borough’s towns and villages. 
8.18.2 The prominent gateway corridors include the M6, M62, A58, A570, A580, 
North Road/City Road, A569 (Peasley Cross Lane section), A571 
(between St Helens Town Centre and the A580), and the A49.  Although 
much of the land visible from some of these routes is high quality open 
countryside or development, some routes and railway stations also pass St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 183 through or are located within areas that have become less attractive due 
to the legacy of the Borough’s industrial past. 
8.18.3 In order to protect, promote and enhance the image and unique local 
distinctiveness of St Helens Borough for its residents, visitors and for 
those who are passing through, it is considered important to optimise the 
visual appearance of these routes and locations.  This approach will also 
promote a sense of welcome into the Borough, celebrate its diligent and 
enterprising business community and boost economic regeneration and 
investment by projecting and promoting a strong, positive, and vibrant 
image for the area. 
8.18.4 Poor quality new development in these gateway corridors and locations 
could however hinder efforts to attract investors, new residents, and 
visitors as well as harm the environment for local residents.  New 
development will therefore be expected to protect or, particularly in areas 
where the existing development is of poorer quality, enhance their 
appearance.  Innovative new designs will be encouraged where 
appropriate and opportunities to improve the existing appearance of 
rundown areas will be sought. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 184 8.19 Policy LPD07: Digital Communications 
Policy LPD07: Digital Communications 
All new housing and employment development should make provision for the 
latest generation of information and digital communication (ICT) networks to a 
standard that is compatible with the infrastructure available or is likely to become 
available in the Plan period, in the area in which the development would be sited.   
Proposals for the development of new digital communications infrastructure will be 
assessed against the following criteria: 
1. In the case of proposals for infrastructure to be sited on a new mast, it must be 
demonstrated that there is no realistic option of siting the infrastructure more 
suitably (in a manner that is less visually intrusive) on an existing mast, 
building or other structure; 
2. There should be no suitable alternative site(s) available that could more 
satisfactorily meet the identified need for the proposed development; 
3. Building-mounted dishes and apparatus must normally be placed in the least 
obtrusive position possible, and designed and sited to reduce visual clutter, 
taking account of the architectural detailing, materials and colour of the host 
building and its neighbours; 
4. Development must not have an unacceptable impact, including cumulative 
impact, on residential amenity, landscape or townscape character, or wildlife; 
5. Any development that could affect the character or setting of a heritage asset 
must satisfy the requirements of Policy LPC11; 
6. Existing landscape features must be utilised and / or an appropriate 
landscaping scheme be implemented to minimise any impact on the visual 
amenity, character or appearance of the surrounding area; 
7. Apparatus, mountings, and ancillary structures should be coloured in a durable 
finish to minimise any visual harm that would arise from the proposal; and 
8. Underground facilities and ducts should be sited and laid to minimise harm to 
tree roots or areas of archaeological importance. 
The Council will continue to work with its Liverpool City Region partners to improve 
digital infrastructure within the Borough. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
8.21 Reasoned Justification 
8.21.1 There has been a huge expansion in telecommunications and computing 
in recent years.  Mobile communications are now an integral part of 
everyday modern life and are essential to a successful economic future.  
With the emergence of new innovations such as fourth and fifth generation 
networks and the expansion of internet capable devices, there is likely to 
be a very large increase in demand for bandwidth, whether this is supplied 
via copper or fibre optic cables, Wi-Fi, or mobile networks. 
National guidance and legislation 
8.21.2 The Government is investing heavily in the UK’s digital future through its 
"Digital Strategy” .  A key component of the strategy is to ensure that 
reliable mobile telephone coverage is provided to 95% of the United 
Kingdom by 2022, and that mainline rail routes, major roads, and 
connectivity ‘hotspots’ are all ready for the next generation of mobile and 
digital communication. 
8.21.3 The Government has already put significant planning reforms for digital 
technology in place, with further reforms to help industry deliver 5G and 
support improved indoor coverage currently under review, together with 
the introduction of a new broadband Universal Service Obligation by 2020.  
New permitted development rights and the reform of the Electronic 
Communications Code, through the Digital Economy Act (2017), will make 
the roll-out of communications infrastructure substantially easier and 
cheaper for the industry to install. 
8.21.4 Revised building regulations that came into force on 1 January 2017 will 
guarantee that all new buildings and renovations will include in-building 
physical infrastructure to support connections to superfast broadband.  
The Government has brokered an agreement between Openreach and the 
Home Builders Federation to offer access to full fibre broadband for all 
new developments, free of charge for developments of over 30 dwellings 
registered from November 2016, or as part of a co-funded initiative. 
8.21.5 Following consultation on its White Paper “Fixing our broken housing 
market”, the Government also intends to support improved broadband and 
mobile connectivity by requiring local authorities to have planning policies 
in place, setting out how high quality digital infrastructure will be delivered 
in their area. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 186 Liverpool City Region priorities 
8.21.6 One of the main priorities of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority 
(LCRCA) is to improve digital infrastructure within the Liverpool City 
Region, to create excellent digital connectivity to help improve the quality 
of life for residents and attract and retain investors, skilled workers and 
visitors who will contribute to economic growth. 
8.21.7 Despite growth in the existing digitally-driven sectors, digital connectivity is 
still poorer in the Liverpool City Region than in some other parts of the 
United Kingdom.  Therefore, the LCRCA aims to embed both digital and 
green technologies into the region’s transport and built environment, in 
order to provide comprehensive coverage of ultra-fast broadband 
infrastructure and ensure digital connectivity is part of future strategic 
planning and built into transport systems.  This will be achieved for 
example, through the use of smart ticketing and by exploring the use of 
free public WiFi networks to contribute to a vibrant visitor economy. 
Developer Requirements 
8.21.8 The Plan cannot predict the future of fast moving technology.  However, it 
is important that the planning process proactively supports ICT networks 
to maximise their economic and social benefits whilst minimising any 
adverse effects.  With this in mind, telecommunications infrastructure 
should be sensitively sited and designed having regard to the criteria in 
Policy LPD07. 
8.21.9 Developers of new housing and employment facilities may also (subject to 
the requirements of Policy LPA07 ‘Infrastructure Delivery and Funding’) be 
required to make appropriate provision to enable their development to 
have access to the highest available broadband speed.  The Council is 
seeking to ensure that all new housing has fibre optic availability.  
Therefore, developers of new homes should contact the appropriate digital 
communications provider at an early stage of the planning process to plan 
and correctly match network connection points to serve the new 
development. 
8.21.10 Developers are also encouraged to use ‘Dig Once’ principles, in which 
they install fibre duct in the ground during the initial construction of a 
development (even where there is no immediate use for the duct) so that 
cabling can be installed at a later date with reduced cost and disruption. 
8.21.11 The St Helens Telecommunications SPD (2008) will be updated as 
necessary to incorporate new forms of technology and policy requirements 
both nationally and locally to ensure requirements for the design and 
layout of new housing and employment meet the required standards. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 187 8.22 Policy LPD08: Advertisements 
Policy LPD08: Advertisements 
Proposals for advertisement display will be granted consent provided they would 
have an acceptable impact upon amenity or public safety. 
 Amenity 
1. Advertisements should respect the scale of and be sympathetic to their 
surroundings and not dominate any building(s), the street scene or any nearby 
open and / or publicly accessible area(s). 
2. Advertisements should respect the design and appearance of any building(s) 
on which they would be displayed. 
3. Advertisements displayed on or within the setting of a Listed Building must be 
of particularly high quality, respecting the size, materials, proportions and 
detailing of the building concerned.  Advertisements that could affect the 
character or appearance of a Conservation Area must respect the 
predominant building styles and design that lend the area its special character. 
4. Consideration will be given to the size, location, and means of any illumination 
of any proposed advertisement and whether the proposal would lead to there 
being a proliferation of advertisements creating clutter in the area. 
 Public Safety 
5. The location, siting, illumination, design and scale of any proposed 
advertisement must not compromise the safety of pedestrians, drivers or other 
users of the public highway, for example by hindering their movement, 
obscuring visibility or by causing a distraction.

Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
8.24 Reasoned Justification 
8.24.1 Advertisements can play an important role in supporting the economy and 
form a necessary part of the urban landscape, in some cases giving 
buildings or areas of land a clear identity and helping to direct vehicular 
and pedestrian traffic to their intended destination.  However, they can St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 188 also greatly influence the appearance and character of an area.  If 
advertisements are inappropriately sited or designed, or if there is a 
proliferation of them, this can lead to a dominating and cluttered street 
scene resulting in an undesirable environment. 
8.24.2 In terms of public safety, consideration will be given to whether the 
advertisement itself, or the location proposed for its display, is likely to be 
so distracting, or so confusing, that it creates a hazard to, or endangers, 
people in the vicinity.  Advertisements should not block or otherwise 
interfere with visibility splays of pedestrians and / or other road users, 
create glare or dazzle, or obscure or hinder the interpretation of road 
signs.  In the case of illuminated signs, conditions will normally be 
imposed to ensure their brightness does not cause a traffic safety hazard 
or loss of amenity for neighbouring residents. 
8.24.3 Not all advertisements require advertisement consent; national guidance 
on this point can be found in the booklet “Outdoor advertisements and 
signs: a guide for advertisers” at:

 189 8.25 Policy LPD09: Air Quality 
Policy LPD09: Air Quality 
1. Development proposals must demonstrate that they will not: 
 a) impede the achievement of any objective(s) or measure(s) set out in an Air 
Quality Management Area (AQMA) Action Plan; or 
 b) introduce a significant new source of any air pollutant, or new 
development whose users or occupiers would be particularly susceptible 
to air pollution, within an AQMA; or 
 c) lead to a significant deterioration in local air quality resulting in 
unacceptable effects on human health, local amenity, or the natural 
environment, that would require a new AQMA to be created; or 
 d) having regard to established local and national standards, lead to an 
unacceptable decline in air quality in any area. 
2. Major development schemes should demonstrably promote a shift to the use 
of sustainable modes of transport to minimise the impact of vehicle emissions 
on air quality. 
3. New development that would result in increased traffic flows on the M62 past 
Manchester Mosses Special Area of Conservation (SAC) of more than 1000 
vehicles per day or 200 Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) per day must be 
accompanied by evidence identifying whether the resultant impacts on air 
quality would cause a significant effect on ecological interests within the SAC.  
Where such effects are identified they would need to be considered in 
accordance with Policy LPC06.

Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Local 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Air Quality Management Area Action Plans 
• Development Management process 
8.27 Reasoned Justification 
8.27.1 Air pollution is associated with a number of adverse health impacts.  It is 
recognised as a contributing factor, for example, in the onset of heart 
disease and cancer and particularly affects vulnerable groups such as St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 190 children and older people, and those with heart and lung conditions.  
Mortality rates in St Helens Borough for cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases are significantly higher than the national average. 
8.27.2 There is a strong correlation with equalities issues, as many of the less 
affluent areas have poor air quality.  Air quality can also affect biodiversity 
and thereby impact on legal obligations under the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2017. 
8.27.3 Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to regularly 
monitor levels of seven key pollutants against national standards set by 
the Air Quality (England) Regulations 2000 (as amended).  St Helens 
Borough Council complies fully with these duties and works closely with 
other local authorities to protect air quality.  The Council must designate 
an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) where air pollution exceeds or is 
likely to exceed an air quality objective. 
8.27.4 Currently there are four AQMAs, where levels of nitrogen dioxide have 
been found to exceed those set by the Government, within St Helens 
Borough as follows: 
 M6 AQMA includes a strip of land either side of the M6 motorway; 
 High Street AQMA includes part of the A49 in Newton-le-Willows 
between its junctions with Ashton Road and Church Street; 
 Borough Road AQMA includes Borough Road, St Helens 
between its junctions with Westfield Street and Prescot Road; 
and 
 Linkway Reflection Court, located off Linkway West, St Helens. 
8.27.5 Further guidance and links to the AQMAs maps can be found on the 
Council’s website at: https://www.sthelens.gov.uk/business/environmental-
health/environmental-protection/air-quality/ 
8.27.6 Action to protect and improve air quality will be undertaken by requiring all 
planning applications to be accompanied by suitable mitigation measures 
where necessary.  These may include for example, requiring proposals 
that would generate additional traffic to include new Electric Vehicle 
Charging Points.  All proposals for new development that could give rise to 
significant amounts of traffic must include information on any increase in 
pollution that would arise as a result of the proposals and identify 
mitigation measures to address such increases. In doing so, this Policy will 
support the Council’s Climate Change Emergency declaration. 
8.27.7 The Manchester Mosses Special Area of Conservation (SAC) has been 
identified as being at risk of harm from increased air pollution caused by 
traffic.  For this reason, all proposals for development that would cause an 
increase in traffic levels that would exceed one or both of the thresholds in 
paragraph 3 of Policy LPD09 must be accompanied by sufficient evidence 
to enable the effects upon the SAC to be assessed. Under part 1 of Policy 
LPC06, smaller development proposals would also need to be 
accompanied by such evidence if they are likely to have a significant effect 
alone or in combination with other projects on the SAC. For this purpose, St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 191 ‘smaller developments’ is defined as meeting the threshold for requiring a 
transport assessment.  This is currently set out in St Helens Borough 
Council’s ‘Guidance Notes for the Submission of Transport Assessments’ 
(March 2016).  However, the threshold is guidance only, and the 
circumstances of individual proposals will have an influence, for example, 
there may be site specific issues or traffic sensitive locations that require 
assessment, but do not fall within the threshold indicated.  This will be 
determined on a site by site basis. Any significant effects would need to be 
addressed in line with Policy LPC06. 
8.27.8 The precise details of the measures required in response to paragraph 3) 
of Policy LPD09 will depend on the details of the development itself. 
However, effective measures available (depending on the type of 
development) may include: 
1. Electric vehicle charging points at parking spaces; 
2. Provision of a communal minibus (particularly if electric), and car 
club space; 
3. Cycle parking and shower facilities for staff; 
4. On-site services (e.g. GP surgeries and shops) to reduce need for 
off-site movements; 
5. Personalised Journey Planning services for residents. If 
employment premises the company could provide incentives for 
car-sharing and minimising car journeys for work; 
6. Production of sustainable travel information for residents e.g. 
accurate and easily understandable bus timetables; 
7. Implementation of a Staff Management Plan to place restrictions on 
car use by staff; and 
8. For vehicles generating HGV movements, restrictions to keep 
movements below 200 Heavy Duty Vehicles per day, or a 
commitment to ensuring all HGVs used will be Euro6 compliant. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037

Policy LPD10: Food and Drink 
1. Proposals for food and drink uses (including restaurants, cafes, drinking 
establishments and the sale of hot food for consumption off the premises) 
which consist of new built development or those that are not classed as 
permitted development for Change of Use under use Class E or are Sui 
Generis will only be permitted where all of the following criteria are met: 
 a) they would not cause significant harm to local amenity, public health, 
highway safety or community safety; 
 b) they would not cause significant harm to the character of the area or the 
vitality and viability of any town, district, local centre, or shopping parade; 
and 
 c) any external ventilation or extractor system and / or waste storage 
connected with the proposed use would not: 
 i) significantly harm the external appearance of the building or the street 
scene, or 
 ii) harm the residential amenity of any neighbouring property through 
noise or odours. 
2. In considering the criteria set out in paragraphs 1 of this Policy the Council will 
also take into account any cumulative impacts that the proposal may have in 
combination with any other existing or permitted food and drink uses nearby. 
3. Planning permission for a hot food takeaway will only be granted if it would be 
located: 
 a) within the defined Town Centre of St Helens or Earlestown; or 
 b) if located outside the Town Centre of St Helens or Earlestown, be outside

Document 2011 and / or any future Supplementary Planning Document that 
may supersede this.  Where an exclusion zone has a boundary that cuts 
wholly or partly through the building that is subject to the application or its 
curtilage, the whole building and its curtilage shall be considered to be within 
the exclusion zone. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 193 8.29 Policy LPD10: 
Strategic Aims, Objectives and Key Delivery Mechanisms 
Strategic Aims Met SA 2, SA 6 
Strategic Objectives Met SO 2.2, SO 6.1 
Is this a ‘strategic’ or ‘local’ policy? Local 
Key Delivery Mechanisms • Development Management process 
• Hot Food Takeaway SPD 
8.30 Reasoned justification 
8.30.1 National planning policy requires the Council to promote the achievement 
of healthy, inclusive, and safe communities.  It also encourages the 
creation and retention of vibrant town, district, and local centres.  These 
objectives can be met by promoting active street frontages (with open 
shop window displays), the creation of safe environments and by 
encouraging access to healthier food. 
8.30.2 The Government introduced a new Use Class E on 1st September 2020, 
which now groups Restaurants and Cafes within Use Class E. Therefore, 
proposals to change within the same use class do not require Planning 
Permission. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Policy LPD10 only apply to restaurant 
and café applications where a new unit is proposed or where the existing 
use class E cannot be demonstrated. Proposals for drinking 
establishments and hot food takeaways are now Sui Generis and remain 
unaffected. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Policy relate solely to proposals for 
hot food takeaways. 
8.30.3 Premises selling food and drink can contribute to the mix of uses in an 
area and provide a popular service and source of jobs for local people.  
However, they can also come to dominate the local retail food offer, 
displace other shops and food options, restrict choice and access to 
healthy, fresh food, and impact on the living conditions of nearby 
residents.  It is therefore important that such uses are appropriately 
controlled. 
8.30.4 Within town centres and other shopping areas, it is important that 
groupings of food and drink uses do not detract from the centre’s primary 
retail function or result in a loss of shops to the detriment of local 
residents.  Clustering of hot food takeaways can lead to dead frontages 
during daytime hours leading to an adverse impact on the vitality and 
viability of existing designated shopping centres.  To ensure that shopping 
areas are diverse and balanced, especially in designated centres, 
applications for food and drink uses will therefore be assessed for their 
cumulative impact. 
8.30.5 Planning conditions will also be used, where appropriate, to mitigate any 
potential harmful effects of proposals, including the restriction of permitted 
development rights, installation of ventilation or extraction systems, the 
incorporation of sound insulation and / or the control of opening hours. St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037 
 
 
 194 8.30.6 The Council’s ‘Hot Food Takeaways’ SPD (adopted in 2011) sets out 
further details to guide the location and design of hot food takeaways and 
also addresses their health impacts.  In this regard, the SPD identifies that 
obesity is an important health issue that, if developed during childhood 
and adolescence, can lead to associated health issues during adulthood.  
It also establishes a link between the occurrence of hot food takeaways 
providing a source of cheap, energy-dense, and nutrient-poor foods and 
health issues in the local area. 
8.30.7 To promote healthy eating habits and reduce the rate of childhood obesity, 
Policy LPD10 therefore restricts the areas within which new hot food 
takeaways may be allowed by setting 400 metre exclusion zones around 
primary and secondary schools and colleges.  The Council will continue 
this approach alongside other initiatives to promote healthy eating habits 
and physical activity.  The Policy will apply irrespective of whether the 
affected schools or colleges are run by the Local Education Authority. 
8.30.8 The Council will update the Hot Food Takeaways SPD (2011) to set out 
more detail about how Policy LPD10 will be implemented.  In the 
meantime, the 2011 document will continue to be applied. St Helens Borough Local Plan  up to 2037

 Appendix 4 : Monitoring Framework  
  St Helens Borough Local Plan up to 2037   
 
 Continual monitoring is a key aspect of the plan making system. The Localism Act of 
2011 requires local planning authorities to monitor the extent to which policies 
contained in their plans are being achieved and to publish this information each year 
in an  Authority Monitoring Report (AMR).    
The effectiveness of the policies in the Local Plan will be monitored to ensure that 
they are:  
• achieving the Local Plan objectives and delivering sustainable development;  
• delivering new homes and jobs; and  
• not having any unintended consequences.  
 
To enable this to happen, the Local Plan contains suitable targets and indicators that 
relate to the delivery of policies and sets out clearly how these are to be measured.
