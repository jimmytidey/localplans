Local Plan:
Core Strategy
Adopted July 2014
www.reigate-banstead.gov.uk
01737 27600023Foreword 
“The Core Strategy will help deliver sustainable growth, whilst protecting the 
attractive, accessible and well-maintained borough that our residents and 
communities value.”
Reigate & Banstead is a great place to live and work. The Borough has a healthy 
economy, distinctive town centres and good transport links, all set within a beautiful and 
diverse natural environment. 
This Core Strategy provides a framework to build on the Borough’s many strengths: to 
increase the economic prosperity of our businesses, to provide homes for local people 
and workers, and to protect and enhance the natural environment and the character of our 
urban areas.
It will also help the Council address the challenges we face: improving opportunities for 
local people in the more deprived parts of the Borough through regeneration schemes, 
facilitating development in our town centres to make them more attractive, and providing 
more affordable housing across the Borough.
The Core Strategy has been developed taking into account local evidence and public 
consultation, as well as national planning policies and sustainability appraisal, and has 
been confirmed as ‘sound’ by an independent planning inspector.
Thank you to all those who have contributed to its development. As we now move forward 
to develop our more detailed planning policies, we encourage you to continue to engage 
with us to help deliver a sustainable and prosperous future for all those who live and work 
in Reigate & Banstead.

Introduction 
1.1 Our Core Strategy provides the spatial strategy for Reigate & Banstead for the next 
15 years. It covers a wide range of spatial planning issues, including economic 
development, regeneration, housing, environmental protection, transport, health and 
education.
1.2 Underpinning the Core Strategy is a commitment by the Council to ensure that 
future development in the borough is achieved in a sustainable way – that it delivers 
prosperous and self-reliant communities whilst ensuring that the borough remains 
attractive, accessible and well-maintained.
1.3 The Core Strategy is the first in a series of planning documents that will together make 
up the Reigate & Banstead Local Development Framework (the LDF). Other documents 
being prepared as part of the LDF include the Development Management Policies 
(DMP), the Policies Map, and a number of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD). 
These other documents will reflect the strategic direction provided by this Core Strategy 
and are being progressed closely behind the Core Strategy to provide maximum 
certainty to local communities, service providers and developers.
1.4 Once adopted, the Core Strategy will form part of the statutory Development Plan that 
guides land-use planning (including neighbourhood planning) in the borough. Until 
the DMP is adopted, policies in the Borough Local Plan 2005 (BLP) which have been 
formally saved1 will also form part of the Development Plan. The National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) clarifies that these existing policies should be given due 
weight according to their degree of consistency with the NPPF. Further information is 
available on the Council’s website.
1.5 The Surrey Waste Plan, the Surrey Minerals Plan and the Aggregates Recycling Joint 
Development Plan Document (prepared by the County Council) also form part of the 
Development Plan and include site allocations and safeguarding areas in the borough 
that are required to be shown on the Policies Map.
Structure of the Core Strategy
1.6 Our Core Strategy contains:
(a) a spatial vision , setting out what we want the borough to look like in the future
(b) a set of strategic objectives , outlining the issues that need to be addressed in 
order to realise our spatial vision
(c) a series of strategic policies  that will deliver our vision and objectives. These 
policies are specific to Reigate & Banstead, but also recognise the dif ferences that 
exist within the borough. The policies provide a framework to inform and coordinate 
future development and investment in the borough, and to guide decision-making 
on development proposals.1
The Core Strategy covers a wide range of planning issues, including economic 
development, regeneration, housing, environmental protection, transport, health 
and education.
1 See Appendix 371.7 Our strategic policies are divided into three main sections:
(a) spatial strategy policies , which set the spatial strategy and context for growth, and 
describe how this growth will be planned, managed and delivered across the borough over 
the next 15 years
(b) place shaping policies , specific to different parts of the borough. These policies will 
shape future development within each area or place, taking account of local characteristics, 
opportunities and constraints
(c) cross cutting policies , more detailed policies that apply across the borough and focus 
on specific types of development. These policies set out to local communities and the 
development industry the Council’s expectations and aspirations for future development.
Timeframe
1.8 The Reigate & Banstead Core Strategy covers a period from 2012 to 2027. This is consistent 
with Government guidance and ensures that the Core Strategy offers sufficient certainty to local 
communities, stakeholders and delivery agencies about the scale, distribution and phasing of 
future development
1.9 We have prepared this Core Strategy at a time of substantial change and uncertainty. The 
impact of the recent economic downturn continues to mean reduced development finance. 
There are calls for far-reaching action to adapt to, and mitigate, the effects of climate change. 
Technology is changing the way people live and work. In addition, the Government has recently 
implemented – or is in the process of implementing – a number of changes to the planning 
system, including abolishing the regional tier of government, introducing a duty to co-operate, 
and establishing a new tier of neighbourhood plans. It has replaced the old system of planning 
policy statements with the NPPF.
1.10 Despite these uncertainties, the Council is committed to promoting a robust plan-led growth 
and regeneration programme for the borough. It is therefore important that a clear and up-
to-date statutory framework is in place to guide that development and provide the certainty 
needed for the Council and other partners to positively shape, and add value to, our 
communities over the next 15 years. The Core Strategy represents a major step towards 
achieving these goals.8
Background 2
The development of the Core Strategy and the evidence base has been subject to 
community consultation, participation and engagement.
2.1 In preparing our Core Strategy, we have adhered to Government guidance and best 
practice, and developed a comprehensive evidence base to ensure that our policies are 
robust yet sufficiently flexible to respond to changing circumstances.
The evidence base
2.2 The Core Strategy is supported by a comprehensive evidence base (available at www.
reigate-banstead.gov.uk) which has been collated throughout the development of the 
document. Our evidence base will be subject to ongoing review and updates during 
the life of the Core Strategy. Most pieces of evidence will be reviewed at least every 5 
years to ensure that we have a robust technical understanding of how our policies, and 
external circumstances, are shaping and influencing the borough.
The Duty to Co-operate
2.3 The Council has tried to maximise opportunities to undertake joint evidence gathering 
on spatial planning issues to inform policy development. Some evidence has been 
prepared through joint working with neighbouring authorities, including other East Surrey 
local authorities, Gatwick Diamond authorities and Surrey County Council. In preparing 
other pieces of evidence we have worked closely with key partner organisations, 
including Natural England and the Environment Agency. This co-operation has enabled 
us to build up intelligence about the functional areas which cover the borough, as well as 
the administrative areas of Reigate & Banstead.
2.4 We will continue to assess key issues facing the borough in partnership with adjoining 
authorities and delivery agencies. These issues include:
(a) protection and enhancement of areas designated for landscape character and/or 
biodiversity interests, including the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty 
(AONB) and the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Special Area of Conservation 
(SAC), and the maintenance of a coherent Green Belt
(b) strategic road and rail transport infrastructure provision, including the A23/M23 
corridor, the M25 corridor and the London-Brighton railway line
(c) securing balanced and sustainable housing and employment growth across the 
sub-region
(d) the future role and wider impact of Gatwick Airport
(e) the management of flood risk and air quality and responding to the challenges of 
climate change.
Consultation
2.5 Throughout the development of this Core Strategy and the evidence base that sits 
behind it, we have undertaken a range of public participation, engagement and 
consultation, ranging from informal engagement with interested parties and meetings 
with partner organisations to more formal public consultation exercises.92.6 We have undertaken the relevant statutory consultations, reflecting the national planning policy 
guidance and legislation in place at the time (although this has changed during the course of plan 
preparation). In the initial stages of plan preparation, our consultations were undertaken in line 
with Regulations 25 and 26 of the Town and Country Planning (Local Development) (England) 
Regulations 2004; in the latter stages, in line with Regulation 25 and 27 of the Town and Country 
Planning (Local Development) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2008. At the time of the Core 
Strategy submission, the Localism Act 2011 has introduced some changes to the Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, the Town and Country Planning (Local Development) (England) 
Regulations 2012 are in force, and Planning Policy Statement 12 has been replaced by the 
NPPF.
2.7 A summary of the main consultation stages is provided in Figure 1. 
Sustainability Appraisal
2.8 Our Core Strategy has been informed by a process of Sustainability Appraisal (SA), which is a 
mandatory requirement designed to ensure that the likely social, environmental and economic 
impacts of planning policies and proposals are assessed and considered by decision-makers. 
The SA process also fulfils the requirements of ‘Strategic Environmental Assessment’ under 
Directive 2001/42/EC (the SEA directive). The SA uses a set of objectives that are based on key 
sustainability issues for the borough and parameters set out in legislation. The objectives include 
protection of important habitats, preservation of heritage interests, provision of affordable housing 
and the maintenance of a robust and flexible economy. The Core Strategy is accompanied by 
a series of Sustainability Appraisal Reports, which show how policies support or conflict with 
sustainability objectives and how negative impacts can be avoided or mitigated.
Habitats Regulations Assessment
2.9 The Core Strategy has also been subject to Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA). A HRA of 
land use plans is required under Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats 
and Wild Flora and Fauna (as transposed into UK law by the Conservation of Habitats and 
Species Regulations 2010) and provides for the protection of European sites of exceptional 
importance for rare, endangered or vulnerable natural habitats and species. One European site, 
the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Special Area of Conservation, lies within the borough. The 
HRA has ensured that our spatial strategy, and Core Strategy policies, will not have an adverse 
effect on this, or any other, European wildlife site.

Borough characteristic 3
Reigate & Banstead is an accessible and attractive borough. But its valued 
characteristics also present challenges for the future.
3.1 Reigate & Banstead is a great place to live and work. The borough is accessible, 
with good transport links to central London, the wider South East, and national and 
international destinations via the M23/A23 corridor, London to Brighton railway line, M25 
and Gatwick Airport. It is also attractive, with high quality countryside and landscape, 
four distinctive towns, and a range of smaller settlements. But these characteristics also 
present challenges for the future.
Figure 2 : The Borough11Population and housing
3.2 A growing population: The population of Reigate & Banstead has risen steadily over recent 
decades and is forecast to continue to do so. The Government predicts that our population could 
rise from 140,400 residents in 20122  to 158,100 in 2022 and 165,700 residents by 2027 - an 
increase of 18% between 2012 and 20273. Looking beyond the plan period, the Government 
projects that by 2032 the population of the borough may be 172,400.
3.3 An ageing population: Projections suggest that the number of older people (the over 65s) in 
Reigate & Banstead could increase by just over 40% between 2012 and 2027, compared to an 
overall population increase of 18%4.
3.4 Declining household sizes: Nationally, household sizes are declining. Whilst recent years have 
seen an increase in household sizes in the borough, demographic changes – such as a growth in 
the numbers of older people, the impact of relationship breakdown and an increase in single and 
child-free households means that household sizes may start to decline again.
3.5 A growing population, together with declining household sizes, means that we need to plan for 
new housing growth in the borough. At the same time, our ageing population means that the 
types of housing and services that need to be provided in the borough may be different. We 
therefore need to plan for future housing and services which respond to the demands of this 
changing population structure, whilst at the same time, making the best use of land within our 
urban areas, and protecting the environment and people’s quality of life.
The economy, education and skills
3.6 Reigate & Banstead is a relatively affluent and prosperous area, with low levels of unemployment 
compared to regional and national averages. It sits at the heart of the Coast to Capital Local 
Enterprise Partnership area and within the Gatwick Diamond sub-region.
3.7 The locational advantages offered by the borough have attracted many national and 
international companies. A large proportion of the population is well qualified and works in high-
level managerial positions and professions, and across much of the borough, education and 
qualification levels are also above average.
3.8 However, this picture of general affluence masks more localised pockets of deprivation. For 
example5:
(a) parts of Merstham fall within the top 20% most deprived areas of the country and are 
ranked third most deprived in Surrey
(b) in Preston, 35% of the population have no qualifications (compared with a borough average 
of 20%).
3.9 It is important not to be complacent about the local economy. To secure economic prosperity 
in the future, the borough, and the wider Gatwick Diamond sub-region, must become more 
competitive and attractive to national and international businesses, and existing businesses 
must be supported and allowed to grow. At the same time, interventions are also needed which 
focus on regenerating the more deprived parts of the borough, improving access to services and 
supporting people to improve their quality of life.

4 2010-based sub-national population projections (ONS 2011)
5 English indices of multiple deprivation (DCLG)123.10 The positive impacts of economic growth need to be harnessed, but the negative impacts also 
need to be minimised. ‘Sustainable growth’ will provide economic prosperity whilst securing 
social and environmental objectives which benefit all those who live in, work within or visit the 
borough.
3.11 Our town centres: Even within the framework of a relatively prosperous borough economy, our 
town centres face competition from neighbouring shopping centres. Redhill and Horley town 
centres in particular require additional investment to provide new and better facilities and shops 
to improve their role and offer, whilst it will be important to ensure that Banstead and Reigate 
remain attractive and viable, offering a good range of shops and services.
The environment
3.12 The borough has a variety of natural landscapes, which support a wide range of biodiversity 
interests, from the North Downs on the edge of outer London (largely included within the 
Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and currently designated as an Area of Great 
Landscape Value), to the Low Weald in the south bordering West Sussex. Within this varied 
landscape sit the borough’s four main settlements – Reigate, Redhill, Banstead and Horley, and 
a range of smaller settlements - all of which have very different characters and histories. The 
borough’s townscapes and landscapes also therefore include a diverse range of heritage assets. 
3.13 We know that the people who live in the borough value the landscape, and the contribution it 
makes to their quality of life, and that the high quality environment makes the borough attractive 
to businesses. Preserving the quality of the biodiversity and landscapes and the sense of 
character within our built up areas is therefore a priority.
3.14 The natural and built environment will also play a valuable role in helping us adapt to, and 
mitigate against, the impacts of climate change. Future development must be designed and 
located to withstand more extreme and variable weather conditions, minimise pollution, and 
to facilitate the reduction and better management of waste, the more efficient use of natural 
resources, and the introduction of clean, renewable energy sources.
Our communities
3.15 Our residents generally enjoy good health, with Reigate & Banstead having low rates of early 
deaths from cancer, strokes and heart disease. There are, though, significant variations in health 
levels across the borough. For example6:
(a) life expectancy for males in the most deprived areas is six years shorter than in the least 
deprived areas
(b) more than 10% of children live in poverty and levels of physical activity for children in the 
borough are significantly below average.
3.16 We need to close the gap between our most deprived communities and more affluent parts of the 
borough - this will mean addressing issues such as access to education and health services and 
other local facilities as well as the provision of high quality housing and public open spaces.

Our vision and objectives are underpinned by the Council’s commitment to 
ensuring that future development in the borough is achieved in a sustainable way.
Our vision
4.1 The Core Strategy spatial vision reflects the Reigate & Banstead Partnership’s 
Community Plan vision adopted in March 2008.The Core Strategy Vision and 
Objectives
Figure 3 : The Core Strategy vision
Reigate & Banstead will be one of the most desirable and attractive areas in the region. It will 
be a place where:
•	people	who	live	in,	work	in	and	visit	the	borough	enjoy	the	benefits	of	a	prosperous	
economy
•	neighbourhoods are renewed, improved and supported by effective services, 
infrastructure and transport options
•	the wellbeing of communities is supported by accessible health, leisure, education and 
information services
•	people take personal responsibility, and enjoy active, healthy and diverse lifestyles
•	the environment, and green space, is maintained and enhanced for the future.
4.2 The Corporate Plan: The Core Strategy gives spatial expression to the Council’s latest 
Corporate Plan 2011-15, which seeks to achieve sustainable, prosperous and self reliant 
communities within an attractive, accessible and well-maintained borough.
4.3 Partnership working: The Council believes that partnership working and cooperation is 
essential to deliver the vision and improve people’s quality of life. There are a number of 
established and emerging mechanisms that will help us achieve this:
(a) the Surrey Strategic Partnership (the countywide Local Strategic Partnership) 
comprising district and borough councils, the County Council, Surrey Police, health 
providers, education/training providers, business representatives and community, 
voluntary and faith sector representatives. The Partnership works to address 
issues and deliver priorities identified in the Surrey Strategic Partnership Plan 
2010-20207 
(b) a joint Public Sector Board, established to facilitate better joint working between 
Reigate & Banstead Borough Council and Surrey County Council - and in the 
longer term, other partners - to deliver shared priorities
(c) the Gatwick Diamond Initiative, a private/public partnership undertaking joint 
working on strategic issues to promote the economic performance of the Gatwick 
Diamond sub-region, which includes Reigate & Banstead
7 www.surreycc.gov.uk14(d) the Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership, which provides the framework for joint 
working between local authorities and businesses to promote international growth and 
entrepreneurship across Surrey, West Sussex and South London.
(e) Surrey Connects, the economic partnership for Surrey, providing the forum for joint working 
with the County Council, Surrey districts and business to deliver economic prosperity 
across the county.
What will the borough look like in 2027?
4.4 The Core Strategy and other planning policy documents will promote change to deliver our 
vision. In 2027:
(a) people living in Reigate & Banstead will experience a high quality of life and environment 
and vibrant local communities, places and spaces. They will have ready access to the 
services, facilities and information that allow them to make healthy lifestyle choices, and to 
realise their own potential through improved access to skills training
(b) the green fabric that defines the borough - from the landscape scale to very local urban 
green spaces - will provide a coherent network providing an attractive setting for our 
towns and villages, enhanced recreational opportunities and improved habitats to support 
biodiversity, as well as assisting in the mitigation of, and adaption to, climate change
(c) Reigate & Banstead will be a prosperous place, providing the conditions and environment 
within which local businesses thrive. Town centres and employment areas will offer 
attractive locations for commercial investment, contributing to a flourishing and 
internationally recognised, but sustainable, Gatwick Diamond.
(d) the towns and villages within the borough will have their own unique and distinct characters, 
reflecting their history and providing for the needs of the local community
i. Redhill: through regeneration, the potential of Redhill - and the town centre in particular 
- as an attractive sub-regional centre and vibrant place to live, work and spend time will 
have been realised
ii. Horley: through regeneration in the town centre, and completion of two new 
sustainable neighbourhoods, the vitality and vibrancy of Horley will be restored
iii. Reigate: the historic interests of Reigate will have been protected, and its unique 
character, attractiveness and town centre offer enhanced
iv. Banstead: Banstead village will be recognised as a vibrant and vital centre providing a 
mix of uses and services for the local needs of people in the north of the borough
(e) regeneration initiatives in Merstham and Preston will have secured a better quality of 
environment and access to services, and helped deliver an improvement in life chances for 
those who live there
(f) the coherence and vital role of the Green Belt in protecting urban sprawl and preserving the 
openness of the countryside will have been maintained
(g) new development that has been delivered in the existing urban area will sit comfortably 
within, and make a positive contribution to, the local area and communities
(h) new development outside the current urban areas will have been planned positively - taking 
a long-term perspective and through partnership working - to ensure the most sustainable 
location, scale and form of development
(i) people living and working in the borough will have access to a range of sustainable 
transport choices, and the efficiency of the road network, public transport services and 
interchange facilities will have been improved
(j) Reigate & Banstead will be making a positive and proportionate contribution towards 
increasing tough national and global carbon emission reduction targets. Natural resources - 
such as water and energy - will be used more efficiently, waste generation will be reduced, 
and the borough’s resilience to the impacts of climate change will be much improved.15

Spatial planning sets out how much growth will take place, where it will occur 
and how it will be delivered. It also sets the context for that growth.
5.1  Our strategy
5.1.1 The purpose of the Core Strategy is to set out how much growth will take place, 
where it will occur and how it will be delivered.
5.1.2 Our spatial strategy - illustrated by the Key Diagram (Figure 4) - has been developed 
to achieve a ‘sustainable’ approach to growth, which:
  (a) preserves and encourages economic prosperity
  (b) protects valued and vulnerable parts of the environment
  (c) ensures the provision of services and infrastructure to support the community.
5.1.3 Development that is sustainable - reflecting the policies within this Core Strategy , 
saved Borough Local Plan policies or subsequent development plan document 
policies, and national guidance - will be looked upon favourably.The Spatial Strategy
Policy CS1 : Presumption in favour of sustainable development
1.  In assessing and determining development proposals, the Council will apply the  
presumption in favour of sustainable development contained in the National Planning Policy 
Framework. It will work proactively with applicants to secure development that improves the 
economic, social and environmental conditions in the area.
2. Unless material considerations indicate otherwise, proposed development that  
accords with policies in the development plan - including this Core Strategy (and where 
relevant with policies in neighbourhood plans) - will be approved without delay, and proposed 
development that conflicts with the development plan will be refused.
3. Where there are no policies relevant to the application or where relevant policies are out of 
date at the time of making the decision the Council will grant permission unless:
a.  The adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the 
benefits when assessed against policies in the National Planning Policy Framework as a 
whole; or
b.  Specific policies in the National Planning Policy Framework indicate that development 
should be restricted;  or
c.  Any other material considerations indicate otherwise.
This policy will be implemented through:
• consideration and determination of planning applications.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include: 
• planning application decisions and pre-application advice.19An area based approach
5.1.4 The borough comprises three clear geographical areas, which have been used to structure 
our spatial strategy (Figure 6). Each area has a distinct set of characteristics which will shape 
the nature and scale of growth in the future: the strategy for each area has been informed 
by that area’s physical characteristics and historical development and its sensitivities to, and 
opportunities for, development that exist there.
5.1.5 Area 1 The North Downs:  The North Downs area slopes gently downhill from the ridge of the 
North Downs towards outer London. Its predominant green fabric is a patchwork of woodland 
and heath, including Banstead Heath. Due to its underlying chalk geology there are no main 
watercourses; however, dry valleys dissect the area. Scattered settlements occur in this area, 
often following the roads. Large parts of the higher North Downs have the national designation 
of AONB. The local building style is influenced from materials available from the underlying 
geology characterised by flint walls, orange-red Wealden bricks, yellow gault clay bricks, with 
hawthorn and hazel hedges as common hedgerows. This is an area with limited potential 
for further development due to limited transport infrastructure, the existing built form and the 
constraints of the Metropolitan Green Belt and the AONB. The key objectives of the spatial 
strategy for this area are to achieve modest and sustainable growth within these limitations 
whilst preserving and enhancing the area.
5.1.6 Area 2 Wealden Greensand Ridge : The clay of the Weald is dissected by hills created by the 
harder greensand that protrudes from the clay valleys. The ridge on which Redhill and Reigate 
sit was historically one of the most prominent locations for settlement due to the availability of 
water from springs and the fertile greensand for growing crops. A string of settlements beyond 
the borough boundaries have grown up along this ridge and were connected by ancient 
transportation routes. The area has a strong industrial past that is evident by the old quarries 
along the back of the ridge. The local building style derives from materials available from the 
underlying geology like red brick, greensand walls and red tile roofs. Having traditionally been 
the main trading place and centre of the borough, there are good transport links and a large 
concentration of housing in the amalgamated settlements of Reigate and Redhill. The spatial 
strategy for this area recognises the need to ensure its continued success by maintaining 
its high economic profile - and in particular the potential for Redhill to grow physically and 
economically in the future.
5.1.7 Area 3 The Low Weald:  The Low Weald is characterised by its underlying clay geology 
resulting in a flatter area that is dissected by the River Mole, streams and ponds. This flat 
topography is interrupted with smaller greensand ridges, which provide views of the vast 
weald and woodland strips. The field systems are bounded by distinctive low, square-cut 
hedges with large oak trees scattered along their length at intervals. The urban areas have 
developed along transport corridors and railway lines. The local building style is influenced 
by the underlying geology and is characterised by orange/red brick buildings with tile hanging 
on walls and steeply pitched roofs. This area is the main location for industrial uses in the 
borough with strong links to Gatwick Airport. The only large built-up area is the town of 
Horley, which is surrounded by countryside and is the main focus for moderate growth and 
improvements to the town centre as a result of the increase in population due to two planned 
new neighbourhoods.20
Figure 6 : The area based approach
 
Prioritising regeneration and making best use of the urban areas
5.1.8 Our strategy prioritises regeneration and making best use of the development opportunities 
that exist in our urban areas. This approach recognises national priorities to make the most 
effective use of land, and focus development in the most sustainable locations and protect 
Green Belt land. It also reflects local priorities to progress the two new neighbourhoods in 
Horley, and to focus on improving the most deprived parts of the borough and our main town 
centres to secure their resilience to respond to future development pressures and challenges.
5.1.9 Redhill is the main focal point for economic and cultural provision in the borough. The town 
has good transport connections - it is not only a transport interchange and gateway for 
movement within the borough but also to inter-regional and international destinations. As a 21commercial centre offering a wide range of office space, Redhill is an attractive employment 
location for both employers and employees and an accessible destination for shoppers and 
people to spend their leisure time. However Redhill does not currently fulfil its potential in 
terms of its retail offer and range of leisure facilities. This results in the borough’s residents, 
and potential employers, choosing to - or having to - travel or locate elsewhere. Given its 
strong locational advantages, Redhill is identified in the Core Strategy as the main centre for 
consolidation and growth. The strategy seeks to ensure that in the future Redhill realises its 
full potential to become the thriving centre of the borough where people want to live, work, 
shop and spend their leisure time.
5.1.10 In Horley, the Council is committed to working in partnership to deliver two new 
neighbourhoods (the North East and North West sectors) and improvements to support the 
expanded population, including enhanced recreation and leisure provision, infrastructure 
improvements and a regenerated town centre.
5.1.11 Our spatial strategy recognises the need for regeneration in other parts of the borough. In the 
Preston and Merstham regeneration areas, moderate development and growth will help to 
bring about social, economic and/or environmental improvements that will benefit people who 
have fewer advantages than those in the rest of the borough. These regeneration areas are 
characterised by fewer facilities, and poorer services and accessibility. The social, economic 
and environmental improvements that will be realised justify directing growth here alongside 
improvements to services and access. 
5.1.12 In line with sustainable development principles and the need to make the most efficient use 
of resources, including land, our strategy gives a clear priority to development being located 
within the existing urban area, particularly those locations which are well serviced and highly 
accessible. This will ensure the best use of existing infrastructure, and enhancements to that 
infrastructure where appropriate to support new development. It will also allow us to secure 
the continued protection of the borough’s green fabric - the Green Belt and countryside 
beyond the Green Belt - from unplanned development pressures.
A realistic approach to planning for long-term growth
5.1.13 Our spatial strategy acknowledges that, as development opportunities within the urban area 
become more limited, some development on land outside the current urban area will be 
required. Such development will only be acceptable in the most sustainable locations, and 
Green Belt boundaries will only be altered in exceptional circumstances, and through the plan-
making process: further detail about this process is provided in policies CS3, CS6 and CS13. 
5.1.14 Prioritising development in this way will ensure that important regeneration objectives are 
secured and our communities and town centres are resilient to future change. It also allows for 
sufficient time to properly plan any sustainable urban extensions that are required to ensure 
they are located, designed and delivered sustainably and to a high standard.
Securing infrastructure to support development
5.1.15 New and improved infrastructure in the borough will be funded from a variety of sources, 
depending on the specific circumstances, including:
(a) developer contributions including through section 106 and Community Infrastructure Levy 
(CIL)
(b) the sale of publicly owned assets to fund infrastructure in regeneration areas
(c) bidding for grant funding to undertake regeneration initiatives
(d) undertaking projects which have shared or similar objectives with Surrey County Council 
and other partners.225.1.16 Regeneration initiatives in particular may require a different, more innovative style of funding 
than relying on conventional contributions from developers alone. The regeneration areas 
have been identified because of their existing infrastructure deficits and their requirements for 
social, economic and environmental improvements. The existing deficits in infrastructure need 
to be addressed, and initiatives to improve the quality of life undertaken, to avoid exacerbating 
current problems associated with new development. In addition, initial investment will be 
needed to make the areas more attractive to both public and private investors. The funding 
for the early stages of regeneration is therefore proposed to come from the sale of publicly 
owned assets in the regeneration areas. This ‘front-loaded’ funding will also signal to existing 
residents that change is coming and enable them to become involved in future regeneration 
projects in line with the Community Plan and Corporate Plan aspirations to encourage local 
communities to take personal responsibility for improving their areas.
5.1.17 Coordinating infrastructure provision (new or upgraded) across different providers allows more 
efficient working and economies of scale. An Infrastructure Delivery Plan has been prepared 
alongside this Core Strategy with input from a range of providers. Infrastructure priorities for 
different areas of the borough are identified in policy CS8 - more detailed information about 
infrastructure funding is included in section 7.3 and section 8.
5.1.18 Figure 7 summarises the spatial strategy for the borough - it draws on more detailed 
information and policies about the scale, location and delivery of growth in the rest of the Core 
Strategy document.23

5.2.1 The borough’s built-up areas are centred on four main settlements: Redhill, Reigate, Banstead 
and Horley. These centres have developed over time as a result of the availability of natural 
resources and the physical limitations of the geography of the area. As a result, these places 
are set very clearly within a wider ‘green fabric’ - the natural environment setting that both 
defines the borough’s landscape character and plays a vital role in supporting biodiversity. 
This green fabric comprises a range of types of green space. It includes the hills of the North 
Downs, the nationally designated Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), 
and the Low Weald, which is divided in places by outcrops of the Wealden Greensands. It also 
includes the green spaces that weave through our urban areas - the commons, historic parks, 
remnant hedgerows, treelines and other urban green space in the built-up areas that form a 
cherished part of the pleasant and green character of the borough.
5.2.2 The attractive and varied green fabric is one of the borough’s most important assets, greatly 
appreciated by residents and visitors alike.
Figure 8 : The green fabric of Reigate & Banstead
The green fabric includes:
• the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Special Area of Conservation (SAC), protected by European 
legislation
• the nationally significant Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)
• other areas of high landscape value, currently defined as Areas of Great Landscape Value (AGLV)
• common land, such as Banstead and Earlswood Commons
• the Metropolitan Green Belt which acts to separate the open countryside and London, and prevent 
settlements from merging
• all other countryside not covered by the Green Belt
• Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Sites of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCIs) and 
Local Nature Reserves (LNRs), ancient woodlands, watercourses and flood plains, all of which 
contain important habitats and contribute to the biodiversity of the borough
• green spaces in the urban area, green corridors for people and wildlife, and other site-specific 
features which provide valuable habitats to biodiversity, and contribute to visual amenity (such as 
hedgerows, ponds, protected or veteran trees, green roofs/walls).
5.2.3 The green fabric provides us with a clear framework for identifying opportunities for growth 
- it not only reflects the borough’s history but is also key to securing the high quality of life 
which attracts people to live and work in, and visit, Reigate & Banstead. By understanding the 
relationships between the green fabric and built-up areas, we can define our future priorities 
for development: those areas that can continue to grow, and those green areas that need to 
be protected and respected to deliver environmental objectives and benefit local communities.
Landscape
5.2.4 The Surrey Hills AONB: A large part of the higher North Downs is designated as an Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty - of national landscape importance and protected for the purposes 
of conserving and enhancing its natural beauty. The Surrey Hills AONB Management Plan 
guides the future management and enhancement of the area and is a material consideration in 
determining planning applications in and around the AONB.
5.2.5 Area of Great Landscape Value: Parts of the North Downs outside the AONB also currently 
have the local designation of Areas of Great Landscape Value (AGLV), in recognition of their 
landscape quality and their role in buffering the AONB. A study into the qualities of the AGLV 
landscape undertaken in 2007 recommended that a review of the AONB boundaries should be 25undertaken but that no areas should be removed from AGLV designation until the case for an 
amended AONB boundary has been considered. A Landscape Character Assessment and an 
evaluation of natural beauty has been undertaken and will inform Natural England’s decision 
as to whether to undertake a review of the boundary.
Figure 9 : The green fabric
 
NB This map indicates the overall extent of the borough’s green fabric. Detailed 
designation boundaries will be confirmed through the DMP and Policies Map.
5.2.6 This work will also form the basis on which criteria based policies in the DMP will be 
prepared and - if appropriate - will inform the identification of new local landscape 
designations and/or supplementary guidance.  In the interim, the AGLV designation will be 
retained.
5.2.7 The borough’s other landscapes: Other landscapes across the borough – whilst diverse – 
are also highly valued. The DMP and supplementary guidance will provide more detailed 
information about the protection and enhancement of the distinctive landscape areas and 
heritage assets across the borough.26Biodiversity
5.2.8 The Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment SAC: The borough’s green fabric includes the Mole 
Gap to Reigate Escarpment Special Area of Conservation (SAC), which is a protected 
European ‘Natura 2000’ site designated under the European Directive on the Conservation 
of Natural Habitats of Wild Fauna and Flora (92/43/EEC) because of the presence of rare 
Box scrub as well as chalk grassland and yew woodland.
5.2.9 The Core Strategy has been assessed under the Habitats Regulations (2010) to determine 
its potential impact on the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment SAC and other Natura 2000 
sites8. This assessment has concluded that the Core Strategy - alone and in combination 
with other plans and projects - will have no adverse impact on the integrity of Natura 2000 
sites. Specific measures are proposed as part of the Core Strategy to avoid or mitigate the 
potential impacts of visitor recreational pressure on the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment 
SAC. These include a combination of site management activities around frequently visited 
locations within the SAC, proposals for diverting visitors to alternative space in the vicinity 
of the SAC and joint working with other local authorities, organisations and government 
agencies to avoid possible effects through the management of recreational pressures. The 
Council will also allocate new open spaces and identify improved links to the countryside 
from urban areas, and encourage the improvement of existing open spaces for recreation. 
These measures to avoid or mitigate the potential impacts on the SAC will be delivered, 
during the Plan period, via the Council’s Green Infrastructure Strategy, through CIL 
and other forms of funding. Projects associated with avoiding the potential effects of 
development on the SAC will be included within the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. The 
effectiveness of these measures will be monitored and regularly assessed.
5.2.10 In addition, the DMP will contain policies to:
(a) alleviate recreational pressures on the SAC by facilitating measures to promote and 
divert recreational activities away from the SAC to other parts of the borough
(b) avoid the impacts of air pollution on the SAC
The effects of proposed development on the SAC will also be assessed on a case-by-
case basis as appropriate.
5.2.11 Other areas of Biodiversity importance: Within the borough are four nationally designated 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest, as well as Sites of Nature Conservation Importance, 
areas of Ancient Woodland and Local Nature Reserves. In addition to these designated 
areas there are numerous other sites of value for biodiversity, both in urban and rural 
areas, including valuable woodlands and watercourses, and features such as mature 
hedgerows and trees. Areas of the borough have also been identified as Biodiversity 
Opportunity Areas, where there is considered to be the best opportunity for the restoration 
and creation of nationally important habitats.
5.2.12 The Council will protect and enhance biodiversity and areas of geological importance 
across the borough, applying national legislation, to discharge its Biodiversity Duty9  and 
by implementing a Green Infrastructure Strategy for Reigate & Banstead.
5.2.13 The rural economy: Agricultural development, and small scale development to support 
the rural economy and provide appropriate facilities for outdoor recreation and community 
uses, will be supported in the countryside (including the Green Belt). Detailed policies 
8 HRA available at www.reigate-banstead.gov.uk
9 Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 200627setting out the criteria against which proposals for such development will be assessed 
will be included in the DMP document. The Rural Surrounds of Horley and Babylon Lane 
designations will also be reviewed through the DMP.
Green infrastructure
5.2.14 Development within the borough provides positive opportunities to deliver better 
communities and enhancements to the green fabric.
5.2.15 In conjunction with the Core Strategy and the DMP, the Council is developing a Green 
Infrastructure (GI) Strategy. The strategy will define the strategic direction for developing 
and managing a multi-functional network of green spaces across the borough, linked 
together by green corridors, facilitating the delivery of a wide range of national and local 
policies and strategies. This network will include parks, commons, natural and semi-
natural green spaces, areas used for recreation, sport and play, churchyards, allotments 
and green roofs and walls - linked by corridors, including hedgerows, urban planting, 
public rights of way or watercourses.
5.2.16 The GI Strategy will set priorities for addressing deficiencies in green infrastructure and 
will outline how the Council will work with partners to plan, protect, promote, enhance 
and extend the network and to embrace opportunities provided by development. Its 
implementation will bring a range of social, environmental and economic benefits in 
particular to areas of regeneration:
(a) enhancing the GI of the borough will lead to improvements to biodiversity and to the 
connectivity of habitat, enhancements of the landscape and townscape, and play and 
amenity provision
(b) enhancing sustainable transport linkages between town and countryside and between 
areas of open space will increase residents’ access to nature, thus contributing to 
quality of life and health improvements
(c) improving the attractiveness of the borough as a place to live and work, through 
provision of GI, will help promote economic prosperity
(d) a comprehensive GI network will help the borough adapt to the effects of climate 
change, for example by helping deliver flood management and urban cooling.
5.2.17 GI planning will also provide an important contribution to avoiding the effects of 
development on the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment SAC by enabling sustainable 
visitor management practices at the SAC and providing alternative open spaces for local 
residents.
Policy CS2 : Valued landscapes and the natural environment
1.  In considering the allocation of land and /or proposals for significant development, the Council and 
developers will be required to protect and enhance the borough’s green fabric.
a.  The Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) is a landscape of national 
importance and therefore will be provided with the highest level of protection. The same principles 
will be applied to protect the AGLV as an important buffer to the AONB and to protect views from 
and into the AONB, until such time as there has been a review of the AONB boundary.
b.  All areas of countryside have their own distinctive landscape character. The landscape character 
of the countryside outside the current (or revised) AONB boundary will be protected and 
enhanced through criteria based policies in the DMP including, if and where appropriate, new 
local landscape designations. In those areas of countryside allocated for development, policies 
will be included in the DMP in relation to the design and siting of development to minimise the 
impact on landscape character.
c.  The borough’s commons will be maintained and enhanced for the benefits of farming, public 
access and biodiversity.28
Policy CS2 : Valued landscapes and the natural environment (contd.)
d.  The Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment SAC will be afforded the highest level of protection in line 
with European legislation. Proposals for development that is likely to have a significant ef fect on 
the SAC, alone or in combination with other development, will be required to demonstrate that it 
will not adversely affect the integrity of the site.
e.  Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Sites of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCIs), 
Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) and ancient woodland will be protected for their biodiversity value 
and where appropriate enhanced.
f.  Urban green spaces, green corridors and site specific features which make a positive contribution 
to the green fabric and/or a coherent green infrastructure network and will, as far as practicable, 
be retained and enhanced.
2.  The Council will work with a range of partners to promote, enhance and manage a substantial 
network of multi-functional green infrastructure across the borough, to maximise the social, economic 
and environmental benefits of the borough’s green fabric. 
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies including to protect and enhance landscape character, biodiversity and urban green 
space
• Design and Parking SPD
• Green Infrastructure Strategy and action plan, including measures to protect, promote, enhance and 
extend the GI network and to deliver a range of measures to mitigate the effects of development and 
avoid potential effects of development on the SAC
• close working with Natural England, the National Trust and other partners as appropriate to identify 
areas of focus for the delivery of avoidance measures to protect the SAC
• partnership working to implement the Surrey Biodiversity Strategy and to implement projects and 
initiatives identified through the GI Strategy, and to implement and monitor the AONB Management 
Plan and secure a review of the AONB boundary
• Habitats Regulations Assessment of future policies, programmes and projects which are likely to have 
a significant effect on the SAC.
• developer contributions, through Section 106 payments and/or Community Infrastructure Levy, and 
other funding mechanisms as appropriate
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• the scale of change and development within areas of landscape and nature conservation value.
Evidence base: 
• Sustainability Appraisal
• Habitats Regulations Assessment
• Landscape and Townscape Character Assessment
• Area of Great Landscape Value Report
• PPG17 Open Space, Sport and Recreation Assessment.
5.3  Green Belt
5.3.1 Stretching across all three landscape areas of the borough is the Metropolitan Green Belt: 
approximately 70% of the borough, and most of its ‘green fabric’, is covered by Green Belt 
designation. 
5.3.2 Green Belt is a policy designation with the fundamental aim to prevent urban sprawl by 
keeping land permanently open.  National policy requires that the Green Belt be protected 
from inappropriate development and that once established, boundaries should only be altered 
in exceptional circumstances through the plan making process. The South East Plan indicated 
(Policy SP5) that a Green Belt review may be required around Redhill-Reigate to meet 
regional development needs. 
5.3.3 In developing the Core Strategy, we have concluded (on the basis of existing evidence) that 
sustainable urban extensions to deliver the housing target in policy CS13 will be required. 
In exceptional circumstances limited areas of land may be removed from the Green Belt for 
this purpose and allocated for development through the plan making process. As set out 
in policy CS3, the exceptional circumstances test will include consideration of the need for 29development, the suitability and availability of sites to accommodate that development, and 
will require demonstration that removal of land will result in no or limited conflict with the 
purposes and integrity of the Green Belt. 
5.3.4 It is also probable – given some of the constraints to the provision of Gypsy, Traveller and 
Travelling Showpeople accommodation in the urban area and countryside beyond the Green 
Belt – that there will be a need to consider limited alterations to Green Belt boundaries to 
accommodate Traveller sites (for example to inset a site within the Green Belt). Further 
information is provided in policy CS16.
5.3.5 A detailed Green Belt review will be carried out to inform the DMP. This review will assess the 
extent to which parcels of land contribute to the purposes and integrity of the Green Belt (as 
identified in national policy). It will identify where boundaries can be revised to align with clear 
physical features and without compromising the essential characteristics of the Green Belt.
5.3.6 National policy also requires that Green Belt boundaries should be capable of enduring 
beyond the plan period. Further work will be undertaken as part of the DMP – based on both 
existing evidence and new studies such as the detailed Green Belt review – to consider 
where land should be safeguarded. Safeguarded land to meet development needs beyond 
the current plan period would only be allocated for development through a Local Plan review 
process.
5.3.7 There are proposals in other plans that could also affect the Green Belt. The Surrey Waste 
Plan 2008 identifies Copyhold Works, Redhill, and Land at Earlswood Depot and Sewage 
Treatment Works, Redhill as sites within the borough where development related to waste 
treatment/management is considered suitable. It also has policies that recognise the possibility 
that other waste related development may need to be located in the countryside. Copyhold 
Works, Redhill is also identified as a suitable site for aggregates recycling in the Aggregates 
Recycling Joint Development Plan Document. The Surrey Minerals Plan identifies Chilmead 
Farm, Nutfield Marsh as an area of search for possible future silica sand production. Sites 
identified in the Surrey Waste Plan, Surrey Minerals Plan and Aggregates Recycling Joint DPD 
will be shown on the Policies Map.
Policy CS3 : Green Belt
1.     A robust and defensible Green Belt will be maintained to ensure that the coherence of the green 
fabric is protected and future growth is accommodated in a sustainable manner.
2.  Planning permission will not be granted for inappropriate development in the Green Belt unless very 
special circumstances clearly outweigh the potential harm to the Green Belt.
3.  In exceptional circumstances land may be removed from the Green Belt and allocated for 
development through the plan making process. Exceptional circumstances may exist where both (a) 
and (b) apply:
a.  There is an overriding need for the development in order to secure the delivery of the strategic 
objectives and policies of the Core Strategy, and either:
(i)  The development proposed cannot be accommodated on land within the existing urban 
area or on land which is in the countryside beyond the Green Belt; or
(ii)  The development of land within the Green Belt would represent a significantly more 
sustainable option than (i).
b.  There is no or limited conflict with the purposes and integrity of the Green Belt.
4.  The Council will undertake a Green Belt review to inform the DMP and Policies Map. This review will 
include:
a.  Consideration of the purposes of the Green Belt to inform the identification of land for 
sustainable urban extensions within the broad areas of search identified in policy CS6
b.  Addressing existing boundary anomalies throughout the borough
c.  Reviewing washed over villages and areas of land inset within or currently beyond the Green 
Belt throughout the borough
d.  Ensuring clearly defined and readily recognisable boundaries which are likely to be permanent 
and are capable of enduring beyond the plan period.30
Policy CS3 : Green Belt (contd.)
5.  In accordance with (3) and (4) above and the provisions and considerations set out in policies CS6, 
CS10 and CS16, land required for development will be removed from the Green Belt and allocated 
through the DMP. 
6.  Land may also be safeguarded through the DMP in order to provide options to meet development 
needs beyond the plan period. Safeguarded land will only be allocated through a subsequent local 
plan review and will be subject to Green Belt policy until such time.  
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies to protect the Green Belt; DMP allocations of land for development, and safeguarding of 
land to meet longer term development needs, and associated amendments to Green Belt boundaries 
on the Policies Map
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include: 
• development taking place within the Green Belt.

5.4  Valued townscapes and the historic environment
5.4.1 The historic environment: In parts of the borough, both urban and rural, historic buildings, 
townscapes, landscapes and other historic features have an important role in defining the 
local sense of place, character and distinctiveness. In addition to being of value in their own 
right they often bring associated social and cultural benefits. Historic environment features 
(‘heritage assets’) include listed and locally listed buildings, conservation areas, scheduled 
ancient monuments and historic parks and gardens. The historic significance and contribution 
of these assets to the quality of place will be conserved and enhanced through the sensitive 
location and design of new development.
5.4.2 Valued townscapes: Whilst the borough’s built up areas share many similar characteristics, 
they are also each unique - a function of their history, past evolution and development, and 
their current role. In many of the borough’s built up areas, a strong sense of place exists 
due to the layout of the street scene, green space and trees, and/or local vernacular design. 
The sensitivity of the different built up areas of the borough to change and their ability to 
absorb growth therefore also varies. For example, Reigate and Redhill are physically linked 
and located in the same landscape character area, but differ considerably in their ability 
to accommodate future growth. Banstead village and Preston are also within the same 
landscape character area, but are very different places with very different communities and 
needs.
5.4.3 Our Core Strategy policies reflect the individual sensitivities of the dif ferent built up areas in 
the borough, and seek to direct appropriate levels of growth to each. Growth will be used to 
bring about positive change to places that need investment to reduce the gap in quality of 
life between those places and the rest of the borough. In other areas, it will be necessary to 
ensure that development is of an appropriate scale and design to maintain the already high 
quality street scene and environment.
5.4.4 The DMP will include specific site allocations for new development, and more detailed policies 
about conserving and enhancing townscapes and the historic environment. Guidance on 
development densities and parking, informed by character and sustainability considerations, 
will also be provided.31
Policy CS4 : Valued townscapes and the historic environment
1.  Development will be designed sensitively to respect, conserve, and enhance the historic 
environment, including heritage assets and their settings. Development proposals that would provide 
sensitive restoration and re-use for heritage assets  at risk will be particularly encouraged.
2.  Development will respect, maintain and protect the character of the valued townscapes in the 
borough, showing consideration for any detailed design guidance that has been produced by the 
Council for specific built-up areas of the borough. Proposals will:
a.  Reflect high standards of sustainable construction in line with policy CS1 1
b.  Be of a high quality design which takes direction from the existing character of the area and 
reflects local distinctiveness
c.  Be laid out and designed to make the best use of the site and its physical characteristics, whilst 
minimising the impact on surrounding properties and the environment
d.  Protect and where appropriate enhance existing areas of biodiversity value and the links between 
them.  
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies including to protect and enhance the historic environment and secure appropriate 
densities and sensitive design
• Design and Parking SPD
• ongoing review of conservation areas, and maintenance of an up-to-date list of heritage assets
• Green Infrastructure Strategy, including measures to improve links between urban green spaces
• developer contributions through Section 106 payments and/or Community Infrastructure Levy
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include: 
• the scale of change and development within areas of conservation or special character and the impact 
of development upon historic assets such as listed buildings.
Evidence base:
• Sustainability Appraisal
• Landscape and Townscape Character Assessment
• Conservation Area Appraisals.
5.5  Valued people and economic development
5.5.1 There are over 138,000 people living in Reigate & Banstead10, and some 71,000 people work 
here11.  Many more people travel through the borough to and from London, the south coast 
and international destinations.
5.5.2 One theme in the Core Strategy vision is securing community well-being and a healthy 
population. Residents of Reigate & Banstead are generally healthy, affluent and well educated. 
However, there are parts of the borough where people do not share the same advantages 
as other areas, and which have levels of income, educational attainment and health that are 
lower than the regional average. It is important that the Core Strategy considers the needs of 
all people and provides the opportunities for vibrant thriving communities where individuals 
take personal responsibility for themselves and their surroundings.
5.5.3 By understanding local needs, and by ensuring that people have access to the services, 
information and facilities that allow them to make healthy lifestyle choices, planning policies 
can lay the foundations for the borough to be a better place for those who live, work and learn 
in it. Policies will:
(a) support the Corporate Plan aspiration for an economically prosperous borough 
where small and large businesses thrive and grow, through more positive and flexible 
employment policies and town centre regeneration in Redhill and Horley
10 2010 mid year estimates (ONS)
11 Experian 201032(b) provide positive benefits in areas in need of regeneration, including Preston and 
Merstham
(c) provide for healthier communities, for example, in partnership with the health sector, 
by improving access to an established GI network throughout the borough to promote 
healthier lifestyles
(d) support improved access to, and where possible new provision of, further and higher 
education and skills training, and identify new employment opportunities, particularly in 
Redhill.
Education and skills
5.5.4 Several universities serve the Gatwick Diamond area12, but there are no universities within 
Reigate & Banstead. There is a good choice of high quality state schools and outstanding 
independent schools, and a number of further education colleges, including East Surrey 
College and Reigate College. The University of Brighton, working with the Gatwick Diamond 
Initiative, is extending further and higher education provision across the Gatwick Diamond 
area more directly in line with the needs of businesses in the area. The Council will continue to 
work with the County Council, the Gatwick Diamond Initiative, adjoining authorities and further 
education and higher education institutions to improve access to education facilities in the 
borough over the timeframe of this strategy.
Health
5.5.5 Overall, the population of Reigate & Banstead enjoys good health, but statistics show that 
obesity is a problem in more deprived parts of the borough. Most residents live long and active 
lives – we therefore have an increasingly elderly population who will need particular care in the 
future. We also have a growing younger population, which will result in greater demands for 
education, transport and housing. It is therefore important that the Council continues to work in 
partnership with service providers to ensure these needs are met.
Economy and employment
5.5.6 Reigate & Banstead occupies a strong strategic location for business. It is central to the 
Gatwick Diamond economic area and at the heart of the Coast to Capital Local Enterprise 
Partnership. The authority also falls within the area of Surrey Connects, the economic 
partnership for Surrey. The borough enjoys excellent transport links to central London, the 
wider South East, and national and international destinations via the M23/A23 corridor, 
London to Brighton railway line, M25, and Gatwick Airport.
5.5.7 Different parts of the borough fulfil different economic roles. The North Downs area is 
characterised by a small number of large stand-alone headquarter office sites with only a 
limited amount of other commercial activity. Redhill and Reigate town centres provide the focal 
point for office activity, particularly in the financial and business services sector, with several 
successful industrial sites also located nearby. Industrial estates in Salfords are characterised 
by larger industrial and warehouse units, whilst Horley is home to a range of smaller office and 
industrial premises. The southern part of the borough is characterised by a higher presence 
of transport, storage and communications businesses. It is important that the Core Strategy 
recognises and capitalises on these different roles.
5.5.8 The borough’s economy will continue to be influenced by its location in the Gatwick Diamond 
and its proximity to Gatwick Airport. The airport is recognised as a key driver in the sub-
regional regional and national economy, yet associated with its activity are environmental 
effects. The Council will work closely with partners across the Gatwick Diamond to deliver 
12 The universities of Brighton, Chichester, Surrey and Sussex33the vision of the area as an internationally recognised business location with a global future 
in a sustainable way, including through the exploration of options for strategic employment 
development opportunities. The Core Strategy reflects the role of Reigate and Banstead (in 
particular Redhill) outlined in the Gatwick Diamond Local Strategic Statement (2012).
5.5.9 The Corporate Plan identifies the importance of regeneration to the improved and sustained 
economic prosperity of the borough. It falls to the Core Strategy to balance economic 
development pressures with securing regeneration aims and sustaining a high quality of 
life and environment for residents. This is particularly important in the light of the current 
economic downturn. Economic forecasts for the borough13 indicate that employment figures 
may increase by 6,800 by 2026 and that future growth (in both output and employment) 
will be dominated by financial and business services, public sector related services and 
the distribution, hotel and catering industries. Floorspace forecasts indicate that between 
2010 and 2026 demand for industrial floorspace will decline whilst demand for office and 
distribution/warehousing floorspace will increase. The Core Strategy therefore needs to 
provide a framework to manage the declining demand for industrial floorspace, and secure 
new provision of office and warehousing floorspace, whilst remaining flexible to accommodate 
the changing needs of business.
5.5.10 Policies within this Core Strategy set out the broad amount and distribution of floorspace that  
is likely to be required over the plan period. The DMP will identify designated employment 
areas and address in more detail the provision of additional employment-generating 
floorspace, including, as appropriate, identifying specific sites and setting criteria based 
policies (including design and amenity considerations) to guide new development.
5.5.11 The regeneration focus of the Council, and environmental and policy constraints, mean that 
it is essential to secure the best use of land, including employment land. In the majority of 
cases, redundant industrial space is likely to be appropriate for re-use or redevelopment for 
alternative employment generating uses. However it is recognised that over the course of the 
Core Strategy period, unanticipated strategic proposals may come forward that would result in 
a major gain or loss of employment provision. This may include the identification of strategic 
employment development through joint working with Gatwick Diamond authorities and/or other 
adjoining authorities. The Council will seek to manage any such proposals and may consider 
a partial review of economic/ employment policies or the production of an Area Action Plan or 
Supplementary Planning Document.
5.5.12 Choice, flexibility and smart growth: Securing a prosperous economy requires new and 
existing businesses in the borough to operate efficiently and effectively. This not only depends 
on employment growth - it also requires a flexible approach that allows businesses to have 
access to the right type of employment floorspace, the right skills, and the ability to implement 
‘smarter’ or more productive ways of working.
5.5.13 The commercial property market currently offers a wide choice of type, size and quality of 
floorspace. Maintaining this choice for businesses will allow them to expand and maximise 
their potential: this can be achieved through designation of a range of different types of 
employment area, and flexible employment policies to ensure that the market is able to 
respond to changing demands for different types or sizes of premises over the plan period.
5.5.14 Ensuring best use is made of employment land is a key driver of ‘smarter ’ working, as well as 
being the most sustainable approach to future development. Small businesses make a vital 
contribution to the borough’s economy so it is particularly important to secure the conditions 
and facilities that allow these businesses to survive and grow. Supporting entrepreneurship,

Policy CS5 : Valued people and economic development
1.  The Council will promote and support continued sustainable economic prosperity and regeneration in 
Reigate & Banstead by:
a.  Identifying, targeting and working to improve the priority Regeneration Areas, where 
development and growth can deliver economic, social and environmental improvements to those 
areas and the people who live in them
b.  Sustaining those areas of the borough which already prosper by supporting communities and 
improving infrastructure and community facilities to meet their needs
c.  Recognising and nurturing the distinctive economic role of different parts of the borough (in 
particular raising the profile of Redhill as a commercial location), and working with adjoining 
authorities and other partners to maximise the opportunities arising from our position within the 
Gatwick Diamond, the Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership, Surrey Connects and our 
proximity to London
d.  Planning for a range of types and sizes of employment premises to cater for the needs of 
established, growing and start-up businesses; and ensuring sufficient flexibility to meet their 
changing needs and attract new businesses
e.  Planning for the delivery of additional employment floorspace to meet the forecast growth needs 
of the borough, by:
(i)  focusing on retaining and making the best use of existing employment land, particularly 
within town centres and industrial areas unless it can be demonstrated that there is no 
reasonable prospect of a site being used for that purpose over the life of the plan; and 
(ii)  ensuring that any new employment development outside these areas reflects wider policy 
priorities and is located in accordance with sustainability principles.
f.  Supporting entrepreneurship and innovation by facilitating the provision of affordable start-up/
incubator units in the most accessible locations.
2.  The Council will:
a.  Work with partners such as Surrey County Council, health providers and neighbouring 
authorities to deliver improved health facilities and access to healthier lifestyles
b.  Work with partners such as Surrey County Council, skills providers including East Surrey College 
and neighbouring authorities to promote and deliver improved education facilities and increased 
education opportunities including support for identifying and developing vocational and skills 
improvement  facilities in the borough
c.  Empower, support, and actively work with local communities, as part of the Local Community 
Action Plan (LCAP) process and to facilitate neighbourhood planning.especially in the most productive sectors, will also contribute to securing a prosperous 
economy. Key sectors identified in Reigate & Banstead include financial and business services 
and distribution and communications - financial and business services contributing most to 
the borough’s economy. Planning policy can help facilitate the growth of productive small 
and medium sized businesses by identifying appropriate types and locations for employment 
floorspace: the wider regeneration measures being implemented will also benefit local 
businesses, and provide job opportunities for local people.35
Policy CS5 : Valued people and economic development (contd.)
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including in relation to employment provision and community facilities.
• site allocations (including for regeneration proposals) and employment area boundaries in the DMP 
and on the Policies Map
• cross boundary working, including through the Gatwick Diamond Initiative, the Coast to Capital Local 
Enterprise Partnership and Surrey Connects
• active and regular engagement with local community groups, businesses and established regeneration 
forums, including to facilitate neighbourhood planning where appropriate
• partnership working with Surrey County Council, including through the Public Sector Board, and with 
health and education providers, to deliver the Surrey Partnership Plan and other shared strategic 
priorities
• developer contributions through Section 106 payments and/or Community Infrastructure Levy
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals
• where appropriate, Local Development Orders or other similar mechanisms to promote growth and 
enterprise at particular locations
• where appropriate, Area Action Plans or SPD to deal with strategic proposals for the major gain or loss 
of employment provision.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• the progress of projects and sites in regeneration areas
• proposals for the gain or loss of employment floorspace or major occupiers in the borough.

Place	shaping	is	the	creative	use	of	local	government	powers	to	influence	and	
promote the general wellbeing of communities and citizens.Shaping our places
6.1  Place shaping
6.1.1 Local authorities have a key role in shaping the places where we live, bringing 
together communities, businesses and service providers to coordinate action that 
improves places and enhances the general well-being of residents. Alongside this, 
through the Government’s localism proposals, communities now have a greater 
opportunity to shape their local neighbourhoods using neighbourhood plans and 
neighbourhood development orders.
6.1.2 Spatial planning has an important role to play in place shaping and delivery. Through 
spatial planning we can better understand how places function and set in motion 
joined-up policies, guidance and actions to make them better. We can ensure that 
new development is located in the most sustainable locations and designed to 
minimise its impact on the environment, whilst enhancing the character and identity of 
the surrounding area:
(a) the planning system is the principal way in which good design can be secured. 
Policies can be used to positively shape the borough and help improve those 
areas that are in need of renewal or a better defined purpose
(b) place shaping will make sure that investment in all our settlements takes place 
ahead of, or alongside, the growth that will take place there.
6.1.3 This section of the Core Strategy concentrates on the issues to be tackled through 
a place shaping approach. The borough has been divided into three areas based on 
the underlying geology and history of development over time. How these places have 
been shaped in the past provide us with a direction for how they should develop in 
the future.
6.2 Strategic locations for growth and the allocation of development
6.2.1 As outlined in section 5, our spatial strategy is based around the three broad 
geographic areas, defined on the basis of their geology, history and character.
6.2.2 Across these areas are distributed the Council’s priority areas for regeneration and 
growth, and our four town centres, which together represent the focal points for future 
growth:
(a) Preston regeneration area and Banstead village centre in the North Downs 
area
(b) Redhill town centre, Merstham regeneration area and Reigate town centre in 
the Wealden Greensand Ridge area
(c) the two new Horley neighbourhoods and Horley town centre in the Low Weald 
area.37The allocation of development
6.2.3 The Core Strategy sets out the overall strategy for growth in the borough. Detailed site 
allocations for development, and policies to guide the design, phasing and siting of 
development, will be included in the DMP. Other DPDs may also need to be brought forward in 
future years to allocate additional sites should they be needed.
6.2.4 Urban areas first: Our spatial strategy is based on an ‘urban area first’  approach. This reflects 
national policy guidance, and the constrained nature of the borough. The fact that the borough 
sits within the Metropolitan Green Belt means that the Council has to manage future land 
supply carefully to ensure that development can be delivered sustainably both now and in the 
future.
6.2.5 The Council’s priority areas for growth and regeneration are Redhill town centre, Horley town 
centre, Preston and Merstham regeneration areas and the two new neighbourhoods in Horley. 
The other town centres also offer opportunities for sustainably located development, and many 
other urban locations are highly accessible and well suited for future development. Smaller 
scale development may also be appropriate in other urban areas. This approach will enable 
the use of existing services and infrastructure, promote the efficient reuse of urban land and 
ensure that allocated sites are sustainable and consistent with the Council’s overarching 
spatial strategy. Further information about this approach is provided in section 5.1.
6.2.6 The Council has undertaken a Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA), 
a review of employment land, a landscape character assessment and a retail and leisure 
needs assessment to support the development of the Core Strategy. These, along with other 
technical evidence, will inform the identification of site allocations. Further work will include 
an assessment of current urban designations, such as urban open land, and consideration of 
additional potential that might exist in these locations.
6.2.7 Development outside the urban area: In the longer term (beyond 2022 based on current 
evidence) development opportunities within the urban area are likely to become more limited, 
especially in relation to housing provision. Our spatial strategy therefore recognises that 
some development on land currently outside the urban area will be needed to accommodate 
sustainable urban extensions providing up to 1,600 homes. If identified urban opportunities 
fail to come forward, sustainable urban extensions will be required earlier in the plan period; 
conversely, if unanticipated but sustainable opportunities come forward in the urban area this 
will mean that the need for development on land currently outside the urban area is pushed 
back or that the scale will be less than currently estimated.
6.2.8 Three broad areas of search have been identified for sustainable urban extensions to deliver  
housing, with indicative capacities for development:
(a) small scale opportunities adjoining the urban area of Horley, for up to 200 homes
(b) the area to the East of Redhill and East of Merstham, with potential for up to 500-700 new 
homes
(c) the area to the South and South West of Reigate with potential for up to 500-700 new 
homes. 
6.2.9 The DMP and Policies Map will allocate sites for development within these areas of search. 
Further technical work and testing will be undertaken. This will include a detailed Green Belt 
boundary review, and assessment of sustainability (including consideration of local level 
constraints and opportunities - for example, flood risk, biodiversity , landscape, amenity value - 
and the infrastructure and service requirements resulting from new development). 38
Policy CS6 : Allocation of land for development
1.  Development sites will be allocated in the Development Management Policies Document, or through other 
DPDs, taking account of sustainability considerations including environmental and amenity value, localised 
constraints and opportunities, the need to secure appropriate infrastructure/service provision, and the policies 
within this Core Strategy. 
2.  The Council will give priority to the allocation and delivery of land for development in sustainable locations in 
the urban area, that is: 
a. The priority locations for growth and regeneration:
- Redhill town centre
- Horley town centre
- Horley North East and North West sectors
- Preston regeneration area
- Merstham regeneration area
- Other regeneration areas as identified by the Council and its partners
b. The built up areas of Redhill, Reigate, Horley and Banstead:
c. Other sustainable sites in the existing urban area.
3.  The Council will also allocate land beyond the current urban area for sustainable urban extensions, based on 
an assessment of the potential within the following broad areas of search (in order of priority):
a.  Countryside beyond the Green Belt adjoining the urban area of Horley
b.  East of Redhill and East of Merstham
c.  South and South West of Reigate.
Sites beyond the current urban area will be released for development in accordance with policy CS13 and 
detailed phasing policies within the DMP.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP including in relation to design, amenity and sustainability, and saved policies from the Borough Local Plan.
• Site allocations in the DMP and on the Policies Map, including in regeneration areas, and allocated and 
safeguarded sites for sustainable urban extensions.
• Horley North East and North West sector planning permissions.
• Masterplans for sustainable urban extensions.
• Partnership working with Surrey County Council, registered providers and private sector development partners.
• New Growth Point funding.
• Developer contributions, through Section 106 payments and/or Community Infrastructure Levy, and other 
funding opportunities as appropriate.
• Consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
• Compulsory purchase orders where necessary.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• Monitoring indicators related to policies CS5, CS8 and CS13.
Evidence base:
• Sustainability Appraisal.
• Habitats Regulations Assessment.
• Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment.
• Landscape and Townscape Character Assessment.
• Merstham Estate Local Centre Planning Framework.
• Preston Planning Framework.
• Draft Redhill Area Action Plan
• Indices of Multiple Deprivation
• Strategic Flood Risk Assessment.
• Sustainable urban extensions: Broad Geographic Locations Technical Report6.2.10 Sites identified through these studies will be further scrutinised against Core Strategy policies  
and will be subject to Sustainability Appraisal before choices are made about land allocations. 
Following identification of sites in the DMP, masterplans may be prepared to ensure that 
any sustainable urban extensions (or other allocations) are located, planned, designed and 
delivered sustainably. Further information in relation to trigger points for the release of land 
currently outside the urban area for housing is provided in policy CS13.396.3  Town and local centres
6.3.1 Our town centres provide economic prosperity, community focus, and a range of shopping, 
dining and entertainment for residents and visitors alike. It is important to ensure that they 
remain viable and competitive. At the same time, we recognise the contribution that town 
centres make to the character of the borough. By preserving and enhancing the character - as 
well as a range of shops and services - we can create visually attractive places that will draw in 
increased numbers of visitors and customers.
6.3.2 Redhill/Reigate is part of the strategic town centre network, which is the prime focus for large 
scale leisure, culture and retail developments. Redhill is identified in the Council’ s Corporate 
Plan 2011-15 as the borough’s growth and transport hub. Redhill town centre, already a 
comparison and convenience goods shopping and leisure destination, is clearly the heart of 
the transport hub and has the potential to become a better-connected and more vibrant town 
centre. To deliver these aspirations, the Core Strategy plans to maintain a constant retail 
market share across the borough as a whole, but in the short term, to frontload the floorspace 
requirements, and to direct the majority of this retail growth to Redhill. This will have the effect 
of capturing benefits from inward investment opportunities. In the longer term, as regeneration 
initiatives progress and on the basis of monitoring information, the scope for Redhill to secure 
investment at a scale which would permanently alter its market share - and enable it to perform 
an increased market function - will be assessed.
6.3.3 Whilst joined with the wider transport hub, Reigate town centre is distinctly different from 
Redhill, although it also functions as a comparison, convenience and food and drink 
destination. Its strengths are its historic character and buildings, and range of small 
independent specialist and boutique shops and restaurants (although this character does 
constrain the extent of future development in the town).
6.3.4 Elsewhere in the borough:
(a) Banstead village centre performs a convenience role for its local catchment, primarily 
focused around the daytime economy
(b) Horley town centre performs a service and convenience role for its local area, and is the 
subject of regeneration plans to improve facilities and accommodate increased demand 
from the two new residential neighbourhoods in the north of the town.
6.3.5 Alongside these town centres is a network of smaller local centres. These local centres sit 
lower down the hierarchy and make a valuable contribution in providing for more local needs; 
particularly day-today convenience shopping. The DMP will provide more information about 
protecting and enhancing their vitality and viability. In more deprived areas, they also provide 
the focus for the provision of accessible local services such as health centres and other small-
scale community facilities.
6.3.6 The Retail & Leisure Needs Update Study (2011) identifies that an additional 25,800sqm of 
comparison floorspace and 11,700sqm of convenience floorspace will be needed to 2027 
across the borough. To reflect the objective of enhancing Redhill’s retail offer, the majority of 
both convenience and comparison floorspace will be accommodated in Redhill town centre 
(see also policy CS8 Area 2a). In the other town and local centres more limited growth will 
ensure these centres retain a constant market share of both comparison and convenience 
floorspace.
6.3.7 The provision of leisure and entertainment activities (including cultural activities) in town 
centres can also help deliver vibrant and attractive town and local centres. Appropriate town 
centre leisure uses may include cinemas, restaurants, bars/pubs, theatres, health and fitness 
centres and hotels.406.3.8 The boundaries of our town and local centres will be shown in the DMP along with the detailed 
policies for development in those areas. In line with national policy, a sequential approach 
and an assessment of impact will be applied to proposals for retail and leisure uses outside 
identified centres. As there is generally limited space for expansion, more efficient use of land 
and buildings within existing centres will be promoted, with higher density redevelopment 
where appropriate. In the priority regeneration areas, the Council will work with local 
communities and retailers to identify opportunities to remedy deficiencies in local provision. It 
is particularly important that any significant new areas of housing provision should incorporate 
local convenience and service outlets and may require new local centres to be designated.
Policy CS7 : Town and local centres
1.  The multi-purpose role of town and local centres will be maintained and improved. These centres will 
accommodate most of the borough’s new retail, social, community and leisure uses (including culture/
tourism) at a scale  appropriate to their role.
a.  The majority of comparison and convenience retail growth to meet the strategic needs of the 
borough and beyond will be accommodated in Redhill town centre.
b.  Only limited growth will take place in all other centres, with no changes anticipated to the 
functional role of any of these centres from that defined in (2).
2.  The borough’s hierarchy of town centres is as follows:
a.  Primary town centre: Redhill is the prime focus for large-scale leisure, office, cultural and retail 
uses and developments
b.  Town centres: the Council will seek to maintain a balance of uses and development that promote 
both the vitality and viability of each individual centre:
• Reigate town centre
• Horley town centre
• Banstead village centre
c.  Local centres: these provide for more local needs and either offer now, or will be the focus for 
investment in, accessible local services.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including in relation to design, amenity and sustainability, and saved policies from the 
Borough Local Plan
• site allocations in the DMP and on the Policies Map, including in regeneration areas, and sustainable 
urban extensions as required
• Horley North East and North West sector planning permissions
• Area Action Plans for town centres as required
• Partnership working with Surrey County Council, Registered Providers and private sector development 
partners
• New Growth Point funding
• Developer contributions, through Section 106 payments and/or Community Infrastructure Levy, and 
other funding opportunities as appropriate
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals
• compulsory purchase orders where necessary.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• proposals for the gain or loss of retail and leisure floorspace
• changes of use within town and local centres.
Evidence base:
• Sustainability Appraisal
• Retail & Leisure Needs Assessment.
6.4  Area 1: The North Downs
6.4.1 This area lies close to outer London, separated by one of the narrowest portions of 
Metropolitan Green Belt in the South East.
6.4.2 The North Downs area comprises high quality landscape, with an amalgamation of smaller 
settlements, and arterial roads heavily used by commuters to and from London. Lying close 41to outer London, it sits within one of the narrowest portions of Metropolitan Green Belt. The 
green fabric in this area forms an important buffer preventing urban sprawl and the merging 
of settlements, and is recognised as having a high to medium sensitivity to change. Whilst 
A-class roads cross the area, the low-density suburban nature of the built up area means that 
it is relatively poorly served by public transport.
6.4.3 Banstead village provides the focal point for retail and community activity in the North Downs 
area, however there is only limited accessibility from beyond its local catchment, and the 
townscape is sensitive to change. Banstead’s identity as a large village settlement surrounded 
by Green Belt is important to protect.
6.4.4 Preston is a small suburb within the built up area. It is one of the Council’s priority areas for 
regeneration, and it is committed to working with partners (including Surrey County Council 
and Raven Housing Trust) and local people to bring about comprehensive physical and social 
renewal. The regeneration will help tackle historic deprivation and create a more sustainable 
community. In terms of its existing character Preston is recognised as having low sensitivity to 
change.
Figure 10 : The North Downs
 
Development proposed
6.4.5 Housing in the urban area: Banstead village is a small centre serving mostly local needs 
with moderate public transport accessibility. As a result of its constrained nature and limited 
accessibility there are only a limited number of development opportunities in and around the 
village. Some suburban settlements, particularly in the north west of the area, have reasonable 
accessibility and provide opportunities for residential intensification which will come forward 
as windfall sites. Most other settlements in the area have fewer services and lower transport 
accessibility and generally have low potential for accommodating high levels of growth. 
Collectively, the settlements (including Banstead) will provide for at least 930 residential units 42for the period 2012-2027. Housing will primarily be for families and delivered on smaller sites 
within the urban area. Specific sites identified by the Council will be allocated through the DMP  
and development density and type will be informed by local character and need.
6.4.6 Employment: This area has limited employment provision, focused at Waterhouse Lane and 
Pitwood Park and a small number of single owner office sites in spacious grounds. No major 
new employment development is planned for this area, although Waterhouse Lane and 
Pitwood Park both show some potential for intensification subject to the preservation of the 
character of surrounding areas. The DMP will confirm employment land designations for this 
area. For monitoring purposes, a target of up to 2,000sqm additional provision over the plan 
period has been identified for Area 1.
6.4.7 Retail: Banstead provides for the local shopping needs of the area and is one of the four 
town centre locations in the borough. There is a need over the life of this Strategy for minor 
expansion of the convenience and comparison floorspace for Banstead village centre. Retail 
provision will be reviewed regularly over the plan period to ensure that the centre maintains 
its position in the retail hierarchy and fulfils its role as the principal town centre location for the 
area.
6.4.8 Regeneration: Preston is the focus for regeneration in this area. As a designated regeneration 
area, a variety of social, economic and environmental improvements will be made. Working 
with Raven Housing Trust and Surrey County Council, an estimated 330 housing units will be 
delivered by 2022, along with improved community and leisure facilities, enhancements to the 
public realm and improved accessibility.
6.4.9 Future expansion potential: In this area, the Green Belt forms an important strategic gap 
between the outer suburbs of London and the towns and settlements beyond. It will be 
important that the protection offered by the Green Belt against sprawl and settlements merging 
is maintained. It is therefore not anticipated that this area will experience urban expansion 
beyond small-scale re-use and consolidation of sites during the life of the plan.
6.4.10 Infrastructure: Infrastructure requirements in this area will generally be met by improving 
existing infrastructure and ensuring that development is directed to locations that are already 
well served by existing services or those that can be upgraded. Traffic congestion will be 
addressed through the improvement of alternative transport options to reduce the need to use 
the car. The regeneration of Preston requires the improvement of infrastructure to meet the 
needs of the existing residents and new infrastructure to meet the needs of new development. 
Comprehensive redevelopment in the Preston regeneration area will benefit not only the local 
community, but also provide for the wider infrastructure needs (for example, in terms of leisure/
recreation) of residents across the North Downs area.43

6.5  Area 2: Wealden Greensand Ridge
6.5.1 As historic centres, and the largest of the built-up areas in the borough, Reigate and Redhill 
are relatively sustainable locations for growth and will continue to be a focus for growth in the 
future.
6.5.2 The Wealden Greensand Ridge is the most heavily urbanised area in the borough, containing 
the major settlement areas of Redhill and Reigate - two adjoining but distinct towns which 
together operate as the economic and transport hub of the borough. The two towns are the 
focus for retailing and community facilities. They are relatively sustainable locations, however 
have very different characteristics and functions. Area 2 will continue to be a focus for growth 
and investment in the future, with the Redhill area in particular being the location for additional 
housing, employment, retail, leisure and cultural development, including within Redhill town 
centre and the Merstham Estate.
6.5.3 The large areas of suburban development to the north, west and south adjoin land that is 
protected through landscape designations (including the Surrey Hills AONB, which provides a 
dramatic backdrop to the north of the towns) or forms part of an ‘urban fringe’  including heaths 
and common land. The landscape to the west and south of Area 2 is identified as having 
a high sensitivity to change, whilst the area to the east of Redhill has a lower sensitivity to 
change.
Figure 11 : Area 2 - Wealden Greensand Ridge
 
456.6  Area 2a: Redhill
6.6.1 Redhill is the borough’s largest town. It is a primary shopping centre and major site for 
employment with excellent road and rail links north-south and east-west including the A25/A23 
and the London to Brighton and Reading to Gatwick lines. The unique combination of rail and 
bus services and connections to the national trunk road and motorway networks make Redhill 
one of the most accessible locations in the region, providing relatively easy access to both 
Central London and Gatwick Airport.
6.6.2 The Council’s townscape analysis shows that the centre of Redhill has a relatively low 
sensitivity to growth and high capacity for change. The evidence also shows that Redhill is the 
borough’s most accessible location by public transport. This is reflected in the Council’s efforts 
to regenerate the town centre to reflect its primary centre status and take advantage of its 
excellent transport links.
6.6.3 Regeneration proposals for Redhill town centre will be addressed through the DMP. The 
definition of town centre boundaries and identification of site specific allocations within town 
centres will be set out in the DMP.
Development proposed
6.6.4 Housing in the urban area: Redhill town centre has the potential to provide up to 750 
new housing units between 2012 and 2022. Almost all of these will be high-density units 
associated with opportunity sites in the town. It is anticipated that an additional 580 units 
will be constructed in the built up areas of Area 2a over the Plan period to 2027. These units 
will be delivered either as part of the Holmethorpe ‘Watercolour’ development, as part of the 
Merstham regeneration proposals or through other site allocations in the DMP.
6.6.5 Employment: As the main urban centre in the borough and a centre for significant change, 
Redhill will be a focus for employment development, with the town centre being a key 
location for additional office space of up to 7,000sqm (net) to enhance the role of Redhill as 
a commercial destination. There are also a number of other employment areas in Area 2a 
– these offer some potential for reuse/intensification for other commercial uses and provide 
important complementary employment opportunities for the area. The DMP will confirm 
employment designations in the Area 2a. For monitoring purposes, a target of 12,500sqm 
of employment floorspace has been identified for Area 2a and Area 2b together (excluding 
Redhill town centre).
6.6.6 Retail and leisure: As a primary shopping centre, Redhill caters for both local and borough-
wide needs. The majority of both comparison retail and convenience retail development in 
the borough will be accommodated within Redhill town centre - 15,480sqm and 7,020sqm 
respectively within the current town centre boundary, with potential for an extension to the 
town centre boundary in the longer term, subject to realisation of wider regeneration objectives 
and further testing. The DMP will plan for and allocate sites to provide the identified retail 
floorspace. Retail provision figures will be reviewed regularly to ensure opportunities for 
regeneration within the town centre, and Redhill’s potential as a primary shopping centre for 
the borough and beyond, are realised. To support the development of Redhill’s sub-regional 
role, other complementary uses, such as leisure, need to be delivered. The DMP will therefore 
also set out the amount and type of leisure provision required in the town centre.
6.6.7 Regeneration: Redhill town centre and Merstham have been identified as priority regeneratio n 
areas. The regeneration of Redhill is linked to its status as a centre for significant change 
and its role as a hub with its strong transport connections. The regeneration of Redhill 
will result in population growth alongside employment, retail and cultural development 46in a highly accessible location with a strong economic base. There is the opportunity to 
generate significant jobs and training opportunities to help benefit the local community . The 
development will involve innovative environmental design and public realm improvements 
and other sustainable development initiatives including the potential for renewable energy 
schemes being explored. The regeneration of Merstham - which will include provision of a new 
community hub - will involve working with other organisations and local groups to improve the 
physical environment and tackle social problems.
6.6.8 Infrastructure: Realising regeneration and growth within Redhill town centre will require some 
key improvements to the transport infrastructure, flood attenuation works and relocation of 
essential community facilities to ensure the town centre fulfils its potential. The DMP and IDP 
will plan for, and identify funding sources to deliver, the necessary infrastructure. This will 
include parking provision. In Merstham, regeneration proposals include provision of a new 
community hub, and public realm and accessibility improvements. Across the rest of area 2a, 
infrastructure requirements will generally be met through upon improving existing infrastructure 
and ensuring that development is directed to locations that are already well served by existing 
services or those that can be upgraded. Traffic congestion will be addressed through the 
improvement of alternative transport options to reduce the need to use the car.
6.6.9 Future expansion potential: The area to the East of Redhill, and East of Merstham, has been 
identified as a broad area of search for sustainable urban extensions with capacity for up to 
500-700 new homes. Sites will be allocated through the DMP, which will also establish the 
scale of development and the phasing of individual sites. The detailed phasing of sites will 
take account of the need to provide site-specific mitigation measures. It may also be related to 
the delivery of strategic infrastructure schemes, such as: 
(a) the balanced network highway scheme in Redhill 
(b) the provision of sufficient school capacity (secondary and primary) 
(c) improvements to service provision within Merstham Estate Local Centre. 47

6.7  Area 2b: Reigate and the remainder of Area 2
6.7.1 The rest of Area 2 includes the town of Reigate and the countryside area surrounding the 
Reigate-Redhill built up area. Reigate/Redhill occupies a continuous urban area: however, the 
centre of Reigate has a distinctly different character to that of Redhill, which has been shaped 
by its history. The town’s history can be read through its historic buildings such as the old Town 
Hall in the High Street, the Castle Ruins in the Castle Grounds and The Priory in Priory Park.
6.7.2 The rest of the urban area is a diverse mix of character types. The suburbs that make up 
Reigate and blend into Redhill are dissected by parks and commons, which form the green 
fabric, weaving through the urban area and linking it to the countryside beyond.
6.7.3 The Council’s townscape analysis shows that the centre of Reigate has a high sensitivity to 
growth and low capacity for change. The evidence also shows that the central area of Reigate 
has good accessibility by public transport. The rest of the urban areas in Area 2 and the rural 
areas have moderate to low accessibility by public transport.
Development proposed
6.7.4 Housing in the urban area: Reigate and the remainder of Area 2 will provide for at least 280 
new housing units within the urban area between 2012 and 2027. This new housing will 
be delivered at densities that reflect local character and accessibility . Reigate town centre, 
although identified as a sustainable location, is highly constrained by its designation as a 
conservation area, so has only limited development potential.
6.7.5 Employment: Reigate is a strategically important employment location in the borough 
particularly for office uses. There is some scope within Reigate town centre for intensification 
of office uses, subject to the constraints of the conservation area designation. Elsewhere in 
the remainder of Area 2 there is a small amount of employment land, including the Albert Road 
North Industrial Estate, which makes an important contribution to the supply of employment 
land within this area, but which has only limited scope for intensification for commercial uses. 
The DMP will confirm employment land designations for this area. For monitoring purposes, 
a target of 12,500sqm of employment floorspace has been identified for Area 2a and Area 2b 
together (excluding Redhill town centre).
6.7.6 Retail: As a town centre location, Reigate caters for local needs and some borough-
wide needs. It is a pleasant and unique town centre that has been shaped by its historic 
buildings and future growth will be limited by its conservation area designation. The retail 
area is characterised by small units and there is limited potential for retail growth, or for the 
amalgamation of units (due to the conservation area designation). Therefore, Reigate will 
continue to serve as a location for small specialist shops. The retail offer is complemented 50by the presence of Priory Park, and the large number of offices that provide the opportunity 
for shared trips from workers or visitors to these locations. The majority of convenience retail 
floorspace will be delivered in Redhill.
6.7.7 Regeneration: The regeneration of Priory Park was completed in 2008 and is now an 
established focal point for the area. Further opportunities for linkages to and from Priory Park 
will be identified through the Green Infrastructure Strategy.
6.7.8 Infrastructure: Infrastructure requirements in this area will generally be met by improving 
existing infrastructure and ensuring that development is directed to locations that are already 
well served by existing services or those that can be upgraded. Traffic congestion will be 
addressed through the improvement of alternative transport options to reduce the need to use 
the car.
6.7.9 Future expansion potential: The area to the South and South West of Reigate has been 
identified as a broad area of search for sustainable urban extensions with capacity for up to 
500-700 new homes. Sites will be allocated through the DMP, which will also establish the 
scale of development and the phasing of individual sites. The detailed phasing of sites will 
take account of the need to provide site-specific mitigation measures. It may also be related to 
the delivery of strategic infrastructure schemes.51

6.8  Area 3: The Low Weald
6.8.1 This area is dominated by flat open countryside, within which sits the separate town of Horley . 
Horley is physically and economically related to Gatwick Airport and sits at the centre of the 
Gatwick Diamond.
6.8.2 The predominantly flat area of the Low Weald sits to the south of the North Downs. The green 
fabric in the area offers expansive views due to the low-lying topography: overall, landscape 
sensitivity is medium-high. Horley is the dominant town in the area, located in the south, 
immediately adjacent to Gatwick Airport (and physically and economically related to it) and at 
the centre of the Gatwick Diamond area. There are excellent communication links across the 
area along the A23 and A217 corridors and the London-Brighton rail corridor. The Salfords 
industrial area is located on the A23 just north of Horley and is a significant employment area 
for the borough.
6.8.3 Horley town centre is identified as a regeneration area, improvement within which will 
complement and support the two new neighbourhoods being developed to the north of the 
town. Horley has already seen significant investment and this will continue as the growth and 
regeneration proposals progress.
Figure 12 : The Low Weald
 
53Development proposed
6.8.4 Housing in the urban area: Horley will provide for at least 2,440 new housing units in the urban 
area between 2012 and 2027. The majority of this development will be in the two planned new 
neighbourhoods to the north east and north west of the town.
6.8.5 Employment: There are two distinct employment sub-areas within Area 3: the Salfords 
industrial areas, which provide a range of mostly larger light industrial and warehousing space, 
and the Horley areas, which provide smaller units accommodating a range of uses. The DMP 
will confirm employment land designations for this area, with Salfords and Horley remaining a 
key focal point for employment uses within the borough and the wider Gatwick Diamond area. 
For monitoring purposes, a target of 24,000sqm of employment floorspace has been identified 
for Area 3.
6.8.6 Retail: Horley town centre is the focal point for retailing in this area and acts as a local 
convenience shopping centre. Studies indicate there is a need over the life of the Strategy 
to ensure that the quality of the retail offer is enhanced to meet the shopping needs of the 
growing catchment population. Some additional A1 and A3 floorspace will be required to 
support the regeneration of the town centre and prevent further out-of-town development and 
this will be secured through the redevelopment of a number of key town centre sites; however, 
significant levels of additional retail space are not planned at this time.
6.8.7 Regeneration: The Council has designated Horley town centre as a priority regeneration 
area. Due to the scale of planned residential growth in the two new neighbourhoods a 
comprehensive approach to delivery of associated infrastructure and the regeneration of the 
town centre will be taken.
6.8.8 Infrastructure: There is a comprehensive plan to provide new infrastructure to meet the needs 
of the development in the planned new neighbourhoods in the North East and North West 
sectors. Associated with this development, the accessibility to - and service provision within 
- Horley town centre is being enhanced. Away from these areas, infrastructure requirements 
will generally be met through improving existing infrastructure and ensuring that development 
is directed to locations that are already well served by existing services or those that can 
be upgraded. Traffic congestion will be addressed through the improvement of alternative 
transport options to reduce the need to use the car.
6.8.9 Future expansion potential: The opportunity for some small scale sustainable urban 
extensions adjoining the Horley urban area has been identified. Development in this location 
will only be acceptable on sites allocated through the DMP, which will also establish the 
scale of development and phasing of individual sites. The detailed phasing of sites will take 
account of the need to provide site specific mitigation measures. It may also be related to the 
delivery of strategic infrastructure schemes, and may need to take account of any reliance on 
infrastructure being delivered as part of the North East and North West sectors.54

6.9  Gatwick Airport
6.9.1 Airport development: Gatwick Airport is a single runway, two terminal airport. The airport has 
ambitious plans for growth and development, utilising the existing runway and terminals, to 
support up to 45 million passengers by 2021. The Council will work with partners across the 
Gatwick Diamond area, through the Gatwick Diamond Initiative, to encourage sustainable 
economic growth to support this expansion. This will include supporting Gatwick as an 
economic and transport hub, and seeking to improve access to and from the airport by a range 
of modes of transport.
6.9.2 The Council will also work with adjoining local authorities to minimise the environmental impact 
of existing development at the airport and actively seek to ensure that the environmental 
effects of expansion proposals (within agreed limits) are minimised, and where necessary 
mitigated, and that wherever possible additional environmental benefits are secured. 
6.9.3 Aerodrome Safeguarding: Applications for development within identified safeguarded areas 
will be subject to consultation with the airport operator to ensure that the operational integrity 
and safety of the airport are not compromised.
6.9.4 This Core Strategy is based upon the airport functioning within the legal limits defined by the 
Gatwick Airport legal agreement (that is, without additional runway development before 2019). 
Any growth of the airport beyond that allowed in the legal agreement would require an early 
review of our policies and – given the possible impact on the borough - potentially our overall 
spatial strategy.
Policy CS9 : Gatwick Airport
The Council will support the development of Gatwick Airport, within the existing airport boundary and 
existing legal limits, including the development of facilities that contribute to the safe and efficient operation 
of the airport.
This policy will be implemented through:
• Joint working with adjoining authorities and participation in the Gatwick Diamond Initiative and 
continued engagement with the airport.
• Consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals, including consultation with 
Gatwick Airport Ltd as appropriate.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include: 
• Consultations on strategic and operational matters related to the airport
Evidence base:
• Sustainability Appraisal.
• Gatwick Diamond Local Strategic Statement.
• Gatwick Airport Masterplan.57
Cross cutting policies7
The Council is committed to ensuring that development will create places and 
spaces that are well designed and meet the needs of today and tomorrow, but not 
at the expense of the future.
Sustainable development
7.1.1 Underpinning this Core Strategy is a commitment by the Council to ensure that 
future development in the borough is achieved in a sustainable way – that it delivers 
prosperous and self-reliant communities whilst ensuring that the borough remains 
attractive, accessible and well-maintained.
7.1.2 In order for development proposals to be considered sustainable, certain criteria will 
need to be met. These criteria will help ensure that new development creates spaces 
and places that are well designed in practical and aesthetic terms and meet the 
needs of today and also address the needs of future generations.
7.1.3 New development should contribute to:
(a) Mitigation against - and adaptation to - the impacts of climate change.
(b) The creation of stronger communities.
(c) Sustained economic growth and prosperity.
(d) Environmental protection and successful integration of the built and green fabric.
7.1.4 There is a great deal of international, national and regional policy on sustainable 
development. This has informed our local policy to ensure that sustainable 
development is enshrined through all new development in the borough. Our policy will 
help achieve a range of social, economic and environmental objectives, including:
(a) Securing the efficient use of natural resources, including water, energy and land.
(b) Reducing congestion and the need to travel.
(c) Reducing pollution.
(d) Minimising the generation of waste products.
(e) Reducing flood risk.
7.1.5 Climate change: Climate change poses a serious threat to the way we live and work. 
Past and present global greenhouse gas emissions mean that climatic changes 
are inevitable. Climate change modelling14 includes a range of future scenarios - all 
modelling for the South East shows an increase in summer and winter temperatures, 
with even the lowest emissions scenario showing an average daily maximum 
temperature rise of 2.2oC by 2020 and 3.5oC by 2050. Precipitation is predicted to 
decrease during the summer months and increase in winter, with more extreme 
weather patterns also being likely.
7.1.6 Delivering development in a sustainable way will help ensure that both existing 
communities and new developments contribute to addressing the causes of climate 
change (for example by contributing to a reduction in carbon emissions) and ensuring 
the borough adapts to the impacts of climate change. This will include through the 
14 UK Climate projections 200958design and location of development, construction methods and the generation of renewable 
energy (further guidance on which is provided in policy CS11). When determining planning 
applications, the Council will want to ensure that every effort has been taken to ‘design in’ 
sustainable development. Site allocations and proposals for development will be assessed 
against the criteria set out in this policy. Planning applications will need to show how the 
proposed development has been formulated taking into consideration the criteria and 
demonstrating how they have been met.
7.1.7 Making the best use of land: The borough contains many areas that are appropriately 
developed at a relatively low density, as well as areas where there is the opportunity to 
develop at higher densities to make better use of previously developed land and existing 
infrastructure. To respect the character of existing built-up areas, and to promote regeneration 
where appropriate, policy criteria to guide development densities, and/or area or site specific 
densities, will be developed in the DMP, along with policy relating to the development of 
garden land. This will ensure that the most efficient use is made of previously developed land 
but will also take account of character, infrastructure capacity or potential, and accessibility to 
and from jobs and services. Our spatial strategy, through policy CS6, prioritises development 
sites within the urban area, particularly in the most sustainable locations, however recognises 
that in the longer term, some release of sites beyond the current urban area for development 
may be required. The allocation of such sites will be guided by the sustainability criteria set out 
in this policy and policy CS6.
7.1.8 Flood risk: A Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) has been carried out to support the 
Core Strategy, which has identified those areas of borough most at risk of flooding and where 
development should be avoided.
7.1.9 The Sequential Test has been carried out for the areas identified as locations for growth in 
section 6. This demonstrates that where these locations fall outside Flood Zone 1 there are 
no reasonably available locations for growth in areas with a lower probability of flooding that 
would be appropriate to accommodate the proposed level of growth.
7.1.10 Redhill: Development sites within Redhill town centre will be allocated through the DMP. A 
flood risk assessment has been carried out for the town centre and the Sequential Test has 
been applied to all of the proposed development sites in this area. This has concluded that 
it would not be possible to locate the development proposed for these sites in areas at lower 
risk of flooding. For sites in Redhill town centre where the Exception Test is required it has 
been demonstrated that the proposed development would provide wider sustainability benefits 
to the community that outweigh the flood risk, owing to the regeneration benefits arising 
from the development. It has therefore been demonstrated that the first two requirements 
of the Exception Test has been met. The remaining requirement of the Exception Test is to 
demonstrate that the development will be safe, without increasing flood risk elsewhere and 
where possible would reduce flood risk overall. Developers will be required to meet this 
requirement through the application of policies in the DMP.
7.1.11 Rest of the borough: The Sequential Test, and where necessary, the Exception Test will 
be applied to all sites to be allocated in the DMP, in respect of fluvial flooding. A sequential 
approach will also be applied to ensure that land for development is directed to areas 
at least risk of flooding from other sources such as surface water flooding and reservoir 
failure. Development on unallocated sites will be required by policies of the DMP to meet 
the sequential test and where necessary the Exception Test and to take account of the risk 
of flooding from all sources. In line with the NPPF, the Council will require development 
proposals to be accompanied by necessary flood risk assessments and design measures, 
including use of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS).59
Policy CS10 : Sustainable development
Development will:
1.  Make efficient use of land, giving priority to previously developed land and buildings within the built-
up areas.
2.  Be at an appropriate density, taking account of and respecting the character of the local area and 
levels of accessibility and services.
3.  Contribute to the creation of neighbourhoods which are supported by effective services, infrastructure 
and transport options and which are designed to be safe, secure and socially inclusive.
4.  Protect and enhance the green fabric, and respect and contribute to the borough’s green 
infrastructure network.
5.  Respect the ecological and cultural heritage of the borough including the historic environment.
6.  Minimise the need to travel, whilst increasing opportunities to walk, cycle or use public transport, 
including as part of the green infrastructure network.
7.  Minimise the use of natural resources and contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions by re-using 
existing resources, maximising energy efficiency, minimising water use, and reducing the production 
of waste, including through sustainable construction methods. Encourage renewable energy/fuel 
production whilst ensuring that adverse impacts are addressed, including on landscape, wildlife, 
heritage assets and amenity.
8.  Be designed to minimise pollution, including air, noise and light, and to safeguard water quality.
9.  Be designed reflecting the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change (for example higher 
temperatures, increased flooding, increased pressure on water resources, impacts on ecology and 
built heritage and impacts on ground conditions).
10.  Be located to minimise flood risk, through the application of the Sequential Test and where necessary 
the Exception Test, taking account of all sources of  flooding including fluvial, surface water, sewer 
and pluvial flooding, and reservoir failure, and manage flood risk through the use of SuDS and flood  
resistant/resilient design features, and where necessary provide floodplain compensation.
The criteria within this policy, along with policy CS6, will guide the allocation of sites through the DMP.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including policies on design and amenity.
• Use of the SFRA to inform site allocations, and flood risk assessments for specific development 
proposals.
• Green Infrastructure Strategy.
• Design and Parking SPD.
• Sustainability self-assessment.
• Consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• The reuse of previously developed land and the efficient use of sites.
• Development within areas of flood risk
• Monitoring indicators associated with policy CS11.
Evidence base:
• Sustainability Appraisal
• Landscape and Townscape Character Assessment
• Strategic Flood Risk Assessment7.1.12 Surrey County Council is the Lead Local Flood Authority for Surrey. The County Council 
has the lead role in managing flood risk from surface water, groundwater and ordinary 
watercourses across the county and will also be the consenting body for land drainage and 
sustainable drainage works. The Environment Agency provides the overall strategic overview 
role in flood risk management with specific responsibility for fluvial and tidal flooding.607.2  Sustainable construction
7.2.1 The UK aims to reduce carbon emissions by 80 million tonnes by 2020, 40 million tonnes of 
which need to be cut from emissions from residential development. More locally, the Surrey 
Climate Change Partnership has set out the ambition for the county to become one of the 
lowest carbon areas in the UK, and is aiming for a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 
(compared to a 2005 baseline). For Reigate & Banstead, this equates to a carbon saving of 
339 kilotonnes per year.
7.2.2 In order to achieve these demanding national and local carbon emissions reduction targets, 
new development in the borough needs to play its part, through meeting high standards of 
design and construction. Technological development and commercialisation is moving rapidly: 
at the same time national standards, through Building Regulations, are becoming tighter. 
Our policy approach therefore recognises that minimum requirements will increase over the 
plan period; however as a starting point it expects new housing to meet Code for Sustainable 
Homes Level 4.
7.2.3 The Code is a national standard for the sustainable design and construction of new homes, 
which aims to reduce carbon emissions and create homes that are more sustainable. Code 
levels are achieved through a combination of (i) meeting mandatory elements and (ii) earning 
credits in relation to other ‘tradeable’ sustainability elements. 
7.2.4 The Council may require through the DMP, or encourage through supplementary guidance, 
minimum standards for some ‘tradeable’ Code elements (in certain locations or in relation 
to particular types of housing) to meet the overall Code Level 4 requirement. In instances 
where a higher number of credits on some tradeable elements is required to mitigate against 
identified sustainability issues, this will be balanced by an equivalent reduction in the number 
of credits expected from other tradeable elements.
7.2.5 National policy requires that local authorities have a positive strategy to promote energy from 
low carbon sources and identify such opportunities. It is recognised that the common, least-
cost approach to achieving the mandatory Code Level 4 emission rate standard is through the 
further improvement in fabric standard, combined with technologies installed at the dwelling 
scale. However, the achievement of zero-carbon targets, when introduced in 2016, is likely to 
see biomass-based community energy strategies tending to be more cost effective, particularly 
in larger-scale, higher density development scenarios.
7.2.6 The Government has stated its intention to wind down the Code for Sustainable Homes 
and replace it with nationally described standards and/or revised Building Regulations. As 
appropriate, the Council may introduce national standards (justified by local evidence of 
need and viability if required) through the DMP or other DPD. This would then supersede the 
requirements of Policy CS11 in relation to the Code.
7.2.7 Policy CS11 provides a local context to national policy requirements by giving strategic 
direction to enable the opportunities for decentralised and renewable or low carbon energy 
to be fully investigated. DECC’s National Heat Density Maps will be used to identify areas 
of significant heat density exceeding the current widely accepted industry threshold of 
3,000KW/Km2 where further investigation will be expected.  This will inform joint working with 
developers and other partners to ensure that both cost and environmental benefits can be 
captured.
7.2.8 For strategic development proposals (or development proposals which, cumulatively, 
contribute to strategic development), decentralised energy networks for cooling, heating 
and power can make a significant contribution to the reduction of carbon emissions and can 61
Policy CS11 : Sustainable construction
1.  The Council will expect new development to be constructed to the following  standards (taking into 
account the overall viability of the proposed development at the time the application is made):
a.  New housing: to a minimum of Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4, or future nationally 
described standards (justified by local evidence if required). To achieve  Level 4, the Council may 
require (through the DMP) or encourage (through supplementary guidance) minimum standards 
for some tradeable Code elements to be provided in particular locations or for particular types of 
housing development. 
b.  Relevant non-residential development of new or replacement buildings, or extensions to existing 
structures: to a minimum of BREEAM ‘very good’.
2.  The Council will work with developers and other partners to encourage and  promote the 
development of decentralised and renewable or low carbon energy  (including combined heat and 
power) as a means to help future development meet zero-carbon standards affordably. 
a.  Where a major development is planned that generates, is within, or is adjacent to an area of 
significant heat density, it will be expected that the potential to create, or connect to, a district 
heating network is fully investigated. Such developments will be identified in the DMP  where 
possible.
b.  Where a district heat network exists or is planned, or where there is potential to utilise waste 
heat, the Council may require - where feasible and viable - development in these areas to be 
designed to facilitate its use and connect to it.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including in relation to provision of decentralised energy networks in Redhill.
• Allowable Solutions framework/Community Energy Fund.
• Design and Parking SPD.
• Sustainability self-assessment.
• Consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• Developments achieving the required standards of Code for Sustainable Homes and BREEAM.
Evidence base:
• Sustainability Appraisal
7.3  Infrastructure delivery
7.3.1 Delivering development sustainably is a main theme of the Core Strategy. It is essential that 
new development where possible avoids, or otherwise mitigates, its own adverse effects, and 
in the process secures the necessary infrastructure benefits for our existing wider communities 
who should not suffer the burden of providing for new development.
7.3.2 Given the fragmented pattern of development in the borough, the best way to provide for the 
service and infrastructure needs of new development is by improving efficiency – through a 
number of small scale improvements to increase the capacity of existing infrastructure – rather 
than providing major new pieces of infrastructure.utilise local resources such as wood fuel. The Council will expect this option to be explored 
in development proposals that will create a high level of demand for heat and power. In 
addition, to help ensure that opportunities for decentralised energy networks are maximised, 
proposals for non-strategic major development may be required to connect to existing or future 
decentralised energy networks. 
7.2.9 Policy CS11 will be operated with sensitivity to the viability and feasibility of development. If 
it is clearly demonstrated that a development would be unviable due to the application of this 
policy, the Council will negotiate a viable solution.
7.2.10 Further guidance on how developers can achieve lower carbon development will be provided 
through the DMP and/or supplementary guidance. This will include information about both on-
site measures and off-site allowable solutions.627.3.3 Development will be delivered at levels, and in locations and forms, that are sustainable and 
either:
(a) at a rate that reflects the adequacy of infrastructure and services to meet the needs of the 
development; or
(b) alongside new or upgraded infrastructure and services, which could include additions 
or improvements to public infrastructure and services such as transport, water (water 
supply, water treatment and flood management), energy, telecommunications/electronic 
communications, utilities, health and social care, education, open space, sports and 
recreational facilities.
7.3.4 Investment by the private sector will be necessary in order to implement the Core Strategy 
and to help deliver infrastructure upgrades to serve new developments, including in relation 
to transport and water and sewerage infrastructure. Developers will therefore be expected to 
work with the Council and infrastructure providers to:
(a) ensure that there is adequate infrastructure capacity both on and off site to accommodate 
the impacts of growth
(b) to secure delivery of the necessary infrastructure in a timely manner to serve and support 
new development; and 
(c) phase development as necessary to align with infrastructure delivery.
 Policies in the DMP will set out more detailed requirements in relation to the provision of new 
or upgraded infrastructure to support new development. 
7.3.5 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan: The Council has developed an Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan (IDP) alongside the Core Strategy. The IDP has been compiled with input from service 
providers and delivery agencies, and identifies the infrastructure that must be delivered to 
accompany the planned levels of growth. The Council will regularly monitor and update the 
IDP over the life of the Core Strategy, including by monitoring development and liaising with 
key infrastructure providers. The IDP will also help inform the development of the Council’s 
Community Infrastructure Levy Charging Schedule.
7.3.6 Funding: In the past, where appropriate, developer contributions towards infrastructure have 
been secured through Section 106 undertakings. In the future, the infrastructure required 
to deliver the Core Strategy will be funded in different ways, depending on the location 
of development and the specific circumstances of the scheme. The main mechanism for 
collecting developer contributions will be the CIL, which will secure contributions from 
developers to support the delivery of new development. The charging rate will be set at a 
level which achieves an appropriate balance between securing investment for necessary 
infrastructure and ensuring that the economic effect of imposing CIL does not put the overall 
development of the borough at risk. Section 106 contributions will still be used to secure site 
specific mitigation measures and provision of affordable housing.
7.3.7 Green Infrastructure (GI): A key local feature of our infrastructure requirements is the green 
infrastructure network which will be established in the borough linking existing, locally 
distinctive large areas of green space. The GI network will comprise linked, multi-functional, 
green spaces protecting and enhancing opportunities for biodiversity, recreation and general 
amenity. The Council will work in partnership with public, private and voluntary sectors to 
develop and maintain a GI Strategy that seeks to address:
 (a) nature conservation
(b) biodiversity
(c) climate change (adaptation and mitigation)
(d) access to nature63
Policy CS12 : Infrastructure delivery
The Council will:
1.  Secure contributions from new development towards the infrastructure required to meet the needs 
created by the new development.
2.  Require infrastructure to be provided either ahead of, or alongside, the delivery of new development.
3.  Encourage proposals that would:
a.  increase the range, improve the quality, or enhance the accessibility, of  community and leisure 
(including sport, recreation, and cultural) facilities in the borough, and/or 
b.  provide for a mix of compatible community services on a single site, including through 
consolidation to result in economies of scale or innovative forms of service provision.
4.  Secure green infrastructure in line with its Green Infrastructure Strategy to  include provision of new 
open space and or improvements to existing open spaces, the provision of and/or improvements to 
links between open space, and measures to link new and existing developments with open space.
5.  Resist the loss of existing leisure and community facilities (including sport, recreation and cultural) 
and open spaces, unless it can be demonstrated that:
a.  the existing use is surplus to requirements, or 
b.  equivalent or better provision in terms of quantity and quality, or some wider community benefits, 
will be made in a suitable location.
6.  Seek provision and maintenance of leisure and community facilities and open spaces from new 
development.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including in relation to community and leisure uses and green infrastructure.
• Green Infrastructure Strategy.
• Joint working with partners and infrastructure providers, including to update the Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan and through the Public Sector Board.
• Developer contributions through Section 106 payments and/or Community Infrastructure Levy.
• Consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• The amount of financial contributions secured and collected and spending of these contributions.
• The delivery of IDP projects in line with established timescales.
Evidence base:
• Infrastructure Delivery Plan
• PPG17 Open Space, Sport and Recreation Assessment
7.4  Housing delivery
7.4.1 The Council is planning for the provision of a total of at least 6,900 homes over the plan period 
from 2012-2027, equivalent to an annual average provision of 460 homes per year. 
7.4.2 This figure takes into account the level of provision identified for the borough through the (now  
revoked) South East Plan.(e) accessibility
(f) health and well-being.
7.3.8 Land designated as Urban Open Land in the Reigate & Banstead Borough Local Plan 
2005 will be reviewed to inform the development of the DMP and Policies Map, and the 
development of the GI Strategy, to ensure that open spaces continue to be given an 
appropriate level of protection in recognition of their public value for visual amenity, sports and 
recreation. The review should give consideration to the extent to which sites:
(a) contribute to landscape and townscape character
(b) provide accessible open space, sport and recreation facilities
(c) address deficiencies in open space provision; and
(d) provide wider benefits including, but not limited to, biodiversity conservation and flood 
management.647.4.3 It is also based on an analysis of the levels of need and demand for housing in the borough, 
an assessment of housing land supply and consideration of the social, economic and 
environmental implications of housing growth. There is considerable pressure for housing 
across the South East, including in Surrey and the Gatwick Diamond area. At the same 
time, the borough is subject to high levels of constraint (including landscape and nature 
conservation designations, areas of flood risk, and the Green Belt). This amount of housing 
recognises the need to provide homes for local people and to support economic growth. It 
provides for internally-generated natural change and some continuing net in-migration to 
the borough which would contribute towards meeting unmet needs of other local authorities 
including those within the wider East Surrey and North West Sussex HMAs. The level of 
growth is broadly in line with longer term trends. But it also takes account of the importance 
of delivering existing priorities, ensuring that – through regeneration – our communities are 
in the best position to support future growth in a sustainable manner, and respecting and 
safeguarding designated areas and local character.
7.4.4 The DMP will identify and allocate sufficient land to ensure that there is a continued supply of 
housing sites to deliver this figure in line with national guidance. This process will reflect the 
order of priority set out in policy CS6. A housing trajectory will be prepared annually indicating 
delivery against local policy and the planned phasing and distribution of future housing 
provision.
7.4.5 Housing provision will be focused within the existing urban area, in particular to deliver the 
priorities for regeneration and growth identified in policy CS6. Our evidence indicates that we 
can deliver at least 5,800 homes within the urban area over the plan period. Although other 
unanticipated urban opportunities may come forward, current housing land supply evidence 
indicates that it will not be possible to accommodate the total level of planned housing growth 
within the existing urban area. Broad areas of search for sustainable urban extensions to 
accommodate the additional housing required to deliver the housing target (up to 1,600 
homes) have therefore been identified and are set out in policy CS6. Where these broad areas 
of search are within areas of Green Belt, land will only be removed from the Green Belt if 
exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated in accordance with policy CS3.
7.4.6 The release of sites for sustainable urban extensions will be triggered if the Council is unable 
to demonstrate a five year land supply, based on the residual annual housing requirement 
calculated over the plan period 2012-2027.
7.4.7 The DMP will take account of site specific factors in allocating and phasing sustainable urban 
extension sites for development. This will include:
(a) the need to provide any mitigation measures to minimise the impact of new development 
on the natural or built environment (for example, flood risk mitigation measures or green 
infrastructure measures)
(b) the need to provide infrastructure to support the new development itself (for example, 
local services/facilities or transport infrastructure improvements).
 In phasing sites for development, the Council will also ensure that relevant strategic 
infrastructure requirements (such as those set out in policy CS8) are in place to meet the 
requirements of the borough’s existing and new population.657.5  Housing needs of the community
7.5.1 The development of sustainable and balanced communities will require future housing 
development to provide a mix of housing tenures, types and sizes to meet the needs of the 
wide range of household types that exist in the borough.
7.5.2 In particular, it is important that we plan to meet the accommodation requirements of families 
and those with priority needs as well as the volume requirements for small units for single and 
couple households. It is also important that we address the need to provide for the current and 
future growth in the number of older people and frail older households across all tenures and 
their related care and support needs through specialist housing developments such as extra 
care housing.
7.5.3 Planning policy will be informed by regular assessment and monitoring of the housing market 
through updates to the Strategic Housing Market Assessment and Council monitoring reports. 
Assessments will consider the supply of homes and compare this to levels of demand to 
identify the need for different tenures and sized properties. This evidence will aid the Council’s 
understanding of the nature and level of housing need and demand for both market and 
affordable housing, and form the basis for guidance in supplementary planning documents 
about the mix of property types and sizes that will be encouraged.
Policy CS13 : Housing delivery
1.  The Council will plan for delivery of at least 6,900 homes between 2012 and 2027, equating to an 
annual average provision of 460 homes per year.
2.  Housing will be delivered as follows:
a.  At least 5,800 homes within existing urban areas, in particular the priority areas for growth and 
regeneration identified in policy CS6
b.  The remainder to be provided in sustainable urban extensions in the locations set out in policy 
CS6. 
3.  The Council will identify and allocate in the DMP the necessary sites to deliver these homes in 
accordance with the policies in the Core Strategy. 
4.  Sites for sustainable urban extensions within the broad areas of search set out in policy CS6 will be 
released when such action is necessary to maintain a five year supply of specific deliverable sites 
(based on the residual annual housing requirement). The phasing of sustainable urban extension sites 
will be set out in the DMP and will take account of strategic infrastructure requirements.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP including in relation to density, access and amenity.
• site allocations in the DMP for housing sites.
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• proposals for - and the delivery of - additional dwellings within the borough
• housing trajectory and five year land supply
Evidence base: 
• Sustainability Appraisal.
• Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment.
• Strategic Housing Market Assessment.
• Housing context technical paper
• Sustainable urban extensions technical paper.66
Policy CS14 : Housing needs of the community
The Council will:
1.  Seek a range of housing types and tenures through the redevelopment of the  existing housing stock or 
new development, including affordable housing, and  resist an undue concentration of any one type of 
dwelling in a location that would cause an imbalance and adversely affect community cohesion.
2.  Require housing developments to contain an appropriate mix of dwelling sizes in accordance with 
assessments of housing need, site size and characteristics.
3.  Encourage the provision of housing for the elderly, and for people with special mobility, accessibility 
and support needs in sustainable locations where appropriate whilst avoiding an undue concentration 
in any location.
4.  Work with partners such as Surrey County Council, Registered Providers and  health providers to 
identify suitable sites for, and secure provision of, specialist housing.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including in relation to the type and number of bedrooms in Redhill town centre
• Affordable Housing SPD, providing details about the type of housing unit and tenure and the number 
of bedrooms for affordable housing provision
• Design and Parking SPD, providing details on the type of market housing being sought across the 
borough, and number of bedrooms
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• the type and size of new dwellings completed within the borough
• proposals for new or expanded elderly and specialist housing.
Evidence base:
• Strategic Housing Market Assessment.
• Surrey Joint Accommodation Strategy.
• Joint Strategic Needs Assessment.
7.6  Affordable housing
7.6.1 Affordable housing is defined as that which includes social rented, intermediate housing, 
and affordable rented housing, provided to eligible households whose needs are not met 
by the market. Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local house prices. 
Affordable housing should include provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible 
households or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.
7.6.2 The high level of house prices in the borough means that many people are unable to afford to 
buy their own property on the open market or rent from the private sector. The level of need 
for affordable housing is considerably higher than it would be possible to deliver, given local 
market conditions and lack of sufficient resources.
7.6.3 The Council will therefore aim to secure affordable housing provision from residential 
development sites at a rate which is viable without unfairly prejudicing the delivery of the 
development, or compromising provision of other necessary supporting infrastructure and 
services. If developments can clearly demonstrate that the rate of affordable housing, or the 
mix of affordable housing being sought, is not financially viable due to site circumstances, 
the Council will negotiate a viable solution. The expectation is that on larger sites affordable 
housing should be delivered on site. However, on smaller sites, where there is less flexibility 
to develop a range of affordable homes and to create sustainable communities, a financial 
contribution will be sought to enable affordable housing to be provided elsewhere in the 
borough (however this does not preclude affordable housing being provided on smaller sites 
as an alternative option). 
7.6.4 The Council aims to enable the provision of 1,500 affordable homes over the plan period; 
equating to an average of 100 homes per year. This is included within the overall housing 
target for the borough. This is a realistic target and has been developed taking account 67of likely levels of housing delivery, although it is recognised that it will not meet the need 
identified in the borough. Within this target, a range of affordable housing types and tenures - 
as envisaged by national policy and that meet local need - will be delivered through a number 
of processes and from a number of sources, not all of which involve the planning system. 
Guidance on the mix of tenure, size and type will be set out in supplementary guidance. The 
latest evidence points to a tenure mix of 40% rented and 60% intermediate housing, and the 
need for a range of unit sizes, from 1 to 4 bedrooms.
7.6.5 Maintaining the existing number of affordable homes in the borough is as important as 
delivering new affordable housing. Where existing affordable housing - or sites previously 
used for affordable housing - are to be redeveloped, the Council will normally expect the 
same number of affordable housing units to be delivered, reflecting current mix and tenure 
requirements. However, the Council is aware that in some circumstances this may not be 
feasible, and that in exceptional circumstances it may be more appropriate to make provision 
on a different site. On that basis, whilst the Council will take as a starting point the premise 
that the same number of affordable housing units should be delivered, it may agree variations 
in overall numbers, tenure, size or location taking account of site specific circumstances (such 
as existing provision and constraints).
7.6.6 In some regeneration areas and future allocated housing sites, there may be the opportunity 
to create a more diverse mix of housing tenures than currently exists to create a stronger and 
more balanced community whilst improving the character, social and economic well-being of 
the area. This may mean varying or relocating the requirement for affordable housing on sites 
in certain regeneration areas: this will need to be balanced against the need to ensure that 
overall borough-wide targets for the provision of affordable housing are achieved. Similarly, 
consideration will be given to maximising opportunities for affordable housing delivery on any 
sustainable urban extensions. Specific requirements for affordable housing on allocated sites 
may be provided through the DMP and Affordable Housing SPD.
Policy CS15 : Affordable housing
1.  Between 2012 and 2027 a minimum of 1,500 gross new units of affordable housing will be secured 
within the borough.
2.  The mix of tenures, including rented, and a mix of sizes and types should reflect the current 
assessment of housing needs. 
3.  The Council will negotiate to achieve affordable housing taking account of the mix of affordable units 
proposed and the overall viability of the proposed development at the time the application is made.
a.  New residential developments comprising 15 or more net dwellings should provide 30 percent of 
housing as affordable
b.  For residential developments of between 10 and 14 net dwellings, a financial contribution broadly 
equivalent to provision of 20 percent affordable housing will be sought, so that affordable housing 
can be provided elsewhere in the borough
c.  For residential developments of 1-9 net dwellings, a financial contribution broadly equivalent 
to provision of 10 percent affordable housing will be sought, so that affordable housing can be 
provided elsewhere in the borough
d.  In some regeneration areas an alternative level of affordable housing provision may be sought to 
achieve a more balanced community and deliver other regeneration initiatives.
4.  On sites being redeveloped where there is existing affordable housing (or sites where the most recent 
use has been affordable housing), as a minimum the same number of affordable homes should be re-
provided, and be consistent with current mix and tenure requirements unless agreed otherwise with the 
Council.687.7  Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople
7.7.1 The Council will seek to ensure that sufficient sites are made available to meet the 
accommodation needs of Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople. In identifying their 
needs, reference will be made to the latest Traveller Accommodation Assessment (2013). 
This identifies a need for 52 pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and 13 plots for Travelling 
Showpeople over the next 15 years. 
7.7.2 A target for pitches and plots will be included within the DMP. In determining the target figure, 
opportunities to allocate sites sufficient to meet the identified need within the urban area and 
countryside beyond the Green Belt will be given priority.
7.7.3 However it is probable - given the need to ensure that sites are suitable, affordable and 
deliverable, and some of the environmental constraints that exist in these areas - that there 
will be a need to consider some limited alterations to Green Belt boundaries to accommodate 
Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites. Exceptional circumstances will need to be 
demonstrated if land is to be taken out of the Green Belt to accommodate sites. 
7.7.4 Whilst the Council is committed to meeting the identified level of need as far as possible, it is  
not able to conclude at this Core Strategy stage whether sites can be allocated to meet the 
full need without compromising the purposes or integrity of the Green Belt. The final target will 
therefore need to be informed not only by capacity within urban areas and countryside beyond 
the Green Belt, but also by the findings of the detailed Green Belt review (see policy CS3). 
7.7.5 As well as identifying pitch and plot targets, the DMP will also allocate the sites needed to 
provide a five year supply of specific and deliverable sites and broad locations for growth in 
years six to ten (based on the final targets).
7.7.6 This Core Strategy policy sets out the criteria which will be used to identify sites and to 
determine planning applications relating to sites not allocated in the DMP.
Policy CS15 : Affordable housing (contd.)
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies and allocations, including for identified regeneration areas
• Affordable Housing SPD, including a model for calculating financial contributions and detail on the 
type, tenure and size of affordable homes
• developer contributions through Section 106 payments
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• target for delivery of additional affordable housing units
• affordable housing provision within regeneration areas.
Evidence base:
• Strategic Housing Market Assessment.
• Affordable Housing Viability Study69
Policy CS16 : Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople
1.  The DMP will identify a local target for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites and make 
provision for a five year supply of specific deliverable sites and broad locations for growth for years six 
to ten. 
2.  A sequential approach will be taken to identifying suitable sites, with possible  sites within the urban 
area being considered first, then all other countryside not within the Green Belt, then sites in the 
Green Belt. Any site considered for allocation must be deliverable (including affordable to its intended 
occupiers) to ensure that needs are met. The lack of any suitable, affordable and deliverable  
sites in the urban area or other countryside not covered by Green Belt could provide the exceptional 
circumstances necessary to justify alterations to Green Belt boundaries to meet a specific identified 
need for a Traveller site.
3.  The following criteria will be used to assess the suitability of sites for allocation in the DMP and any 
planning applications for sites not allocated:
a.  The site can be integrated into the local area and co-exist with the local community
b.  The site has safe access to the highway and has adequate parking and turning areas
c.  The site provides a satisfactory residential environment for its intended occupiers and on-site utility 
services for the number of pitches proposed including space for related business activities where 
applicable
d.  The site is not located in an area of high flood risk, including functional floodplains
e.  There is adequate local infrastructure and access to appropriate healthcare and local schools
f.  The site does not significantly impact on the visual amenity and character of the area or the amenity 
of neighbouring land uses.
4.  Existing authorised sites for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople will be safeguarded from 
development which would preclude their continued occupation by these groups, unless the site is no 
longer required to meet an identified need.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including in relation to access and amenity
• site allocations in the DMP for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople sites
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• proposals for – and the delivery of – additional pitches and plots within the borough and provision of 
five year supply of sites.
Evidence base:
• Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment
• Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment
7.8  Travel options and accessibility
7.8.1 The overall spatial strategy focuses on locating future development in areas of the borough 
that are highly accessible. This will enable us, in the main, to increase the capacity of existing 
transport infrastructure, and reduce the need to rely upon the delivery of significant new 
schemes.
7.8.2 Reigate & Banstead is a major commuter destination (in particular Redhill and Reigate), 
and with Gatwick Airport and London in very close proximity, one third of our residents travel 
outside the borough to work. The borough is divided by the M25, which runs east-west, and 
adjoins the north-south M23/A23 corridor. Busy A-class roads and local roads run throughout 
the borough, as do major rail and bus routes. This complex transport network supports the 
South East’s ‘gateway’ function to the rest of Europe and beyond.
7.8.3 Our strategy in relation to travel and transport can be summarised as:
(a) managing demand
(b) improving the efficiency of the network
(c) improving transport choice (for example, improving pedestrian and cycle links).707.8.4 Transport modelling: The Council has been working closely with Surrey County Council 
to model the impacts of the growth proposed within this Core Strategy. The results of this 
work indicate a number of areas where interventions may be required to safeguard the 
smooth operation of the transport network (further information on which is provided in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan). The Council will continue to work closely with the County Council 
to develop, implement and monitor solutions that improve the efficiency of the transport 
network.
7.8.5 Securing sustainable transport options: Through the planning system, and the Core Strategy, 
we can help secure a range of sustainable travel options and choices to reduce the impact 
and consequence of the significant travel movements that take place within and across 
the borough. This will include working with partners such as Surrey County Council (as the 
Highway Authority) and the Highways Agency, to promote travel options which, amongst 
other things, recognise the importance of – but reduce dependency on – the car, and promote 
alternative transport choices. In accordance with national policy, developments that generate 
significant amounts of movement will be required to provide travel plans and transport 
assessments. The requirement to provide a travel plan will be determined with reference 
to guidance issued by the County Council and the requirement to provide a transport 
assessment will be determined in line with the Department for Transport’s Guidance on 
Transport Assessments’ (2007). The Council’s Green Infrastructure Strategy also has a key 
role to play in promoting sustainable travel choices buy providing pleasant green walking and 
cycling routes to key destinations.
7.8.6 Improving access and accessibility: The planning system can also promote more sustainable 
communities by minimising the need for people to travel to essential services, for example, by:
(a) directing development to accessible areas conveniently located near to the services and 
facilities needed to support communities
(b) coordinating the provision of services and facilities as part of new development, and 
ensuring they are adaptable to change in the local population
(c) promoting better travel choices for existing and new development
(d) by helping improve the vitality and viability of local shopping centres and parades.
7.8.7 As well as joint working to require development proposals to secure improved accessibility 
(including through developer contributions and travel plans), other mechanisms include 
promoting car sharing/ car clubs/car pools and assessing the impact of traffic generated by 
new development by transport assessments/statements where appropriate.
7.8.8 Parking: Reigate & Banstead has one of the highest car ownership rates in the region and 
there is increasing pressure not only on the roads themselves but also for parking in the 
borough. The Council will develop detailed policies in relation to parking in the DMP and 
supplementary guidance. These will set out graduated standards for different areas of the 
borough, to ensure that car parking does not detract from the character of the area and 
encourages sustainable modes of travel, taking into account the accessibility of different 
locations and levels of car ownership. The Council will also work with Surrey County Council 
to investigate, and where appropriate introduce, Residential and Controlled Parking Zones.71
Policy CS17 : Travel options and accessibility
The Council will work with Surrey County Council, the Highways Agency, rail and bus operators, 
neighbouring local authorities and developers to:
1.  Manage demand and reduce the need to travel, by:
a.  Allocating land for development and directing development to accessible locations in the borough
b.  Securing provision of - or easy access to - services, facilities and public transport as part of new 
development.
2.  Improve the efficiency of the transport network, by:
a.  Enhancing public interchange facilities in Redhill and Horley town centres and promoting Redhill/
Reigate as a transport hub
b.  Delivering improvements to the road network to meet all street users’ needs, enhance accessibility 
along key corridors and accommodate the forecast increase in journeys.
3.  Facilitate sustainable transport choices, by:
a.  Improving travel options through enhanced provision for bus, rail, walking,  cycling and bridleways
b.  Promoting walking and cycling as the preferred travel option for shorter journeys
c.  Promoting non-car travel
d.  Requiring the provision of travel plans and transport assessments for proposals which are likely to 
generate significant amounts of movement
e.  Seeking to minimise parking provision in the most sustainable locations, and secure adequate 
parking provision relative to patterns of car ownership elsewhere.
This policy will be implemented through:
• DMP policies, including in relation to sustainable transport routes and travel plans
• Design and Parking SPD, including parking standards and guidance on parking provision
• Green Infrastructure Strategy, including walking and cycling routes
• Surrey County Council’s Local Transport Plan
• partnership working with the Highways Authority, transport infrastructure providers and neighbouring 
authorities
• developer contributions through Section 106 payments and/or Community Infrastructure Levy
• consideration and determination of planning applications and appeals.
Indicators used to monitor this policy will include:
• the location of new development in relation to public transport services
• the delivery of travels plans as applicable
• the delivery of travel and transport projects in line with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan.
Evidence base:
• Surrey Local Transport Plan (3).
• Transport Assessment.
• Redhill Transport Modelling
• Infrastructure Delivery Plan.72
Implementation and monitoring8
The Council has a comprehensive implementation framework that supports 
sustainable growth in the borough.
8.1 The Council has a comprehensive implementation framework to support sustainable 
growth in the borough. This includes the constitutional policy framework (including 
Corporate Plan), dedicated staff, successful joint working relationships and a 
corporate project management system. The Council is also committed to adopting the 
Community Infrastructure Levy.
8.2 The Council has been working with key stakeholders and infrastructure providers to 
ensure that a joined up and plan led approach is taken, and will continue engagement 
throughout the life of the Core Strategy, monitoring delivery and ensuring priorities 
are achieved.
8.3 This will include keeping the evidence base up to date (including assessments 
of projected demand and land supply) and, where appropriate, co-operating with 
neighbouring authorities in relation to agreed strategic priorities.
Implementation
8.4 Priority areas for regeneration and growth: Regeneration initiatives will be 
undertaken in a phased and planned way, coordinated through dedicated Council 
resources, reflecting the need for sustainable development to achieve wider social, 
environmental and economic objectives, the availability of key sites and development 
financing:
(a) the Horley new neighbourhoods will be progressed in line with the existing 
planning permissions and adopted policy and SPD
(b) regeneration in Horley town centre will proceed in line with adopted policy and 
supplementary guidance, which will be updated through the DMP
(c) regeneration in Redhill town centre is being guided by the draft RTCAAP, and 
final proposals - to guide development on key sites within Redhill town centre - 
will be included in the DMP
(d) the Merstham Planning Framework has been prepared to guide physical 
change in Merstham and will be incorporated within the DMP. Regeneration 
activities in Merstham are underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding 
between key partners
(e) the Preston Planning Framework will guide development on public sector land 
in Preston and similarly will be incorporated within the DMP. Regeneration in 
Preston is underpinned by a joint Statement of Intent.
8.5 In the event that regeneration priorities do not progress as anticipated, additional 
management actions to ‘unlock’ regeneration projects will be implemented, which 
may include the use of Council-owned land interests to act as a catalyst for the 
development of sites; consideration of options to address any economic viability 
issues; the use of planning powers such as compulsory purchase orders; and the 
exploration of other funding/forward funding mechanisms. 738.6 Employment and retail development: The effective delivery of employment and retail growth 
is an important part of our overall strategy for the borough. Where monitoring indicates that 
there is a significant gap between identified targets and anticipated land supply over the plan 
period, or a significant shortfall in opportunities that are deliverable in the short term, then 
management and contingency actions will be implemented. These may include the review 
of allocations, consideration of the acceptability of enabling development and/or the use of 
planning powers such as local development orders. 
8.7 Housing development: Performance against the housing trajectory will be regularly monitored, 
and the Council will publish information about its five year land supply annually . If monitoring 
indicates that delivery of allocated sites is not progressing as anticipated, then management 
and contingency actions will be implemented. This may include the consideration of options to 
address any economic viability issues in relation to specific sites. 
8.8 Sustainable urban extension sites will be released for development if the Council is unable 
to demonstrate a five year land supply, based on the residual annual housing requirement 
calculated over the plan period 2012-2027.
8.9 Infrastructure Delivery: Further information about infrastructure delivery is included under 
policies CS8 and CS12. The IDP provides an overview of the infrastructure to be delivered 
over the Core Strategy period, based on information from across the Council and from 
external infrastructure and service providers. It identifies projects, phasing, cost and funding 
mechanisms. The IDP will be regularly updated and reviewed to ensure that our understanding 
of infrastructure requirements remains relevant, responding to local circumstances, changing 
delivery mechanisms and funding regimes. In the event that priority elements of infrastructure 
are not progressing as anticipated, the Council will work closely with partners and landowners 
and may jointly implement management actions and contingency measures. These may 
include considering opportunities to divert financial contributions to aid delivery , or exploring 
alternative funding opportunities.
8.10 Partnership working: Place shaping is the responsibility of local government and all local 
partners in the public, voluntary, community and business sectors. The Council will continue 
to work closely with a number of partners to ensure priorities remain aligned, and to deliver 
the Core Strategy (see figure 13). Additional engagement takes place through the Council’s 
Overview and Scrutiny function, including in relation to housing performance, crime and 
disorder, and other topical areas reflecting local pressures and priorities.

Monitoring
8.11 A fundamental feature of the Local Development Framework is its flexibility to respond quickly 
to changing circumstances through the plan, monitor and implement approach. This allows 
the Council to regularly assess the performance of individual policies and overall progress in 
delivering the objectives of the plan. The result is that the Council is better placed to manage 
the effectiveness of the plan whilst being well placed to consider any policy changes or 
additional actions which may be required to support its successful implementation. Monitoring 
is also an important part of the functioning of certain policies and where trigger mechanisms 
for policy action are required.758.12 The Core Strategy is supported by a series of indicators which provide the basis for monitoring 
- these are available in the accompanying Monitoring Framework15. Indicators broadly fall 
within one of two categories:
(a) significant effects indicators which measure progress against our objectives and 
contextual indicators which provide complementary background
(b) delivery indicators which assess the effectiveness of individual policies.
8.13 For policies where clear outputs are required (such as annual housing delivery), specific 
targets are included within the monitoring framework. For policies and objectives where 
clear outputs are not apparent, performance trends allow the Council to identify whether the 
appropriate direction of travel is being met. In many cases, more detailed indicators will be 
developed for related policies within the DMP.
8.14 These indicators will be reported in a suite of regularly produced, subject-specific monitoring 
documents and summarised in an annual report. The annual report will also provide an 
assessment of the implementation of the Local Development Scheme and progress of 
policies and projects contained in subsequent Local Development Documents. The reports 
will also identify any further action that needs to be taken to address any underperformance, 
unintended consequences and/or amendments to the investment framework, enabling early 
dialogue with relevant delivery partners to avoid obstacles to delivery wherever possible. 
Together, this monitoring information will help the Council determine whether a partial or full 
review of any Local Development Document (or individual policies within a LDD) is needed.
Policy CS18 : Implementation and monitoring
1.  Progress towards the development targets set out in the Core Strategy and the delivery of allocated 
sites will be regularly monitored and reviewed by the Council. 
2.  To secure the timely delivery of development and infrastructure, a range of management actions and/
or contingency measures will be used as part of the on-going monitoring and review process. The 
Council will work with landowners and developers proactively to facilitate the delivery of all allocated 
development sites and other sustainable development opportunities. Measures may include: 
a.  The use of Council’s land interests to act as a catalyst for development
b.  Negotiation on particular sites to overcome specific economic viability issues
c.  Using planning powers such as compulsory purchase orders or local development orders
d.  Facilitating land assembly by assisting with the relocation of existing users
e.  Preparing masterplans or development briefs
f.  Exploring alternative funding mechanisms and/or the potential for enabling development.
Evidence base:
• Monitoring framework
Reviewing the Core Strategy
8.15 The Core Strategy period runs until 2027.
8.16 We have prepared this Core Strategy at a time of substantial change and uncertainty. 
However, the Council is promoting a robust plan-led growth and regeneration programme 
for the borough and is determined to proceed with its vision to ensure a clear and up-to-date 
statutory framework is in place to guide development and provide the certainty needed for the 
Council and other key partners to positively shape, and add value to, our communities.
8.17 Review of the Core Strategy will commence within 5 years of its adoption date to ensure that 
the overall spatial strategy and accompanying policies remain up to date and robust.
