NEW LOCAL PLAN
Pl�n��n� f�� Gr�wt � �n� Ch�n��
WHAT IS A LOCAL PLAN?
Local Plans are the key documents through 
which local planning authorities can set out a vision and framework for the future development of the area, engaging with their communities in doing so. Local Plans address needs and opportunities in relation to housing, the local economy, community facilities and infrastructure. They should safeguard the environment, enable adaptation to climate change and help secure high quality accessible design. The Local Plan provides a degree of certainty for communities, businesses and investors on future development proposals, and a framework for guiding decisions on individual planning applications.
 i
This consultation sets out the key issues for the new local plan for Southend and a number of options on how they might be tackled.
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 3ABOUT THIS CONSULTATION
Why are we Consulting
We know that people care passionately about Southend, that you think 
the seafront, mature parks and rich history across the town should be protected. We know that many people who live in Southend value how special it is. 
Alongside the need for protection of these special qualities we also need 
to provide for the future, the needs of our children and young people, the needs of a rapidly growing population (including older people) and the need for businesses to thrive and prosper. We all need to live in good quality affordable homes, and to live in thriving and healthy communities with easy access to shops, services and facilities which make them a vibrant and sustainable place to live. 
We know that Southend’s businesses are varied, that they are important 
to communities and visitors, want to grow, and need our support and encouragement to do so. We understand the need for a competitive local economy including the value of tourism to the town. 
Meeting these varied needs requires some tough choices to be made 
on how we use land, how we design buildings and communities, where and how we develop. To make sure these choices are made in the public interest we would like to hear your views on what it should say.
The local plan needs to be followed when we make decisions on 
planning applications, unless there are good reasons not to. That is why we need your help.For more Information see the Government’s Plain English Guide to the Planning System.
What Are We Consulting On
The local plan is an important document in shaping Southend’s future. In some areas the current development plans for Southend contain policies that are fairly new, such as the airport and development of some major sites in the town centre. However in some areas, such as meeting pressing housing needs, they are out of date and now need to be reviewed and updated to plan for the next twenty years.
This consultation gives an early opportunity for everyone to express 
their views on what the new local plan should say about the future development of Southend.
This Consultation aims to:
 ● identify the issues which the new local plan should cover;
 ● highlight the information we know already and what we will collect 
(the evidence base) to help us decide what policies we need
 and 
what they should say;
 ● consider some of the options for addressing identified issues.
4 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsHOW TO HAVE YOUR SAY
This consultation provides a starting point for discussion in preparing a new local plan for 
Southend, and we would like to hear your views.
It is important to tell us what you think works well in Southend and its 
different places, and what you like, as well as what you think we could change. You do not need to respond to all of the suggested questions set out below, focus on what interests you, or tell us what you feel needs changing, or should stay the same.
You may like to consider the following general questions:
 ●Have we identified the right issues ?

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 5This is the first in a number of public 
consultations on the new local plan. As the plan is progressed through its statutory stages of preparation there will be further opportunities to make further comments on the plans contents. 
Figure 1 shows the plan preparation timetable for the Southend New 
Local Plan. A ‘live’ timetable of preparation is also available here .
Following submission the Government will appoint a Planning Inspector to undertake an independent examination in public. Their role will be to examine all evidence, including comments made, and consider it against national planning policy to determine whether the Local Plan is sound and legally compliant and may be then adopted by the Council to become planning policy.
As an approximation, the period from submission to adoption may range 
from 6 to 9 months dependent on the content and scope of the plan, issues arising during examination and scheduling of meetings.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

6 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsWHERE THE NEW LOCAL PLAN FITS WITH OTHER 
POLICY AND STRATEGIES
South Essex  
2050 Vision We understand that to plan effectively for Southend we have to look beyond our borders 
and plan strategically with neighbouring authorities. 
The Association of South Essex Local Authorities (ASELA) partnership 
comprises the local councils of Basildon, Brentwood, Castle Point, Rochford, Southend and Thurrock together with Essex County Council (see Figure 3 ). The partnership are developing a ‘shared ambition’ as to what it would like South Essex to look like by 2050.
This shared ambition will be developed into a ‘2050 Vision’ to guide 
the preparation of strategic documents for South Essex including a statutory Joint Strategic Plan (JSP). This will set out strategic planning policies for the sub-region for a range of major issues including housing, employment, infrastructure and environmental considerations and importantly where strategic scale development should be located. The Joint Strategic Plan is currently being prepared and will be subject to separate public consultation later in 2019. 
Similarly, Southend-on-Sea Council is progressing a Southend ‘2050 
Vision’. This will be about the future development of the Borough and how it affects the everyday lives of the people that live, work and visit here. The Joint Strategic Plan and Southend New Local Plan together will provide a part of delivering these wider visions.
The Joint Strategic Plan will provide the framework for the preparation 
of more detailed local plans for each of the South Essex Local Authority areas, including the Southend New Local Plan.
The hierarchy of strategies and plans related to Southend is depicted in

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 9The new local plan will be the starting point for all decisions  
on planning applications in Southend.
The new local plan will replace three current plans, the Core Strategy; 
the Development Management Document; and the Southend Central Area Action Plan with a single document
1.
When making a decision on a planning application, we must consider:
 ●The L
ocal Plan
 ●Government policy and advice (the National Planning P
olicy 
Framework and Planning Practice Guidance)
 ●Supplementary Planning Documents: Currently our Design Guide
, 
Planning Obligations and Streetscape Manual
 ●Other relevant issues or ‘
material considerations ’ such as 
development briefs and corporate strategies, the planning history of a site, highway safety, environmental health.
The way we prepare our local plan and what it contains is carefully regulated
2. Although there is some flexibility in how we go about it, we 
must prepare formal draft documents before the plan is ‘submitted’ to be examined by an independent inspector. 
1 The L ondon Southend Airport and Environs Joint Area Action Plan (prepared jointly with Rochford 
District Council) and the Essex and Southend Waste Local Plan (prepared jointly with Essex County 
Council) will be subject to their own review.
2
 T
own and Country Planning Regulations 2012.Local Plans must incorporate the principles of sustainable development3 
which were first adopted by the United Nations in 1992. The objectives 
of sustainable development have been enshrined into European and National law and lie at the heart of the National Planning Policy Framework. This provides that there is a presumption in favour of sustainable development, which should be seen as a golden thread running through both plan-making and decision-taking. 
In January 2016 the United Nations refined its sustainability objectives 
to include new areas such as climate change, economic inequality and innovation. These have been adopted as 17 interconnected ‘Sustainable Development Goals’
4. It will be important that the new local plan 
embraces these objectives. 
Local Plans should be aspirational but realistic. To support the new  
Local Plans production, evidence base documents have and will continue to be prepared for various topics. These are referred to under each section of this report and can be viewed on the Council’s web site  (localplan.southend.gov.uk). Every Local Plan must also be informed and 
3 Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

partnership for sustainable development to improve human lives and protect the environment.INTRODUCTION

16 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsThe new local plan must be prepared positively, in a 
way that is aspirational but deliverable, and provide a vision for the future of Southend and a framework for addressing housing needs and other economic, social and environmental priorities.
The Council has set out an ‘ambition’ 
and a number of supporting ‘themes’ and ‘outcomes’ that reflects the feedback from the ‘Southend 2050 – be part of the conversation’ engagement programme that started in spring 2018. Over 35,000 people were reached through the work, with 4,000 people actively taking part through a wide variety of events, surveys, workshops and forums across the Borough.
The Southend New Local Plan in setting out 
a planning framework for the next 20 years, will be a key driver and stepping stone in delivering towards the Southend 2050 shared ambition and sub-regional initiatives. It is important to ensure that we are clear in what we are trying to achieve and where we want to be. This will help shape objectives and provide a measure to monitor how successful the plan has been over the coming years. 
Figure 8 below provides a summary of the 
key messages, relating to planning, that we have received as part of the engagement on Southend 2050 to date. We are keen to hear your views on them, to help us develop planning related objectives and aspirations for the local plan on how our land and open spaces are used in the future.

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 19The Local Plan must set out an overall 
strategy for the pattern, scale and quantity of development, and make sufficient provision for housing (including affordable housing), employment, retail, leisure and other commercial development, infrastructure and community facilities and conservation and enhancement of the natural, built and historic environment.
There is an important link between housing and economic performance. 
Getting the right housing offer, including affordable housing, is essential to attracting and retaining a skills base that will encourage inward investment and help address underlying economic causes of deprivation where this exists.
In relation to housing, Local Authorities must seek to meet its need in 
full where it is possible to do so when considering any legitimate and evidenced constraints to housing development in the area, such as environmental considerations and infrastructure capacity, which cannot be mitigated.The Government has recently introduced a new standard methodology
1 
for calculating housing need. This represents a significant uplift on the number of houses that have been built in Southend in recent years. Only about a third of this rate was built each year between 2001-17, the majority of this development taking place on previously developed land within the existing built up area.
If we do not meet the Government housing target, either by ourselves 
or through South Essex Authorities working together, the Government will apply a ‘Housing Delivery Test’ that will make it harder to reject proposals that don’t comply with the local plan on matters such as poor design or loss of existing land uses. There is therefore a pressing need to look at how and where this need can be met.
Housing in Southend, and South Essex as a whole, has become less and less affordable in recent years. When compared to the national average, we have higher rates of overcrowding, enforced house sharing, homelessness. We have seen rising houses price, rising private rent rises but continue to have low local wages. This in part is due to not building enough housing in the area and a major issue facing the new Local Plan is how we can work towards providing a step-change in housing delivery in the future without detrimentally impacting on the character of the town and its environment.
1 National Planning P olicy Framework 2018SPATIAL STRATEGY 
20 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsDevelopment within the existing built up area of Southend
Development within the existing built up area should and must continue 
to play a key role in delivering new homes and jobs in Southend and thereby ensuring the vitality and vibrancy of communities, bringing back into use empty homes and underused land and to assist regeneration. 
However, early surveys undertaken as part of the preparation of the 
Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment (HELAA) indicate that Southend will not be able to continue to meet all of its housing need within its existing urban area or on land at the edge of the existing built up area of Southend. This means looking at other possible ways this can be achieved.
To see the sites surveyed please refer to the HELAA on the Council’s 
webpage.
To determine whether more housing can be sustainably accommodated 
within the existing built up area of Southend we will prepare an Urban Living Study, building on the findings of the HELAA. 
Edge of Settlement Strategic scale development 
(Garden Communities)
The Government is placing great emphasis on the Garden Communities 
approach to meeting housing needs through delivering strategic scale sustainable communities providing for new homes, jobs and infrastructure. 
An important aspect of delivering new homes is the provision 
of supporting infrastructure. A potential advantage of looking to accommodate strategic scale development in a comprehensively planned way, such as by a new Garden Settlement, is that there is a better chance of securing the necessary infrastructure as well as ensuring the critical mass of employment and services to ensure communities thrive.Given Southend’s tightly drawn administrative boundary any strategic scale development will likely have cross border implications with neighbouring authorities, such as Castle Point and Rochford. The South Essex Joint Strategic Plan will consider where strategic scale development sites may be located, which itself will be subject to consultation.
We have prepared a South East Essex Strategic Growth Locations 
Assessment, jointly with Castle Point and Rochford Councils, to understand whether there are areas that could accommodate development of a strategic scale around the urban area of Southend. Strategic scale has been broadly defined as being large enough to sustain supporting infrastructure such as local schools, shops and other services, as well as employment generating development and would comprise a minimum of 6,000 to 8,000 dwellings.
The South East Essex Strategic Growth Locations Assessment has 
identified one area around Southend (north of Fossetts Farm, Garon Park and Bournes Green Chase, incorporating land within both Southend Borough and Rochford District) that has the potential to accommodate strategic scale development and therefore warrants further investigation. This initial exploratory growth locations assessment work will form an initial stepping stone in examining the potential of the area as part of the preparation of the South Essex Joint Strategic Plan being progressed by the Association of South Essex Local Authorities. This work will include an assessment of infrastructure and transport impacts and an assessment of Green Belt. ⊲
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 21The new Local Plan must by law plan to meet identified local housing 
and economic needs. This equates to 18,000 – 24,000 New Homes and 10,000 – 12,000 New Jobs over a 20 year period. We have identified 3 possible options on how this may be achieved and would like to hear your views on each.
We have set out in Figure 9 overleaf the potential advantages and disadvantages of each option.

PLANNING FOR 
GROWTH AND 
CHANGE
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 27HOUSING
Housing is an important 
issue, particularly its affordability, not just for Southend but nationally. Government has set a clear agenda for growth 
to address the historic under delivery of new homes to meet future needs in this country and to support economic prosperity. As part of this approach changes have been recently made to national planning policy guidance which now requires local planning authorities to use a standardised methodology for calculating local housing need. Possible options for meeting this need are discussed in the Spatial Strategy section above.

28 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and Options28 | Southend New Local Plan • ConsultationThe Governments standard method for assessing housing need does not 
break down the overall figure into different types of housing. National planning policy guidance requires local planning authorities to have regard to the need for particular sizes, types and tenures of homes as well as the housing needs of particular groups in preparing their local plans.
Housing Type
The type and quality of the housing offer can have a significant impact on the health and wealth of places. Their ability to attract and retain people and provide support for those who need it relies on good housing and attractive and inclusive neighbourhoods.
There is huge pressure on the housing sector within Southend and as 
such the Council has recently adopted a Housing Strategy, which will prioritise affordable, safe homes for all residents. The local plan will complement this and will consider how to meet the needs for different types of housing across the Borough when determining planning applications. A key part of this will be around delivering more affordable housing, but also how we can:
 ●k
eep younger working age people living in Southend
 ●help older people live independently for longer and pro
vide attractive 
alternatives for people to downsize if they so wish
 ●provide options for custom and self-build housing
Current planning policy1 seeks to achieve a proportion of affordable 
housing on new development sites2. On large schemes (50+ dwellings) 
30% of the housing proposed is required to be affordable, whilst for

Since these policy provisions were introduced in 2007 some 600 affordable homes have been delivered, which represents about 18% of all housing completions between 2007 -2018. However, this is well below the demand and identified future requirements and more needs to be done to address affordability issues.
National policy requires Local Authorities to identify and provide for Gypsy, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in relation to the provision of sites on which caravans can be stationed. On this basis an accommodation assessment has been undertaken across Essex and found that there is no local need for gypsy and traveller sites in Southend.

LOCAL ECONOMY
The Local Plan will be key to realising future economic 
opportunities and ensuring that the town is ‘open for business’.
Approximately 66,200 employees work within 
Southend in over 6,600 businesses. There is a recognised strong entrepreneurial culture in the area and most businesses within Southend are small, with 85.5% of companies employing 10 people or fewer. Current planning policy focusses on expanding existing business sites and premises, together with providing new opportunities as part of the Airport Business Park Southend.
The office market in Southend has seen 
significant changes with much of the town’s older outdated office stock being converted to provide much needed smaller residential units, particularly in the town centre at Victoria Avenue. There is now a changing requirement for smaller to medium sized office units providing a range of quality flexible stock as part of mixed use developments.

as essential for supporting economic development and employment activities across South Essex. Without this investment it will not be possible to achieve the economic growth potential.
The EDNA study identifies ‘growth clusters’ as having the potential to 
achieve future growth in Southend. These are the Town Centre, London Southend Airport and northern Southend corridor centred around Stock Road and Temple Farm. Within these areas the principal growth drivers are identified as being the digital, cultural and creative; healthcare technology; advanced manufacturing and engineering; and tourism sectors. It is recommended that support and investment for education, skills and training is targeted towards these occupations and industries to help boost the qualifications and skills levels of local people in these sectors.
The EDNA suggests that there is a need for up to 39,000sq metres/4 
hectares of additional office space in Southend over the next 20 years whilst changes in the traditional manufacturing sector indicate that there is not a quantitative need to allocate additional land for this purpose. However, the EDNA report notes that this does not mean that there is not a qualitative need at a particular scale and format not currently provided which supports manufacturing/industrial activity.

MAJOR RESORT
With over 7 million day 
visitors each year and over 250,000 longer stay visitors, Southend has significant potential to secure further growth as a major tourism destination. Tourism gives the town its identity centred on its iconic Pier.Recent developments have sought to 
build on this potential including new hotel developments, increasing the quality as well as the capacity of the hotel offer, upgrading of the seafront as part of the City Beach regeneration scheme (at Marine Parade), provision of new and upgraded casino facilities and investments in the leisure offer at Adventure Island theme park and lagoon at Three Shells beach. Further developments are planned at Seaway to attract more visitors to the town.
Tourism and the visitor economy is an 
important economic driver in the town supporting some 9,500 tourism related jobs. It is also an important economic driver for the adjoining town centre offering complementary leisure facilities including further hotel accommodation, bars and restaurants.
As part of a partnership approach involving 
the Council, the Southend Tourism Partnership and local business community, a strategy has been prepared to harness the tourism potential of Southend – ‘Destination Southend on Sea’

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 3940 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsPROVIDING FOR VIBRANT AND 
ATTRACTIVE TOWN CENTRES
The main shopping centres 
of the Borough are the town centre and two district centres at Westcliff and Leigh. These are complemented by a number of local centres at West Leigh, Eastwood, Southchurch Road, Thorpe Bay, North Shoebury and Shoeburyness. In addition there are retail parks at the Airport, London Road, Greyhound Way and Fossetts Farm and a number of stand-alone large supermarket facilities.Southend Town Centre
Southend town centre lies at the heart of 
the Borough providing a range of business, educational, retail and leisure facilities. It is focused on two indoor shopping malls connected by a long linear pedestrianised High Street. At the north of the High Street is The Victoria shopping mall and at the south is The Royals.
Like many comparable centres in the UK, 
Southend town centre has felt the impact of the recent economic recession and effects of changing retail patterns. Several factors have created a need for retailers to rapidly adapt their business strategies and store formats in the light of changing economic circumstances. These factors include
 ●reduced consumer e
xpenditure growth
 ●changes in customer requirements 
 ●growth of internet and multi-channel retailing.
The combination of these factors has resulted in an increasing number of retailers 
5
40 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultationconcentrating trading activities within larger centres and out-of-town retail 
parks in order to compete effectively with on line retailers. As a result, the strength of the comparison retail offer in larger centres continues to improve relative to small centres. This has had a negative impact on Southend in comparison to such centres as Chelmsford. It has impacted on the quality of the retail offer in Southend town centre with the majority of retailers now being value to mid-market. 
However, in contrast there have been a growing number of cafes, bars 
and restaurants established, particularly at the northern end of the centre adjacent the Odeon cinema and at its southern end linked to the major tourist and related leisure facilities located adjacent the foreshore. This has brought a new vibrancy to the centre complemented by increasing residential provision and a growing student population centred on the town centres University campus. Leisure turnover in the centre is expected to increase over the next 20 years, the majority of this growth being in the food and drink sector.
Future demand for retail growth is therefore limited and there is an urgent 
need to consider alternative strategies for the town centre to retain its vitality and vibrancy. For example, there is potential to encourage a mix of uses in the centre building on its leisure, educational, tourism and cultural offer together with office and residential development opportunities. 
The recently adopted Southend Central Area Action Plan (SCAAP 2018), 
in seeking to provide a much more flexible approach to the type of uses that should be permitted in the High Street, relaxed previous policy provisions to allow a greater mix of uses in the centre such as cafes and restaurants. It also encourages further residential development in the town centre and the expansion of the University campus and associated student accommodation. ⊲

In contrast Leigh provides a unique selection of local independent convenience and comparison retail operators and a higher quality of retail offer. Current planning policy seeks to retain and enhance the viability of these local centres together with the other local shopping centres.
In developing new planning policies for the Boroughs’ retail centres it

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 4344 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsPROVIDING FOR A SUSTAINABLE 
TRANSPORT SYSTEM
Transport and transport 
infrastructure is not an end in itself but serves a wider purpose to enable movement of people and goods. Transport facilitates, but also creates wider issues which include air pollution, noise and severance. Transport also needs to reflect changing societal patterns and changes in technology. With some 21,000 inbound commuters 
to Southend and around 30,000 outward commuters, 12,500 of whom travel to London, and over 7 million day visitors each year
1, 
Southend’s transport network is heavily utilised. There are also many other local movements. 
Southend’s transport network reflects the 
geography and historical development of the area being based on an east-west axis. The A127 dual carriageway provides the strategic highway access to the Borough providing links to London and the M25. The A13 also runs east-west through the Borough. Two railway lines and ten stations serve the Borough. It also benefits from an extensive bus network with high frequency services along the A13 Passenger Transport Corridor. 
The A13 experiences conflicts between 
serving local functions and acting as a link to the strategic network. As the only strategic highway route into and out of Southend, the A127 is the main highway access to the town.

44 | Southend New Local Plan • ConsultationAs a consequence the A127 gets congested at peak times and is heavily 
used by residents, commuters and visitors. Significant improvements to the A127 have been undertaken in recent years and further improvements along this corridor towards the M25 will be essential if projected housing and employment growth in Southend is to be accommodated. The A127 Bell Junction has been designated as an Air Quality Management Area and the Council’s Air Quality Action Plan seeks to tackle road transport related pollution and improve health outcomes.
The town offers considerable scope for improving sustainable transport. 
East-west cycle routes have been improved but links between the north and south of the Borough are limited. Designing in safe walking and cycling routes can assist with improving health and has benefits for reducing congestion and air pollution. 
Improvements to the efficiency of car parking provision, including the 
town centre, are proposed as part of Southend Central Area Action Plan and Southend Borough-wide Parking and Access Strategy. Building upon these documents the Council will be undertaking an Access, Parking and Transport Strategy and reviewing its Local Transport Plan.
It will be critical that significant improvements are made to the transport 
network. Any urban extension or new settlement on the edge of the town would require new transport links such as an outer bypass for all travel modes and would need to integrate with the Borough’s existing transport routes. Further junction upgrades would also require consideration. If this option was taken forward then further work will be required to determine where such a route could be accommodated.
Southend international airport has flights to a number of destinations 
around the UK and across Europe. The Airport continues to grow, which will also attract related employment opportunities. This however has implications for surface access as well as noise and air quality impacts. ⊲

Local planning authorities can also promote healthier lifestyles by supporting opportunities for communities to access a wide range of healthier food production, influencing consumption choices, including reducing access to less healthy food options, and providing opportunities for increasing physical activity and participation in sport and improving mental wellbeing. A mix of housing types and tenures are also required to provide choice for residents throughout their lives. Moreover, with increasing pressure for new housing developments, and possibly development at higher densities within the town centre and other areas of the Borough, good quality design will become even more important. 
There are 14 Conservation Areas in the Borough, six scheduled 
monuments and numerous listed buildings. These heritage assets contribute to the character of the town and are an important reminder of the town’s history. Our seaside heritage, including the Grade II listed pier are also important components of the tourist economy and play a crucial role in the identity of the town. Local planning authorities have a statutory duty to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of heritage assets. New development has the potential to lead to incremental changes in landscape and townscape character and quality in and around the Borough, but it can also be an opportunity to enhance the setting of heritage assets and better reveal their significance, we should therefore ensure that development has a positive impact on the historic environment.
Current planning policies require good design in all new development. 
Further detailed guidance and advice on design is set out in the Southend Design and Townscape Guide and the Streetscape Manual, which will be reviewed and updated as part of the local plan process to reflect changing circumstances. ⊲

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 5354 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsPROVIDING COMMUNITY 
SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Providing quality services 
for the future health, education, sports and leisure and community needs of the Borough’s residents are fundamental factors in achieving a high quality of life, and with a growing population it is essential that these are planned in such a way that they meet the future demands that are placed upon the town. The existing and projected future capacity of physical infrastructure is also essential to the planning and phasing of future development. The provision of community services and infrastructure is the responsibility of a range of public and private bodies.
Utility provision is at or close to capacity in 
some locations. Combined sewers cause issues in parts of the Borough while in other areas there are issues with the capacity of the electricity network to accommodate growth. Enhancements will be required in the existing urban area and new infrastructure carefully planned for new development. The increased use of sustainable technologies should also be incorporated wherever possible. 
The new local plan will need to plan for an 
increase in primary healthcare facilities (e.g. GP surgeries) to meet projected population growth 
8
54 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultationover the next twenty years. This will need to 
reflect changing models of healthcare provision with a move towards larger, purpose built GP practices and specialisation within hospitals as well as moves to provide more care in the community and an emphasis on preventative care. Similarly new infrastructure to support social and community health care provision to meet the needs of a growing older and vulnerable population will need to be put in place. 
It will be essential that the new local plan 
ensures that appropriate education facilities are planned to meet future needs as the local population grows. The Southend Central Area Action Plan already provides for the expansion of existing facilities at the University of Essex and South Essex College campus in the town centre. Some existing schools in the Borough are already at or close to capacity. While in a number of locations there is room to expand, this is not always the case and new Primary and Secondary School sites will be required to accommodate development needs. 
Southend has a good network of different types 
of sports and leisure facilities. Our evidence suggests supply and demand for most sports are and will be in balance, with some exceptions including swimming and sports such as Netball and Futsal. Because many sports have a wide catchment the assessment has been done across local authority borders. It is expected that in the future the focus for investment will be on “hub sites” where facilities are concentrated rather than on a large number of small sites. The development of artificial 3G pitches is expected to be a priority. The town’s seven miles of foreshore offers a wealth of water recreation opportunities. Such facilities are an important asset in providing residents with the opportunities to participate in a range of sports and leisure facilities. 
Southend United Football Club has for a number 
of years sought to relocate its football ground from its current home at Roots Hall to Fossetts Farm on the northern edge of the Borough. To make it viable, the scheme includes a number of additional retail, leisure and ancillary facilities as well as new housing and community facilities. The retail element will need to be carefully considered so that it is not detrimental to the vitality and viability of the town centre.
Over the coming decades the provision of 
quality digital technology will be essential. Southend is at the forefront of initiatives to bring superfast broadband to the area through a Fibre to the Premise (FTTP) programme. It will be vital that the new local plan for Southend embraces this in all new development schemes. ⊲

Southend is renowned for the quality of its parks and 
open spaces. This ‘green infrastructure’ provides valuable benefits including opportunities for informal recreation and relaxation, participation in sports, wildlife habitats, improved air quality and tranquility. Whilst Southend needs to adapt and grow to meet changing circumstances and needs, it will be essential that its natural habitats are protected and enhanced.

58 | Southend New Local Plan • ConsultationMoreover Southend contains a diverse and rich range of areas important 
for their biodiversity and nature conservation value, including Belfairs/Great Wood and the foreshore. Southend’s blue infrastructure network of rivers and streams, including the Thames Estuary, benefit from extensive nature conservation designations to protect its biodiversity and wildlife significance (specifically SPAs, SACs, RAMSAR and SSSIs). This means that a careful balance needs to be struck between protection of these important environments and the provision of access for local communities and visitors alike. 
Increasing pressure for recreational and leisure pursuits on the foreshore 
will require careful planning to ensure the natural environment is protected. Initiatives are currently being pursued to combat the impact of increasing housing development and consequent recreation pressures through mitigation measures to protect the natural habitat of the coast. ⊲

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 6162 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsPLANNING FOR  
CLIMATE CHANGE 
National planning policy is 
clear that planning has a key role to play in minimising vulnerability and providing resilience to the impacts of climate change, including coastal change, flood risk, drought, water supply and changes to biodiversity and landscape. It will be essential that appropriate planning policies are put in place in the new local plan to meet these challenges.For urban coastal areas such as Southend the 
impacts of climate change is expected to have significant implications in terms of sea rise and the need to retain, maintain and provide sea defences that are fit for purpose given predictions of sea level rise. This requires careful planning and design to ensure that schemes are sensitive to their surroundings and do not have adverse impacts on local habitats, tourism and leisure, and do not impair important views. 
The impacts of climate change are likely to 
result in erratic and unsettled weather, causing periods of drought and severe storms that can lead to flooding. This has already been experienced in Southend with flash floods in a number of coastal areas and areas adjacent to inland waterways. Flood risk assessments will continue to be required in areas of high risk and new development directed to areas with the lowest flood risk, and sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDs) will be required to reduce the potential of surface water flooding 
10
62 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultationas a result of development, by using more natural methods for drainage, 
flood storage and dispersal. 
In planning for the future of the town and its resilience to climate 
change Southend must become more energy efficient and use sources of renewable energy in order to meet national targets for a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions
1. The Council’s Low Carbon Energy and 
Sustainability Strategy focuses on delivering low carbon growth, improving energy efficiency and providing for a more sustainable future with the aim of establishing Southend as a Low Carbon Smart City. This will form an important input to the development of the new local plan. However, solutions to reduce energy inefficiency must be planned properly to avoid harmful alterations to the appearance of buildings and surrounding spaces.
The Air Quality Strategy and Low Emission Strategy 2018 – 2025 identify 
land use planning as a key tool to reduce road transport emissions and transport related air pollution. Effective planning policies can play a significant role in helping sustain air quality improvements by providing infrastructure to encourage alternatives to the private car and by both discouraging the use of high emission vehicles and supporting the uptake of low emission vehicles (LEV) including the provision of LEV refuelling facilities such as Electric Vehicle charging points.
Furthermore, projects such as urban greening, landscaping, green walls 
and roofs and tree planting can reduce flooding, reduce high summer temperatures, store the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, improve air quality and provide habitats for wildlife. It will be important that the local plan seeks such provision in new development schemes, and reflects international best practice in climate change adaptation and mitigation.

NEIGHBOURHOODS
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 6768 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsSOUTHEND'S NEIGHBOURHOODS
As with any borough, Southend is not a single homogenous 
place. Rather, it is a collection of separate and distinct places or neighbourhoods which have grown together over time to create a substantial conurbation. It will be important that the local plan considers the issues facing the different communities of Southend.
The following pages provide a brief description 
of the different neighbourhoods within the Borough, their key characteristics and some of the future planning issues facing them. It is not intended to present comprehensive information or definitive boundaries for these neighbourhoods, but rather to stimulate discussion about particular issues and options that you think these areas face in the future. 
Eastwood
Eastwood is a relatively low rise neighbourhood on the north west edge of the Borough, featuring predominantly post-war residential buildings which vary in style and format, but are generally low density with a number set out in informal cul-de-sacs. Whilst often providing for a quiet suburban character, this can result in a lack of clear routes through the area for pedestrians and cyclists. The A127 Southend arterial road forms a barrier dividing Eastwood from other parts of the Borough, and improvements to key junctions have been completed or

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 69are underway to reduce the severance effect of the road. 
Important employment sites are located at Aviation Way, Laurence 
Industrial Estate, Progress Road and Airborne Close/Industrial Estates. It will be important that these employment areas are retained and enhanced. 
Rayleigh Road provides for a range of retail, cafes, restaurants and 
commercial services serving local needs. These have been recently enhanced with the development of a large Lidl foodstore. Further retail provision is provided at Western Approaches anchored by a large Morrison’s foodstore. 
Eastwood contains few elements of significant historic value, the 
exception being the ancient Green Way at its northern edge abutting the Cherry Orchard Jubilee Country Park which provides for informal countryside pursuits. This is supplemented by the more formal green spaces at Eastwood Park and Edwards Hall Park. 
Leigh 
London Road forms a linear, predominantly commercial spine, dividing north Leigh from the main popular and thriving retail centre of Leigh Broadway and Leigh Road. The shopping centre suffers from a lack of off street car parking facilities.
North of the London Road are the residential areas of Belfairs and 
Blenheim, with a mix of Edwardian and Inter-War dwellings, and some more modern, larger properties adjacent to Belfairs Wood and Golf Course. This part of the Borough contains a number of secondary schools, playing fields and parks, and has a leafy feel with a large number of mature street trees and grass verges, including within Blenheim Chase and Highlands Boulevard. The London Road is well served by public transport and is likely to be able to support increased density given its sustainable location. To the south of the London Road the area is characterised by areas of higher density terraced properties, with limited off-street car parking facilities. The exception is the Marine Estate at the western edge of the Borough and Chalkwell area where there are larger detached and semi-detached dwellings set within generous plots. 
On the coast the original Old Leigh 
fishing settlement is now a popular visitor destination with a number of cafes, pubs and restaurants. The area retains traditional fishing and marine activities giving the area its distinctive character. This character continues along the seafront to Chalkwell which contains mainly substantial detached properties set within spacious gardens. Most properties are two to three storeys in height, although there are several substantially taller buildings along the seafront, with pressure for re-development of the Victorian and Edwardian villas on the seafront with additional taller buildings. 
Reflecting its historic origins and coastal architecture, Leigh contains a 
number of Conservation Areas at Chapmanslord on the Marine Estate, Leigh Old Town, Leigh, and Leigh Cliff, the Crowstone and many listed buildings. 
70 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsThese neighbourhoods have an attractive residential environment, 
however, there is continuing demand for infill development and extensions to existing properties. These can impact on the character of the neighbourhoods and it will be important to retain the areas distinctive character. The development of numerous garden frontages and verges for off-street parking has reduced greenery and the ability of the land to absorb surface water run-off. 
Westcliff 
Westcliff’s development followed the establishment of the railway. It contains areas of densely developed terraced and semi-detached Victorian and Edwardian housing, with Westborough having a particularly strong grid layout and rhythm of terraced streets. A large number of these properties have been sub-divided, leading to growing demand for on-street parking, and there is generally poor tree cover within these streets, and a lack of local open space, reflecting the high density of development. Further opportunities should be sought for greening the neighbourhood with appropriate soft landscape enhancements. As in the high density areas of Leigh, Westborough has witnessed the development of numerous garden frontages and verges for off-street parking which reduces greenery and the ability of the land to absorb surface water run-off. 
London Road has a strong commercial focus within Westcliff, with shops 
and community facilities including the library and Palace theatre and there are a number of opportunities to increase density along the route given the frequent bus service and sustainable location. The stretch of seafront includes the Cliffs Pavilion regional entertainment centre, Casino, cafés and restaurants. Linking the two is Hamlet Court Road district shopping centre serving local community needs. It has a number of impressive Edwardian and inter-war buildings with a decorative character, albeit these are dispersed throughout a long length of shopping frontage. 
Prittlewell 
Prittlewell contains some of the oldest buildings in the Borough, which developed as the ‘South end’ of Prittlewell. The historic settlement is focussed around St Marys Church and the Priory, within Priory Park. The area is generally characterised by low and medium density housing, although there has recently been a mixed development of higher density north of Priory Crescent on the site of the old Ecko factory. There are also a number of yards and industrial areas that could be improved and potentially redeveloped. Should Southend United football club re-locate there would also be a significant residential development opportunity close to the town centre on Victoria Avenue. Local shopping needs are provided by neighbourhood parades whilst the out of town Tesco superstore provides for wider local needs.
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 71Southend 
Southend contains 
the main retail heart 
of the Borough, 
within the town 
centre, and is the 
principal transport 
hub for the town with two railway 
stations and the 
central bus station. 
Just to the north 
of the high street, 
Victoria Avenue is 
the location of its main 
civic functions, and a 
number of tall buildings 
formerly used as offices 
which have been converted 
to residential accommodation. In 
addition to potential for new residential 
accommodation within the upper floors of high street 
properties, there are also several mixed use development opportunity sites within the town, including Queensway, Baxter Avenue, Esplanade House and Seaway and Tylers Avenue car parks. The dual carriageway and roundabout at Queensway forms a major barrier for pedestrians. The Better Queensway project aims to provide high quality new residential properties and public space, and to better integrate the town centre into its residential hinterland to the north and east.This neighbourhood also contains the Conservation Areas of Milton and Clifftown, to the west of the high street, and the Kursaal, Warrior Square and Eastern Esplanade to the east. There are also heritage assets at the southern end of the high street, including the Grade II listed Pier. The central seafront area on either side of the Pier is a focus for tourism and leisure contributing to the 7 million visitors to the borough each year.
Southchurch 
Southchurch has a strong grid character, provided by the regular streets of Victorian and Edwardian dwellings to the north and south of Southchurch Road. Properties to the south tend to be grander and more detailed, particularly towards the seafront and Southchurch Park. Southchurch Village local centre, along Southchurch Road, is the commercial hub of the neighbourhood, containing many independent shops. There are a number of opportunities to increase density along Southchurch Road given it is sustainable location. To the north of Southchurch Road dwellings were built during the post war period, and have a more fragmented street pattern, including some residential towers. On the northern periphery of the area is the Waitrose superstore and Fossetts Retail Park. Southend United Football Club have had long standing plans to relocate its facilities to land north of the retail park.

(Please state the neighbourhood you are describing).Thorpe Bay 
Thorpe Bay developed with the coming of the railway into 
a relatively low density area, with detached and semi-
detached dwellings set within larger plots with wide 
central boulevards and green verges. Dwellings to 
the south of the railway line have a strong grid form with wide plots of generous proportions, although 
there are also streets with modest properties, including 
bungalows. The Thorpe Bay Broadway provides for local 
shopping and commercial needs. The main threat to the 
area is from larger scale developments, particularly along 
the seafront. Incremental change on a plot by plot basis should 
be sympathetic to the overall scale and character of the area. 
Shoeburyness
Shoeburyness contains a number of distinct residential and industrial areas.  The inward facing character of some of the more recent housing developments has meant the urban form within Shoeburyness is more fragmented than other parts of the Borough. The local shopping and commercial needs are served by the centres along West Road and Ness Road and supplemented by the 1980’s built large Asda superstore in North Shoebury. The area contains a number of important employment sites which should be retained and enhanced.
South Shoebury has a more obvious grid form of streets, with relatively 
large plots. The New Garrison development reflects the nature and historical significance of the original Garrison buildings, with a prominent frontage to the estuary. The Garrison is designated as a Conservation Area. The redevelopment has also enabled continuous public access from East Beach around the coast through the new Gunners Park.

DELIVERABILITY & 
IMPLEMENTATION
Southend-on-Sea Borough Council | 7576 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultation Issues and OptionsENSURING THAT THE  
NEW LOCAL PLAN IS DELIVERED
Over the coming decades Southend will be faced with a 
number of significant challenges. It will be essential that the new local plan for Southend embraces these in a positive way to bring real benefits to the town. 
The formulation of sound and balanced 
planning policies in partnership with the local and business community will be key to achieving this. However, this will only be of value if they can be delivered in an effective, coordinated and planned way. This is particularly the case in the delivery of essential infrastructure. Implementation and resourcing of the plan is therefore critical to its success. This has to be set out in an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) to support the local plans provisions.
Most of the plans policies and proposals will 
be delivered by private sector developers, particularly for housing and business development, government agencies and utility companies. Implementation will primarily be in the form of planning applications for development which are required to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the adopted local plan. As part of this process, the Council in appropriate cases will seek a contribution from the developer to support the provision of facilities such as affordable housing, new roads, open space, education and health facilities. These can either be in the form of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) payment or as part of Section 106 legal agreement attached to the planning permission.
The Community Infrastructure Levy is a 
planning charge that allows local planning authorities to raise contributions from developers from multiple sites to help pay for 
 12
76 | Southend New Local Plan • Consultationkey infrastructure. The local planning authority must identify the schemes 
and total cost of infrastructure it desires to fund in its area to support its local plan provisions (Regulation 123 List) and having regard to a charging schedule relating to specific types of development. A Section 106 agreement is usually used to secure contributions from the developer for on-site infrastructure needs. The total level of contributions from these sources and requirements for affordable housing should not, at local plan level, render the development needs of the Borough unviable. Providing it is viable, however, much of the uplift in land value from allocating new sites for development can contribute to paying for new infrastructure.
The Borough Council will seek further opportunities to draw in funding 
as a part of the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP) and as a partner of the recently formed Association of South Essex Local Authorities. The Borough Council is also able to secure funding from other government sources, including for local transport schemes as part of its Local Transport Plan capital programme. 
It will be important that the Borough Council continues to work in 
partnership with partners across the private, public and voluntary sectors to deliver the new local plans provisions, particularly as public finances are likely to remain strictly controlled and in limited supply in the immediate future. Once adopted, the new local plans policies and proposals will also enable the Council to highlight the infrastructure needs and bid for additional resource funding opportunities that may arise from Government and regional funding initiatives.
The implementation of the Plan and its policies is measured through the 
Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) which is produced annually. This can lead to further analysis for Government, especially on housing delivery. The CIL schedule is also monitored annually. ⊲
