North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
What is a Local Plan?
1.1
Welcome to the new Local Plan for North
Warwickshire.
1.2
The Local Plan takes forward
and would supercede
the adopted Core Strategy
incorporating
the site allocation and development management draft policies that have
bee
n out for consultation previously. Putting all the documents together in one place will
make it easier to understand how development is managed and what policies should be
taken into consideration. There will also be Neighbourhood Plans which when made
(ad
opted) will have policies that will impact on proposals. In addition
,
from time to time
the Borough Council may update parts of this plan rather than updating the entire
document.
1.3
A Local Plan contains planning policies to guide
the development and use of land, which
affect the nature of places and how they function at a strategic level as well as providing
detailed policies for individual sites and applications. The Core Strategy was adopted in
2014 and sought quality sustainable
development in the right place at the right time. It
looked forward to 2029. This Local Plan looks forward to 2033 and continues the theme
of sustainable development in the right place with the right infrastructure. The Local Plan
also gives an indication
of where and how development will take place beyond this time
frame in order to ensure a continuous supply of land. It explains how much and what
type of development there will be and where this will be
located.
1.4
The policies within this Plan are interrelated and therefore the document should be read
as a whole.
As the Local Plan was submitted for examination on 27 March 2018, the
National Planning Policy Framework published on 27 March 2012 sets the relevant
poli
cy context (NPPF2012).
However
,
the Local Plan has looked forward to take
account of the implications of the NPPF published on 19 February 2019 as necessary
(NPPF2019
.
In addition
,
the County Council prepares the Waste and Minerals Local
Development Docu
ments. The first of these documents sets out sites proposed for waste
development whilst the second document will set out potential sites and areas of search
for new mineral development. Together these plans make up the statutory planning
framework for the
Borough.
A number of Neighbourhood Plans are currently being
prepared by Parish and Town
Councils
with those at Arley, Austrey, Coleshill, Hartshill,
Mancetter and Fillongley currently part of the development plan.
1.5
The Minerals Core Strategy will also d
efine Mineral Safeguarding Areas (MSAs). North
Warwickshire has a number of resources such as sand and gravel and coal. The North
Warwickshire Coalfield covers a significant area of the Borough from Shuttington in the
north
-
west to the boundary with Covent
ry to the south east.
Some of the reserves
identified within the coalfield are shallow and may be accessible by surface mining
extraction methods.
It will be necessary for non
-
mineral development proposed by this
Local Plan to consider whether mineral re
sources should be extracted prior to
development taking place in order to not needlessly sterilise mineral resources.
The
environmental and social impacts of such extractions will be important considerations.
The Borough Council has concerns about the pot
ential environmental, visual and
amenity impacts of extractions.
In particular before the Borough Council supports a
scheme, it should be satisfied that the potential impact has been addressed and there
are no viable, accessible reserves that may be steri
lised or trigger the need to surface
mine
.

Map
sits alongside this Plan which will show the detailed geographical items.
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD) will be used, where necessary, to add more detail
and give guidance on how the Council
will implement specific
policies
in accordance with
NPPF2012, paragraph 153.  A glossary of terms is provided at Appendix A to the Plan, however
in the eventuality that there are any conflicts between the terms contained therein and preceding
elements of
the Local Plan and national planning policy, the latter prevail.
1.6
The Local Plan has been shaped by consultation. Taking into account the consultations
undertaken previously in relation to the Draft Site Allocations and Draft Development
Management Plan as
well as the Core Strategy this document shows the preferred
option of allowing development of the appropriate size and scale in a variety of
settlements, guided by the updated settlement hierarchy. The settlement hierarchy is
based on an assessment of the
services, facilities and sustainability of the various
settlements within the Borough.
1.7
The Localism Act 2011 introduced a requirement for the Borough Council to co
-
operate
with other local authorities as well as organisations and agencies to ensure the effective
discussion of issues of common concern to develop sound plans.
This Duty is an
on
-
going process and does not stop with the production of a plan.
The Borough Council
has a proven track record in cooperating with neighbouring authorities in strategic
planning matters and has been working with neighbouring authorities to consider thei
r
future development needs and if they can accommodate them.
The Borough Council
has reached an agreement on the amount of development that can be accommodated
can be delivered with local authorities from the Coventry & Warwickshire area as well as
the Gr
eater Birmingham & Black Country area (including Tamworth). It is considered
there is sufficient information to progress this Plan taking into account these needs and
providing for them where possible within this Plan.
In addition
,
the Borough Council
con
tinues to commit to working collaboratively with relevant authorities and bodies to
refine the scale and distribution of housing and employment needs within the housing
market areas and functional economic market areas in which the Borough falls, the
level
s that it is appropriate for the Borough to seek to accommodate, and to working
collaboratively with infrastructure providers to ensure that any impacts of growth are
suitably mitigated.
In the event that evidence, monitoring indicators (set out below) or
events identify that a significant change in provision is needed compared to that set out
in the Local Plan (or the evidence upon which it is based) an early partial/ full review,
depending on the issue, will be brought forward to address this. ln any eve
nt the Council
is required by statute to complete a review of the plan every five years, starting from the
date of adoption.
1.8
Sustainability Appraisals were prepared to accompany the Core Strategy as well as the
Draft Site Allo
cations Plan and Draft Development Management Plan.
A further
Sustainability Appraisal to look at this comprehensive Plan has been undertaken to
further assist with the progress of the Plan and where possible changes have been
made to the Plan.
However
,
as development pressures increase it is important to
recognise that not all development will be able to be accompanied with no adverse
impacts so mitigation of those impacts will be very important
considerations.9
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
2.1
The Spatial Portrait gives the story of the Borough and the issues that it faces.
It
includes not just the traditional aspects related to land
-
use planning but it also includes
other information/issues that have an
impact on how land is used, such as, health, skills
and training.
All of this information provides an image of the Borough which then feeds
into the strategic
policies.
2.2
North Warwickshire is a rural Borough with over 50 settlements as shown on Map 1
,
covering 110 square miles/28,526 ha/285 km².
The rural nature of the Borough is very
important.
This is created by the number of rivers
–
Blythe, Tame, Cole, Anker
-
Kingsbury Water Park and the canal system, as well as the number of other natural
feat
ures and the predominantly mixed agricultural and woodland uses operating
throughout the Borough.
The Borough has an open rural character which is unique
compared to many of the surrounding urban
areas.
2.3
Settlements range in size from Atherstone, and
Mancetter, with a population of 10,000 to
small hamlets.
Atherstone with Mancetter, Coleshill and Polesworth with Dordon are the
three market towns and are important to the health of the surrounding rural economy as
they provide many services and faciliti
es to the outlying
hinterland.
2.4
The Borough lies between Birmingham, Solihull, Tamworth, Coventry, Nuneaton and
Hinckley, all of which are growing areas.
Growth
will be supported
in the Borough in the
plan period to assist with the need to provide housing for the Coventry & Warwickshire
and the Greater Birmingham
housing market
areas.
In that context the Council commits
to the approach in the former Core Strategy to delivering 50
0 homes for Tamworth
Borough Council plus an additional 413 homes over the plan period and 8.5 hectares of
employment space
.
The Borough therefore has pressure for growth from all around.
This is not only in terms of land being sought in this Borough but
in terms of the
environmental implications of such growth. For example, traffic passing through the
Borough especially along the
A5.
2.5
The economy of the Borough, since the closure of the coal mines, has seen an increase
in employment land, particularly logistics, but a decrease in manufacturing.
Large
brownfield sites, such as Hams Hall, Birch Coppice, and Kingsbury Link, have been used
for development, mainly B8 (storage and distribution uses) the former two sites also
benefit from intermodal rail freight interchanges.
The Borough is the location for many
national and international companies including Aldi, TNT, 3M, BMW, Sainsbury and
Subaru.
In 2012 it also became home to one of Ocado’s national
hubs.
2.6
There are a number of other older industrial estates in Atherstone, Mancetter, Arley and
Coleshill that serve the local and sub
-
regional employment needs of the Borough
compromising
mostly of smaller companies.
Over 90% of firms in the Borough employ
10 or less employees.
Over 50% of workers commute into and out of the Borough.
With
companies locating in the
Borough,
it is important for local people to have the necessary
skills to
take up the local job opportunities as well as having the skills to start up in
business.
2.7
Major roads of national and regional significance pass through the Borough (M6, M6
Toll, A5, M42, and A446) and they form part of the Strategic Road Network.
T
he A5 and
A446
although
part
of
this
network,
are
not
dual
carriageway
along
their
entire
length
and has speed limits as low as 40 mph in some parts.
The Borough Council is working
Chapter

Spatial
Portrait10
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
with Warwickshire County Council, Leicestershire County Council,
Highways England
from the East and West Midlands, as well as other local authorities along its route, to
investigate the issues of growth and how improvements to the route can take place. A
Strategy has been prepared for the A5 and the Borough Council will
work with partners
including the private sector to deal with issues along its route.  The capacity of the A5
and A446 will be an on
-
going concern as major developments are taking place along its
route mainly outside the Borough which may impact on how dev
elopment takes place in
the Borough. Such developments include the MIRA Technology Park and sustainable
urban extensions in Hinckley & Bosworth and Birmingham; DIRFT in Daventry and
Rugby; growth in Nuneaton & Bedworth; HS2 interchange station; UK Central;
growth in
Birmingham as well as growth in Tamworth, Lichfield and
beyond.
2.8
Rail also plays an important role in the Borough with the Trent Valley line/ West Coast
mainline and the
Cross
-
Country
line.
During 2008 a new station called Coleshill
Parkway
opened and services have been improved to Atherstone.
There are two
intermodal rail freight facilities at Hams Hall and Birch Coppice. The improvement of rails
services and facilities will be a key issue if growth is going to be delivered.
2.9
In Januar
y 2012 the Secretary of State announced the route for the first phase of HS2
(High Speed Rail) between London and the West Midlands. This travels through the
Borough northwards from the NEC along the Tame Valley up to Middleton and then on
to Bassett’s Pol
e.
A route also comes out of and goes into Birmingham to the south of
Water Orton.
The safeguarded route is shown on the
Policies
Map. Work to construct
this phase has commenced.
The second phase of the route to Leeds via the East
Midlands and to Manche
ster was published in January 2013 and has also been
safeguarded.
The Leeds leg follows the route of the M42 from a junction near Lea
Marston, past Polesworth and then heads towards Ashby.
The full impact of the
proposals will not be known for some time,
but increased traffic, especially through the
rural countryside close to the new railway station and monorail depot to the east of the
M42 near to the NEC, is likely.
The construction of the railway will be an enormous
project which will impact the Borou
gh for a number of years. HS2 Ltd has powers to stop
development being built if it interferes with the construction programme of the line.
This
has to be a key consideration in terms of where development takes place within this Plan
period.
2.10
Improved public transport connections will be extremely important to mitigate this impact
as well as substantial landscaping and absorptive noise barriers along its route.
Other
mitigation measures, including community benefits will be needed and will be
progressed
through discussions with HS2 Ltd and the Department of Transport.
There will be
pressure for development expanding out of the new HS2 railway station at the
NEC.
2.11
The Borough Council recognises that when HS2 takes place, it will impact on a number
of properties.
The Council will work with owners to mitigate the loss of properties
wherever possible.
2.12
In addition to the above transport corridors there is 7km of
the Birmingham & Fazeley
Canal and 17km of the Coventry Canal within the Borough.
The canal system has many
uses from regeneration to tourism to being important biodiversity corridors. They are an
important recreation and tourism
resource
.
2.13
There are
three main airports close to the Borough boundary
–
Birmingham
International, East Midlands and Coventry Airports. Implications on North Warwickshire
of any expansion plans for the airports will be considered particularly in relation to the
increase in th
e amount of traffic.
However
,
the opportunities of improved access to jobs11
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
and services will also be exploited.
Development within the Borough will need to
consider the constraints imposed by their close
proximity.
2.14
Individually the schemes and deve
lopments above will have an impact on the Borough
but collectively it means that there is pressure from around the Borough. In terms of the
Birmingham Airport there are expansion plans which may include a new runway.  Their
plans are in their infancy.  In
addition, UK Central and Arden Cross are being developed
in the Solihull MBC area.
Pressure on the western and southern boundaries are
expected but cannot yet be quantified and thus
mitigated.
2.15
The Borough’s own objectively assessed housing need and the need to consider
delivering further growth for neighbours means that growth is much greater than ever
experienced in the Borough before.
This will bring many challenges.  In particular
,
due
to th
e rural nature of the Borough making quality places that are integrated into the
existing fabric of settlements wherever possible will be important.
Making settlements
work will be just as important as delivering a specific site as this will lead to their
long
-
lasting
success.
2.16
The Borough has historically been seen as a good place to be, particularly for logistics
companies, due to its location.
Broadening the employment base is very important to
the Borough Council. MIRA Technology Park is directly
adjacent to the Borough with
access off the A5 in this Borough.
Its primary focus is research and development.
It
provides the opportunity to extend the opportunities within the area.
The Borough
Council will work with partners to ensure that those liv
ing in North Warwickshire have the
right opportunities, training and skills to take advantage of and access the additional
jobs. The way that buildings will be built and integrated into the landscape and existing
settlements will also be an important consi
deration
too.
2.17
The Borough has a special and important natural environment shaped by its landscape
and mining legacy. It has four major river corridors
–
the Tame, Blythe, Cole and Anker
-
and holds the largest and most important area of inter
-
connect
ed wetlands in the sub
-
region along the Tame Valley.
Cumulatively this area forms a migratory bird route of
regional significance.
The Borough also has notable concentrations of heathland,
ancient woodlands and acid grasslands associated with post
-
indust
rial habitats, which
are otherwise scarce within the county.
The natural environment provides many vital
ecosystem services to the Borough, such as natural flood defence, carbon sequestration
and the maintenance of biodiversity and air quality.
These ser
vices help to underpin the
local economy and make a valuable contribution to the quality of life of its
residents.
2.18
North Warwickshire has a high level of energy consumption with 61% being used by
transport (particularly caused by the high
levels of petroleum consumption), 25% by
industrial uses and 13% by domestic (Source Quality of Life 2009 page
99).
2.19
With a number of mineral reserves within the Borough there are a number of quarries.
Early consideration of beneficial after uses of m
ineral sites needs to be undertaken.
Where development is proposed on land with mineral reserves consideration must be
given to the extraction of the mineral before development takes place in accordance with
national guidance
.
In accordance with the emerg
ing Warwickshire Minerals Plan,
submitted for examination on 29 November 2019,
the
Council will not support surface
minin
g
operations especially where it will have a direct effect on local residents and an
adverse environmental impact.
2.20
North Warwicks
hire contains a number of major hazard sites and pipelines.
Whilst they
are subject to stringent controls under existing health and safety legislation, it is12
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
Villages & Hamlets
Cou
ntryside
considered prudent to control the kinds of development permitted in the vicinity of these
install
ations.
There are therefore consultation zones for each major hazard site and
pipeline. In determining whether or not to grant planning permission for a proposed
development within these consultation zones, the Borough Council will consult the
Health and
Safety Executive to determine the risks for the proposed development.
2.21
As mentioned above the Borough of North Warwickshire is made up of a number of
different settlements each with their own characteristics but sometimes showing similar
issues.
The
County Council has prepared Locality Profiles for the Borough which divides
the Borough into four areas to coincide with the Area Forum Boundaries.
2.22
There are a number of other settlements, without a development boundary, that do not
have the same range of services and facilities but provide significantly to community life
within the Borough.
With the emphasis in the past for development to be targete
d at the
main settlements (Atherstone/ Mancetter and Polesworth/Dordon, as identified by the
Warwickshire Structure Plan, 1989) it put the smaller villages in a difficult position in that
they were losing services and facilities without the support of the
planning policies, to
recognise their importance to the rural nature of the Borough.
Local requirements have
changed as the residents of the countryside have changed, but there are many people
who live in the smaller settlements and the countryside, who h
ave difficulty accessing
services/facilities and affordable housing.
Local planning policies should allow for these
needs to be catered for in a sensitive and innovative way.
Such settlements include
Middleton, Corley, Lea Marston and Furnace End.
2.23
With the Borough covering over 110 square miles and with over 50 settlements ranging
in size from the largest conjoined settlement of Atherstone and Mancetter having a
population of 10,000 to places with a few houses, means that the countryside plays an
im
portant role in the Borough.
Many small settlements do not have a development
boundary but are important to the local communities.
The countryside gives the rural
context in which all other things operate. Its landscape is diverse and
varied.
2.24
There are three major private estates of Packington, Blythe and Merevale, which have
influenced the landscape of the Borough.
Agriculture is a major influence on the
character of the
Borough.
2.25
Within the countryside there are
7
golf courses, includin
g The Belfry and the Forest of
Arden; major tourist attractions, such as Kingsbury Water Park; as well as more local
facilities.
A thriving rural economy is important to the Borough.
However, a balance
needs to be struck between allowing development that
is appropriate in terms of scale
and character, whilst protecting and emphasising the rural context of the Borough.13
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
3.1
It is clear that there are a number of cross cu
tting issues that have consistently been
highlighted or raised throughout the development of this
Plan.
3.2
Access is an important issue in respect of both the physical means of accessing services
and facilities, as well as accessing education,
employment, debt/benefits advice/health
services, leisure and recreation and housing provision and support
.
This issue is
exacerbated by an increasing elderly population, higher than expected adverse health
issues, cross cutting the generations (obesity/sm
oking/drinking/infant death rates) and
increased fuel costs impacting on fuel poverty and transport costs. These raise major
implications and potential pressures for future service needs and how to address the
form and location of their provision and how t
hose who need those services can access
them
3.3
Flood risk is an issue in a number of locations within the Borough as identified in the
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, most notably along the River Tame, River Anker River
Blythe, River Cole and associate
d tributaries.
The presence of formal flood defences
across North Warwickshire Borough is concentrated in the Coleshill Area where the
River Tame, Cole, Blythe and Bourne converge.
A number of locations have been
identified by the Environment Agency and
Warwickshire County Council where flood
alleviation works may provide benefits to local communities.
Future development needs
to be located outside areas of greatest risk in line with the Sequential Approach outlined
within the NPPF and PPG, with mitigati
on designed into all schemes to ensure they are
safe from the effects of flooding, do not increase the risk of flooding elsewhere and
reduce flood risk where possible.
Flood risk should be considered for the lifetime of the
development (considering the im
pact of climate change, guidance on which is available
from the Environment Agency based on latest UKCP projections).
3.4
There are also strong links with the armed forces community, with approximately 6300
forces veterans living within the Borough.
This
community faces a number of issues in
terms of health, support services and housing and the Borough recognises this and is
actively involved as a signatory to the Armed Forces
Covenant.
3.5
The Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) recognises that with li
mited resources,
partnership working needs to be more focussed in order to ensure delivery.
This is not
to say that other issues are less important to either individual organisations, or groups of
organisations, which can be tackled outside of the SCS are
na.
It has therefore focussed
on three priorities that it considers the North Warwickshire Community Partnership (the
Local Strategic Partnership) as a whole can be effective at delivering results.
These
are:
1.
Raising aspirations, educational attainment a
nd
skills
2.
Healthier
Communities
3.
Transport, Access and
Communications
3.6
In terms of the Local Plan the aim is to look at spatial linkages to these issues.
For
example there are clear links between issues of poor health, obesity and open
space/recreation provision, education and the skills gap, rural transport and isolation and
where the opportunities and needs are for seeking planning gain or financial
contributions from any proposed commercial/housing
developments.
3.7
The Borough has,
is and will continue to look for ways of tackling these issues.
This will
be through a range of opportunities including, the LEADER programme, the Borough’s
Community Hubs, Section 106 contributions, as well as continuing to work with a range
Chapter

Issues14
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
Delivery of infrastructure
of partners from the public, private and voluntary sectors.
The Local Plan c
an assist in
ensuring a lasting legacy from any development that takes
place.
3.8
A further issue has also been identified which is connected to the above but is much
broader and that is the delivery of
all forms of
infrastr
ucture to ensure that developments
work for both existing and future residents and businesses.
The growth now being
envisaged has brought this issue to the fore.
This Plan seeks to ensure that the
implications of growth within and outside the Borough
is
considered comprehensively
and not in a piecemeal way.
Working with partners and our neighbours will be key to
ensuring that infrastructure is
secured
and
delivered
in an appropriate and timely manner
alongside housing and employment growth
.
3.9
In conclusion the list below summarises the key qualities that makes North Warwickshire
unique:
1
Quality of its natural and historic environment.
The Borough has a pleasant rural
character distinct from its growing urban neighbours with a large number of
natural and historic assets.
There are 10 Conservation Areas, over 600 listed or
Scheduled Monum
ents and buildings, as well as many wildlife and geological
sites of varying
designations.
2
The Borough has a number of unique biodiversity habitats and species that are
only or predominantly found in the Borough, such as
heathland.
3
Dispersed settlement
s.
There are over 50 settlements within the Borough,
ranging from Market Towns to small hamlets, each with a different
character.
4
Mix of architectural styles.
Whilst there is no distinctive Borough
-
wide building
style there are very local styles either
in character or in form that leads to places
being very different from one
another.
5
Former mining legacy.
The Borough had a number of mines and there are still

The Borough has some unique transport issues. It has national road and rail
routes going through the Borough
–
M6, M6 (Toll), M42 and West Coast Mainline.
The A5 itself is a unique part of the
Borough. It is a road which is multi
-
functional,
serving a national as well as a local requirement.  High Speed Rail will bring with
it its own unique issues. However
,
access to jobs and training is still an
issue.

A range of major employers.
The Borou
gh is the location for national and
regional headquarters of both national and international companies with two rail
freight facilities, which is unusual for such a relatively small Borough. In addition
,
the Borough is close to the Enterprise Zone at the M
IRA Technology Park.
So
what makes North Warwickshire unique?15
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted September 2021
4.1
This
leads
us
to
the
Spatial
Vision
for
the
Local
Plan.
This Vision builds on the
Community Strategy Vision and gives it a spatial
dimension.
4.2
The Spatial Vision for the Borough is
thus:
Rural North Warwickshire: a co
mmunity of communities. A place where people want to
live, work and visit, now and in the future, which meets the diverse needs of existing and
future residents is sensitive to the local environment and contributes to a high quality of
life. A place which
is safe and inclusive, well planned, built and run and offers equality of
opportunity and good services for
all.
The rural character of North Warwickshire will be retained and reinforced to ensure that
when entering the Borough it is
distinctive from the surrounding urban areas.
The Borough will accommodate development in a balanced and sustainable way, placing
a high priority on quality of life, ensuring the protection, restoration and enhancement of
valuable natural and historic res
ources and providing the necessary supporting
infrastructure.
New homes, new employment proposals, local services and community facilities will be
integrated carefully into the Borough’s existing areas respecting local distinctiveness.
The majority of the
development will be focused on the Market Towns and Local Service
Centres.
Employment generation will benefit local residents and ensure long lasting benefits to
the Borough, including improved skills, reducing out commuting and regeneration of
industria
l estates where appropriate.
Housing catering for the needs of residents will be provided in order to give choice of
tenure and location and will be located to take advantage of good public transport
accessibility and to help maintain and enhance the vita
lity and viability of settlements.
Existing communities will retain their distinctiveness and identity through good quality,
inclusive design. New development will be designed to a high quality following urban
design, sustainable development and construct
ion principles and giving high importance
to the public realm as well as good access and provision of Green Infrastructure, open
space, sports and recreational facilities.
Important natural and historic areas and buildings help to create the distinctive c
haracter
and identity of the Borough and its settlements are protected and enhanced.

North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
6.1
When considering development proposals that accord with policies in the Local Plan, the
National Planning Policy Framework is also a material consideration.
As delivery of the
Local Plan is very important to the Co
uncil it will take a positive approach that reflects the
presumption in favour of sustainable development.
The Borough Council will always work
proactively with applicants and other stakeholders jointly to seek solutions which mean
that proposals can be a
pproved wherever possible, and to secure development which
sustainably improves the economic, social and environmental conditions in North
Warwickshire.
6.
2
Place making is a key part of considering development proposals and making them
sustainable whatev
er their size.
There are two overarching elements that make
development proposals work for the long term. These are ensuring the development is of
a quality that is
long
-
lasting,
and that infrastructure is
provided.
Quality of Development / Place
6.
3
The quality of development is important and can be helped through early consideration of
the development.
This is particularly the case in considering the natural and historic
environment and how this will be dealt with.
Considering biodiversity at an ea
rly stage of
the planning process will assist in building in beneficial features to aid
biodiversity.
6.
4
The Council will work with and look to developers to contribute effectively to maintaining
and developing local Quality of Life and
assisting in the delivery of the Sustainable
Community Strategy, through high standards of development; the type and character of
buildings and uses proposed and from measures of the type set out below:

ensure that the impact of development on the social f
abric of communities is
considered and taken into
account;


seek to reduce social
inequalities;


address accessibility (both in terms of location and physical access) for all
members of the community to jobs, health, housing (particularly affordable
housing)
, education, shops, leisure and community
facilities;


take into account the needs of all the community, including particular requirements
relating to age, sex, ethnic background, religion, disability or income;


deliver safe, healthy and
attractive places to live;
and,


support the promotion of health and well
-
being by making provision for physical
activity including walking and
cycling.

6.
5
In addition to delivering suitable forms of development in appropriate locations, a main
objective
of the Core Strategy was to promote high quality development at all times.
This
continues in this Local Plan and policies in this Plan are formulated with this objective in
mind. Quality developments rely on a combination of factors including aesthetics o
f the
buildings; how water is dealt with and how development fits within the landscape, both
rural and urban.
Other policies play an equal part in the achievement of quality
developments such as how access is gained to a site and how cars and lorries are
treated
within a scheme.
All are crucial in achieving high quality developments within the
Borough and making places
work.
6.
6
The Design Council has developed the Building for Life (BfL)
1
standard, in conjunction
with the Home Builders Federation and is
supported by government as the standard for
the design quality on new homes. BfL provides a means of ensuring new housing meet
appropriate design standards; respect their setting and are sustainable, thus creating
quality
places.
Chapter
6
Sustainable
Development22
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
6.
7
The Borough Council will encourage the use of the BfL standard within new residential
developments. It will look to promote Building for Life and where appropriate, offer specific
guidance drawing on this initiative.
Consequently, the aim is to ensure tha
t all new
housing developments achieve a good standard of design as defined by the BfL standard
and serve the needs of the existing and future
residents.
6.
8
Ensuring high quality design across the commercial and industrial sector is equally as
important.
Many elements of the BfL standard apply to non
-
domestic buildings and the
Council will seek that development achieves a good
standard.
6.
9
The Council recognises the importance of planning development to reduce the opportunity
for crime, including terrorism.
Whilst crime levels across the Borough are generally lower
than other areas of the West Midlands, design should ensure such figures are
maintained
and further lowered where possible. The fear of crime especially at night is still an issue.
The Borough Council will use the Secured by Design
2
principles, which are widely
accepted to contribute to lowering crime
rates.
6.
10
North Warwicksh
ire is made up of a number of communities and thus there are very
differing styles.
With the Borough having over 50 settlements it is important that the local
distinctiveness is reflected in any developments.
This is particularly important in
settlements
that for the settlement hierarchy have a co
-
joined settlement boundary.
This
does not detract from the fact that these places consider themselves separate with each
having their unique
identities.
6.
11
The Landscape Character Appraisal and individual Se
ttlement Appraisals have been
carried out and will be developed further into Supplementary Planning Documents and
should be used as the basis for creating locally distinctive proposals.
The Landscape
Character Assessment identified landscape sensitivity a
reas surrounding settlements and
these will be used when assessing impacts from developments.
The Borough Council
has Design Champions and they will be used to promote and encourage local
distinctiveness in new
developments.
6.
12
Development can adversel
y affect public rights of ways
.
Therefore
,
the Council wants to
ensure that public rights of way, where relevant to the development proposed, are
protected and enhanced (including via relocation or alternative provision where justified).
6.
13
Planning applications should be submitted with evidenc
e to show how the design, scale
and layout match the historic pattern of the surrounding development, its built form,
density and overall
appearance.
Implementation and Infrastructure
6.
14
The delivery of infrastructure at the right time and in the right place will be essential to the
success and delivery of developments for this Local Plan.
Infrastructure can range from
the provision of services and facilities to the provision of the open
spaces to the provision
of emergency services and waste collection services serving new homes.
Considerable
importance is attached to the need to ensure that existing and future local communities in
North Warwickshire have reasonable access to a range of
services and
facilities.

15
A number of factors underpin the importance of planning agreements and Section 106
contributions in North
Warwickshire:

The area is
relatively remote with a small but dispersed population and this has an
impact on the cost of service
provision.


The Borough Council has a history of working in partnership with developers to
secure and deliver local benefits through the Planning
process.


The area does not benefit from any significant UK, regional nor EU regeneration
regimes.


There are significant public concerns to ensure the impacts of development are
mitigated.


Again, there is public concern to maintain the provision of local services th
at are
vital to community
life.


Limited Council resources reflecting a small and rural
population.


6.16
In the context of planning for the growth of an area, infrastructure can be defined as
physical development needed to support communities and
which directly relates to
ec
onomic development and regeneration. This includes:

Transport Networks
-
Pedestrian facilities, roads, public transport, cycle ways;

Health Facilities
-
Hospitals, care provision, GP and dentist surgeries

Education
-
Schools, hi
gher education, research infrastructure;


Contributions towards infrastructure provision will be sought through appropriate use of
planning conditions and obligations in accordance with national policy and associated
Planning Practice Guidance, and statute
6.
19
Alongside this Local Plan is an Infrastructure Delivery Plan.
This sets out the known
infrastructure requirements to accomm
odate the growth within the Borough.
This will be
updated on a regular basis.
The Plan will feed into a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)
which is a new planning charge that came into force on 6 April 2010 through the
Community Infrastructure Levy Regu
lations 2010 (now amended by the Community
Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) Regulations 2011).
The Borough Council will work with
partners to develop a Community Infrastructure Levy charging schedule as well as seek
alternative funding opportunities.
Both
S106 obligations and CIL will need to have regard
to viability issues to ensure the level of levy set or obligations sought does not prevent the
delivery of development in
general.24
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
6.
20
The policies give a framework within which assessments of S106, CIL or other legal
agreements will be made.
These will be supplemented, where necessary, over time by
further advice in the form of guidance notes and Supplementary Planning Documents.
Futur
e Growth
6.
21
The Borough Council recognises that the pressure for growth will extend beyond 2033
and that this needs to be considered at an early stage.
It will explore with partners and
stakeholders’
options for future growth of the Borough beyond 2033
to ensure options are
explored and the required infrastructure is provided in a timely manner.
This will enable a
wide range of options to be explored, ensure infrastructure and the funding of it will be
provided accordingly and that places are created t
hat are
sustainable.

Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Plan (and where relevant, with other
development plan
policies
including those
in Neighbourhood Plans) will be approved without
delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.
Where there are no relevant
development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for
determining the
application are out

Quality of Development /
Place
All development proposals
must;

be supported by
the required
infrastructure

be consistent with the approach to place
making set out through development
management policies, including, where relevant

integrate appropriately with the natural and historic environment, protecting and
enhancing rights of way network where appropriate

demonstrate a high quality of
sustainable design that positively improve the individual
settlement’s character; appearance and environmental quality of an
area;

deter
crime;

sustain, conserve and enhance the historic
environment
;

provide, conserve and enhance biodiversity;
and,

create linkages between green spaces
, wildlife sites
and corridors.
Development should protect the existing rights of way network and where possible contribute to
its expansion and management.
Implementation and Infrastructure
Infrastructure will be sought where it is necessary, directly related to the development and is fairly and
reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.
It may be related to social, economic and/or
environmental issues. Supplementary Planning G
uidance and documents will be used to guide
provision, Infrastructure requirements are outlined in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (For clarity,
infrastructure projects drawn from the IDP are itemised and indicated to be either critical to the Plan’s
stra
tegy as a whole, or necessary in association with particular allocations or projects, along with
indicative timings are itemised in NWBC26, Appendix A) and the supporting documents contained in
Appendix C of the Local Plan.
The list is not exhaustive as e
ach will be taken on a site by site basis
and will depend on the viability of the scheme.
Other site specific measures will be considered at the
time of the planning permission.
These will be secured through conditions, S106’s or other
agreements conside
red appropriate to ensure its delivery. It will be necessary to ensure the ongoing
maintenance, where appropriate, of any infrastructure provision.25
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Where development is proposed in excess of plan requirements and would assist in the provision of or
enab
ling infrastructure, particularly that related to facilitating development in the long term, or of
affordable housing relative to needs, that will carry weight in favour of granting permission.26
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted

Chapter
7
Spatial
Strategy
7.1
The Local Plan sets out
the long term strategic policies and proposals. It identifies a
Borough
-
wide pattern of development and sets out the sites to bring forward the required
development.
7.2
The Spatial Strategy is a key component of the Local Plan for delivering a sustainabl
e
way of living and working and considering the appropriate distribution for development.
It seeks to allow development to take place in a controlled pattern throughout the
Borough.
The pattern of development has been influenced by considering how the
Bo
rough functions, as well as the impact of surrounding cities and towns.
Future
development will take place in accordance to the size of the settlement taken, with its
range of services and facilities and is influenced by considering if the settlement is i
n or
outside of the Green Belt.
This will mean that the majority of development will take place
in the larger settlements, with more limited development in the smaller rural settlements
and in particular those not in the Green Belt.
This will benefit tho
se who currently live,
work and visit the Borough and future generations and ensure that development is
directed to the most appropriate
place.
A constraints map is attached as Appendix
N
.
7.3
The Local Plan’s approach is still to steer most development to the Main Towns and then
in a cascade approach in other settlements with very little development towards the
countryside.
A limited amount of development is targeted to the smaller settlements
which follow the recommendations of the Matthew Taylor Report which advocated more
development in the rural areas, to assist in maintaining the vitality of the rural
settlements.
7.4
The Matthew Taylor Review on the Rural Economy and Affordable Housing s
howed that
historically, settlements can grow
incrementally,
and this can help to maintain the
balance between restraint and the continuing vitality of the settlements.
In the Core
Strategy this approach was widened to consider the holistic development of
services and
facilities to help maintain and enhance thriving communities.
The constant aim is to
provide these in the most sustainable
way,
without it stimulating pressure on the
countryside, in particular, the Green Belt to make suitable provision for development
necessary to sustain rural communities, by focussing rural housing development and
supporting facilities on a network of Local Serv
ice Centres, but with limited development
provision in other smaller settlements, identified with a development boundary on the
Policies
Map.
Elsewhere, other than where specifically provided for in the Plan,
development will be limited to that requisite
for agriculture, forestry or other uses that can
be shown to require a rural location.
This Local Plan carries this forward.
7.5
The difficulty arises in determining how much development should be allowed in the
smaller settlements, particularly as 60% o
f North Warwickshire is within the Green Belt.
For example, it has been estimated to warrant an additional primary class that over 150
new dwellings would be required. In many locations this is not feasible when trying to
balance the needs of the local co
mmunity, the protection of the local environment, the
character of the settlement/landscape and ensuring that the development is as
sustainable as possible.
To keep a village shop profitable is indeterminable, as
changing shopping habits can easily skew t
his. In some locations a

In these
instances
,
however, it is not just seeing shops as shops, but it is the need to protect
those premises as a community asset w
ith wider potential.
7.6
Atherstone with Mancetter and Polesworth with Dordon, are the Main Towns.
Coleshill
is also recognised as a Market Town due to its range of services and facilities
,
but27
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
development will be smaller in scale due to the Green Belt w
rapping around the
settlement.
There are five Local Service Centres located throughout the Borough, which
provide important local services and facilities.
Housing growth has generally been
distributed to the Market Towns (including Coleshill) and then to
Local Service Centres.
In settlements, villages and hamlets beyond these, development that provides for local
housing needs and help support local services will be
permitted.
7.7
The amount of development now being envisaged means that the Borough
Council has
had to consider whether it is appropriate or possible that all the required development
can fit into this settlement hierarchy.
As the hierarchy underpins many of the policies
within the Plan it is important to ensure there is flexibility to e
nsure development is
delivered.
As a result
,
it is considered necessary to allow developments that may be on
the outer boundary of the Borough that are close to sustainable settlements outside of
the Borough such as Tamworth and
Nuneaton.
7.8
This Local
Plan allocates strategic and non
-
strategic housing sites. Further allocations
may come forward through Neighbourhood Development Plans, prepared by Parish
Councils.
All development proposals from housing, employment and retail will be
expected to accord w
ith the settlement hierarchy and be proportionate to the size and
scale of the
settlement.
7.9
Although in the past it was only local affordable housing that could be supported in the
smaller settlements, now a small proportion of market housing as well as affordable has
been allocated to some of the smaller settlements in order to assist with maint
aining the
vitality of these smaller communities.
So
,
in smaller settlements small scale housing
developments that help regenerate and support the rural economy or meet proven
affordable housing needs (via a local housing needs assessments) can still be
c
onsidered.  If plan monitoring shows that this distribution is not being maintained
through planning permissions, the position will need to be redressed through a revision
to this
policy.
7.10
In the Core Strategy it was suggested that in Category 4 settl
ements
,
sites would
normally be no larger than 10 units at any one time.
The reason behind this was to
ensure small communities were not swamped by new developments but could grow
organically and naturally to be sustainable.
This is still the case and co
ntinues to be the
stance of the Council.
However
,
it is clear in the production of this Plan that sites that
have been put forward for development are not the smaller incremental sites and tend to
be larger.
For this reason
,
there are some allocations th
at are larger. In these cases the
Borough Council will discuss phasing options where viability
permits.
7.11
Work is continuing at a sub
-
regional level with neighbouring authorities to develop a
Sub

This will build on the work
already carried out and will
reflect
issues
arising
from
the
creation
of
the

(CWLEP).
It is not expected that this work will alter the specific
Spatial Strategy for North
Warwickshire.
LP2
Settlement
Hierarchy
Development within the Borough will be
proportionately
distributed
and be of a scale that
is
in
accordance with the Borough’s settlement hierarchy.
Development will be commensurate with
the level, type and quality of day to day
service provision currently available and the ability of
those services to absorb the level of development in combination with any planned allocations in
this Local Plan and committed development in liaison with service providers.28

All Development
In all other locations
development will not generally be acceptable, albeit as set out above that
there may be some instances where development may be appropriately located and would
enhance or maintain the vitality of rural communities under this category.
Special circumstanc
es
should exist to justify new isolated homes in the countryside such as rural workers’ needs, the
optimal viable use of a heritage asset, the re
-
use of redundant buildings enhancing its immediate
setting, the subdivision of an existing residential dwellin
g, or development of exceptional quality
or innovative design or for rural exception sites in line with national planning policy.
All such
development will be considered on its merits and with regard to other policies in this plan.
Green Belt
7.12
National Green Belt policy operates over two thirds of the Borough.
Within Green Belts
the primary aim is to maintain the open nature of the area and there is a general
presumption against development that is inappropriate, except in very special
circumst
ances.
The National Planning Policy Framework provides the strategic policy
guidance.
It gives advice on where and what development is appropriate or inappropriate
in the Green Belt.
This policy builds on the NPPF, provides the local context and provide
s29
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
how it will be implemented in certain
instances.
7.13
The pressure on the Borough from surrounding urban areas needs to be considered
in the
context of protections accorded to the Green Belt, and how areas of the Green Belt
perform relative to the funct
ions for Green Belt
. Two studies have been carried out relating
to the Green
Belt.
7.14
The first relates to how broad areas and parcels of land perform in relation to the five
purposes of Green Belt as defined by the NPPF.
3
The Joint Green Belt Study hig
hlighted
some areas as relatively poor performing in some aspects of the purposes of Green Belt.
Taking into account the needs of the Borough, the pressures for further development and
the environmental impacts it is considered some of these sites will be
either allocated now
for development or safeguarded for development as and when required whether in this
Plan period or the next. This is explained further in this
Plan.
7.15
The maintenance of the Green Belt is seen as a vital component in protecting an
d
enhancing the Borough as an area of pleasant countryside, especially by preventing the
incursion of nearby urban areas.
It is not just the wholeness of the Green Belt designation
that is important but having defensive boundaries.
As a result
,
a second
Study of the
Green Belt has been carried out looking at the future boundaries of the Green Belt in
relation to the outer limits and the detailed boundaries around settlements.
4
The study has
been undertaken to look at ensuring that the boundaries continue
to be defensible and
follow clear physical features.
The detailed boundaries of the Green Belt are shown on
the
Policies
Map.
7.16
It is accepted that settlements surrounded by the Green Belt have smaller scale
opportunities than those outside the Green
Belt. This is in essence the role of the Green
Belt, in protecting the openness between places.
However
,
there may be opportunities for
limited infill and redevelopment in villages still washed over by the Green Belt designation.
Two settlements exhibit
a clear,
focused
and cohesive settlement pattern with limited infill
potential.
Middleton and Lea Marston are considered to have the potential for one or
two
true infill plots.
Therefore
,
infill boundaries have been drawn to indicate where infill and
limited redevelopment would be permitted and are shown on the
Policies
Map.
7.17
It must be stressed that a Green Belt Infill Boundary is not the same as a Development
Boundary.
A Green Belt
Infill boundary is only intended to accommodate that type of
development defined as “infill” or “infilling”.
The policy defines “limited” through the use of
a boundary rather than by a number or indeed leaving the matter open to interpretation on
a
case
-
by
-
case
basis.
This is the same approach adopted for settlement and town centre
boundaries.
The village however remains “washed over” by Green Belt and development
within the village continues to be controlled by National and Local Green Belt policy.
Th
e
restriction on development classed as “inappropriate” within a Green Belt therefore still
applies.
A Development Boundary however excludes the area within it from the Green
Belt and its policy constraints.
It establishes the principle for development a
nd enables all
types of development to be accommodated (site availability and other policies permitting).
This includes redevelopment of existing buildings and plots, such as the demolition of
large properties in large plots or the redevelopment of garden
areas for higher density
housing
proposals.

North Warwickshire Green Belt Study 201630
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
7.18
One exception to the principle that construction of new buildings are
inappropriate
development in the Green Belt is where a building is replaced, providing the new building
is in the same use and not materially larger than the one it replaces.
Another is limited
infilling or complete redevelopment of previously developed s
ites where that would not
have a greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt.
A further exception is an
extension or alteration which is not disproportionate relative to the size of the original
building.
7.19
It is not considered that the NPPF alone is all that is necessary for the management of
new development proposals in North Warwickshire’s Green Belt.
The spatial vision and
the strategic objectives set out in the Core Strategy 2014 and this Local Plan, em
phasise
that it is the rural character of North Warwickshire that distinguishes it from its neighbours.
That character is to be retained by safeguarding that countryside and protecting its
openness from encroachment.
The Council therefore has to have rob
ust and consistent
policies to implement these objectives.
The NPPF provides the background to do so, but
it lacks definition when it comes to some of the details of handling planning applications.
The policy below provides that definition as the alterna
tive would be to rely on the wording
of the NPPF and thus determine each application on its merits.
This could result in an
inconsistent approach, but on the other hand the use of stricter definitions should not be
seen as
prescriptive.
7.20
In particula
r it is some of the adjectives used in the NPPF that are considered to lack
precision and it is the purpose of the policy below to make these explicit.
It therefore
addresses the main definition issues that are likely to arise when dealing with new
develo
pment proposals in the Green Belt.
There are two key quantitative adjectives
“disproportionate” and “materially larger”.
In addition
,
it is considered necessary to
considered how previously developed land is dealt with. These are explained
below.
7.21
The present saved 2006 Local Plan policy ENV13 includes
that extensions within the
Green Belt will be considered against
a figure of 30% as a guide in order to assist in the
assessment as to whether extensions are disproportionate or not.
This has be
en applied
consistently since that Plan
was
adopted; it is well understood, it has been upheld
throughout that period on appeal, and it has impacted on new development proposals.
It
is not considered that there is reason to vary this figure.
However
,
the
policy below does
address a constant issue arising with its use and that is the relationship with permitted
development rights.
Each application will be dealt with on its merits against this policy.
However
,
there may be circumstances whereby larger ext
ensions might be deemed
acceptable.
Examples could include the existing building’s setting, proximity and
relationship with other buildings; its prominence in the landscape and whether there would
be a substantial improvement in the overall design of the
building.
These considerations
would also need to be assessed against the 30% figure set out in the
policy.
7.22
The figure of 30%
will also be used as a guide
where it relates to replacement houses in
the Green Belt.
However
,
because of the different definitions in the NPPF
–
“disproportionate” and “materially larger” there could be case for different quantitative
figures.
The term “not materially larger” migh
t suggest a lesser amount of development
than “disproportionate”.
This is why it is also important to assess each application on its
merits using the same considerations as set out above where appropriate.
An additional
consideration would be to look at
the merits of replacing a building either on the same
footprint as the existing or
another.
7.23
It is considered that the use of a quantitative measure in these instances is a very useful
indicator as to what the Council considers to be the meaning of th
ese adjectives.
Given
the importance of retaining the Green Belt to the Council and to the consistent successful
use of the measure since the adoption of the 2006 Local Plan, it is considered that it31
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
should be
retained.
7.24
The NPPF gives guidance on ho
w to deal with applications for the partial or complete
redevelopment of previously developed land.
Redevelopment within the lawful use
of
the
previously developed land is acknowledged as being appropriate development.
A
redevelopment proposal for an alt
ernative use that is itself appropriate within the Green
Belt by definition in the NPPF is clearly acceptable.
Other development proposals are still
appropriate development by virtue of the NPPF, but other material planning
considerations may have to be c
onsidered in the final planning balance.
LP3
Green
Belt
Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be
approved except in very special circumstances. Other than in instances where allocations are
proposed, Green Belt within the Borough will be protected accordingly. The following criteria set
out how Green Belt applies to land and settlements in North Warwickshire, whether named in
LP2 or not, with development management policy/policies for the Gre
en Belt set out
subsequently.
1
The outer extent of the Green Belt as well as the detailed development boundaries
for the
settlements identified in Policy LP2
are shown on the
Policies
Map
2.
Areas within Development Boundaries are excluded from the
Green
Belt.
3.
Limited infilling in settlements washed over by the Green Belt will be allowed within the
infill boundaries as defined on the
Policies
Map
.
4.
L
imited infilling may also be acceptable where a site is clearly part of the built form of a
settlement,
i.e. where there is substantial built development around three or more sides of
a site
.
5.
Settlements surrounded or washed over by the Green Belt will be able to pursue the
Community Right to Build
in accordance with the relevant statutory
requirements
.
When considering proposals within the Green Belt in addition to the NPPF, regard should
also be
had to the following
considerations:
a)
provision of appropriate facilities for outdoor sport, outdoor recreation and for cemeteries,
as long as it
preserves the openness of the Green Belt and does not conflict with the
purposes of including land within it, regard will be had to whether such proposals are of a
scale necessary for the efficient function of the parent use concerned and that they are
th
e minimum size necessary
b)
Extensions will be considered to be disproportionate
building
based on the merits of each
individual case. Both quantitative and qualitative criteria will be used in this assessment.
For the purposes of this policy, the original b
uilding is defined as that which was present
on 1 July 1948 or that which came into being after this date as a result of the original
planning permission,
i
.
e
.,
as built
and volume is defined as gross external volume
including basements and cellars.
c)
A rep
lacement building will be considered to be materially larger
based on the merits of
each individual case.
Both quantitative and qualitative criteria will be used in this
assessment
.
Replacements should be located on the same footprint as the existing
bui
lding unless there are material benefits to the openness of the Green Belt or, when
environmental and amenity improvements indicate otherwise.
For the purposes of this
policy, volume is defined as gross external volume including basements and
cellars.
d)
Consideration will be given to the removal of permitted development rights where the new
development is considered to be at the maximum scale acceptable to ensure the
openness of the Green Belt, or where other issues such as visual impact and impa
ct on
neighbouring residential amenity, are
material.32
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
e)
Relevant planning consideration, such as the sustainability of the location; landscape and
visual appearance or impact, the loss of employment land and impacts on general
amenity will all be
considered in the final planning balance in respect of proposals to
redevelop previously developed land within the Green
Belt.
Strategic Gap
7.
25
Polesworth with Dordon is one of the Market Towns in the Borough.
Due to its location it
has a close relationship with Tamworth. NW19 of the Core Strategy 2014 referred to a
strategic
gap between Polesworth and Dordon.
This was to avoid coalesce with
Tam
worth.
The Core Strategy however did not define where the boundaries of this area
would
fall
and it was expected that this would be through the emerging Site Allocations
Plan.
As this Local Plan has superseded the production of the Site Allocations Plan
it is
now included in this
Plan.
7.
26
A detailed technical study has been carried out to look at the area and to determine where
the detailed boundaries should be drawn.
A separate consultation was carried out by the
Council to consider the extent of the
“gap” and this has informed the designation as
shown on the
Policies
Map.
7.
27
Following the approval of the site at the south
-
eastern site of junction 10 M42 and A5 for
employment use the area south of the A5 is removed from the Meaningful Gap as
proposed in the Draft Site Allocations Plan and Draft Local Plan.
This means that any
consideration of a contiguous area linking the Green Belt northwards cannot be
considered.
The
Strategic
Gap north of the A5 is therefore free standing. Its purpose is
clear in that it is to maintain the gap, both visually and in landscape terms between t
he
urban areas of Polesworth, Dordon and
Tamworth.
7.
28
The purpose of policy
LP
4
is to retain and respect the separate identities and characters
of the settlements of Tamworth and Polesworth with Dordon to avoid their coalescence.
The Strategic Gap seeks to retain and maintain the sense of space, place and separation
between these settlements so that when travelling through the strategic gap (by all modes
of transport), a traveller should have a clear sense of having left the first
settlement,
having travelled through an undeveloped area and then entering the second settlement.
LP
4
Strategic Gap
In order to maintain the separate identity of Tamworth and Polesworth with Dordon, a Strategic
Gap is identified on the Policies Map in o
rder to prevent their coalescence.
Development
proposals will not be permitted where they significantly adversely affect the distinctive, separate
characters of Tamworth and Polesworth with Dordon.
In assessing whether or not that would
occur, considerat
ion will be given to any effects in terms of the physical and visual separation
between those settlements

Amount of Development
Housing Numbers
7.
29
National planning policy sets out the requirement for a local plan to identify and meet
housing needs including mix and tenure within the relevant housing market area. North
Warwickshire sits within two Housing Market Areas of Coventry & Warwickshire and
Greater Birmingham. This makes the picture of determining the housing requirement for
the
Borough more complicated. To establish the housing requirement for the Borough it
requires looking at the need for the Borough and then considering the housing
requirements of
neighbours.
Objectively Assessed Need (OAN)
7.3
0
The Coventry & Warwickshire
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (CWSHMA) has
been updated on a regular basis with the latest being in 2015.
That latest update
established a household projection
-
based housing needs figure for the Borough of 159
homes a year. It then looked at market
turnover, demographic trends and economic
factors, recommending an annual uplift of +4 homes, +27 and +47 homes respectively.
That amounts to 237 dwellings a year, or a total of 4,740 to 2031.
Economic uplift relates
to people moving to the Borough from
elsewhere, notably the Coventry and Warwickshire
Housing Market Area and Greater Birmingham Housing Market.
As the updated
CWSHMA is based on up
-
to
-
date demographic evidence as at 2011, the start of the plan
period, it takes account of housing delivery be
fore then.
Needs of Neighbours
7.3
1
The Borough has been working with neighbouring local authorities including those from
both Coventry & Warwickshire HMA and the Greater Birmingham HMA to produce and
agree the overall housing number for the area.
A M
emorandum of Understanding for
Coventry and Warwickshire includes a redistribution of housing due to capacity
constraints within the City of Coventry.
In addition, the Birmingham City Local Plan also
identifies a shortfall in housing provision.
The Borou
gh Council agreed through the Core
Strategy to deliver 500 dwellings for Tamworth Borough Council, which is within the
Greater Birmingham Housing Market Area.
The Local Plan additionally commits to
providing a further 413 homes for Tamworth Borough Council (i.e. 913 in total).
The work
has resulted in an updated Borough housing figure as shown in Table 1 below.
The Table
indicates the housing requirement for t
he Local Plan should be 9,598 dwellings between
2011 and 2033. This will be delivered through a stepped trajectory shown in Appendix B.
7.3
2
In assessing and forecasting the delivery of housing the Plan has utilised a stepped
trajectory.
This can be seen below

34
Due to the low past delivery rates and the rural nature of the Borough the delivery of all of
the housing will however be dependent on the provision of infrastructure.
The Local Plan
therefore seeks to deliver
infrastructure alongside housing to ensure th
at services and
facilities are provided and to ensure new developments are sustainable and add to the
viability of settlements.
7.
35
Monitoring will be carried out covering the supply of housing and completions of housing
within the Borough.
However jus
t as importantly will be the monitoring of the situation in
the Housing Market Areas and in particular Tamworth, Birmingham and Coventry.
It is
important that sites in North Warwickshire are not seen as “quick  wins”, which means that
sites in the other a
reas do not come forward for development.
This would be
unacceptable.
Employment Requirements
7.
36
With the abolition of the Regional Spatial Strategy the Borough Council has to consider its
employment land target.
Looking at the available evidence it has been decided to
continue with the target to equate to 11 hectares over a 5 year period.
Therefore
,
over the
Plan period this equates to a total of 60
hectares.
7.
37
The 2013 Employment Land Review (ELR) identified a need for 60 hectares for
employment needs and this was reflected in the 2014 Core Strategy.
At that time it was
understood that 2 hecta
res of land at Spring Hill Industrial Estate, Arley, would be lost
from employment use. The site has however remained in employment use and is now fully
used. The continued use of the land for employment purposes reduced the need to find
those 2 additional
hectares
elsewhere.
7.
38
Consultants have revisited the Employment Land Review providing the evidence to show
that there is still a need for 58 hectares (excluding 2 hectares at Spring Hill) of
employment land within the Borough.
The indications are tha
t this requirement will be
sufficient to deal with the minimum growth of 5280 dwellings.
Further employment land
will be required if further housing growth is possible.

between 2011 and

7.
39
Unlike during the preparation of the Core Strategy the Borough Council has now been
approached to deliver employment land for a neighbouring local authority.
Tamworth
Borough Council is seeking the Borough to deliver a proportion of 14 hectares in
partner
ship with Lichfield District Council.
A site allocation has been identified to satisfy a
part of these 14 hectares. Lichfield DC has confirmed that they are looking to provide for
the balance of 6.5 hectares in their emerging Local Plan.  As any additiona
l housing and
employment needs to be considered in balance and Tamworth lies within the Greater
Birmingham
HMA
any proportion delivered will be within the overall employment land
requirements and are not additional. This will avoid double
counting.
7.
40
W
ithin the Coventry & Warwickshire HMA consideration has been given to the
employment land requirements across the HMA.
As a result a Memorandum of
Understanding has been agreed on the delivery of additional employment land to address
a shortfall in provis
ion from Coventry City Council.
There
are
is
no additional land
requirements that the Borough must
consider.
7.4
1
In addition, since the preparation of the Core Strategy two studies
5
have made it clear that
there is a wider than local need for large sites.
This provision does not necessarily have
to be provided for within North Warwickshire.
The Borough Council will continue to work
with other local planning authorities to see what
opportunities there are around the East
and West Midlands to deal with this need.
There are large scale sites coming forward in
other areas such as Daventry, Market Harborough, North
-
West Leicestershire and South
Staffordshire.
It is considered more impo
rtant for the Borough to focus its attention on
widening the employment base and to build on the opportunities that the Horiba MIRA
Technology Park can provide and seek the provision of aspirational job opportunities
within the
Borough.
Gypsy, Travellers
and Travelling Show People
7.
42
The Government’s key objective for planning for housing is to ensure that everyone has
the opportunity of living in a decent home.
The Planning Policy for Travellers Sites, which
relates to Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Show people was published in
A
ugust 2015
.
This document should be read in conjunction with the NPPF which includes a commitment
to ensuring that the housing needs of members of the gypsy and traveller community and
the travelling show people’s community are
met.
7.
43
Appropriate rega
rd has been given to Gypsy and Travellers need through a Gypsy and
Traveller Accommodation assessment.
There are a number of private residential pitches
in the Borough.

That
, indicated there
was
a need for an additional 9 residential pitches (2 up to 2017, 3 up
to 2022, and 4 up to 2028) and up to 5 transit caravan pitches up to 2028.
A review of
that GTAA
has been completed which has identified a need for a minimum of 19
residential permanent pitches from 2019 to 2033.  This takes into account sites that have
secured planning permission, including a 12 pitch transit site since the 2013 Study.  The
2020 Stud
y will inform the production of a Gypsy & Traveller Development Plan
Document.
There
continues to be
no evidence of any requirement to provide pitches for
travelling show
people.

CBRE 2015 and West Midlands Strategic Sites Study 201536
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
7.
45
In order t
o provide for a range of small sites outside of the Green Belt, but close to
services and facilities, a site criteria policy is included in this Local Plan.
It follows the
principles of the settlement
hierarchy.
LP5
Amount of Development
Between
2011 and 2033 the Council will make provision for a minimum of:

9598 new dwellings,

100 hectares of employment land (subject to policy LP6), and

19 permanent
residential gypsy and traveller pitches between 2019 and 2033.
The actual amount of
development delivered over the Plan period will be governed by the provision
of infrastructure to ensure developments are sustainable.
Additional Employment Land
7.
46
Area A encompasses land covered by the Strategic Gap, designated Green Belt, and land
which is not in categories 1, 2, 3 or 4 of plan policy LP2.
This policy does not
automatically override other
policies but
recognises that there are particular locational
requirements specific to certain employment uses and economic benefits to addressing
needs in those locations.
As such, any weight accorded to proposed employment
provision by virtue of this policy will be considered in the context of the policies in the plan
as a whole in arriving at a balanced assessment.
LP6 Additional
Employment Land
Significant weight will be given in decision taking to supporting economic growth and productivity,
particularly where evidence demonstrates an immediate need for employment land, or a certain
type of employment land, within Area A on Figu
re 4.10 of the West Midlands Strategic
Employment Sites Study of September 2015 (or successor study) which cannot be met via
forecast supply or allocations. The relevant scheme will be required to demonstrate:
(i) access to the strategic highway network i
s achievable and appropriate,
(ii) the site is reasonably accessible by a choice of modes of transport,
(iii) it is otherwise acceptable, taking account of the living conditions of those nearby.37
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
8.1
The Borough Council is seeking to provide a variety of types and tenures of housing
throughout the
Borough but
will specifically seek the type and tenure to reflect the local
settlement. Information for this can be found in a variety of sources including the Strategic
Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) and Local Housing Needs

The Government is seeking to encourage and enable the provision of serviced plots for self
-
build and custom build to support development opportunities for individuals, association of
individuals and small to medium sized self
-
build and custom build developers
.
The
Government’s aim is to make this form of housing a mainstream housing option to diversify
the housing market and help meet housing
needs
.
8.

Development proposals will
therefore be encouraged to address the demand for serviced
self
-
build and custom
-
build plots.  Evidence of the demand for plots will be found in the
Council’s Self Build and Custom Build Register as well as indications of demand from other
secondary data s

building plots from individuals and local estate agents

The 2011 Census data for North Warwickshire records proportionally more people “limited a
lot” by health or disability a
t 9.3% than the County average of 7.7%, with fewer residents at
79.9% rating their health as good or very good when compared to the County average of
82%.
Similarly
,
North Warwickshire performs less well than the national and county
averages against a ran
ge of health indicators, and with the trend towards more aged (65+)
and one person households this along with the lower performing health indicators carries
implications for the demand for appropriate housing and delivery of a range of services (See
tables
3, 4 & 5).
8.
6
Increases in the proportions of unpaid care to 12.1% of the population and in hours of care
provided per week over (with the highest increases being those providing more than 19
hours per week a third of whom provide more than 50 unpaid ho
urs of care), reflect the
increases in health and/or disability in the North Warwickshire population noted above.
As
the population ages the role of carers will grow with implications for their support and needs
as well as those under care.
These key mes
sages highlighted through the Census health
indicators and County Council’s profiles for North Warwickshire identify and support the
need for development to provide an element of special needs housing and that the size, and
suitability of that housing shou
ld be adaptable to also reflect the potential longer term health
care implications and any potential carer accommodation needs that may arise.

Evidence suggests that developments should provide for special needs accommodation for
the elderly and for those with mobility issues.
The Borough has an ageing population.
It is
clear from the data available that the Borough has an ageing population wit
h also well over
20% considering they have bad or very bad ill health.
This evidence indicates that the type
of housing being developed in the Borough must reflect this
need.

The Borough Council will seek housing developments to be at a density of at least 30
dwellings per hectare.
However
,
this should not compromise the quality of proposals and it
attaches considerable importance to maintaining and improving the quality of th
e local
environment.
Within in the town centres in the Market Towns as defined
on
the
Policies
Map can accommodate a higher density of housing development.
For this reason, higher
densities, of 50 dwelling per hectare (dph) or more, may be considered app
ropriate in the
defined town centre areas.
LP7
Housing
Development
Housing developments will be required to:
Housing Mix
Provide for a variety of types and tenures that reflect the needs of the Borough and of the
settlement. Sites will be
expected to provide for a range of needs and opportunities including:

homes for those with mobility
issues;

homes for older
people;

homes for young people;
and

plots for custom /
self
-
builders
.
Older People
Independent living units for the over 55’s
will be a key way to provide for some of these needs.39
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Self
–
build and Custom Build
Development proposals should make serviced plots available for self
-
build to address relevant demand
identified in the Council’s Self and Custom Build register at the
time of the planning application, unless
that would be unfeasible on account of the nature of the development
proposed, its scale, or viability.
On larger sites plots should be spread across the development. Plots should be reasonably priced
reflecting pr
evailing market values.
Where
not taken up by
self
-
builders
or custom builders within three
years of becoming available can, having provided evidence to the Borough Council, be built out
as
general housing
.
Special Needs

Provide for an element of special needs housing. This will be sought in all
major
developments
and relative to evidence of need
(including the sites allocations included in
this Local Plan)

The amount of special needs housing sought will be expected to am
ount to 10% of the total
housing provision on the site concerned, but the precise quantity will be determined having
regard to site size, suitability, the economics of provision and the need to achieve a
successful development. All or part of the provision
may be absorbed within the  affordable
housing requirements of this
Plan.
Density
Housing is expected to be built at a net density of no less than 30 dwelling per hectare. In
and
around
town centres, net densities of 50 dwellings per hectare or more
may
be sought. In all cases
making more efficient use of land must not compromise the qu
ality of the environment.
Infrastructure
Provide for the necessary infrastructure. Development will only occur if the appropriate
infrastructure is available or can be made available.
Windfall Allowance
8.
9
A windfall site is one that has not been
specifically identified in the creation of the
development plan
but comes forward for development at a later date.
They are unforeseen
sites that cannot be allocated at the time of the production of the Local
Plan.
8.
10
Analysis has been carried out as t
o how many sites than have come forward since 2011
that
are not included as allocations in adopted Development Plans or sites considered in the
current SHLAA
.
This Plan seeks to allocate
where possible all
sites larger than 0.2 hectares
or more than 5 dwe
llings.
There is evidence that also indicates that sites larger than 0.2ha
that have not been considered in the SHLAA are still coming forward for development. In
addition, Policy LP2 of this Local Plan allows sites to come forward outside of the Green Be
lt
and directly adjacent development boundaries, if they are proportionate in scale to the
settlement it adjoins. This could lead to potentially larger sites than 0.2 hectares coming
forward.
8.
11
When combined the number of ‘windfall’ completions per an
num is currently averaging
119.5 units over recent years (2016
-
2018). Applying a 50% discount to this figure is
considered to be robust and justified approach and suggests a windfall figure of 60 units per
annum is reasonable. Windfall provision has been e
xpressed as a policy to reflect the
Council’s intention to maintain levels of such provision to provide flexibility and, in part, to
support the vibrancy of smaller settlements.40
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
LP8
Windfall
Allowance
A windfall allowance of
660 dwellings over the
Plan period is provided for which is equivalent to 60
dwellings per annum between monitoring years 2022
-
2033

Affordable Housing
8.
12
Generally affordable housing is defined as housing that is non
-
market for those whose need
is not met by the market.
National guidance indicates that this can include
a
wide
variety
of
delivery
methods
such
as
socially
rented
and
intermediate
housing.
Fo
llowing royal assent
of the Housing & Planning Act starter homes are now part of the affordable housing
definition. Further guidance is awaited on how this will impact on housing provision within
the
Borough.
8.
13
The Council undertook a Housing Market Assessment in 2013 to provide up to date
evidence and information for the Core Strategy. Affordable housing needs still remain high
with a need of
267
units per
annum
on a simple average, consistent with the minimum
r
equirement of 9,598 set out in policy
LP
5
.
8.1
4
The need for affordable housing as identified by this assessment is significant.
The analysis
further shows that the ratio of income to house prices/market rental in the Borough is such
that the greatest am
ount of need is for socially rented accommodation.
Since the adoption
of the 2006 Local Plan therefore “local affordable housing” for North Warwickshire has
related to the provision of socially rented housing provided by a Registered Social Landlord,
or h
ousing of a similar standard that is available at an equivalent or lower cost (in terms of
weekly or monthly repayments or rent).
The changes to the socially rented accommodation
is not the only provision of local affordable housing but it is a means of c
omparison to
ensure that the housing that is provided is affordable for those in housing need in North
Warwickshire.  However, nationally changes to the grant funding scheme introduced a new
type of home (Affordable Rented homes) with rents charged at up t
o 80% of market rents
and less secure tenancies than social tenancies.
Where affordable housing for rent is
provided as part of a development proposal it is expected that this will be primarily through
“affordable rent” properties unless social rent can b
e achieved viably through development
of Council or other public owned land and assets.
8.
15
Further changes to the Planning Policy Guidance through the Housing and Planning Act
have introduced an exception site policy which enables applications for devel
opment for
Starter Homes on under
-
used or unviable industrial and commercial land that has not been
currently identified for housing.
Starter Homes are new affordable housing products which
first
-
time buyers can purchase at a discount of at least 20% on t
he market value.
Such
properties are expected to be offered to people who have not previously been a home buyer
and want to own and occupy a home, and who are below the age of 40 at the time of
purchase.
It is noted that these affordable starter home pro
perties should be exempt from
any future community infrastructure levy and housing and tariff
-
style contributions to enable
developers to help deliver the discounted sale
price.
8.
16
Provision of affordable housing remains one of the main priorities for the future.
‘Right to
buy’/acquire has exacerbated the local situation leaving a dwindling supply of housing held
by the Council or Registered Social Landlords.
In villages with a pop
ulation of less than
3000 it is possible to curtail the right to acquire from Registered Social Landlords (RSL’s).
Thresholds and percentages are justified and pursued in the Plan and sites will be identified
to provide exclusively for affordable housing.41
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
8.
17
In terms of delivery of housing sites the Borough Council has been working with the Homes
& Communities Agency and other local authorities in the sub
-
region to prepare a Local
Investment Plan (LIP).
This includes a list of priority sites that it wi
ll pursue with Registered
Social Landlords and the private sector to deliver.  In addition, the Borough Council itself
has built affordable units and will pursue this again where possible, by looking to its own and
other public sector land to unlock furthe
r
opportunities.
8.
18
Any local affordable housing will have a cascade of eligibility from local ward up to Borough
level.
It is important that the housing provided caters for the local affordable housing need
and that this is maintained as such.
In the
first place, priority will be given to those who
currently live or work in the ward where the development is taking place. Secondly, the
needs of those living in adjacent wards will be considered, followed then by the wider needs
of the Borough.
Those wh
o have been offered a job with a permanent contract in North
Warwickshire and need to move into the
area but
cannot afford a house will also be eligible
if they can provide proof of the job
offer.
8.
19
Each housing site will be expected to provide for housing in order to meet the target of 20,
30 or 40% of housing to be affordable depending on the type and size
of site over the plan
period.
The Borough Council will seek provision of affordable housing primarily through
onsite provision as set out in policies LP9 and LP7.
Consequently, in recognition of the
current definition of affordable housing in planning p
olicy, the requirement that 15% of
affordable homes be intermediate is indicative and may legitimately differ based on
appropriate evidence.
The methodology in the Affordable Housing Viability Report will be
used to calculate any financial contribution. I
n all cases viability issues will determine the
nature and scale of
provision and
reflect any National planning policy requirements.
Planning conditions will be imposed or planning obligations be sought for social or
affordable rental provision, in order
to ensure that the affordable housing provision is
provided, in a way that meets local needs and is locally affordable in perpetuity.
Innovative
ways of providing affordable housing will need to be pursued and may involve combining
commuted sums from a nu
mber of developments that collectively, can provide a viable sum
and the availability of a suitable site to provide affordable housing elsewhere in the
Borough.
8.
20
Housing sites will be dealt with on a comprehensive rather than piecemeal basis to ensure
that the affordable housing requirement of each site is met.
This means that where sites
come forward at different stages but are clearly part of a larger site they will be treated as if
they are part of the larger site.
Such land will usually be identi
fied, but not always, through
the use of the same access point or, the planning unit is clearly larger than applied for or,
boundaries are not artificially drawn;
or
boundaries follow clear boundaries and, is likely to
be adjoining parcels of land.
This w
ill avoid situations where there are incremental
increases in numbers thus avoiding the requirements of this policy.
LP9 Affordable Housing Provision
All major developments will provide at least
30% of housing provided on
-
site will be affordable
except in the case of Greenfield (previously agricultural use) sites where 40% on
-
site provision will
be required.
Where on
-
site affordable housing provision is not possible
a financial contribution in l
ieu of
providing affordable housing on
-
site may be considered only if.

There is clear evidence to support it being provided elsewhere;

It is capable of being delivered elsewhere; and,

It is ca
lculated using the methodology outlined in the Affordable Housi
ng42
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Viability report or subsequent updated document and is broadly equivalent to on
-
site
provision.
On sites of over 100 dwellings consideration will be given to land being gifted to the Borough
Council in lieu of the total affordable housing
provision. The amount of land will equate sufficient
land to provide for the number of units and any associated works.
The Council and other partners will continue to maximise numbers of affordable housing on other
sites.
Proposals to provide less than
the targets set out above should be supported by a viability
appraisal to verify that the targets cannot be met and the maximum level that can be provided
without threatening the delivery of the
scheme.
Where it is apparent that the site is a fragmented p
art of a larger whole, the thresholds and ratios in
the foregoing clauses of this policy will be applied as if the proposal is for the larger whole
Affordable Housing Mix
A
ffordable housing
should include a tenure
to be approximately
85% affordable rent and 15%
intermediate tenure will be provided where practicable
and unless evidence justifies departure from
this (as indicated in paragraph 6.85/ figure 56 of the Strategic Housing Market update of September
2015).
Gypsy & Travellers
8.
21
A
Gypsy & Traveller Plan will be brought forward and will include pitch allocations and follow
the principles of the settlement hierarchy.
The allocations will be informed by the Gypsy and
Travellers Accommodation Assessment (GTAA) and any subseque
nt update and
review.
8.
22
A Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation assessment was completed in early 2020.
A Gypsy
and Traveller Development Plan Document will be undertaken as soon as practicable to
address this need, including the allocation of sites as
identified in the Council’s Local
Development Scheme.
8.
23
Sites for Travelling Show people will not be allocated specifically
albeit that if the above
review or monitoring indicators (set out below) indicates needs arising in the future, the
Council will
similarly undertake further work as soon as practicable to address that
.
However appropriate sites would be groups of farms buildings close to main roads
throughout the Borough.
In addition, there would be a need to meet the criteria reflected in
government guidance.
Further work will be required to identify specific sites to meet any
identified need.
If sites arise then they will be treated in accordance with the Policy LP10
be
low.
8.
24
A
criteria
-
based
policy will assist the provision of sites.
Where sites fall outside the
development boundary preference will be given for them to be located on previously
developed
land.
8.
25
Any permission granted under this Policy will be s
ubject to a condition limiting occupancy to
Gypsy and
Travellers.
8.
26
It is important that sites permitted as Gypsy and Travellers sites (whether residential or
transit sites) are safeguarded for their continued use. If sites are lost this could lead to
a
reduction in site availability and increase the potential for unauthorised sites. Safeguarding
will ensure that the levels of Gypsy and Traveller accommodation are
maintained.43
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
LP10 Gypsy & Travellers Sites
New Sites
Sites will be allocated and/or permissible inside, adjoining or within a reasonable safe walking
distance of a settlement development boundary outside of the Green Belt. Site suitability will be
assessed against relevant policies in this
Local Plan
and oth
er relevant guidance and policy. Sites
will also be assessed using the following
criteria:
•
The size of the site and number of pitches is appropriate in scale and size to the nearest
settlement in the settlement hierarchy and its range of services and infra
structure;
•
The site is suitably located within a safe, reasonable walking distance
of a settlement
boundary or
pu
blic transport service,
and
access to a range of services including school
and health services;
•
Avoiding
sites vulnerable to flooding
or
affected by any other environmental hazards that
may affect the residents’ health and
welfare;
•
The site has access to essential utilities including water supply, sewerage, drainage and
waste disposal;
•
The site can be assimilated into the
surroundings
and l
andscape without any significant
adverse
effect.
Safeguarding Established Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Show people Sites
Existing Authorised sites listed in Appendix E will be safeguarded for Gypsy and Traveller Use for
the number of pitches
permitted
and a
ny new Gypsy and Traveller sites granted planning
permission will also be safeguarded for Gypsy and Traveller use for the number of pitches
permitted.
Planning permission for changes of use or redevelopment to uses other than for
residential use by
gypsy and travellers or as a travelling show people yard of the sites listed/identified in Appendix E
will be refused unless acceptable replacement accommodation can be provided, or it can be
demonstrated that the site is no longer requi
red to meet any identified needs.”44
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
9.1
Economic growth is a key Government goal and Local Enterprise Partnerships have been
developed to pursue this.
The Borough Council wants to work with the private sector to
create long lasting local employment opportunities as well as mitigate any adverse
impacts
and enhance the rural character of the
Borough.
9.2
Historically North Warwickshire had a number of large brownfield sites that have been
redeveloped.
Two of the largest sites are Hams Hall and Birch Coppice, which were seen
as regional logistic
sites in the abolished Regional Spatial Strategy and benefits from
intermodal rail freight facilities. Many of the main settlements have a range of industrial
estates.
9.3
Although North Warwickshire has seen one of the largest growths in terms of logisti
cs and
support facilities in the West Midlands it is still a fragile economy, with a high dependency on
a narrow range of sectors and larger employers.
The growth of the small to medium sized
enterprises, in particular, will continue to be supported. Both
appropriate rural diversification
and regeneration of existing sites will be part of the long term strategy to address the
economic issues that the Borough
faces.
9.4
There is the Horiba MIRA Technology Park, an Enterprise Zone, south of the A5 primarily
aimed at research and development. Plans for the development of UK Central around the
HS2 Interchange Station on the south west border of the Borough are also expected to
provide higher skilled jobs opportunities.
With the development of the latter two s
ites, this
will change the local market and will provide opportunities to diversify the local economy for
different types of employment growth.  The Borough Council is keen to exploit these
opportunities.
9.5
In addition, to target the priority issues and needs identified through the Sustainable
Community Strategy, it is considered that all employment related development, should
support and assist improvements to access to services, health, skills training and
education
opportunities through appropriate contributions or specific service delivery.
The aim is to
address the skills and education deficit and improve aspiration, opportunity and choice of
employment. Delivery will need to provide a more focused match
between available local
employment and the existing and aspirational local employee skill base, in order to meet
local economic needs and to address the large scale out
-
commuting pattern that presently
exists in the
Borough.
9.6
The Borough Council will
work with neighbouring authorities and relevant Local Enterprise
Partnerships to develop and assist companies.
In particular research and development and
other
knowledge
-
based
companies/facilities would be welcomed in order to broaden the
range of higher
skilled employment generating
uses.
9.7
The provision of highspeed broadband throughout the Borough will be important to allow
businesses to grow, develop and exploit the opportunities coming forward as a result of the
MIRA Technology
Park.
9.8
Delivery of appropriate employment uses and redevelopment within existing employment
sites should reflect the need to broaden the employment base and improve employment
choice and opportunity.
This will assist both in the employment choice and opportuniti
es
across the Borough.
It is important therefore to protect employment land from alternative
uses.
However
,
the Borough Council recognises that this cannot always be the case.
Proposals for a change of use from
employment
uses to non
-
employment uses shou
ld be
supported by evidence to show that the existing buildings and land are not suitable or
Chapter
9
Employment45
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
cannot be viably reused for another employment use.  Evidence should include details of the
marketing of the site for employment use for at least 12
months.
LP11
Economic Regeneration
The delivery of employment generating uses, including the redevelopment of existing
employment sites and farm diversification, should reflect the need to broaden the employment
base, improve employment choice and
opportunities for local people.
All employment land will be protected unless it can be demonstrated that there is no realistic
prospect of the site being used for employment purposes. Evidence would need to demonstrate
that:

The site is no longer commerci
ally viable; and,

It has been marketed for an appropriate period of time, usually no less than 12 months
.
Support and encouragement will be given to
established / lawful
rural businesses to expand
where this
has no significant and demonstrable harm in
particular on the character of the
area
.
Proposals for
new development and
redevelopment of existing employment land outside of
development boundaries will be considered against Policy LP1 and LP2
and should seek to retain
the rural character, appearance and openness of the countryside (including in respect of policy
LP3, Green
Belt).
Employment Areas
9.9
There are a number of industrial areas throughout the Borough. Some are purpose built
whilst others like Manor Road have grown out of the location of other historical uses.
It will
be expected that the majority of employment
generating uses will be concentrated into
these
areas
.
LP12 Employment Areas
The following existing industrial estates together with the sites allocated in this Plan support the
functioning of the Borough and in particular the Market Towns and
Local Service Centres:

Holly Lane,
Atherstone

Farm Diversification
Proposals for farm diversification through the introduction of new uses onto established farm
holdings will be supported where it can be demonstrated that:
a)
the development in terms of its scale, nature, location and layout would contribute
towards sustaining the
long

term
operation and viability of the farm
holding;
b)
it would not cause an
unacceptable
adverse impact to the safe and free movement of
pedestrian,
vehicular or other traffic on the trunk or rural road network as a result of
heavy vehicle
usage,
c)
there would be no adverse impacts arising from increased noise or other form of
pollution,
d)
there are adequate foul drainage facilities,
and
e)
there would be
no adverse impact on the character of the surrounding natural or historic
environment.
Re

Use of Existing Rural Buildings
Proposals for the re

use and adaptation of existing rural buildings will be supported provided that
the following three
pre
-
conditions are all satisfied:
a)
The buildings are readily accessible to the Main Towns and Local Service Centres via a
range of modes of
transport;
b)
they are of sound and permanent construction,
and
c)
are capable of adaptation or re
-
use without
recourse to major or complete re
-
building,
alteration or
extension.
If the building is a Listed Building or one that is recognised as a locally important building, then
irrespective of the foregoing pre
-
conditions, the re
-
use or adaptation of that buildi
ng will be
considered if the proposal is the only reasonable means of securing its retention.
The proposal
will be considered alongside LP15.
D
evelopment proposals will have to show an understanding
of the historic and/or architectural significance of th
at building; its relationship to its setting and its
sensitivity to change.  Appropriate materials should be used along with methods of repair which
respect the building’s significance. As much of the fabric of the building, as possible, that
embodies its
character and interest should be retained. The criteria set out in section (a) of this
policy will however still apply in these cases.
Provided that the building meets these pre

Only where
demonstrable adverse impacts would arise or such a use can be evidenced to be unviable, would

North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
10.1
North Warwickshire is characterised by distinctive and open countryside with market
towns and many small villages and hamlets. Large country estates make up part of the
Borough and much of this open character is in
part due to their existence.
The
overwhelming land use is agriculture, often in extensive estates and accompanied by
countryside recreation.
The Borough has many Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI),
areas of Ancient Woodland, Local Sites (Wildli
fe and Geological), Parks and Gardens of
Historical Interest, Country Parks and Warwickshire Wildlife Trust Nature Reserves.
However, biodiversity is not only restricted to these sites, but also extends into the wider
countryside where protected, rare and
endangered species exist, forage or rest, such as
individual veteran trees.
Assets are not only statutory and non
-
statutory sites, including
potential sites, but also those that maintain connectivity within the landscape. Some of
these assets have alread
y been identified but are continually being updated.
Therefore
,
Supplementary Planning Documents will be prepared in order to allow the information to
be updated. Contributions will be sought to assist with the delivery of creating and
maintaining the Bor
ough’s biodiversity and geo
-
diversity
assets.
10.2
The Local Plan, therefore, recognises that it is essential for a healthy and diverse
landscape to be protected and enhanced to ensure species movement throughout the
Borough as well as into neighbouring authorities.
This flow will assist with climate chan
ge
adaptation by enabling species to expand populations as well as move to more favourable
areas.
10.3
Due to the area's natural assets and growth pressure from surrounding areas the primary
planning policy will be appropriate development of the appropria
te size in the appropriate
location.
As a consequence it is important to ensure that new developments treat
landscape and bio
-
diversity as integral parts of the whole proposal.
This should assist in
retaining, protecting and strengthening the visual amen
ity and bio
-
diversity of the
setting.
10.4
The Borough has seen proposals that themselves change the landscape
–
e.g. new
fishing pools.
Either individually or cumulatively these can change landscape character as
well as the hydrology of the area.
The i
mpacts of these proposals are therefore often
much wider than perhaps just the immediate setting. Initial assessment of these impacts is
thus
important.
10.5
Regeneration of the Market Towns particularly through mixed
-
use development will allow
the primary assets of the Borough
-
its countryside and settlements
-
to be protected and
enhanced.
Policies to protect and improve the Countryside beyond defined settl
ement
boundaries and expected growth will continue through this
Local Plan
.
10.6
It is intended that mineral workings sites, both in use or exhausted, as well as existing
employment sites be put back into appropriate Green Belt/rural uses as current opera
tions
and permissions
cease
and there is no realistic prospect of their re
-
use for that purpose
(in line with the approach in the Warwickshire Minerals Plan such that resources of local
and national importance are not needlessly sterilised by non
-
mineral d
evelopment)

alter the landscape, or which involve associated physical change to the landscape such a re

Particular attention will be paid in this assessment as to whether the changes are essential to the
development proposed; the sca
le and nature of the movement of all associated materials and
deposits, the cumulative impact of existing and permitted schemes, the impact on the hydrology
of the area and its catchment, any consequential ecological impacts and the significance of the
out
come in terms of its economic and social
benefits.
New landscape schemes will look to use native species and incorporate benefits for biodiversity.
Species that are invasive or problematic to the natural environment will be avoided.
Historic
Environment
10.

North Warwickshire has been shaped by human activity over many thousands of years,
and the distinctiveness of its present landscapes and settlements reflects this historic
character.
Amongst the more prominent features of its historic en
vironment are remains
of a number of monastic sites from the middle ages, whilst the economic exploitation of
the Borough’s geology has left a rich heritage of industrial archaeology.
The 24km of
canal system also adds to the industrial heritage of the Bo
rough.
The Warwickshire
Historic Environment Record contains records of over 1350 archaeological sites, of which
29 are Scheduled Monuments. There are 579 Listed Buildings, 10 Conservation Areas
and 3 Registered Parks and
Gardens.
10.
8
Apart from these d
iscrete sites, the entire landscape has intrinsic historic interest which
contributes to the local sense of place and is valued by residents and visitors.  It has been49

systematically characterised through the national programme of Historic Landscape
Charac
terisation, a regional programme of Historic Farmsteads Characterisation and a
Countywide Historic Town Study and results of this work have informed this
Local Plan
and will further inform the planning and design of developments.
10.

The Historic Environ
ment is a finite and non
-
renewable resource. 14 designated assets
were identified by English Heritage as being ‘at risk’, mainly from disuse or neglect, in
2017. Kingsbury Hall is undergoing major work and Astley Castle has seen major works
completed.
The
Borough Council will continue to work with owners to seek ways of
securing their future. The Borough Council has an on
-
going programme for updating the
areas Conservation Area Appraisals and will undertake management plans for them
where appropriate.
It
will seek opportunities for enhancement through development and
links with other projects and
partnerships.
10.
10
The Borough recognises the role of the Historic Environment in shaping the
distinctiveness of the Borough and in contributing to quality of life and quality of place. It is
committed to protecting and where possible, enhancing its historic assets including
identification of areas where development might need to be limited in order to conserve
heritage assets or would be inappropriate due to its impact upon the historic environment.
Proposals for new development should reflect this commitment, with design th
at reflects
local distinctiveness and adds value to it.
The re
-
use and restoration/conservation of
historic buildings can be a catalyst for regeneration.
The Council have successfully
implemented a Conservation Area Partnership Scheme in Atherstone and w
ill seek ways
of building on this success including the use of Neighbourhood Plans in the promotion of
positive improvements to the Borough’s historic environment.
Proposals which may have
an impact upon the Borough’s Historic Environment will be assessed
in accordance with
local and national policy and
guidance.
LP15 Historic Environment
The Council recognises the importance of the historic environment to the Borough’s local
character, identity and distinctiveness, its cultural, social, environmental an
d economic benefits.
The quality, character, diversity and local distinctiveness of the historic environment will be
conserved
or
enhanced. In
particular:
•
Within identified historic landscape character areas development will conserve,
or
enhance and where appropriate, restore landscape character as well as promote a
resilient, functional landscape able to adapt to climate change. Specific historic features
w
hich contribute to local character will be protected and enhanced
and,
development,
including site allocations, should consider all relevant heritage assets that may be
affected, including those outside the relevant site
•
The quality of the historic environ

Buildings, Scheduled Monuments, Registered Parks and Gardens, Conservation Areas
and any non
-
designated assets; buildings, monuments, archaeological sites, places,
areas or landscapes positively identified in
North Warwickshire’s Historic Environment
Record as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions,
will be protected and enhanced, commensurate to the significance of the
asset.
Wherever possible, a sustainable reuse of red
undant historic buildings will be sought, seeking
opportunities to address those heritage assets identified as most at
risk.
All Scheduled Monuments, Registered Parks and Gardens, Conservation Areas are shown on
the Policies Map

North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Understanding the Historic Environment
All development proposals that affect any heritage asset will be required to provide sufficient
information and an assessment of the impacts of those proposals on the significance of the
assets and their setting. Thi
s is to demonstrate how the proposal would contribute to the
conservation and enhancement of that asset. That information could include desk
-
based
appraisals, field evaluation and historic building reports. Assessments could refer to the
Warwickshire Histo
ric Environment Record, Conservation Area Appraisals, The Warwickshire
Historic Towns Appraisals, The Heritage at Risk Register and Neighbourhood Plans or other
appropriate report.
Conserving the Historic Environment
Great weight will be given to the
conservation of the Borough’s designated heritage assets.
Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset should require clear and
convincing justification with regard to the public benefits of the proposal.
A balanced judgement
will be taken regarding the scale of any harm or loss to the significance of a non
-
designated
heritage asset, and the relative significance of that heritage asset must be justified and will be
weighed against the public benefits of the proposal
.
Where a
proposal affects the significance of a heritage asset, including a non
-
designated
heritage asset, or its setting, the applicant must be able to demonstrate that:
i)
all reasonable efforts have been made to sustain the existing use; find new uses or
mitigate the extent of the harm to the significance of the asset;
and,
ii)
the works proposed are the minimum required to secure the long term
iii)
use of the features of the asset that contribute to its heritage significance and interest are
retained.
Additional
evidence, such as marketing details and/or an analysis of alternative proposals will be
required where developments involve changes of use, demolitions, sub
-
divisions or extensions.
Where a proposal would result in the partial or total loss of a heritag
e asset or its setting, the
applicant will be required to secure a programme of recording and analysis of that asset and
archaeological excavation where relevant and ensure the publication of that record to an
appropriate standard.

The Borough Council recognises the need to establish a coherent and resilient ecological
network in order to contribute towards the Government’s target of halting the loss of
biodiversity
and emerging recovery networks
.
The Local Plan a
ims to achieve this by
providing robust protection for these biodiversity assets that have a significant role and
function in the Borough’s existing ecological network and by seeking enhancements and
gains where deficiencies are
identified.
10.

The natu
ral environment contributes towards the health and wellbeing of the community
and provides many services such as pollination, flood alleviation and carbon
sequestration: helping to adapt to climate change and creating a resilient environment.

Reserves; ancient woodlands and veteran trees; river corridors and canals; networks of
natural habitats and legally protected species, including linear features and wildlife
corridors, such as
hedgerows.
10.
14
All of these make a substantial con
tribution to the Borough’s natural environment.
The
network however is not restricted to these sites but other features of biodiversity that add,
buffer and link to the wider countryside, providing connectivity and facilitating species
movement in respons
e to climate change.
There are also sites in other local authority
areas which must also be considered, in particular, the River Mease Special Area of
Conservation (SAC), Ensor’s Pool SAC and the Cannock Chase SAC.
Accumulative
effects of development wil
l be important considerations for both
areas.
10.
15
The Borough Council considers that virtually all habitats have a biodiversity value. The
Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull Green Infrastructure Strategy (or subsequent update)
sets out the local approa
ch to Biodiversity Offsetting; where the impact of the
development on biodiversity is assessed and offsetting used to compensate for any
calculated loss.
Offsetting is the creation and/or enhancements of off
-
site habitats, where
the
long
-
term
management a
nd maintenance of habitat features is secured. Offsets
should be created where they benefit local, regional or national ecological
networks.
LP16 Natural Environment
The Borough Council recognises the importance of the natural environment to the Borough’s local
character, identity and distinctiveness.
The quality, character, diversity and local distinctiveness
of the natural environment will be protected and
enhanced
as appropriate relative to the nature of
development proposed.
This policy seeks to minimise impacts on, and provide net gains for
biodiversity, where possible, relative to the ecological significance of international, nationally and
locally designated si
tes of importance for biodiversity
.
Understanding the Natural Environment
All development applications that affect the natural environment will be required to provide
sufficient information and an assessment of those proposals on the natural
asset(s
) including via
Appropriate Assessment under Regulation 63 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species
Regulations 2017, or successor legislation, where likely significant effects individually or in
combination with other schemes cannot be ruled out
.
Conserving the Natural Environment
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI’s) will be subject to a high degree of protection, in view of
their national importance.
Development adversely affecting a SSSI will only be permitted where
the benefits of
the development at these sites clearly outweigh the likely impacts on the site and
any broader impacts on the national network of SSSI’s.
Development that affects Sites of Regional and Local Importance for Nature Conservation will
only be permitted where
the benefits of the development outweigh the nature conservation value
of the site and the contribution it makes to the Borough’s ecological network.
Development that damages habitats and features of importance for nature conservation will only
be permit
ted where there are no reasonable alternatives to the development taking place in that
location.
Where appropriate, developments will be required to help enhance these features
and/or secure their beneficial management.52
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Planning permission will be re
fused if development resulting in the loss or deterioration of
irreplaceable habitats, including ancient woodland and the loss of aged or veteran trees found
outside ancient woodland, unless the need for, and benefits of, the development in that location
c
learly outweigh the loss.
Given the natural heritage of the Borough, the Council expects such
circumstances to be wholly exceptional and for there to be a suitable compensation strategy in
place where any loss or deterioration would occur
Developments should avoid significant harm to biodiversity by locating to an alternative site with
less harmful impacts.
If this is not possible adequately mitigate the impacts or, as a last resort
compensate the loss.
Where development takes
place,
it
s
hould help ensure there is a
measurable
net gain of biodiversity and geological interest
.
Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull
Biodiversity Impact Assessment calculator will be used to assess the changes to biodiversity
resulting from the development and B
iodiversity Offsetting will be used where net gain cannot be
achieved within the site boundary.
Offsets will be sought towards enhancements of the wider
ecological network in the Borough or sub
-
region in line with local, regional and national priorities
f
or nature conservation
A minimum buffer zone of 15m will be required in line with Government Guidance for ancient
woodland and individual ancient or veteran trees. The size and type of buffer zone should vary
depending on the scale, type and impact of th
e development and the sensitivity of the natural
asset(s) that may be affected based on proportionate evidence.
Where possible, a buffer zone should:

contribute to wider ecological networks

be part of the green infrastructure of the area
Encouragement wi
ll be given to the planting of street trees, wherever possible.
Green Infrastructure
10.
16
Green Infrastructure (GI) is a strategically planned and delivered network of high

quality
green spaces and other environmental features. It should be designed and managed as a
multifunctional resource capable of delivering a wide range of environmental and quality of
life benefits for local communities.
Green Infrastructure includes pa
rks, open spaces,
playing fields, woodlands, allotments and private gardens.
The Borough already has
higher than average accessibility to woodland providing an excellent basis from which to
develop a Borough wide network.
However
,
there are still local d
eficiencies which need to
be tackled as well as the creation of further woodlands helping to extend
corridors.
10.
17
The Borough Council along with other authorities in the sub
-
region and Natural England
have developed a Sub
-
regional Green Infrastructure
Strategy.
This strategy has
established criteria to identify sub
-
regional Green Infrastructure assets of Landscape,
Accessibility and Biodiversity importance.
The Borough is also a partner in the Coventry,
Solihull and Warwickshire Biodiversity Offsettin
g pilot. Biodiversity Offsetting provides a
standardised mechanism for quantifying and delivering compensation where adverse
impacts on biodiversity cannot be avoided or mitigated on
site.
The
outcome
of
this
work
and
any
additional
local
work
will
be
taken
forward
in other Development Plan Documents
as well as an explanation of how the formulae and offsetting will be translated into further

pportunities exist throughout the Borough where development takes places. In particular
the use of mineral sites provides an opportunity to create links and for biodiversity
offsetting potential, for example the quarry sites of Purley, Jubilee and Oldbury.
Offsets
would be sought towards enhancements of the wider ecological network in line with local,
regional and national priorities for nature conservation. In addition, the development of
HS2 will also provide a corridor in its own right but equally could
cause links across the
railway line to be
broken.

Development proposals must, where appropriate, demonstrate how they contribute to maintaining
and enhancing a comprehensive and strategically planned Green Infrastructure network.  With

The River Tame and its valley extend from the Black County across Birmingham into
North Warwickshire, through Tamworth and beyond. It is
an important ecological area
which is a regional asset that needs to be proactively considered and where possible
enhanced as a tourist destination.
The area has many functions
–
wildlife, flood storage,
nature, and tourism. This is particularly true of t
he Tame Valley Wetlands, which cover the
whole of the Tame Valley in North Warwickshire (and North Solihull, Castle View and
Tamworth) covering the Birmingham & Fazeley Canal and the River Tame and tributaries,
including the River Cole, River Blythe SSSI,
River Bourne and River Anker. The Tame
Valley Wetlands is designated as a Nature Improvement Area and is shown in Appendix
H
.
10.
21
The Tame Valley Wetlands was designated as a Nature Improvement Area (NIA) by the
Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull Local Nature Partnership in October 2016.
NIA’s are
recognised in the NPPF as important areas. The area includes many sites important for
nature conservation: there are 5 SSSi’s and 12 LNRs which are statutory sites plus a
further 48 Local Wildlife Sites of county importance.
The NIA is delivering aspects of the
Local Nature Partnerships strategic
vision.
10.
22
NIA’s were established to c
reate joined up and resilient ecological networks at a
landscape scale; a mechanism identified in the Government’s 2011 White Paper to help
us leave our natural environment in a better state than we inherited it.
They are54

designated by the Local Nature Pa
rtnerships and consist of areas with opportunities to
establish and improve ecological networks via a shared vision for the natural environment,
which will also offer multiple benefits to the
community.

23
The Tame Valley Wetlands Landscape Partnership
focuses on the Tame Valley area lying
within North Warwickshire.
The Partnership is led by Warwickshire Wildlife Trust and the
Borough Council is a partner of this group which is seeking to enhance the area for people
and wildlife.
The Vision for the NI
A “is to create a wetland landscape, rich in wildlife and
accessible to all” by working with a range of partners, organisations, landowners and the
local community.  This will be achieved by taking a landscape
-
scale approach to restoring,
conserving and re
connecting the physical and cultural landscape of the Tame Valley.
Be
re
-
engaging local communities with the landscape and its rich heritage, a sense of
ownership, understanding and pride will be nurtured to ensure a lasting legacy of
restoration and
cons
ervation.
10.
24
Opportunities exist within the NIA to adopt a landscape
-
scale approach to nature
conservation in order to protect habitats and species as they adapt to a changing climate,
engage communities and promote sustainable tourism and land managem
ent so as to
improve the social and economic wellbeing, and secure continued funding for the
landscape.
10.
25
Part of the valley includes the Kingsbury Water Park.
Kingsbury Water Park grew out of
the old, gravel workings in 1975 and has become a haven for bird watchers and walkers
alike, attracting over 100,000 visitors per annum.
It is an important local and regional
visitor attraction providing important habitats
as well as camping and visitor facilities.
The
route of Phase 2 of HS2, as suggested, will go through the site and potentially affect many
of the buildings.
The Borough Council recognises the importance of the site to both the
local area and region. It
therefore wishes to indicate its support for its continued existence
which may require replacement of the buildings within the envelope of the
site.
LP18 Tame Valley Wetlands NIA including Kingsbury Water Park
Encouragement will be given to the maintenan
ce and enhancement of the Tame Valley Wetlands
NIA to encourage greater connectivity across the landscape
–
both in terms of (i) bigger, better
and more joined up habitats and (ii) responsible and safe access for people
–
in keeping with the
vision for the
area and Policy LP17.
Encouragement will be given to natural flood management opportunities and the restoration of
water courses in line with Policy
LP33
.
Where no local mitigation for habitat loss can be provided, the Tame Valley Wetlands NIA will be
identified as a potential
recipient site for appropriate and high quality habitat mitigation and
offsetting
projects.
The Tame Valley Wetlands NIA will be supported and used by the Borough Council as a flagship
example of an important landscape to protect and enhance as it is
where effective partnership
working at a landscape
-
scale is taking place through the Tame Valley Wetlands Landscape
Partnership.
Replacement buildings as a result of the proposed HS2 will be permitted elsewhere within the
Kingsbury Water Park, as shown on
the
Policies
Map, to ensure its continued existence.55

The Borough Council control a number of sites which have potential for enhancing and
improving biodiversity and the natural environment while facilitating access for
educational, recreational needs and community health and well
-
being.
Some sites are
alrea
dy accessible, and serve their communities as informal recreation, providing natural
open space.
Those that are currently not accessible there is the intention to develop as
Local Nature Reserves and further facilitate access and biodiversity improvements
.
The
designated Local Nature Reserves are Dafferns Wood, New Arley; Abbey Green Park,
Polesworth and Cole End Park, Coleshill. There is a proposed Local Nature Reserve
along the River Anker,
Atherstone
10.
27
Daffern’s Wood is about 2.42 hectares in size and was purchased by North Warwickshire
Borough Council in 1992.
It once was part of Arley Wood which in turn was part of the
Arden Forest covering most of Warwickshire.
The wood is classified as Ancient
Wood
land.
Ancient Woodland is an important habitat for many rare and threatened
species of animals and plants. Ancient Woodlands date back to 1600 or before and
developed naturally (without manmade planting). Only 20% of the total wooded area in
Britain is An
cient Woodland making its preservation and management of great
importance.
10.
28
The Riverside site is located behind the Carlyon Road industrial estate in Atherstone.
The
area is a small but long band of grassland following the river Anker with a narrow
band of
newly planted trees screening the rear of the industrial units.
Running through the area is
a public footpath which leads to a bridge over the river and links the area with Witherley in
Leicestershire and other walking
routes.

wildlife area with unmarked mown grass paths and has links to Heart of England Way long
distance walk. Kingsbury Meadow is a small remnant floodplain meadow comprised of a
narrow corridor
of open land either side of the Hurley Brook, which is a tributary of the
River Tame.
It is located to the north of Mill Crescent and east of Coventry
Road.

The River Anker flows through the Abbey Green site in Polesworth. The silted up
channels an
d reed beds make it an interesting area to develop for wildlife.
The aim is to
create a riverside wildlife area following the Anker and creating a focal point for the park.
There is also potential to create a riverside walk and fishing
platforms.

The project in Coleshill focuses on the area of the park south of the River Cole, in
particular the area linking the children’s play area accessed from Old Mill Road with the
park. This area is currently boggy and overgrown with the invasive weed Himala
yan
Balsam. The project will create a nature walk from the play area and areas of native
planting, wildflower meadow and woodland within this part of the park.

Green Spaces
10.
32
Open spaces, whether publicly or privately owned, are important within settlements as
they break up the built form and contribute to local identity.
The Council’s Green Space
Strategy (2008) identified that there were sufficient number of green spaces thr
oughout
the Borough but it was the quality of these that needed to be improved.
Further work is
being carried out on the Green Spaces Strategy and to develop an Action Plan.
The
Council has reviewed potential Local Green Spaces as defined by paragraph 77
of the
National Planning Policy Framework 2012; these are defined in NWBC24B annex K & L to
the plan and represented on the policies map.
LP20 Green Spaces
The Green Spaces as shown on the
Policies
Map will be retained, protected and wherever possible
enhanced.
The Green Space Strategy will provide information which will be used in determining the amount of
land, facilities and/or contributions which will be required as part of development proposal
s
Neighbourhood Plans may designate additional areas.57

COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Allotments, Cemeteries, Clinics, Colleges, Health Centres, Indoor Sports Facilities, Libraries, Local
Authority Offices, Places of Worship, Playgrounds, Fire Stations, Police Stations, Schools, Sports Facilities,
Sports Grounds & Fields, Village Halls, Surgeries, Theatres, Social Club, Youth Centres & Venues for
Community Art/Crafts.
11.1
Local Services and facilities are an important element in ensuring the vitality of the towns,
villages and hamlets in the Borough, including social, health and cultural infrastructure.
The Local Plan will protect and support local services and facilities across the Borough
and will ensure community involvement in the consideration of the means of achieving
this. Further advice and guidance will be
developed.
11.2
Retail uses will be fo
cused towards the Market Towns to help maintain their viability and
vitality.
Existing retail uses will be protected in accordance with the settlement hierarchy
and developed further.
11.3
The most common types of facilities found in our towns and villag
es are as
follows:
11.4
Poor health and in particular obesity, is an issue throughout the Borough, but with some
local high concentrations.
In addition there is increasing concern over betting.
Planning
cannot restrict takeaways or betting shops completely.
Where there is a local problem,
local policies may seek to restrict the number of takeaways or betting shops or other uses,
in order to maintain the variety of retail uses and to assist in a
chieving a healthy resident
population.
11.5
The provision of new and the maintenance of existing services and facilities is an
important consideration for the Borough Council. It is these services and facilities that
make a settlement work for both the
existing and future residents. They are also important
for the local business community. It is expected larger settlements will have a wider range
of services and facilities that fit with their place within the settlement
hierarchy.

boundaries and neighbourhood centres are to be treated the same
in policy terms as below;
those terms refer to the different scales of settlements. In principle commercial, business and
service uses will be supported in these locations, and in line with LP2, to support vitality.

North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Proposals that would have a detrimental impact on the viability and vitality of centres will not be
permitted.
The loss of Class E (including retail) units within town centre boundaries and defined
nei
ghbourhood centres will only be supported if:
•
it can be shown that there is no reasonable prospect of retention of the use;
•
occupation is by an alternative retail or mixed community/retail use; and,
•
there would be no adverse impact on the retail
choice and availability.
Mixed use proposals, including those with residential uses, will be appropriate in principle. Dual
or multiple uses of sites or “hubs” providing services and facilities for individual or groups of
settlements will be encouraged.
Proposals that would have a detrimental impact on the viability
and vitality of centres will not be permitted.
Applications should be supported by relevant and
proportionate evidence to demonstrate that would not be the case
clear evide

ustifying the loss and change of use, and
•
there will be no unacceptable adverse impact on the retail choice and availability in

the frontage or centre.
•
there is not a disproportionate over concentration of these uses.
The following factors will be taken into account: the existing mix of uses; the impact on customer
behaviour; the proximity of education establishments; the deprivation levels in the area
and the
cumulative highway and environmental impacts.
Robust justification using a sequential approach
will be required to avoid a disproportionate concentration of uses.
Proposals resulting in the loss of an existing service or facility and also
including retail uses,
which contribute to the functioning of a settlement or the public health and well
-
being of its
community, will only be supported
if:
a)
an equivalent facility or service is wholly or partially provided elsewhere, in
a
similar
or
more ac
cessible location within that
settlement;
b)
the land and buildings are shown to be no longer suitable for continued use in terms of
their location, design and/or
construction,
or the proposal would represent a net gain or
improvement in provision,
c)
it can
be demonstrated by evidence that there is no realistic prospect of an alternative
service or facility using the site, such as through an appropriate marketing campaign or
the internal procedures of the parent organisation and,
d)
its loss will not harm the vi
tality of the settlement.
All major developments must consider the impact on the provision of services and facilities and
where there is an impact this must be addressed.
All major developments should provide land
and / or financial contributions to enab
le the provision of additional services and facilities.
As set
out in LP1 and paragraph
1
6.6 all development will be expected to contribute proportionately and
in accordance with national policy, statute and relevant supplementary planning documents and
g
uidance to infrastructure provision.
Recreational Provision
11.6
As part of any development it is important that provision is made for
open spaces and
recreation whether this is indoor or outdoor
, publicly or privately owned
. The health and
wellbeing benefits of such provision can improve the quality of life for
residents.
Spaces
can include the following typologies:
1.
parks and gardens
–
including urban parks, country parks, forest parks and formal
gardens;
2.
outdoor sports facilities (w
ith natural or artificial surfaces and either publicly or59
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
privately owned)
–
including tennis courts, bowling greens, sport pitches, golf
courses, athletic tracks, school and other institutional playing fields, and other
outdoor sports areas;
3.
amenity g
reen space (most commonly, but not exclusively in housing areas)
–
including informal recreation spaces, communal green spaces in and around
housing, and village greens;
4.
provision for children and teenagers
–
including play areas, kickabout areas,
skat
eboard parks and outdoor basketball hoops;
5.
green corridors
–
including river and canal banks, amenity footpaths and
cycleways;
6.
natural and semi
-
natural urban green spaces
–
including woodlands, urban
forestry, grasslands (
e.g.
meadows), wetlands, o
pen and running water, and rock
areas (
e.g.
cliffs);
7.
allotments and community gardens;
8.
cemeteries and churchyards; and
9.
civic spaces, including civic and market squares and other hard surface areas
designed for pedestrians.
11.7
Work
was
undertaken to update the Council’s Open Space, Sport & Recreation Audit and
Green Space Strategy and the North Warwickshire Playing Pitch Strategy and a review of
Leisure Services built facilities.
This
was
completed
in 2018
and
will feed into the future
plans of the Borough Council and also will influence advice and guidance given on
development proposals.
All proposals will take account of this updated evidence when
published.
11.8
Long term maintenance is a key issue.
Therefore
,
improvements may be m
ore
appropriate to improve off
-
site facilities / sites rather than creating new
on
-
site
provision.
This will be particularly relevant to smaller scale sites.
LP22
Open Spaces and Recreational Provision
Wherever possible, Open spaces and recreational areas will be retained, protected and
enhanced (unless their loss is off
-
set by an equivalent or improved replacement).
Development
proposals will be expected to provide a range of new on
-
site
and open space
recreational
provision such as parks and amenity space, sport or recreation facilities and semi
-
natural areas
such as woodland wherever appropriate to the area and to the development.
The design and location of these spaces and facilities should be acces
sible to all users; have
regard to the relationship with surrounding uses, enhance the natural environment, protect and
improve green infrastructure and link to surrounding areas where
appropriate.
The Council will require the proper maintenance of these
areas and facilities to be agreed. Where
on
-
site provision is not feasible, off
-
site contributions may be required where the developments
use leads to a need for new or enhanced provision.60

12.1
Transport, especially in a rural area, gives everyone the means of accessing services and
facilities as well as jobs and training.
The Local Plan seeks to maintain and improve
public tr
ansport links between the Market towns, Local Service Centres and other villages
to help sustain a viable local economy.
The Borough Council will pursue transport
improvements through development and will seek mitigation measures from any transport
develo
pments.

12.2
With the development of High Speed rail and the new Station at the NEC there are
implications on road traffic that will need to be carefully considered and mitigated against,
especially through the rural roads of North Warwickshire.
Opportunities will be
sought to
improve public transport links into the rural parts of North Warwickshire and improve
access to a wider range of services and
facilities.
12.3
Birmingham International Airport is close to the western boundary of the Borough.
It is
near to junctions on the M6 and M42 and there is a direct rail link from the airport to
Chapter
12
Transport61
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Birmingham.
Two bus routes travel to the airport through the Borough from Nuneaton and
Atherstone.
12.4
The proximity of the airport brings significant economic
benefits and opportunities to North
Warwickshire.
However
,
disturbance is caused along the
flightpaths
over residential
areas.
Airport traffic is a factor in the growth of road traffic in the Borough and the
presence of the airport has created a demand
for remote vehicle parking.
The Borough
Council will seek improvements to public transport wherever
possible.
12.5
Arrangements are in place to consult with the Civil Aviation Authority on the height of
proposed development in the Borough. Maps showing s
afeguarded areas for Birmingham
International and Coventry airports can be viewed at the Borough Council
offices.
12.6
It is important that when development proposals are submitted elements of transport are
considered.
A Strategic Transport Assessment (S
TA) is being updated for the Plan as a
whole but individual site considerations will still be necessary.
In addition the Borough
Council has a priority of reducing the “killed and serious accidents” year on
year.
12.7
Transport Assessment and
Travel Plans are an important element in determining if a
development can be carried out in a workable way without leading to traffic
problems.
12.8
The Borough has a number of level crossings on the rail network. Development will need
to address its impa
ct where necessary to avoid any adverse impact or interference to the
rail network.
Potentially where there is an expected increase in people using a level
crossing then early discussions need to take place with Network Rail and consideration
should be gi
ven to the replacement of the crossing with a bridge
in so far as that may
impede HS2 implementation or result in an incompatible use in time.
12.9
Warwickshire County Council, in partnership with the Borough Council and a range of
other organisations, is
preparing a Transport Strategy for the Borough.
This will bring
together, into one document, the long
-
term strategy for transport improvements
throughout the Borough.
The strategy will consider the implications of development taking
place both in and ar
ound the Borough. It is expected that this will be completed by spring
2018.
LP23
Transport Assessments
Transport
Assessments appropriate to the scale of development proposed, will be required to
accompany development proposals (including that that is
below the indicative threshold in
Appendix G).
Assessments will also be required where there is a cumulative effect created by
additional floor space or traffic movement on the site or in the vicinity, or where there are
demonstrable shortcomings in the a
dequacy of the local transport network to accommodate
development of the scale
proposed.
These Assessments should address impacts on both the local and strategic highway networks
and should be scoped so as to be bespoke to the nature of the development pr
oposals.
They
should also ensure that proposals provide appropriate infrastructure measures to mitigate the
adverse impacts of development traffic and other environmental and safety impacts either
individually or cumulatively.
Appropriate provision for,
or contributions towards the cost of any
necessary highway improvements should also be addressed.
Widening opportunities to access
new developments for all sections of the
community will need also to be addressed through the
provision and enhancement of p
ublic transport services and facilities together with walking and
cycling facilities.62
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
The Assessments should assess the impact on level crossings in the vicinity of the development.
Travel Plans will be required to be submitted alongside these Assessme
nts.
Travel Plan
Development will be expected to link with existing road, cycle and footpath networks.
Developments that are likely to generate significant amounts of traffic and particularly larger
developments will be expected to focus on the
longer
-
ter
m
management of new trips; encourage
the use of public and shared transport as well as appropriate cycle and pedestrian links.
Increasing the opportunity to access these developments for all sections of the community should
be addressed. This will be secur
ed through a Travel Plan and/or financial contributions which will
be secured either through planning conditions or the provisions of Section
106.
Rail
12.10
Rail also plays an important role in the Borough with the Trent Valley line/ West Coast
mainline and the
Cross
-
Country
line.
There are four stations in the Borough. Atherstone
and Polesworth are on the Tamworth to Nuneaton stretch of the West Coast Mainli
ne.
Water Orton is situated along the Leicester and Nuneaton line to Birmingham.  During 2008
a new station called Coleshill Parkway opened.  There are two intermodal rail freight
facilities at Hams Hall and Birch Coppice.  These routes and stations are s
hown in Figure
3.
12.11
Local rail services have improved since the 2006 Local Plan. Services have been improved
to Atherstone and the new station in Coleshill has meant greater patronage.
Polesworth is
virtually closed with only one service in the morning going north.
In patronage terms
Atherstone has seen an increase of 125% between 2013/14 and 2014/15.
Use of Water
Orton station has reduced slightly whilst Coleshill Parkway continues to
increase.
12.12
Kingsbury once had a railway station and a replacement station is still being pursued by
Centro, alongside the Camp Hill Chord proposals for the Birmingham to Lichfield line that
passes through Kingsbury past Dosthill and on to Tamworth.
This has been a longstanding
proposal having been included in Warwickshire’s Local Transport Plan 3 and policy TPT4
from the North Warwickshire Local Plan 2006.
In addition
,
Network Rail have highlighted in
the West Midlands Route Utilisation Strategy an
d the Initial Industry Plan, the need to
improve the rail access to Birch Coppice/Kingsbury Depots, which would facilitate new and
enhanced passenger rail services on the Birmingham to Tamworth rail corridor.
These
schemes are now being advocated through
the West Midlands Combined Authority which
recently won the franchise to run the rail services within the West Midlands. 9 new rail
routes are being sought into the
City.
12.13
A new station on the Birmingham to Nuneaton line is included in the Warwickshi
re Local
Transport Plan.
Although the exact location is not known
,
it is in the Arley
area.
12.14
The improved provision of train services to Atherstone is supported.
Investment has been
made to improve the platforms and the train information signage.
Further improved train
services were introduced in December 2012 which cut the journey time to London by a
further 20 minutes.
There remain issues over car parking and access to the western
platform under the bridge on the Watling Street. Lighting has bee
n improved and the
footbridge has been removed.
However, replacement of the footbridge is still supported.
In
addition, opportunities to improve parking for both the station and the town will be
pursued.63
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
12.15
Polesworth Station has remained “open” only through the stopping of one train per day in
one direction.
With the proposals for development in and around Polesworth and Dordon
work will be carried out to investigate the reopening of the station.
This will
also consider
whether the current site is the best location for a station in the 21
st
Century.
LP24
Stations
Existing Stations
Further improvements will be encouraged and sought at existing stations.
Specifically, land
adjoining the existing car park alongside platform 1, shown on the policies map, will be
safeguarded for use as a car park extension at Atherstone station and posi
tively pursued with the
relevant, responsible parties early in the plan period. Other additional car parking opportunities will
be investigated, including at other stations.
•
Improved services and pedestrian access arrangements between platforms for
able bodied
and disabled users to meet DDA standards at Atherstone station;
•
Additional car parking provision at Coleshill Parkway station;
•
Investigation into improved services, provision of a new footbridge and parking facilities at
the existing Polesw
orth station will be pursued. If this is not feasible a new Parkway station
will be pursued. The area of search will be along the WCML southwards from the current
station;
•
The sites shown on the policies map for new stations at Kingsbury and Arley will b
e
safeguarded and pursued in the context of the WMRE Strategy; and,
•
The continuance of services and facilities at Water Orton Station will be supported.
Financial contributions towards the provision of the measures identified in this policy will be soug
ht
in accordance with policy LP1 particularly in respect of closely related or enabling development.

In January 2012 the Secretary of State announced the route for the first phase of HS2 (High
Speed Rail) between London and the West Midlands.
This travels through the Borough
northwards from the NEC along the Tame Valley up to Middleton and then on to Bas
sett’s
Pole. A route also comes out of and goes into Birmingham to the south of Water Orton.
The safeguarded route is shown on the
Policies
Map.
12.17
Phase 2b of the route to Leeds via the East Midlands and to Manchester
was
published in
January 2013.
The Leeds leg follows the route of the M42 from a junction near Lea
Marston, past Polesworth and then heads towards Ashby.
The formal announcement of the
route was made in November
2016.
12.18
The full impact of the proposals will not be known for some t
ime, but increased traffic,
especially through the rural countryside close to the new railway station and monorail depot
to the east of the M42 near to the NEC, is likely.
Improved public transport connections will
be extremely important to mitigate this
impact as well as substantial landscaping and
absorptive noise barriers along its route.
Other mitigation measures, including community
benefits will be needed and will be progressed through discussions with HS2 Ltd and the
Department of Transport.
Press
ure for development around the new HS2 railway station at
the NEC will be
resisted.64
North Warwickshire Local Plan

LP25
Railway Lines
The Borough Council supports, in principle, proposals for the replacement of lawful buildings,
structures and uses, including those with permission, if their demolition or removal is required by
HS2 Ltd., or their ability to continue to operate as such wou
ld be compromised.
Particular regard
will be had to the aim of relocation as close to an existing lawful building, structure or use, as
practicable, and as otherwise compliant with the policies, in this plan to minimise disruption and
assist in
ensuring the continued vitality of the Borough
High Speed Rail
The line of the proposed High Speed 2 railway Phases 1 and 2b through North Warwickshire will
be safeguarded and are shown on the
Policies
Map.
Connectivity between the line and the settlements of North Warwickshire will be improved through
work with deve
lopers, the nominated undertaker, government organisations (including Highways
England and the Department of Transport) and funding agencies.
The traffic implications and impact of growth in adjoining area and from development related to
High Speed rail w
ill need to be addressed and mitigated through encouraging sustainable transport
solutions and measures, including traffic calming and access constraints on the rural road network.
Safeguarding of Rail Routes
The former Baddesley Mineral Railway line between Baddesley Colliery and Birch Coppice
(Safeguarded Route RR1) and the route of the former Whitacre Line between Hampton in Arden to
Whitacre will be safeguarded (Safeguarded Route RR2) to allow for the
poten
tial
re
-
instatement of
the route or if this is not possible then as a recreational cycle route.
No development will be permitted which would sever or prevent the
potential
future use of the
routes as a railway or other form of transport unless a suitable
diversion or alternative is provided.
Road
A5
12.19
The A5 is an important part of the Strategic Road Network and forms a key arterial route
through the Borough.
The A5 is an important strategic route for the sub
-
region and
nationally but it is also an important local road serving the local community.
It
therefore has
both local and national
significance.
12.20
The Borough Council has been working with 14 other local authorities and the Highway
England to develop a Strategy for the A5.
As a trunk road its maintenance and
improvements essentially lies wit
h Highways England, who are developing and reviewing
their Route
-
wide Strategies.
The A5 is one of these key
routes.
12.21
There is growth proposed along the A5 both within and outside of the Borough.
It is difficult
to see how the current road will be able to cater for such growth without substantial
investment.
Investment will unlock a number of development sites.
Any gro
wth along its
route will need to carefully consider the implications of additional traffic.
12.22
The Strategic Transport Assessment 2017 confirms that development can take place along
the A5 but it is limited unless there is substantial investment in the
route.
The Borough
Council is working with a range of agencies and organisations to ensure that it can be
improved to ensure the delivery of all of the development proposed within this
Plan.65
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
A446
12.23
In addition the A446 runs parallel to the M42 and is another major route through the
Borough which has both local and national significance.
As part of the HS2 proposals the
bridge over the River Tame will be built so the road can be dualled in the future
.
Investment will be sought to complete this work so that the road is fully dualled south of
Dunton Island (junction 9
M42).
LP26
Strategic Road Improvements A5
A study has been undertaken in respect of the future of the A5 Trunk Road and the outcome of
this will become a material planning consideration in respect of future development proposals that
might impact on the A5.
The Council will work alongside the appropriate Agencies to develop the A5 Strategy and options
and funding
opportunities for its dualling.
Land to the north of Grendon through Site RH1 will be protected from any development to ensure
the dualling of the A5 can take place.  If RH1 is brought forward for development no part will
prejudice the implementation of t
he future dualling of this route.
When the dualling of the A5 trunk road has been implemented the existing Watling Street will be
downgraded, wherever possible, and walking, including the provision of pedestrian crossings,
and cycling routes will be activ
ely encouraged and promoted.
A446
Improvement of the A446 including the dualling over the River Tame will be sought as well as
improved cycling
links.
Walking and Cycling
12.24
Walking and cycling can bring mental and physical health and
wellbeing benefits.
Encouragement will be given wherever to improve and expand the walking
an
d
cycling
routes throughout the Borough.
Canal towpaths can also provide the opportunity for non
-
vehicular traffic free
routes.
12.25
The
Northern Warwickshire C
ycleway
covers approximately 35 miles around the Borough
with more localised routes in Atherstone, Polesworth, Coleshill and Kingsbury.
This
provides for leisure uses.
There has been little in the way of cyclist provision for
commuters, apart from that p
roposed at the Station at Hams Hall.
The Borough Council
will pursue the introduction of improved cycling and pedestrian links throughout the
Borough.
This will also have health benefits and will be supported through the recently
announced Cycling and Wa
lking Investment Strategy by Central Government as well as
support the A5 Sustainable Travel & Transport
Strategy.
LP27
Walking and Cycling
The Borough Council will develop a Walking and Cycling Strategy.
All developments should consider what
improvements can be made to encourage safe and fully
accessible walking and cycling.66
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Encouragement will be given to establishing and promoting responsible access to the natural
environment, for example in the Tame Valley Wetlands NIA.
12.26
Within the
Borough there remain a number of level crossings, many public footpaths. With
both increased frequency of trains, speed of trains and a higher population there are
increased safety concerns.
Network Rail will seek closure of level crossings, and either
r
eplacement with a footbridge or inclusion of a diversionary route where there is an
increase in type or volume of
users.
LP28
Level Crossings
Contributions will be sought where proposals impact on level crossings to mitigate the impacts of
those developments.
Wherever possible level crossings will be closed, and either replaced with a
footbridge or by a diversionary route.67
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
13.1
The Council recognises the importance of sustainability. In this respect, all development
should demonstrate that it is sustainable.
This will be achieved by
being well designed,
laid out and constructed in a manner to ensure the
long
-
term
retention, adaptation and re
-
use of premises; where services and facilities link and support development they must be
protected and improved where necessary; and that promot
ion of sustainable transport is
prioritised, as there is a reliance on private vehicular transport.
This is in line with the
Government’s intentions towards sustainable patterns of
movement.
13.2
High quality design and place making should be the aim of
all those involved in the
development process.
This policy aims to ensure that a high quality of design is achieved
in North Warwickshire.
The Policies in this section
essentially reflect
the approach taken
in the existing Core Strategy and 2006 Local
Pl
an.
13.3
Development proposals will be expected to adopt principles of good design so that they
make a positive contribution to the character and quality of the area.
Regard should
therefore be had to good practice set out in
the
Planning Policy Guidance
.
13.4
Reference should also be made to the design SPG’s produced by the Borough Council.
This includes ‘A Guide for Shop Front Design’, ‘A Guide for the Design of Householder
Developments’ and ‘A Guide for the Design of Lighting Schemes’.
In addition to th
is the
Council plans to prepare further design guidance.
The timetable for this will be brought
forward through the Local Development
Scheme.
13.5
Equal opportunities are an increasingly important matter in planning.
Recent legislation
sets out the Coun
cil’s obligations in ensuring that development is suitable for people of all
ages, abilities and backgrounds.
In addition, promoting healthy and active lifestyles is a
key local priority, as set out in the North Warwickshire Sustainable Community
Strategy
6
.
13.6
Open spaces, whether publicly or privately owned, are important within settlements as
they break up the built form and contribute to local identity. Settlement Character
Assessments will be undertaken to identify public spaces within the settlemen
ts and will
seek to protect and enhance them.
The Council’s Open Space, Sport & Recreation Audit
and Green Space Strategy
7
and the North Warwickshire Playing Pitch Strategy identify
existing shortfalls in provision, as well as further classifying the impo
rtance of existing
open spaces and working to improve and protect sports facilities across the
Borough.
13.7
People within the Borough should be able to enjoy places without undue disturbance or
intrusion from neighbouring uses.
The Council will look to
protect and improve, where
possible, living and working conditions through development proposals, which will be
enforced by planning conditions or through the Council’s Environmental Health
powers.
13.8
The Rivers Tame, Blythe and Anker are all wildlife s
ites in the Borough. All are at risk of
pollution, particularly the River Blythe, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.  In
addition, despite flood alleviation works in some parts of the Borough, a significant amount
of residential and employment
land along and near these corridors is at risk of
flooding.

13.9
The Council has been monitoring and reporting on air quality across North Warwickshire
for several years.
An air quality review and assessment in 2000 concluded that the
natio
nal objective levels for nitrogen dioxide would not be achieved beyond 2005 at an
isolated farmhouse.
The exceedance of the objective level was due to the dwelling being
at the point where the M6 and M42 motorways converge to the south of Coleshill and th
is
was subjected to significant vehicle emissions from congested traffic.
As a result an Air
Quality Management Area (AQMA) was declared in this location and a continuous
automatic monitoring station was acquired to monitor more closely nitrogen dioxide a
nd
other pollutant levels in the vicinity.
The monitoring carried out in recent years has not
found any new objective level exceedances.
However
,
it has shown a continued
reduction in annual mean nitrogen dioxide levels at the affected farmhouse within t
he Air
Quality Management Area (AQMA).
During a round of assessment in 2012 it was
proposed to revoke the AQMA as it no longer exceeded the objective level for nitrogen
dioxide and the farmhouse was no longer a relevant receptor.
This course of action wa
s
agreed by Defra and as a result the AQMA was formally revoked by the Borough Council
and the Revocation Order came into effect on 1
st
February 2013.
The automatic
monitoring station was subsequently
decommissioned
13.10
Nitrogen dioxide levels are bein
g monitored at various locations across North
Warwickshire. If air quality levels worsen this could result in a future AQMA.
The Borough
Council is continuing to work in partnership through the Coventry and Warwickshire Air
Quality Alliance, which is
made up of the Borough, Districts County Council and City
Council as well as and Public Health
England.
13.11
The Council seeks to reduce
flooding risks
by minimising surface water run
-
off to
the main
rivers and water courses in the Borough through the ap
propriate location of new
development; the avoidance of development within Flood Zone 3, requiring sustainable
drainage systems as well as other appropriate attenuation measures such as National
Flood Management Schemes.
In line with guidance, where possi
ble, be protected and
enhanced, especially as they can also result in environmental enhancement and provide
benefits to
wildlife.
Land drainage too provides this function and should be adequately
maintained.
13.12
The raw material, heavy infrastructure
and disposal needs of the adjacent Birmingham
conurbation and other nearby major urban areas have resulted in additional pressures on
the Borough’s land resources, including potential contamination.
The Borough still has a
legacy from extensive coal minin
g and other extraction.
The Minerals and Waste Core
Strategies will address specific detailed policies including how to assess viability of sites.
Whilst the County Council sets out the strategic approach for mineral extraction and waste
disposal, the Bo
rough retains control over contaminated land issues.
In line with national
requirements and the intentions of the Council’s Environmental Health section to identify
and reduce the amount of contaminated land across the Borough, development proposals
must
identify contaminated and potentially contaminated land and secure land
remediation where appropriate.
Such identification may be necessary prior to
determination of proposals depending on the sensitivity of the end use. In addition, strict
control of
the
use and disposal of hazardous substances is necessary to safeguard land,
premises and
people.
13.13
Waste should be considered as part of the design of any development. This can be done
through Site Waste Management Plans (SWMP’s) or their successor.
Attention should be
given to opportunities to minimise the generation of waste as a by
-
product and
devel
opment and ensuring waste arising and managed
sustainably.69
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
13.14
Development proposals particularly of facilities which attract members of the public will
need to consider the measures it will need to take to make the sites as safe as possible
and to de
ter
terrorism.
13.15
‘Secured by Design’ (now owned by the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime, MOPAC,
on behalf of the UK police services) and NaCTOS
(The National Counter Terrorism
Security Office) provide on
-
line advice and guidance towards designing out crime and
reducing vulnerability to the potential impact of terrorism in new development schemes as
part of sustainable development proposals.
The
local police’s Crime Prevention Design
Adviser (CPDA) will also be able to provide advice on measures addressing particular
types of crime or anti
-
social behaviour for both specific developments, or Design and
Access Statements where compliance with the Se
cured by Design award scheme is
sought.
LP

Development
Considerations
Development should meet the needs of residents and businesses without compromising the
ability of future generations to enjoy the same quality of life that the present
generation aspires to.
Development
should:
1.
make effective use of
brownfield land in appropriate locations reflecting the settlement
hierarchy;
and,
2.
be adaptable for future uses and take into account the needs of all users;
and,
3.
maintain and improve the
provision of accessible local and community services, unless it
can be demonstrated that they are no longer needed by the community they serve; not
needed for any other community use, or that the facility is being relocated and improved to
meet the needs o
f the new, existing and future community;
and
services in line with policy
LP21
4.
promote healthier lifestyles for the community to be active outside their homes
and places
of work;
and,
5.
encourage sustainable forms of transport focussing on
pedestrian access and provision of
bike facilities;
and,
6.
Provide safe and suitable access to the site for all users; and
7
before proposals are supported expand or enhance the provision of open space, sport
and recreation facilities, using, in particular,
the Green Space Strategy and Playing Pitch
Strategies;
and,
8
not lead to the loss unless a site of equivalent quality and accessibility can be provided, or
shown that it is surplus to needs;
and,
9.
avoid and address unacceptable impacts upon
neighbouring amenities through
overlooking, overshadowing, noise, light, air quality or other pollution;
and in this respect
identification of contaminated and potentially contaminated land will be necessary prior to
determination of proposals depending on
the history of the site and sensitivity of the end
use
and,
10.
protect and enhance the historic and natural environment;
and,
11.
manage the impacts of climate change through the design and location of development,
including sustainable building design and
materials, sustainable drainage, water efficiency
measures, use of trees and natural vegetation and ensuring no net loss of flood storage
capacity;
and,
12
protect the quality and hydrology of ground or surface water sources so as to reduce the
risk of pol
lution and flooding, on site or elsewhere;
and
13
not sterilise viable known mineral reserves; degrade soil quality or pose risk to human
health and ecology from contamination or mining legacy and ensure that land is
appropriately remediated,
and,70
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
14
seek to maximise opportunities to encourage re
-
use and recycling of waste materials,
both in construction and operation, and,
15
Adequate space for bins should be provided within all new developments to enable the
storage of waste and for materials to be r
e
-
cycled. Guidance is provided
in
the Document
“Design Guide for Bin Storage”
16
provide for information and communication technologies; and,
17
seek to reduce crime and in particular the threat of terrorism.
Built Form
13.16
The Council does not wish to stifle innovative design.
However
,
it is expected that new
buildings and extensions or alterations to existing buildings integrate well into their
surrounding environment so that a local sense of place is
reinforced.
13.17
The impact of a large extension to a building is greater when the
building is located in the
countryside rather than inside the development boundary of a settlement.
This policy
seeks to protect rural character and openness and to avoid suburbanisation of the
countryside.
13.18
The policy introduces a set of criteria a
gainst which design issues can be assessed.
The
Borough Council has prepared Design Guides in order to illustrate these
matters.
13.19
Planning applications should be submitted with evidence to show how the design, scale
and layout match the
historic pattern of the surrounding development, its built form,
density and overall
appearance.
LP30
Built
Form
General
Principles
All development in terms of its layout, form and density should respect and reflect the existing
pattern, character and a
ppearance of its setting. Local design detail and characteristics should
be reflected within the development. All proposals should
therefore:
a)
ensure that all of the elements of the proposal are well related to each other and
harmonise with both the
immediate setting and wider
surroundings;
b)
make use of and enhance views into and out of the site both in and outside of the site;
c)
make appropriate use of landmarks and local
features;
d)
reflect the characteristic architectural styles, patterns and features t
aking into account
their scale and
proportion,
e)
reflect the predominant materials, colours, landscape and boundary treatments in the
area;
f)
ensure that the buildings and spaces connect with and maintain access to the
surrounding area and with the wider
built, water and natural
environment;
g)
are designed to take into account the needs and practicalities of services and the long
term management of public and shared private spaces and
facilities;
h)
create a safe, secure, low crime environment through the la
yout, specification and
positioning of buildings, spaces and uses in line with national Secured by Design
standards;
i)
reduce sky glow, glare and light trespass from external illumination;
and
j)
ensure that existing water courses are fully integrated int
o site layout at an early stage
and to ensure that space is made for water through de
-
culverting, re
-
naturalisation and
potential channel
diversion.71
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Where Design Briefs are adopted for allocated sites and Neighbourhood Plans address design
matters, then all development proposals will be expected to accord with the principles set out
therein.
Specific Development Types
Infill development should reflect the prevailing character and quality of the surrounding street
scene. The more unified th
e character and appearance of the surrounding buildings and built
form, the greater the need will be to reproduce the existing pattern.
Back
-
land development should be subservient in height, scale and mass to the surrounding
frontage buildings. Access arr
angements should not cause adverse impacts to the character and
appearance, safety or amenity of the existing frontage development.
Alterations, Extensions and Replacements
Extensions, alterations to and replacement of existing buildings will be expected
to:
a)
respect the siting, scale, form, proportions, materials, details and overall design and
character of the host building, its curtilage and
setting;
b)
retain and/or reinstate traditional or distinctive architectural features and
fabric,
c)
safeguard the
amenity of the host premises and neighbouring
occupiers
d)
leave sufficient external usable private space for occupiers,
and
e)
satisfy the design criteria set out
in
the Document “Design Guide for Extensions
”
.
Extensions should be physically and
visually subservient to the host building including its roof
form so as not to dominate it, by virtue of their scale and
siting.
Frontages,
Signage and External Installations
13.20
The principle purpose of a
commercial frontage
is the advertisement and display of goods
and services provided inside the building.
Good design will reinforce the
business’s
identity and its location in the street, but by reflecting the style of the whole building above
street level, and that of its
neighbours.
A good design will treat the
frontage
as an
integral part of the whole building and street frontage without focussing exclusively on the
business
alone.
13.21
The Council has to balance the important economic and social function with the
comm
ercial interests of properties.
This is particularly important in the historic town
centres so as to retain a viable retail base whilst preserving the historic and traditional
appearance of our town centres.
The Council’s adopted “
Guide for Shop Front De
sign
”
provides advice, guidance and examples of the preferred approach to development
affecting all shop fronts and commercial properties.
This will continue to be used for
planning purposes for all commercial, business and service uses.
Since the adoption of
this plan the Use Class Order has been updated which allows a greater range of change
of use.
The physical change to the frontages is
still considered important to the locality.
LP31
Frontages, Signage and External Installations
Development proposals involving change to existing, or the introduction of new
service
frontages, advertisements, external illumination and external installations
will be expected to
have regard to the host building and the wider street scene in terms of t
heir scale, proportion and
overall design.
In particular
,72
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
New Agricultural, Forestry and Equestri
an Buildings

the proportions of the changed new elevations should harmonise with the main building

materials should reflect the existing range on the original building

the ground floor should not be treated
in isolation from the other levels

it should add interest to the street scene

where sites are located within the Conservation Area or within the setting of a Listed
Building they should reflect or respect the appearance and character of the Conservation
Ar
ea/Listed Building
In addition, in relation to external
illumination
proposals
will be expected to adopt a scale, detail,
siting and type of illumination appropriate to the character of the host building, the wider street
scene and longer distant views
.
External installations and security measures should be integrated into the over
all design of the
host building with the aim of avoiding harm to the appearance of the building and the street
scene. The design criteria
will be set out in an SPD and its requirements
will need to be
satisfied.
13.22
The rural character of the Borough is very important.
Any buildings within the countryside
can have an adverse effect on the locality generally and on local amenity specifically.
Agricultural and equestrian buildings, in particular, can have substantial visual impacts.
Encouragement will be given to the use of existing buildings wherever possible.
Any
impacts will be balanced against the economic need for such buildings
.
LP32
New Agricultural, Forestry and Equestrian Buildings
New or extensions to existing agricultural, forestry and equestrian buildings or structures will be
supported if it can be demonstrated that they are reasonably necessary both in scale,
construction
and design for the efficient and viable long
-
term operation of that holding; that there
are no other existing buildings
(other than where that would be demonstrably impractical, have
adverse visual effects compared with an alternative location, or where a
new holding and
buildings are being established)
or structures that can be used, altered or extended, that they are
located within or adjacent to a group of existing buildings, the site selected and materials used
would not cause visual intrusion and in t
he case of livestock
buildings their location would not
cause loss of residential amenity.
Water Management
13.23
Water Management is an important issue that must be addressed in any development
proposal. Flooding events, in particular, are making headlines on a more regular basis.
Existing issues may not be able to be addressed completely but they should not be made
any worse by development taking place and where possible improvements should be
made. Any development should have no greater run
-
off than a greenfield
site.
13.24
T
he Water Framework Directive has resulted in a number of River Basin Management
Plans cove
ring the whole country.
Two specifically relate to North Warwickshire.
Humber River Basin Management Plan covers the majority of the Borough and a smaller
area north of Coventry is covered by the Severn River Management Plan.
The Rivers
Tame, Blythe and
Anker are all subject to pollution. Particular attention will be paid to
remediation measures to benefit the River Blythe Site of Special Scientific Interest, which
is currently under serious threat from pollution
run
-
off.73
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
13.25
The Borough Council will c
onsider the impact of
flooding
in its consideration of
development within or adjoining floodplains
.
Any development within Flood Zones Two
and Three will need to provide a site
-
specific Flood Risk Assessment to demonstrate that
it will be safe and will no
t increase flood risk elsewhere.
In Flood Zone 1, an assessment
should accompany all proposals involving: sites of 1 hectare or more; land which has
been identified by the Environment Agency as having critical drainage problems; land
identified in a strat
egic flood risk assessment as being at increased flood risk in future; or
land that may be subject to other sources of flooding, where its
development would
introduce a more vulnerable use.
It should take into account all sources of flood risk and
climate
change.
Up to date indicative Flood Maps for Planning can be obtained from the
Environment Agency and the Government’s website
13.26
Effective flood protection requires proper maintenance of watercourses and
their
associated infrastructure as well as the control of water discharge through drainage
systems.
Ponds and other wetland features
form an important function that should where
possible be protected and enhanced.
Managing flood risk is thus based on min
imising
the risk of flooding by avoiding development in high risk areas; restricting discharge to
greenfield runoff rates and ensuring development is designed so as to minimise surface
water flooding risks, including the retention of existing natural wetla
nd features and the
safeguarding of land adjacent to these features.
Sustainable drainage systems are an
important feature in ensuring flood risk is effectively managed and thus all developments
are expected to include the use of such systems unless demon
strated that they would be
inappropriate.
Sufficient space should thus be allowed for and around them in all
developments.
All such systems should aim to protect and enhance water quality by
reducing the risk of diffuse pollution by treating such possibi
lities at source including
where necessary through multiple different treatment measures.
All of these systems
should be designed in accordance with relevant national standards and long
-
term
operation and maintenance arrangements should be put in place fo
r the lifetime of the
development. Flood alleviation requires a holistic approach to water management.
Rivers
and streams need to be allowed to function via natural processes and to connect with the
flood plain in order to increase and maintain capacity a
nd to store flood water.
Artificial
surface water infrastructure
needs
to be well designed and be properly maintained whilst
the ecosystem that helps manage water also need to be protected to allow greater
ground water storage, to prevent rapid surface ru
n
-
off and soil erosion.
In these ways
natural flood management and the re
-
naturalisation of water courses and their flood
plains can help to reduce flood risk and water pollution; increase biodiversity and
contribute to improving public health.
13.27
Natural flood management and the re

naturalisation of water course and their flood plains

3
Water
and Flood Risk
Management
In line with the objectives of the Water Framework Directive, development proposals must not
detrimentally
affect the ecological status of a waterbody and where appropriate, incorporate
measures to improve its ecological
value.
Opportunities should be sought to de
-
culvert rivers,
in order to reduce flood risk through stopping
flows backing up by undersized culverts.
This should only be undertaken when it is
demonstrated to not increase flood risk elsewhere
.
If de
-
culverting is
not proposed evidence will
be required to demonstrate why this is not possible. River channel restoration should also be
undertaken to return the water course to its natural state and restore floodplain to reduce the
impact of flooding
downstream.74
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
New d
evelopments should also seek opportunities to improve natural riverine processes and in
-
stream and bankside morphology
through
watercourse re
-
naturalisation and the removal of man
-
made structures, both on the development site and in the wider catchment. Wa
ter runoff from
new development must be no more than natural greenfield runoff rates and developments should
hold this water back on the development site through high quality Sustainable Urban Drainage
(SuDS), reducing pollution and flood risk to nearby wa
tercourses. The culverting of watercourses
will only be approved in exceptional circumstances.
The multifunctional benefits of natural flood management
,
the re
-
naturalisation of watercourses
and their floodplains
and the safeguarding of land for local flo
od risk management schemes
will
be promoted when considering any developments in the Borough.
New development proposals in
or land raising within Flood Zone 3 (including Climate Change)
should provide for the following
:
i)
Floodplain Compensation;
provide floodplain compensation on a level
-
for
-
level
basis;
ii)
should set back 8m from the top of the banks of Main Rivers and any culverted
watercourse, regardless of the flood zone;
iii)
Finished floor levels (FFL) within Flood Zone 3 (i
ncluding climate Change) and on land
adjacent should be set a minimum of 600mm above Flood Zone 3, (including climate
change) flood level;
iv)
have agreements in place that “less vulnerable” uses are prevented for changing to those
that are more vulnerable,
an
d
(only applies to ground floor developments in line with
SFRA section 12.4), and single storey residential development, basements and buildings
on stilts should not be located within Flood Zone 3 (including climate change), and
v)
include mitigation measures
to account for up to the 1 in 100 year (1% AEP) plus climate
change fluvial flood event as well as safe access and egress
In order to improve and protect water quality, infiltration measures are the preferred means of
surface water disposal where ground
conditions are appropriate and where practicable, the
separation of surface water from sewers should be undertaken.
New development proposals
should be accompanied by a Water Statement that includes evidence to demonstrate that there
is adequate sewerage
infrastructure in place or that it will be in place prior to
occupation.
13.28
Transport in a rural area has a different dynamic to that in a built up area.
There is a
strong dependence on the use of the motor car, as rural bus services may not provide the
required journey at the relevant t
ime to access employment sites, in particular.
This issue
is being exacerbated by the cut in funds to bus operators.
This reliance on the motor car
can lead to local issues that may result in a greater need for on
-
site parking and thus
result in localise
d parking standards.
It is important that provision is made for proper
vehicular access, sufficient parking and manoeuvring for vehicles in accordance with
adopted
standards;
13.29
Parking reviews undertaken in recent years have indicated the Borough’s h
istoric town
centres are approaching capacity at peak times.
Nevertheless, the reviews note that, if
managed correctly, there was sufficient capacity to meet demand until at least 2018.
The
reviews also noted that the impact of the increased rail service
on parking would be
minimal and this appears to be borne out by recent assessments particularly for
Atherstone, although the private car park provision at both Coleshill and Water Orton are
often over capacity at peak hours resulting in spill over parking
occurring.
Coleshill town
centre currently suffers from insufficient
publicly
accessible parking to serve both its
commercial, economic and residential needs and functions.
Parking75
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
13.30
With the likely introduction of Civil Enforcement and a further parking st
udy underway
there may be implications for the Market Towns. Until this study has been completed this
is still unclear.
The Borough Council will consider the results of the study and will
consider what action will be
required.
13.31
However, increased development levels expected to be accommodated in this Local
Plan are likely to significantly increase pressure on available spaces.
To enable
adequate capacity to serve the commercial function of the town centres it is
recommended that
new housing development within the identified Town Centres should
provide a minimum level of private parking to reduce the pressure on current public
provision.
13.32
The Government has taken the decision that by 2040 no new diesel vehicles will be
produ
ced.
The implication is that more electric vehicles will be on our roads as prices
reduce and batteries improve.
This has implications on the need to provide the right
infrastructure to support this decision.
Rapid charging points will be particularly
i
mportant in the public domain. In addition, all domestic properties and commercial
premises need to provide for the opportunity to charge vehicles close to the parking of
vehicles.
LP34
Parking
Adequate vehicle parking provision commensurate to a proposed development will be expected,
as guided by the standards
in the Document “Parking Standards”
.
Greater emphasis will be
placed on parking provision in areas not served by public transport whilst
lower provision within
the main towns may be appropriate.
Town Centres
Within the defined Town Centres new residential development must provide the minimum parking
spaces necessary to enable and service the development, with 1 parking space per flat or
2 per
house. No reduced level of car parking provision will be acceptable unless the following
circumstances are clearly evidenced:

there is spare capacity available in nearby public car parks or adjacent on street
car
parking (that is available for
long stay use);
or

where the exercise of flexibility would assist in the conservation of the built heritage,
facilitating a better quality of development and the beneficial re
-
use of an existing historic
building.
Airport Parking
Proposals for remote  parking of passengers or visitor vehicles in the Borough will not
generally be
permissible given existing constraints on parking provision and infrastructure demands.
Any such
proposals must demonstrate that they would (i) not compro
mise delivery of the plan strategy as a
whole (ii) that there is a clear justification for provision in the location proposed, and (iii) that the
benefits of such provision would outweigh any adverse effects, including by consequence of
occupying land that
could be put to a viable alternative use.76
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Electric Vehicle Charging points
Electric charging points will be provided as part of all
relevant developments to an agreed
specification and location dependent on the scheme proposed and
applicable technical guidance.
Rapid charging points will be provided on sites when locat
ed in the public realm.
On housing sites
homes with on
-
site parking will provide an electric charging point in an accessible location close
to the parking space(s).
On commercial sites there will be employee and visitor rapid charging
points.
Lorry Parking
Proposals which reduce lorry parking (either informal or formal parking areas) should be
accompanied by evidence to support its loss and explore opportunities fo
r alternative provision.
In
recognition of the Borough’s strategic location and demand for lorry parking, the Council will give
weight to lorry parking provision and facilities, and opportunities for alternative provision and for
improved management in de
cision
-
taking.
13.33
Climate change is a key priority for all and over the coming years the move to zero carbon
will influence the future policy background.
Changes, especially with the improvement in
green technology, can have a major long lasting impact.
The Borough Counci
l is
committed to reducing the carbon footprint of the Borough and encourages changes that
lead to such improvements.
It has worked with other authorities in the sub
-
region to
produce a Renewable Energy Study.
This indicated there was little opportunity
for large
scale wind generation or district and community heat and power schemes.
The report also
highlighted how a reasonable proportion of properties in the Borough are still not
connected to mains gas supply.
In addition
,
it has worked with the sub
-
re
gional authorities
and the Carbon Trust to produce a renewable energy
toolkit.
13.34
Wind turbines are a means of providing renewable energy.
A key factor of their
development will be their impact on the landscape and the local community.
A study has
be
en undertaken to consider the possibility of using district heating schemes.
This showed
that there was limited scope
,
but large development should look at the possibility of such
proposals.
13.35
All proposals will be required to provide detailed information on associated infrastructure
required, including roads and grid connections, impact during construction and operational
phases of the development, including visual impact, noise and odour issue
s and
provisions made for restoration of the
site.
LP35
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
Renewable energy projects will be supported where they respect the capacity and sensitivity of
the landscape and communities to accommodate them.
In particular, they will be assessed on
their individual and cumulative impact on landscape quality, sites or
features of natural
importance, sites or buildings of historic or cultural importance, residential amenity and the local
economy.
New development will be expected to be energy efficient in terms of its fabric and use
including,
where viable, the producti
on of 10% of operational energy from on

Broadband
13.36
The roll out of superfast broadband is critical in helping to assist in providing a wider skills
base within the
Borough and allow for home working and homebased businesses to
thrive. This will particularly help rural
businesses.
13.37
The Coventry, Warwickshire and Solihull Superfast Broadband Project continues to
deliver the Government’s 2015 targets that
every property should be able to access
broadband speeds of at least 2Mbps and that superfast broadband (defined as providing
more than 24Mbps) should be available to 90% of premises in each local authority area.
The project is supported by the Coventry &
Warwickshire and Greater Birmingham &
Solihull Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs). This Plan however looks beyond the aims
of the sub
-
regional broadband project and seeks all new development to have
connections enabling download speeds of 30Mbps in accor
dance with the Government’s
commitment to the EU2020 Digital Agenda. Where no strategic telecommunications
infrastructure is available, developers should provide suitable ducting to the premises for
later
connection.
LP36
Information and Communication Tec
hnologies
New development will contribute to and be compatible with local fibre or other high speed
broadband infrastructure. This will be demonstrated through a ‘Connectivity Statement’
submitted with planning applications where appropriate, based on the scale and
nature of the
proposed development. Such statements should set out the anticipated connectivity
requirements of the development, known data networks nearby and their anticipated speed
(fixed copper, 3G, 4G,
5G
fibre, satellite, microwave, etc.), and a desc
ription of how the
development will connect with or contribute to any such
networks.
The Council will expect new development to be connected to high speed broadband
infrastructure capable of providing a minimum download speed of 30Mbps. Where no strategic
telecommunications infrastructure is available, as a minimum and subject to viability of the
scheme, suitable ducting that can accept fibre should be provided either
to:
•
the public highway;
or
•
a community led local access network;
or
•
another
location that can be justified through the connectivity
statement.
Major infrastructure development must provide ducting that is available for strategic fibre
deployment or community owned local access networks. Developers are encouraged to have
early dis
cussions with strategic providers or local broadband
groups.78

Allocations
14.1
In order to be able to allocate the right amount of land it is important to understand the
components of supply within the
Borough.
Housing Land
14.2
Housing supply is made up of completions (sites already completed), commitments (sites
with planning permission), windfalls (unidentified sites coming forward for development
during the Plan period) as well as new site allocations and
pr
oposals.
14.3
The Borough Council has to maintain a 5
-
year housing supply. The National Planning
Policy Guidance introduced a requirement for either a 5% or 20% buffer depending on
whether the Council has a good record or not of maintaining and delivering
a
five
-
year
housing supply.
The Borough Council will monitor its housing delivery to ensure that good
delivery is maintained.
There is therefore a 5% flexibility included in the
five
-
year
housing
supply.
14.4
Table 7 indicates the amount of housing tha
t is required for the remaining Plan period.
14.5
The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment 2016 indicates that there is sufficient
land to cater for the housing requirement up to and beyond 2031.
In addition, the
Borough Council is actively pu
rsuing development on land it owns as well as County
Council owned land to ensure the continuous supply of readily available sites. Specific
allocations are brought forward through this Plan.
Additional sites could be brought
through a Neighbourhood
Plan.
14.6
The Government has launched a consultation on a new methodology for assessing
housing need. In the accompanying spreadsheet North Warwickshire’s housing need
goes down from 237 to 169 dwellings per annum.
However
,
this does not take account of
the
duty to co
-
operate in respect of both Coventry and Birmingham.
The figure from
Coventry, for example, takes the overall reduction down to 820 over the plan period or 54
per annum. Given the limited weight that can be attached to this consultation it is no
t
proposed to change any of the allocations
,
but it may be that certain sites may go beyond
the plan period in terms of
delivery.

Additional Reserve Land
14.9
The delivery of housing land can alter and change over the Plan period.
In order to take
account of this and to allow an additional element of flexibility
three
sites will be reserved
and released earlier if a number of criteria are
fulfilled.
14.10
The
first site is land to the north of Coleshill Road, Ansley Common and is reserved for
future housing land.
The land totals some 21.6 hectares and could deliver a further 388
units. Access to the site needs to be investigated further. Land to the north is a
local
wildlife
site.
14.11
The second reserve site is land to the north and east of Dairy House Farm, Grendon.
This site also provides for the future dualling of the A5. Land will be thus protected to
provide at least the width of a dual carriageway as
well as providing for a landscape strip
which will include a
15m
buffer around the ancient
woodland.
LP
38
Reserve Housing Sites
The following sites are allocated as reserve housing sites.
They are sites which have been
assessed in the same manner as allocations, and where there is a reasonable prospect that they
could become available and could be viably developed towards the medium
-
latter years of the
Plan.
They will be considered to be
inside the development boundary of the respective
settlement once the whole development has been completed.  The sites will be released when
two criteria are met (both apply).
The first criteria is
,
if there is a need to enable supply against
the five yea
r housing land supply,
i.e.,
if annual monitoring data indicates that forecast land
supply falls lower than 5.5 years relative to the stepped trajectory.
Secondly, reserve sites will
only be considered at that juncture if access, infrastructure, or floodi
ng issues have been
addressed as relevant, and they otherwise represent deliverable sites.
It is expected that sites will
be developed in accordance with the density requirements of this Plan.  Figures given below are
indicative amounts subject to refining
once infrastructure requirements including the safeguarded
routes and flood work, in particular, are known.

and re
-
join the current A5 to the east of Grendon (A5 ‘phases 3 and 4’ in the Infrastructure

the Borough Council to in
clude the following
:81
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021

An agreed alignment of the A5 dualling within the site

Safeguarded land for the dualling of the A5 together with proportionate highway
contributions

housing will be located to the south of the new road

a minimum of 15m (or as agreed) buffer zone will be provided around the ancient
woodland

a
landscaped buffer
will be provided along the new A5;

the current Watling Street, A5, will be downgraded and pedestrian crossings will be
provided to allow for greater cohesion with the main part of the settlement to the south;
and

improved cycling will be provided
along the Watling Street.

Provide supporting social and community infrastructure
Site RH2 (land north of Ansley
Common) will likely be deliverable after 2025 particularly in the
eventuality that phases 1 to 4 of the A5 improvement works are delayed or not
clear at that stage
subject to access and highway improvements in the locality being addressed.
The site
will provide for:

improved walking and cycling through the site to link to the various footpaths;

provide an access road through the site which is useable by public transport; and,

will assess and then implement a package of measures to protect and enhance the
biodiversity
assets in the locality including Moorwood Wood.

Provide supporting social and community infrastructure
Site RH3 as shown on the Policies Map will require a detailed site
-
specific flood risk assessment
to prove with higher accuracy the extents available for safe development outside of the Flood
Zone 3 climate change extent defined by new (high resolution) de
tailed modelling.  The extent of
the developable area will be defined and based upon the EA Flood Zones until such modelling
outputs become available.  It may be possible to redistribute ground levels within the site to
ensure safe access and egress to all
parts of the site, however this will need to be explored in
greater detail as part

Atherstone
14.15
Atherstone is one of the three Market Towns within North Warwickshire and is extremely
important to the vitality of the Borough as a whole. It has continued to struggle within the
overall economic climate. It has a variety of s
hops, large employment areas, historical
areas as well as recreational facilities, providing a wide range of services and facilities.
However due to the easy access to surrounding larger towns and cities these services
and facilities are constantly under
p
ressure.
14.16
Atherstone grew as a town through its association with agriculture and because of its
location in relation to Watling Street, and the canal and railway network. It continues to
exhibit a distinctive character, being underpinned by its
historic plan form which has
medieval origins. The prosperity of the town during the 18
th
and 19
th
centuries is
evidenced with its two and three storey townhouses, with Georgian facades which line
Long Street and surround the Market Place/Church Square. Th
ere is a legacy of past
industries, most importantly the production of felt hats, with examples of industrial
buildings from the 19
th
century onwards. A Heritage Partnership Scheme with Advantage
West Midlands and English Heritage assisted in improving som
e of the important
frontages within the town
centre.

Atherstone has two main employment sites.
The oldest of these, at Carlyon Road, was
built during the 1970’s and 1980’s. It is the
quality of many of the units
8
that is now an
issue with many of the units not standing up to modern day needs.
The other site off
Holly Lane is dominated by the presence of TNT and Aldi. Land has been allocated for
further expansion at this estate.
The l
andowner now wishes to retain this land for their
expansion plans.
Therefore, although available, it is for a specific end user of Aldi
themselves. Both estates offer redevelopment and regeneration opportunities.
Mancetter

Mancetter although shari
ng
a development boundary with Atherstone and is considered
as an integral part of the Market Town in planning terms it is clearly seen, locally
as
a
settlement
in
its
own
right
with
its
own
character.
It
has
its
own
historic
core formed
from
surviving historic buildings and with important archaeological remains dating back
to the Roman period. It also has a conservation area.  Mancetter has its own industrial
estate offering a range of unit sizes starting from small starter units. Ridge Lane l
ies
within the Mancetter Parish and following the adoption of the Mancetter Neighbourhood
Plan has a development
boundary.
Housing
14.19
The Core Strategy identified that due to constraints around Atherstone that growth would
take place to the north
-
west of the town. Some development has already taken place
and further applications are currently under consideration.
There are two main hous
ing
allocations being proposed to the north
-
west of the town.
Land off Holly Lane was
shown as an allocation in the Draft Site Allocations Plan.
An outline planning application
is currently being considered for this site.
If for any reason this applicat
ion is withdrawn
it will be expected that it will be considered as part of the new allocation to the
north
-
west.
H1
Land at Holly Lane Atherstone
32.7 hectares of land off Holly Lane, Atherstone is allocated for around
620
dwellings.
•
The site
should provide for a mix of types and tenures including the opportunity to provide
serviced plots for potential self
-
build dwellings;
and
•
Open space provision either on
-
site or part via financial contributions towards
improvements at Royal Meadow should be
provided, including provision of a landscaped
walk/cycle link along the Innage Brook, linking with the route and Sustainable Urban
Drainage systems on adjoining sites to the south, off Rowland Way; and
•
The site will require significant landscaping along i
ts north and north western boundaries
to address the open aspect and landscape sensitivity identified in the Council’s
Landscape Character Assessment for this area of land at the edge of Atherstone
town.
Development of the site should enable and not prevent access opportunities and routes to further
potential land to the west, including both vehicular and pedestrian.
The site is shown on the
Policies Map indicating Areas A and B. Area A is the developable
area and area B will be an area
for open space/ landscaping.
A site specific Flood Risk Assessment must be undertaken to
demonstrate the extent of land available for development outside of flood zones 2 and 3 plus
climate change freeboard, on the basis o
f (high resolution) detailed modelling.
The extents of
Area A and Area B are indicative and based upon the EA Flood Zones until such modelling
outputs become available84

This site will be considered through a Concept and Master Plan which will be
brought
together with the local community and ensure the comprehensive development of the
area.
There are a number of heritage assets
within and
close to the site
.
In addition to
the evidence prepared in support of the plan including at examination, they
will require
detailed assessment in respect of their significance, setting and implications of any
effects.
14.21
Additional access over the West Coast Mainline will be required to open the area for
development.
The bridge at Whittington Lane could be u
tilised.
Its strength will need to
be investigated and, if required, work carried out to bring it up to a suitable standard or a
new bridge be
provided.
14.22
The site includes 1.1km of the Coventry Canal and is an attractive section for boaters. It
has three bridges, one of which is listed as well as two listed locks.
The canal
is
an
important
asset
that
can
be
utilised
for
encouraging
walking
and
cycling
for both
commuting and leisure.
The future concept and master planning of the site will need to
consider how the canal can be improved and incorporated into the development as well as
improving linkages and in particular to Atherstone town centre,
whilst maintaining its
popularity for boaters.
14.23
Although Atherstone has a range of service and facilities the growth of the town will
place pressure on these.
A full study will need to be carried out involving the local
community to ascertain the e
xact requirements.
The Borough Council will work with
Homes England
(Team for dealing with large planning applications in the Homes &
Communities Agency), the local community and landowners to agree a Concept Plan
and Master Plan for the
area.
H2 Land to
the north
-
west of Atherstone, off Whittington Lane
Some 71.2 hectares to the north
-
west of Atherstone is allocated for development (H2)
including
at least 1280 dwellings.
Development will take place in accordance with a Concept and Master
Plan, agreed by the Borough Council, to ensure the comprehensive delivery of the area.
These
Plans will consider and provide for in particular but not exclusively:
The site is shown on
the Policies Map indicating Areas A and B.  Area A is the developable area
and area B will be an area for open space/ landscaping.  A Level 3 Flood Risk Assessment must
be undertaken to demonstrate the extent of land available for development outside of fl
ood zones
2 and 3 plus climate change freeboard, on the basis of (high resolution) detailed modelling.  The
extents of Area A and Area B will be defined as indicative and based upon the EA Flood Zones
until such modelling outputs become available.
1
An ap
propriate assessment of the significance of the sites designated and non
-
designated
historic assets and the sensitivity to changes in the historic environment will inform the Master
Plan and be an important consideration in assessing development proposals.
Any development
should seek to retain the heritage assets within the site and address the setting of any assets
beyond the site that contribute to their historic significance.
Although the allocation will result in
some contextual change, development sh
ould, as far as practicable, ensure that those assets are
retained or enhanced in line with policy LP15 that any effects to heritage assets or their settings
should be minimised.
The Master Plan should address the preservation and enhancement of

Coleshill is one of the three Market Towns and lies to the west of the Borough. It has a
wide range of services and facilities.
It is surrounded by Green Belt.
The town’s historic
core continues to reflect its medieval plan form, whilst architecturally t
he town displays a
considerable variety of buildings varying in size, type and date.
The built character of the
historic core is dominated by two and three storey Georgian townhouses and its medieval
church.
There are many listed buildings and two conser
vation areas within the town.
Since 2008 it has had its own railway station, Coleshill Parkway, with a bus interchange,
which is proving to be very
successful.

Development in the Core Strategy was limited to land inside the development boundary.
This was taken forward in the Draft Site Allocations Plan.
Although there are a few
opportunities it is considered necessary to allocate land outside of its current boundaries
and remove land from the Green Belt.
This will allow for some development to take place

Town.

Th
ere are a number of constraints to development around Coleshill.
These are physical
barriers such as flood plain to the historic view of the Church setting within the
conservation area.
Land around Coleshill within the Joint Green Belt Study generally
pe
rformed well in relation to Green Belt
principles.
Housing
14.
30
Within the 2006 Local Plan and the Core Strategy it was expected that there would be no
development outside of the current development boundary other than possibly for locally
affordable housing. Due to the Green Belt beyond the development boundary of Coleshill
this will continue during this plan
period.
14.
31
A further housing site is being proposed on the site of the allotments adjacent to the
Memorial Park, Coleshill. Acces
s would need to be gained through the site of the former
police station. Replacement of the allotments will be
required.87

Allotments adjacent to Memorial Park, Coleshill
1.4 hectares of land, currently used as allotments, adjacent to the Memorial Par

Polesworth and Dordon
14.
33
Polesworth and Dordon make up one of the three Market Towns and lies to the north of
the Borough.
Polesworth has the historic core
centered
on Polesworth Abbey and the
Conservation Area.
Polesworth and Dordon have a close geographical relationship with
T
amworth, for a range of services and facilities.
However
,
residents also use the services
and facilities in other neighbouring settlements of Atherstone, Nuneaton and Coventry.
Hospital referrals are mainly accessed via the George Eliot or University Hosp
itals.
This
puts the services and facilities in Polesworth and Dordon under pressure.
It still retains
some key services but these are generally small in
scale.
14.
34
Polesworth and Dordon are important areas for growth and provide an opportunity to
del
iver new development of character and distinction.
The varied landscape and
topography, together with inherent natural features of value, will form the basis for a
standard and quality of place making that is unique within North Warwickshire.
The
charact
er
s
of Polesworth and Dordon should be used to inform type of place created and
integration between old and new communities will be a key aspiration.
There are however
constraints to their growth: To the north and east is the issue of coal reserves.
To t
he
west, the gap between the
built
-
up
boundary of Tamworth and the rural areas up to
Polesworth and Dordon in North Warwickshire, are extremely important locally and to the
Borough as a whole.
The industrial area and the housing to the south of the A5 are
separate from the main body of the settlement and any development in this area needs to
consider how this issue could be
addressed.
14.
35
Access within and around Polesworth and Dordon is an issue.
The junction of the A5 and
Long Street needs to be improved or changed if development in this area can be taken
forward. In addition, Long Street itself may constrain the number of developments t
hat take
place to the north of the A5 and needs to be addressed in any development proposals that
look towards the A5 for access.
The B5000 also needs to be considered and appropriate
proposals be
implemented
including consideration of the stretch within
Tamworth as
identified in the STA
.88
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021

36
The issue of coal reserves, and that development should not needlessly sterilise minerals
resources and implications for land stability and viability needs detailed consideration in
addition to the evidence support
ing the Local Plan as individual proposals come forward.
14.
37
A major challenge is to ensure that any development growth in Polesworth and Dordon
makes a positive contribution to its sustainability by embracing a mix of housing and other
uses, especially
small
-
scale
employment uses, is supported by all the necessary
infrastructure and services while protecting the separate identity of the two distinct
communities

14.
38
A strategic allocation is identified at Polesworth and Dordon, to the immediate east of the
existing settlement and to the north of the A5 an
d as shown on the figure 1
.
The allocation
will provide for a minimum of 2000 new homes over the plan
period.
14.39
The Borough Council will work with Homes England, the local community and landowners
to agree a Concept Plan and Master Plan for the
area.
14.
40
The development will create a
high
-
quality
extension of the Polesworth and Dordon
communities, maximising the opportunities afforded by the topography of the site and the
presence of a number of Local Wildlife sites.
There are a number of her
itage assets
within and close to the site, which will need detailed assessment of their heritage values
and significance in order to avoid, and where necessary, minimise the impact of
development on these assets. A mix and range of housing types, styles an
d tenures, will
be provided to assist in meeting the housing needs of the Borough and in particular,
providing aspirational, quality homes to retain families within North Warwickshire
.
New
retail facilities will meet local needs and be located in an acces
sible location, with new
community provision either within the development or as part of enhanced existing
provision nearby
.
Primary school facilities will be provided within the site and
contributions will be made to ensure that secondary school faciliti
es are available
locally.
14.
41
Strong green infrastructure will be a key feature, connecting through the new
development into the existing settlements of Polesworth and Dordon and out to the
surrounding countryside, to encourage walking, cycling and recreation.
The existing
local wildl
ife sites will provide a focus for the green infrastructure network.
The use of
sustainable urban drainage will be explored as an option to assist with flood alleviation
and can combine with the green infrastructure corridors where
possible.

Land to the east of Polesworth and Dordon
Land to the east of Polesworth and Dordon between the A5 and B500 will be allocated for
development of a minimum of 2000 homes

.89
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Before planning permission is granted for development
on the site, a Masterplan Framework and
Design Guide for the whole site will be prepared by the landowners, in conjunction with and
approved by the
Borough Council.  Development will take place in accor
dance with the
Framework and Design guide to ensure that development for the whole site is delivered in a
comprehensive and co
-
ordinated manner including addressing the setting, significance and
enhancement of the designated and non
-
designated heritage ass
ets within and close to the site,
through the siting and design of new development will ensure a high quality of place is created
respecting the separate identities of Polesworth and Dordon
.
Although the allocation will result in
some contextual change, de
velopment should, as far as practicable, ensure that those assets are
preserved or enhanced in line with policy LP15, that any effects to heritage assets or their
settings should be minimised.
The Masterplan Framework and Design Guide will be a material
co
nsideration in the determination of future planning applications on the site and will consider and
provide for in particular but not exclusively, and in line with policy LP1
.
1.
The minimum provision of 2000 homes of mixed styles, types and tenures
(market and
affordable) with the potential for custom build and provision for the elderly (to include
independent living for the over 55’s and bungalows)
.
2.
A new two form entry primary school to meet the needs of the development
.
3.
A financial contrib
ution to existing Secondary School provision, to ensure the satisfactory
availability of school places in a locally accessible location
.
4.
A focal point for retail and health facilities to meet the needs of the new development, in a
location that is acce
ssible. Uses that create vibrancy, activity and interest should be
considered, including community uses and the provision of a pub and/or restaurant and
other small
-
scale commercial uses within the site should also be explored.
5.
A strong and clear
network of footpaths and cycle ways that allow for and encourage
sustainable movement through the site. This network should connect to the existing
settlements of Polesworth and Dordon and to the wider countryside and make use of
existing rights of way.


a legible road and movement hierarchy for the whole development; and

off

to;

Dordon Hall and the archaeological remains of its gardens,

the listed
Obelisk, and

Hoo Hill and its visibility and legibility within the wider landscape.
This should be used to inform
master planning
and appropriate design of development on site
that appropriately addresses/conserves the fabric and setting of the assets and in the case of
Dordon Hall and associated assets a full heritage statement should be prepared.  Before the
development of the sit
e, an agreed, appropriately staged programme of archaeological mitigation,
informed by field evaluation will be required.90

and has regard to:

the existing Local
Wildlife Sites of The Hollies (known locally as the Blue Bell Wood),
The Orchard, The Former Colliery and The Pond. Opportunities to enhance appropriate
public access to these sites should be explored to create a useable asset for local
residents. The Hol
lies in particular, provides a strong natural feature containing Ancient
Woodland with local ecological
value. A minimum of 15 metre landscaped/open buffer
should be retained around the ancient woodland in line with the Forestry Commission/
Natural England

Birch Coppice is one of the major distribution sites in North Warwickshire. It also has a
rail freight interchange depot. Directly adjacent to this site is an area fronting on to the
A5. It includes an area of some 1.5 hectares currently used as allotments
.
These will
need to be replaced subject to further consultation with alternative provision being
provided at a more accessible location close to existing residential areas.
The existing
allotments must be replaced and relocated to the alternative location
to the north of the
A5, prior to any redevelopment proposal being granted.
In association with employment
proposals E2 and E3 land north of the A5 off Browns Lane’s is considered a potential
suitable location and is identified for their replacement and id

The allocation of the playing fields south of the A5 at Dordon reflects an opportunity to
relocate the current recreational use (Birch Coppice Football club ground) to a site closer
to existing res

In the Core Strategy and the Draft Site Allocations the Borough Council was not keen to
identify any sites for dealing with a particular need identified by neighbouring local
authorities. It is important to the Borough Council th
at residents and businesses are seen
as being part of North Warwickshire.
This is the stance that Borough Council would like to
continue in the main in this Local Plan.
However
,
it recognises that this cannot always be
the case. There are some sites that
are clearly, due to their road layouts in particular, seen
as being part of the neighbouring local authority.
This in some ways makes the distinction94
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
clear that a site is serving the needs of the neighbouring local authority.
The site south
-
west of junc
tion 10 of the M42 is such a site. Its physical location and access through the
existing Relay Park means it is read as being part of Tamworth.
For this reason the
Borough Council will accept that this contributes to the proportion of 14 hectares being so
rt
by Tamworth Borough Council within their adopted Local Plan 2015.
Further discussions
will take place with Tamworth Borough Council and Lichfield District Council to ascertain
the location of the further 6.5
hectares.
Housing
14.

The land to the west of Robey’s Lane was not considered to be part of the
Strategic
Gap
due to its relationship to Tamworth and is seen as an opportunity to develop a site directly
adjacent to the site of the former Golf course which is currently under con
struction in
Tamworth.
The opportunity exists to provide access with this site to ensure that the
developments are undertaken comprehensively.
It is important that when considering the
needs of the site in terms of the required services and facilities th
at consideration is given
to cross
-
border implications.
A number of meetings have already taken place between the
Borough Council, Tamworth Borough Council, Staffordshire County Council and
Warwickshire County
Council.
14.

Robey’s Lane itself is a smal
l rural lane and it will be important that this is retained to
ensure that the rurality of the gap is maintained. It leads to Alvecote Priory
,
Alvecote Pools
SSSI
and Alvecote Wood.
All
of which are important heritage assets.
A landscaped buffer
will be
provided to the west of the Lane to assist with maintaining and strengthening the
gap in this locality and assist with the setting of the ancient woodland and
priory.
H5
Land west of Robey’s Lane, adjacent Tamworth
An area of approximately 66.1 hectares, east of the former Tamworth Golf Course and west of
Robey’s Lane is allocated primarily for residential development
of approximately 1270 dwellings
.
Prior to development taking place a Master Plan must be agreed by
the Borough Council.
Development will then take place in accordance with the agreed Master Plan. The Master Plan will
include:
•
impacts on the scheduled monument to be considered and taken into account in the design
and form of the future
development;
•
a mix
ture of house types which will include housing for the elderly and for young people as
well as an area for
self
-
build;
•
health and education facilities in terms of land and financial
contributions;
•
the delivery of accessible public open space within the
site linking with adjoining
developments, including pedestrian and cycle route access to the Coventry Canal and
open space proposed to the north of the Golf Course
site;
•
the provision of a significant landscaped buffer along the site boundary with Robey’s
Lane
with particular attention given to the proximity with, and potential impact on, Alvecote
Wood, Alvecote Priory
and Alvecote Pools, respectively an ancient woodland, scheduled
monument and Site of Special Scientific Interest. Although the allocation wi
ll result in some
contextual change, development should, as far as practicable, ensure that those assets are
preserved or enhanced in line with policy LP15.

Within the Birmingham Local Plan there is a Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE) called
Langley SUE.
This site is expected to deliver in the region of 6,000 dwellings.
The site
north of Lindridge Road, Wishaw lies directly north of the Langley SUE and would
provide95
North Warwickshire Local Plan

for around 140 dwellings. It is a triangular piece of ground and is bounded to the east by
the motorway.
The site is currently in the Green Belt and it is proposed to exclude the site
from the Green Belt and to seek it to be developed
with suitab
le regard to
Langley SUE.
The proximity to Langley Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE) and the physical presence of
the motorway to the east would enclose the site; it is important that the site is developed
with appropriate regard to its relationship with
Langley SUE.

les
(1.7km by 2.5km).
The site has over 58 miles (95km) of test track, which along with its
other specialist testing equipment make it a unique automotive testing facility within the
UK.
Although the majority of the site falls within the Borough of Hinck
ley & Bosworth the
Borough Council has been working with HBBC and Nuneaton & Bedworth BC to ensure
the benefits of its growth are far reaching.
14.
50
The Local Plan production has given the opportunity to look at how further growth could be
permitted whic
h would exploit the different emphasis of jobs for the benefit of the Borough.
This Plan supports the focus on advanced manufacturing and engineering consistent with
the sub
-
regional vision established by the Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise
Par
tnership under the Strategic Economic Plan (SEP). Approximately 42 hectares has
become available to the south of the main site.
This land will be outside of the current
Enterprise Zone. It will become known as the Southern Manufacturing Park (SMP)
14.
51
Due to the nature of the Technology Park and because of the strong desire of the Borough
Council to broaden its employment base the site will focus
on
E(g)(ii)
(research

development) and B2 uses
.
B8
(warehouse and distribution) will not be permitte
d unless it
is ancillary to the main use.
The Borough Council sees this as a unique opportunity to
build on the success of Horiba MIRA and does not wish to see this diluted in any
way.
Development will be carried out in accordance with a master plan.

Nurturing infant companies within the research and development arena is an important
element of looking to the future and ensuring that focusing on maximising the benefits both

Development will be carried out in accordance with a Master Plan to be agreed by the Borough
Council. The Master Plan will include.
A)
An Assessment will be required of the significance of heritage assets and non

heritage
assets within and
close to the site including  the contribution of setting to that significance, with
particular reference to Caldecote and Watling Street, to inform appropriate design of development
on site.  Development should, as far as practicable, ensure that those ass

Baddesley Ensor and Grendon are two villages which are co

joined.
They are situated
about 2½ miles from Atherstone. Grendon reflects the unplanned “ribbon” development of
the early to mid
-
1900, running south east along the A5.
Whilst Baddesley Ensor rise
s up
Boot Hill from the A5 with the main centre located from Hill Top to Keys Hill/New Street.
Baddesley benefits from a number of services and facilities, including the primary school,
village hall, public house and a few shops and daily bus service.
It
has a community library
in the village hall and community hub. Grendon in addition has a public house and a
newsagent.
There is also a Working Men’s Club and bowling green.
New development
should help maintain existing services, but must be
developed in character with the village,
addressing service needs and highway
issues.

Church Farm is located to the north of New Street, Baddesley Ensor. Car sales have taken
place from the site.
The allocated site extends beyond the farm buildings

Land at Church Farm, Baddesley Ensor
Land at Church Farm New Street, Baddesley Ensor, comprising 2.2 hectares is allocated for a
heritage led residential development including conversion and regeneration of Church
Farmhouse and ancillary/associated barn and outbuildings.
A high level of desi
gn and care
is
required to address the setting of the nearby Church of St Nicolas and Grade 2 listed war
memorial, the sensitive landscape edge and setting of the site as highlighted in the Council’s
Landscape Character Assessment for the settlement.
Deve
lopment of the site will need to
provide for in particular:
An assessment of the significance of designated and non
-
designated heritage assets within and
adjoining the site and the contribution of setting to that significance will be provided via a
herit
age assessment, with particular reference to;

Church of St Nicholas

the Grade 2 Listed war memorial,

Church House, New street,

the historic farmstead and farmhouse, Church Farm,

The site of Baddesley Old Hall and any remaining associated
structures, and the
cottages site off Watery Lane.
1
The approach to development should be to maintain and emphasise the outlook and
views through the site between these assets, reflecting the relationship and sensitivity
with the historic setting of the
wider landscape. Any harm, including taking account of
any mitigation, should require clear and convincing justification. Views from the
existing
settlement through the site to the Church and war memorial shall be retained.
2
Development should
enable retention and re
-
use of the former Church Farm dwelling
and related historic farm buildings, which is recognised as a fine historic agricultural
complex, as part of any development proposal to reflect the historic character of the site
and aid in in
tegrating the site with the existing village. If evidence proves the complex
cannot be retained in full or in part, new development should seek to reflect the farm
complex. The new developments details, scale and massing should reflect the existing
buildin
gs and their rural (partial wooded) setting, retaining the outlook and open nature of
views between the site, heritage assets listed above.
3
The site design should incorporate high value biodiversity features and aim to protect
neighbouring designated si
tes for nature conservation via the appropriate use of
seminatural buffers. A programme of landscaping, tree planting and sensitive boundary
treatment and planting will be required to address the sites sensitive setting in landscape
and built heritage term
s. Given the sensitive nature of the site, proposals will require an
agreed, appropriately
staged programme of archaeological investigation, evaluation and
recording before the development of the site.

Ensor
Land at Boot Hill adjoining the former Youth Centre, currently Grendon Community Centre,
comprising 0.3 hectares, is allocated for residential development. Development of the site s
hould
ensure retention of the mature trees to the boundaries of the site to reflect the character of the site
and aid in integrating the site into the existing village.
Hartshill with Ansley Common
14.
57
Hartshill with Ansley Common is one of the
five Local Service Centres. It has a wide range
of service and facilities. The main facilities include a large secondary school, serving a
wide catchment area in parts of North Warwickshire and Nuneaton, one of the largest
Junior Schools in Warwickshire an
d a
n
infant school.
The scale of school provision is a
particular feature of the village and needs major investment both in terms of the buildings
as well as providing better access to the schools.
14.
58
There has been considerable housing development in the village in the last 40 years,
which has resulted in two large estates either end of the village.
There is potential for
further housing growth including a number of previously developed sites, as well
as
substantial Greenfield sites.
The key would be to allow development that would reflect the
nature of the village, as well as improve the local services and facilities.
Although it has a
very close proximity to Nuneaton it remains an area which has a
more rural character. Any
development in this area will affect residents and businesses in both
Boroughs’.
14.
59
Hartshill has a long history of mineral extraction, with hard rock quarries to the east.
To the
west there are the remains of the Moorwood mi
neral railway line and there are sites that
have previously been tipped.
It will be important for there to be early consideration of
beneficial after uses of mineral sites.
Any uses would need to protect and enhance the rich
natural and geo
-
diversity in
this
area.
Housing
14.
60
It is proposed to allocate some 30 hectares at land off Church Road, Hartshill. The land
extends to Nuneaton Road in the east to Camp Hill Road to the south.
There are areas of
land to the north west of the site which are still
potentially operational for mineral
extraction, but these lie outside of the allocated site.
The owners, Tarmac and Hanson,
are keen to secure the site and quarries long term use as well as give the opportunity,
either in its entirety or in parcels, to be
released for uses that would assist the continued
vitality of the village.
The Hartshill Parish Plan and Neighbourhood Plan have highlighted a
need for housing for older people. It is expected that due to the size of the site that a range
of house types
will be provided.
H9
Land between Church Road and Nuneaton Rd, Hartshill
Some 30.4 hectares at land between Church Road and Nuneaton Road, Hartshill is allocated
for a minimum of 400 dwellings with associated infrastructure. Any development will
need to
consider the significance of the heritage assets within and close to the site and be taken into
account in the design and form of any future
development.
Development will be undertaken in accordance with a Concept and Master Plan agreed with the
Borough Council. The document will be prepared to assist with the development of the site.99
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
Development of the site will include:

a through road from Church Road
to either Nuneaton Road or Camphill Road capable of
buses, emergency vehicles and waste vehicles manoeuvring
freely;

access and parking issues
addressed
; including enabling access to the rear of the
secondary school to facilitate parking, access to the sc
hool and the future provision of
drop off and public transport stopping facilities

a range of house types to include housing for the elderly and young people;
and

a net improvement in educational, sport and recreation facilities within and
adjoining the
site to include educational infrastructure to assist the adjoining secondary school and
nearby primary schools as well as the protection and long
-
term favourable management
of designated Local Wildlife sites;
and,

the contribution of setting
to the significance of the Holy Trinity Church to be assessed
and taken into account in the design and form of the future development.
14.
61
There are a number of sites that have been put forward for housing development around
Ansley Common.
Some 17.2 hectares south of the village have been allocated with a
further 21.6 hectares north of the village reserved for future development.
These larg
e
areas give the opportunity for a number of service and facilities to be
improved
including
the allotments and sports ground
as well as improve the local
roads.
14.
62
Access to both southern and northern sites will need to be investigated and solutions b
e
implemented comprehensively.
This may also involve sites within the boundary of
Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough
Council.
It is expected that the site allocation H20 will be
delivered in advance of the reserve site, RH2, Land north of Ansley Common, identified in
New Policy LP3
8
unless circumstances change
.
H10
Land south of Ansley Common
Some 17.2 hectares (south) of
land at Ansley Common are allocated for housing development. It
is expected that at least 450 dwellings will be developed in this Plan period. Development will take
place comprehensively including site RH2 and be in accordance with an agreed Concept and
Ma
ster Plan.
Development of the site will include:
1
a through road from Plough Hill Road to Coleshill
Road;
2
a range of house types to include both affordable and market housing for the elderly and
young
people;
3
the provision of cycle and footpath links
through the
site;
4
the provision of new and / or improvements to existing health and education facilities;
5
improvements to the
existing
sports ground and
allotments;
will be retained and enhanced
6
the setting of Brett’s Hall and the estate will be considered
and any impacts minimised;
7
a drainage strategy be prepared and implemented;
and
8
the provision of
a minimum 15m
buffer will be retained and maintained to the ancient
woodland of Brett’s
Wood.
14.
63
There are further sites around Ansley Common that have been put forward for
development. The site off Oldbury Road cannot be developed as it is a Regionally
Important G
eological Site (RIG). An additional area to the west of the northern 21.6
hectares site will be reserved for longer term housing needs. It is very important that this
site is considered with the other allocations in the area to ensure that the services and
facilities, including road access, educational and health facilities, are planned
comprehensively. This is referred to in policy

Kingsbury
14.
64
Kingsbury is located to the western half of the Borough south of Tamworth. It is
constrained by a
flood plain to the west and the Birmingham to Tamworth railway line to
the east. The Kingsbury Oil Terminal lies to the north east. HS2 Phase 2b will run from the
south
-
west to north
-
east to the north of the village. The village is surrounded by Green
Belt
. It has a small conservation area with one of English Heritage’s Buildings at Risk.
Kingsbury is now a large, semi
-
rural
village
14.
65
Kingsbury Hall is currently on the Building at Risk register prepared by Historic England.
The
Hall and adjoining land
extends to 2.8 ha site. The Hall and its surrounding grounds,
walls and structures are Grade 2* listed. They are also part of a Scheduled Monument. The
adjoining developable area amounts to approximately 2.3ha.
Water Orton
14.
66
Water Orton is constrained by the Green Belt and the River Tame.
It is under pressure for
further development due to its close proximity to Birmingham. Major road and rail transport
infrastructure surrounds the village.
In addition
,
the delta junction fo
r the High Speed
Railway (HS2) will lie to the south and west of the village.
The majority of the route in this
area will be either on embankment or viaduct and be four tracks
wide.
Education
14.
67
As a result of the development of Phase 1 of HS2 there
is a need identified to move the
current Water Orton Primary school to a new location.
This has been given as an
assurance by the Secretary of State and is an essential part of the mitigation for the
proposed railway line.
Water Orton is constrained on t
he lack of opportunities that could fit
the criteria of providing a good quality school environment, close to the existing village
away from other noise generators such as other railway lines.
The only potential site is a
site off Plank Lane.
For this ex
ceptional reason the site is removed from the Green Belt
and allocated as a site for the new
school.
14.
68
T
he site constitutes approximately 3 hectares on land north of ‘The Green’ and Plank
Lane, Water Orton.
Development of the site is subject to the programme and delivery of
HS2 and any necessary compensatory agreements, to ensure both that funding resources
and a delivery programme is in place to ensure delivery of the community/education
facility.
S1
New School
Land off Plank Lane Water Orton will be removed from the Green Belt and is allocated for a new
primary school, including playing fields.
Housing
14.
69
There is one main housing allocation in Water Orton. The site has become available due
to the relocation of the school.
This enables the release of the old site for residential
redevelopment and will help support the provision of the new sc
hool at Plank Lane.
These are exceptional circumstances.
The site comprises 2.8 ha of land, which includes
the current Water Orton Primary School, playing fields and associated facilities that lies
between Attleboro Lane and the boundary edge of the area
safeguarded for HS2 Phase 2
route into
Birmingham.101
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted

It is proposed to remove from the Green Belt the area of the site beyond the school
buildings.
The embankment of the HS2 route will form the new line of the Green Belt in
this particular area and
form a firm defensive boundary.  The proximity of the site to the
HS2 route to the south will need to be addressed by any development proposals.
H11
Former School redevelopment site (excluding original historic school building),
Water
Orton
The site
of the former Water Orton Primary School (2.8 hectares) at Attleboro and Vicarage
Lane, Water Orton is allocated for housing. The development will include;
•
a range of house types to include housing for the elderly and young
people;
•
the retention of the ori
ginal 19
th
Century School Building;
and,
•
the provision of a landscaped buffer to the southern boundary of the site, alongside the
area safeguarded for the HS2 Phase 2

Ansley
14.

1
Ansley is a large parish to the west of Nuneaton containing the two main settlements of
Ansley Village and Ansley Common.
Ansley village lies west of Nuneaton along the
B4112 Birmingham Road just under a kilometre from Church End, the old village
containi
ng the church, a specialist school, and vicarage.
The houses of the present
Ansley village extend for nearly a mile along Birmingham Road.
The location of the
settlement is rural but with a character linked to previous mining activity including housing.
The settlement is also characterised by some
small
-
scale
farmed landscape with varied
topography and landscape. The settlement includes a village store and fish & chip shop, a
post office point, 2 public houses and social club, church hall, recreational f
acilities and
bus services into Nuneaton/Hartshill but no primary school (the nearest being at Arley or
Ansley Common and Galley
Common).
14.

The levels of facilities and services within the village are considered insufficient to support
major developme
nt levels. Ansley’s role will be primarily to serve its own local needs in
terms of development, particularly in terms of affordable housing, and serve a limited rural
hinterland around. These development needs are expected to be fairly limited.
Development potential is also limited by Green Belt designation along the southern and
western boundary of the village.
An
allocation
has
been made towards the northern part
of
the
village.
H

Land at Village Farm, Birmingham Road, Ansley
Land at Village Farm, Birmingham Road comprising a 0.6 ha brownfield redevelopment site

It is normal practice that if a site has planning consent that it is not included in a Local
Plan as an allocation as the principle of development has already been accepted and to
avoid double counting.
The following site is not included in the list of ne
w allocations but
is included here due to the important local facilities that the development will deliver.
The
proposal will deliver community services, parking for the village hall and open space.
The
development boundary will be drawn around the curre

east and
Seckington on the west, Shuttington to the south and is the northernmost village in the
Borough. Many of the houses are modern, but at the west end of the village there
is a
large conservation area which has retained its character, with black and white cottages,
thatched roofs, farm buildings, a picture book duck pond and church, all combining to
form the traditional old world village image. More recent housing developme
nt has
blended in well with the older
buildings.
14.

The village has limited services including one school with a nursery. The Village Hall is a
recently constructed building which gives the community access to better facilities and
services and current

development.
H14
Site Manor Farm, Newton Regis
1 hectare of land is allocated for housing development at Manor Farm, Newton Regis. Any
development will need to consider the significance of the
designated and non
-
designated
heritage assets within and close to the site and be taken into account in the de
sign and form of
any future development.
Development of the site will need to provide for and address in particular the
following:

retention as far as practicable and achievable of the historic farmsteads, Manor Farm and
Bladon Farm

retention of all trad
itional agricultural buildings associated with the historic farmstead and
heritage asset,

address the setting of the farmsteads and their spatial relationship with the wider rural
landscape, retaining an element of views through the site to reflect the
visual and
functional relationships between the assets and their rural setting, ensuring that the
elements of the setting that make the strongest contribution to significance are conserved
and, where appropriate, enhanced. Development should be set back to
the rear of the
historic buildings and be subservient to the farmhouses.

ensure development is appropriate in terms of design, materials and scale/mass that
reflect the traditional, vernacular of the designated and non
-
designated assets within and
adjoini
ng the site and wider Conservation Area.103
North Warwickshire Local Plan
Adopted
September 2021
A detailed heritage impact assessment, statement and archaeological desk

-
regional infrastructure to support the
community
Community
Strategy
Local authorities are required by th
e Local Government Act 2000 to
prepare these, with aim of improving the social, environmental and
economic
wellbeing
of their areas.
Through the Community Strategy,

-
ordinate the actions of local public,
private, voluntary an
d community sectors.
Responsibility for
producing Community Strategies may be passed to Local Strategic

areas and
are particularly
relevant to the application of housing policies.
They do not define what
is or is not a settlement, and some smaller settlements do not have
developme
nt boundaries.
Nor do they necessarily define the extent of
a settlement, as some features such as churches, playing fields, farm
buildings and peripheral housing may be outside a
development

Documents, including generic Development Control Policies, can be
produced. They will all be shown geographically on an adopted

can be reviewed independently from other Development Plan
Documents. Each authority must set out the programme for preparing
its
Development Plan Documents in the Local Development Scheme.

develop
ment document
Sustainable
Development

gnises the needs of everyone;
effective protection of the environment; the prudent use of natural
resources; and maintenance of high and stable levels of economic
growth and employment
