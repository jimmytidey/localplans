peopleandthephysicalfabricoftheborough.In
July2019,theCouncildeclaredaClimate
Emergency andhaspledgedtoworktowards
makingtheCouncilcarbonneutralasan
12organisationby2030andcarbonzeroby2050.To
achieve this, it has set out a series of actions as
partofitsEnvironmentandSustainabilityStrategy.
2.17Wandsworth is one of the most desirable and
dynamic places to live and work in London and is
therefore experiencing growth, placing huge
demandsonitsinfrastructure,includingtransport.
In 2017 there were 124m passengers using
Wandsworth's railway stations alone. Sustainable
transportinitiativeswillbekeytoreducingcarbon
emissionsfromtransportuse,improvingairquality
and supporting a transport network with a low
carbon future.
2.18Air quality is a significant issue for the borough,
primarily due to the daily volume of traffic using
theTransportforLondonRoadNetwork(TLRN)
and from areas of high industrial activity. A
boroughwide Air Quality Management Area has
been in place since 2001 due to air quality levels
exceeding national standards. In response the
Council has produced an Air Quality Action Plan
to achieve improvements by reducing polluting
emissions through measures such as reducing the
need to travel by car, setting out criteria for
sustainable design, and promoting sustainable
demolitionandconstructionworkingpracticeson
development sites. Heathrow Airport is less than
tenmilesawayfromWandsworthanditsproposed
expansion is highly likely to affect the borough,
includingbyimpactingairqualityduetoadditional
passenger and freight journeys.
2.19Most carbon emissions come from buildings of an
inefficient design and poor energy performance.
To address this, improvements must be made to
both existing and new buildings to effectively
reduce carbon emissions.
2.20Wandsworth is one of the largest inner London
boroughs, stretching from central London at
Vauxhall to the edge of Richmond Park, with one
of the longest riparian frontages to the River
Thames. The borough includes a diverse range of
communities and many distinct neighbourhoods.
A third of the borough's land area is occupied by
residential properties, many within one of the 46
conservation areas. A quarter of the borough's
land area is open space, much of which is in the
formoflargeheathsandcommons.Thefivetown
centres (Balham, Clapham Junction, Putney,
Tooting and Wandsworth), the Nine Elms
Opportunity Area and nine local centres provide
points of focus and identity to the communities
that make up the borough. The quality of much of
the townscape together with the close proximity
to central London, the abundance of green space,
range of popular schools and good distribution of
high streets, has shaped Wandsworth into one of
the most sought after places to live in London,
placing huge pressure on housing availability.
2.21Overthelastdecadetherehasbeenafundamental
shift in policy regarding the density, design and
characterisation of new development. Nationally
therehasbeenagrowingfocusonthecentralrole
ofdesignandbeauty,whichisreflectedinthelatest
version of the NPPF and through the publication
of the National Design Guide. There is also a
greater emphasis on the production of design
codes as a tool for enabling communities to
influence the type of development that is
acceptablewithintheirownneighbourhoods,again
with an emphasis on what they see as
beautiful development. This is expressed through
the National Model Design Code. The London
Plan also promotes a design-led approach, with
greater consideration of character, design,
accessibility as well as existing and proposed
infrastructure.
Transport
2.22There are approximately 440km of roads in the
borough, the majority of which are managed by
the Council as the local highway authority. The
13Places and Townscapesremainder aremanaged byTransportforLondon

morestringentstandardsforsmallersites,ensuring
thatopportunitiestotackleclimatechangeare
24optimised.Thiswillhelptobuildresilienceinplace,
promoting inclusion and facilitating sustainable
travel.
2.60ManyareasofWandsworthareundergoingchange,
and it is important to plan these areas in a way
that optimises the effective use of land to deliver
high-qualityhomesandemploymentopportunities,
delivershigh-qualitystreetscapesandopenspaces,
supports sustainable transport, mitigates climate
change impacts and values the natural and built
environment; in other words, planning for
developmentthatcontributestothequalityoflife
for all.
2.61To this end, the Local Plan requires development
to be sustainable. In assessing whether
development proposals represent sustainable
development,theCouncilwillseektoensurethat
positive economic, social and environmental gains
are all delivered.
2.62The Council will expect development to be fully
resilient in order to minimise vulnerability of
people and property. Development will need tobe located and designed so it can adapt to, and
copewith,thepotentialimpactsandconsequences
of climate change such as heat waves and more
frequent storms. This also includes ensuring that
development is located away from areas
considered to be at high risk of flooding and
incorporating sustainable drainage systems. The
borough's green infrastructure network needs to
be maintained and enhanced so that it will
contribute to the borough’s resilience, protect
water resources and water quality and help to
ensure that biodiversity can adapt.
2.63The Spatial Strategy seeks to ensure that the
environmentalimpactsofdevelopmentdonotlead
to detrimental effects on peoples’ health, safety
and amenity. Consequently, consideration will be
giventoarangeofpotentialimpactsincluding,but
not limited to, air pollution, noise and vibration,
light pollution, odours and fumes and land
contamination. In addition, the Strategy seeks to
ensure that waste is managed in accordance with
the waste hierarchy, which is to reduce, reuse or
recycle waste, as close as possible to where it is
produced.
2.64The Local Plan provides a policy framework that
bringstogetheradeepunderstandingofthevalues,
character and sensitivity of different parts of the
borough to guide development so that adverse
impacts are mitigated and multiple benefits are
secured. In this way, the Plan will allow the
boroughtomakethebestuseofthelandavailable
and provide creative solutions for how
development schemes can enhance their
surroundings, ensure necessary infrastructure is
provided and protect existing cherished features;
resulting in sustainable development that puts the
community at its heart.
2.65Despite significant growth and change in the
borough in recent times, there is still a need to
provide more housing, employment, education,
leisure and other community and infrastructure
services to support continued growth,
regenerationandrenewal.Inaccommodatingthis,
thePlanestablishesthatthetowncentrehierarchy
will be maintained and that there is no single
dominant town centre in the borough. Each will
haveitsowncharacteristicsandplayanimportant
roleasaneconomic,socialandenvironmentalhub
for their respective areas.

The Fourteen Place-based Principles for
CreatingCohesive,ConnectedandHealthy
Communities
3.16UnderpinningthethemesofPlacemaking,Inclusive
Growth and People First are a series of fourteen
principles or characteristics that make cohesive,
well-connected and healthy communities. These
are summarised below:
People First Inclusive Growth Placemaking
Supports active travel
(walking and cycling) that
ensures ease of movement and
accessibility.Provides an active local
economy that delivers work
and opportunity.
Provides sustainable housing
(type, tenure and affordability)
to meet local need.Managestrafficand provides
goodpublic transport
connectivity.
Provides and values inclusive,
accessible and connected open
spacesfor recreation.Ensuresthatday-to-dayfacilities
are accessible ( 15-minute
neighbourhood ).
Promotes identity in the
townscapeandvalues heritage.
Ensures good and lasting urban
designandarchitecturalpractice
to create beautiful places and a
coherent built form.Improves and maximises
lifestylechoice(in transport,
housing, leisure and work).
41Responsive development,
through site allocations, that
promote contextual  
development to meet local 
social, environmental and 
economic need.People First Inclusive Growth Placemaking
Improves and maximises
physicalandmental healthand
well-being .Delivers efficient infrastructure
and built resilience (including
digital connectivity).
Engageswith naturetosupport
biodiversity and climate change

infrastructure and sustainable
drainage.

3.20The Urban Design Study (2021) divides the
borough into high-level ‘Places’ and lower level
‘Character Areas’, each with its own distinctivecharacter,evolutionandseriesofneighbourhoods.
The identification of Places has been informed by
a comprehensive process involving the analysis of
existing planning designations, built form
characteristics and historical evolution of areas.
Theprocesshasalsobeeninformedbycommunity
engagement to ensure that the classification
reflects ‘Places’ recognised by local people. These
areas are shown below.
3.21The boundaries for the Area Strategies have been
drawntoensurethattheseareasofplanningfocus
are functionally and visually integrated. However,
itisimportanttorecognisethattheareascoveredby the strategies and their surrounding areas will

60Development Considerations
The use must result in an increase in
industrial floorspace and should include
workspace for SMEs in the cultural sector.
A section of the western and northern part
of this site is required to support the
implementation of the proposal to
reconfigure the Wandsworth Gyratory
System.
4.21 Open Space - Make provision for public open
space to the north west corner.
Design Requirements
The northwest part of the site will be
required for widening of Armoury Way and
Putney Bridge Road to enable the
reconfiguration of the Wandsworth
Gyratory. Regard should be had to the site’s
location within the Wandsworth Town
Conservation Area, the site’s prominent
location and that exemplary design is to be
expected.
Residential accommodation at ground floor
level on the Armoury Way frontage would
not be acceptable. Any proposals to
accommodate residential dwellings above
ground floor level along this frontage will
need to demonstrate that residents would
enjoy a satisfactory level of amenity.
Proposals should include the provision of a
newactivetravelroutethroughthesitefrom
Armoury Way in the north to link with the
existing yard through to Wandsworth High
Street,includinganareaofpublicopenspace.
A route east to link to Carters Yard should
be provided.
Routes into the site should be welcoming
entrances of a high design quality, with
appropriate signage and lighting to bring
people into the site.
4.24 Building Heights - In accordance with the
mid-rise building maps in Appendix 2, part of the
siteislocatedinmid-risebuildingzoneMB-G1-09,
andthemaximumappropriateheightforthezoneis 5 storeys. The height of developments within
that zone should not exceed the heights of, and
shouldbeinaccordancewith,themid-risebuilding
maps in Appendix 2, which set out the identified
maximum appropriate heights in line with Policy
LP4.Developmentproposalsformid-risebuildings
will only be appropriate within the identified zone
where they address the requirements of Policy
LP4 (Tall and Mid-rise Buildings). Development
proposals for tall buildings will not be supported.

62Development Considerations
4.28 Uses - Land is required from this site for the
reconfiguration of the Wandsworth Gyratory at
the northern end of Wandsworth Plain and Ram
Street. As part of the site’s planning application
there is a commitment to ensure and support a
strongcreativesectorpresenceonsitebothduring
the development phase and as part of the legacy.
There is also a requirement to deliver an ongoing
cultural and heritage programme over the site’s
various development phases, including celebrating
the500yearsofbrewingonsitethroughanon-site
heritage centre which will be open for a minimum
oftenyears.Theseareincludedwithintheplanning
application reference: 2012/5286. The application
also includes a Ram Brewery Cultural Strategy
which sets out a requirement to nurture creative
industries on site and in the immediate vicinity, as
well as deliver a broad cultural and heritage
programme to enable a new 'heart' in the town
centre.
4.29 Open Space - New public open space should be
provided at the northern nodal point and be
enclosed by active building frontages and should
benefit from sunshine for a reasonable period of
the day.
New linkages and routes should all be
designed to be safe and high-quality public
spaces and must be defined by new active
building frontages.
Proposalswillneedtoreflectthelocationof
the site within the Wandsworth Town
Conservation Area, the existence of
designated heritage assets and the site’s
prominentlocation.Exemplarydesignwillbe
expected.
Developmentshouldimproveaccessbetween
the Town Centre and the Wandle Delta
sub-area, as well as links to Wandsworth
Town station and other public transport.
Permeability must be integrated into and
across the site (including through the
provision of a new pedestrian bridge over
the River Wandle) and join up with the
recentlydevelopedRamQuarterPhaseOne.New north-south and east-west routes
should be provided that follow desire lines,
including to the crossing point on Armoury
Way to facilitate links between the town

4.38 Landowner Assembly - This cluster has six
private owners and several long leaseholds.
Proposals should seek to bring forward
development comprehensively. Where ownership
necessitates a phased approach, a co-ordinatedapproach that future proofs the overall
placemaking and regeneration benefits should be
progressed. The Council may need to consider
theuseofitsstatutorypowersinbringingforward
comprehensive redevelopment.
4.39 Open Space - An area of open space designed
as a linear park should be provided along the
Wandle riverside (incorporating a riverside walk).
This should be designed as a place with distinctive
character and identity for the public to enjoy.
Publicly accessible ground floor uses should be
concentratedaroundthisopenspaceunlessitcan
be demonstrated that residential accommodation
can be provided with an appropriate level of
privacy and amenity for its occupiers. Residential
development should provide a 24/7 natural
surveillance in close proximity to the open space.
4.40 Access - Suitable vehicular access onto Armoury

Swandon Way and Armoury Way that aim
to civilise the street making it two-way and
more pedestrian/cycle friendly.
The layout of buildings must allow for new

route will be provided along the River
Wandle linking to the new footbridge.
Proposals should consider a pedestrian
crossing to the south east of the cluster
connecting it to Old York Road if not
providedbythechangestotheWandsworth
Gyratory system.
Any new bridges over the river should be
sensitive to biodiversity and should be of a
bespoke design that contributes to the
character of the cluster and to the riverside

4.46 Context - Proposals should respond to
constraints associated with existing utilities
restrictions, easements or Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) guidance. The cluster contains a
formergasholderandsignificantinfrastructurethat
supporteditsformeruse,includingagasmainsand
gas ‘governor’ which may make it subjected to
substantial decontamination, enabling and

The ground floor commercial uses together with
the activities within the public spaces will

masterplan that connects the site to the rest of
the Wandle Delta sub-area and to Wandsworth
Town Centre. The masterplan should include a
phasing plan for bringing development forward.
4.62 Open Space - The existing open area adjacent
to the River Wandle on Causeway Island (WT3)
shouldremainopenandundevelopedandthesite’s
potential to contribute to the biodiversity of the
river should be enhanced. Causeway Island, and

of future development should be explored.
The safeguarded wharf at the Western
Riverside Waste Transfer Station (WT11) is
important for the sustainable movement of
freight, waste and aggregates and will need
to be retained. Its continued operation
shouldnotbeprejudicedbyanydevelopment
of this cluster.
Any temporary use of the site (WT9),
including temporary buildings, will need to
be appropriate to the location and ensurethat adverse environmental/amenity impacts
on the locality, including on the residential
development on the opposite bank of the
Wandle, are minimised. There are
appropriatetemporaryusesfortheshortto
medium term including potential use of the
southern part of the site for waste
management purposes that do not
compromise the long-term development of
the site. Due to the new requirements for
waste management set out in the
EnvironmentAct2021,theCouncilwillwork
with the WRWA and consider any potential
opportunity to plan for waste management
onWT9Feather’sWharfinaccordancewith
any future expansion plan for the
WRWA. Temporary use of the site should
also include the safeguarding of, and
extensionto,theriversidewalkadjoiningthe
Thames and the River Wandle.
The Switch House site (WT10) could be
developed for a mix of uses including
residential. New buildings should provide an
active frontage to The Causeway that forms
77Development Considerations
4.89 Usesthe existing riverside walk along the eastern
boundary to the site and also an active
frontage to the north, towards the east end
of the footbridge across Bell Lane Creek. If
such development is not feasible then
consideration should be given to the
enhancement of the Switch House with a
public art project that responds to the
historicandnaturalcharacteroftheWandle.
The Smugglers Way area (WT10) contains
an electricity substation facility (the Head
House) and a number of businesses to the
east (an extension of the current site
allocation). The Head House is needed for
the foreseeable future and will make
feasibility and viability challenging. The area
could therefore be a potential longer-term
opportunity if the infrastructure becomes
surplus to requirements or a developer can
find a viable solution to relocating or
reprovision. The Head House could be
developed for a mixture of uses including
residential. There should be no residential
use on the ground floor and any new
buildings should provide an active frontage
to Smugglers Way and to the proposed
connection, east of the Head House, to the
Gasholder site (WT4). Proposals would
require further discussions with the
landowner EDF Energy and UK Power
Networks. Subject to these further
discussions, the site could come forward in
the longer term (11+ years).
4.90 Open Space - The area at the northern end of
the site (WT9) by the Wandle mouth should be
specifically designed to provide a generous open
spaceandbeaplacewithdistinctivecharacterand
identityforthepublictoenjoy.Developmentmust
include measures that contribute towards
enhancementoftheriverbanks.Thesewillinclude
improved biodiversity; restoration of historic
riverbank features and the removal of redundant
pipe/cablebridgesthatcurrentlycrosstheWandle
from these sites.
4.91 Parking - Provision of a car club should be
provided as well as improvements to public
transport.
4.92 Active Travel - Proposals will be expected to
contributetowardsthecostofprovidingimproved
security to the pedestrian and cycle link through
the Western Riverside Waste Transfer Station(WT11) to link to the riverside walk.
Improvements to pavement width and quality on
The Causeway/Smugglers Way are also needed.
Design Requirements
The proposed riverside walks and the
frontage to The Causeway must be defined
by new active building frontages. Any design
must ensure that an acceptable living
environment is created for future residents
anddoesnotinhibittheproperoperationof
the adjacent Western Riverside Waste
Transfer Station (WT11).
Proposals will need to ensure they protect
sensitive views of Feathers Wharf from
Wandsworth Park, from the wider Thames
andWandleRiverside,includingWandsworth
Bridge,theDeodarRoadfootbridgeandfrom
theoppositebankoftheThames,particularly
Hurlingham Park.
There should be provision for a riverside
walkadjoiningtheRiverThamesandWandle.
Buildings should be set back from the
riverbanks to allow for a riverside walk of at
least three metres and six metres on the
Wandle and Thames river frontages
respectively.TheWandlePathshouldinclude
unobstructed connections to the Thames
Path.
New development on WT9 should be
designed to facilitate a safe and secure
connectiontothehigh-levelbridgetakingthe
riverside walk across the refuse transfer
station site to the east of the Wandle.
New connections through the site (WT10)
andfundingforenvironmentalimprovements
to the River Wandle will be required.
Improvementstothewidthandqualityofthe
footway on The Causeway and Smugglers
Way will be sought.
Provision should be made for a new route
along the eastern boundary of the Head
Housetransformerstationthatwouldextend
thenewrouteundertherailwayviaductfrom
the Gasholder site (WT4) through to
Smugglers Way. For security reasons, it may
not be possible to extend the Wandle
riverside walk along the western boundary
of the Switch House site and the western
784.93 Built Form
4.94 Movementboundary of the Head House site. However,
if these can be overcome, it would be
desirabletosecurepublicaccessalongthese
two banks of the Wandle in the form of
riverside walks.
Improvementstopavementwidthandquality
on The Causeway/Smugglers Way will also
be required.
Althoughsitesurveysarenotavailable,these
sites are likely to have contamination and
services running through them, due to their
current use and adjacency to the recycling
facility. These sites are adjacent to the River
Thames and Wandle which could cause
engineering challenges that will need to be
resolved.
Proposalsshouldconsidertheimpactonthe
safeguarded wharf, in terms of the ongoing
operational requirements including
movement of freight, waste and aggregates.
4.96SiteLayout- AtFeathersWharf(WT9),detailed
designworkwillneedtobeundertakentoensure
thatthereisappropriatebufferingandorientation
of the residential units away from the recycling
facility (WT11). Any ground floor food and
beverage use should face west, away from the
recycling facility, with servicing arrangements to
the rear.
4.97 Massing - The cluster offers potential for taller
elements, although diversity in height should be
encouraged adjacent to the River Wandle.
BoththeWandleandThamesriverbanksand
river channels are particularly sensitive
ecologicalandwildlifehabitats.Consideration
needs to be given to design, siting and
massingofbuildings,recognisingthevalueof
the banks, and the need for
assessment/mitigation of impact.
Developments must not cause unreasonable
harm to these habitats by their proximity or
overshadowing and opportunities for
enhancement should be pursued.
A contribution towards the improvement of
riverbanks to enhance wildlife habitats and
biodiversitywhichdonothaveadetrimental
impact on navigation or river regime will be
sought.4.99 Building Heights - In accordance with the tall
building maps in Appendix 2, part of the cluster is
located in tall building zone TB-G1d-03. The
maximum appropriate height range for the zone
is 7 to 15 storeys, and the maximum appropriate
height range for the cluster should be in
accordancewiththetallbuildingmapsinAppendix
2. The height of developments within that zone
should not exceed the heights of, and should be
in accordance with, the tall building maps in
Appendix2,whichsetouttheidentifiedmaximum
appropriate heights in line with Policy LP4.
Development proposals for tall buildings or
mid-rise buildings will only be appropriate within
the identified zone where they address the
requirements of Policy LP4 (Tall and Mid-rise
Buildings).

Design Requirements
4.112 Built Form - Development on the frontages to
Swandon Way, Old York Road and both frontages
toSmugglersWayshouldbeactiveatgroundlevel
and include windows and entrance doors.
Residential accommodation at ground floor level
on the Swandon Way frontage would not be
acceptable. Residential accommodation above
ground floor level will be acceptable subject to
demonstrating that an appropriate standard of
accommodation for future occupiers is achieved
taking into account site circumstances, including
the close proximity to the Waste Transfer Station
and noise from Swandon Way and the
railway. Development should respond positivelyto the alignment of Swandon Way and provide
articulation in its form and massing to avoid an
overbearing and dominant form of development.
Proposals should define safe and attractive
new public active travel routes through the
cluster from Swandon Way to Smugglers
Way to link to the existing riverside walk via
Waterside Path; and from Swandon Way to
the junction of Smugglers Way and The
Causeway, reflecting a desire line to the
proposednorthernentrancetoWandsworth

Development Considerations
4.124 Uses - Given the close proximity to the station,
the Mercedes Benz site (WT15) and McDonalds
site (WT14) would be appropriate for
office/co-working on the lower floors with
residential. There is scope for intensification of
these sites including development above the car
park for a mix of uses including residential. The
Mercedes Benz site (WT15) in particular could
include mixed-use development including
residential, incorporating replacement economic
usesfallingwithinclassE,B8orrelatedsuigeneris
use.AttheWandsworthBusGaragesite(WT17),
proposals for mixed-use with residential
development may be considered if a suitable
alternative site for the bus garage could be
provided. Alternatively, if it can be demonstrated
thattherequirementsoftheexistingtransportuse
remain unaffected, some residential development
may be considered appropriate above the
transport use if the development can protect andenhancetheGradeIIlistedbuilding.Regardshould
behadtothedetailedguidanceforthiskeycluster
within the Wandle Delta Masterplan SPD.
4.125 Open Space - Creation of a new public square
to the north of the cluster along Pier Terrace.
4.126 Access - The entrance in the Wandsworth Bus
Garage site (WT17) to residential units could be
from Jews Row, and some element of additional
height marking the new entrance might be
achievable.
4.127 Parking - The inclusion of a car club will be
sought.
Design Requirements
Secure active frontages to Swandon Way,
the Wandsworth Bridge Roundabout, Marl
Road,BridgendRoad,JewsRow,PierTerrace
and Normans Passage at ground level to
include windows and entrance doors. On
864.128 Built FormSwandon Way, the Wandsworth Bridge
Roundabout, Marl Road and Normans
Passageresidentialaccommodationatground
floor level would not be acceptable and
residential accommodation above ground
floor level would require a convincing case
to demonstrate that any such use would
enjoy a satisfactory level of amenity.
Measures to mitigate the impact of traffic
noise would be required.
If a transport use is retained, the
WandsworthBusGaragesite(WT17)could
include some limited additional floorspace
thatcouldbeaddedabovethewesternrange
of the building (which is largely workshop
space). The proposal should be a clearly
modern, simple rectilinear form,
superimposedovertheexistingstructureand
broadly mirroring an element of the
north-southmultipleroofarrayoverthebus
garage proper. The extension must cause no
harm to the significance of the structure as
a Grade II listed building.
Provision for short- and medium-term
enhancements to lighting, wayfinding signage
andanactivetravelrouteviatheroundabout
including connections to the planned new
entrance to Wandsworth Town Station.
An active travel link through arches beneath
Bridgend Road linking into Jews Row will be
required.
There will be a need to future-proof the
potential longer-term redevelopment of

possible.Subjecttoongoingoperationofthe
current occupier, proposals to rejuvenate
the bus garage for leisure or flexible
workspace should be considered.
Achievement of a high level of amenity for
all residential accommodation in the clusterincluding measures to mitigate the impact of
traffic noise.
The importance of the safeguarded wharf at
Pier Wharf (WT22) for the sustainable
movement of freight, waste and aggregates
will require its retention and continued
operation for cargo handling uses must not
be prejudiced by any development.
4.131 Identity and Architectural Expression - It
would be beneficial to restore the architectural
integrity of the Wandsworth Bus Garage (WT17)
building,i.e.theoriginalbuildingfrontonthesouth
sidethatwasunsympatheticallyaltered.Proposals
could achieve this by reinstating this principal
elevation to match the quality of the surviving
north and east elevations.
4.132 Nature - Tree planting will be required on the
Swandon Way and Bridgend Road frontage.
4.133 Heritage Asset - WT17 includes the Grade II
listedWandsworthGarageBusDepot,whichtakes
upmostofthesiteandistoberetained.Proposals
for this site must demonstrate that development
can preserve and enhance this heritage asset and
its historic interest. The low-height, industrial
nature of the listed building should inform
proposed designs. The listed depot will be
surrounded by new development to the east, and
it will therefore be important to ensure its
significance won’t be eroded by overly developed
sites and tall buildings.
4.134 Building Heights - In accordance with the tall

Connections to the surrounding streets could be
achieved by using the existing subway tunnels

A convincing case will need to be made to
show how the design will ensure a high level
of public safety and security. A satisfactory

accommodation would be expected and the
design of the buildings should include
measures to mitigate the impact of traffic
noise. Given the prominent, pivotal location

4.153 Phasing - The site is currently being
masterplanned by the Council as majority
landowners and the southern part would come
forward for development in the short to medium
term as Phase 1. The northern part of the site
whichincludestheSalvationArmybuildingandthe
residential area of Shoreham Close would form a
second phase of development as the majority of
these properties are not owned by the Council
and would require discussions and agreements on
how this could be brought forward for
redevelopment in the longer term.
Design Requirements
Developmentshouldmaximiseopportunities
to enhance the vibrancy of the area through
the provision of active ground floor uses
withintheredevelopedpartsofthesite.This
should be supported by the provision of
public spaces including a new public square.
Building frontages to Ram Street, Shoreham
Close, Fairfield Street, Barchard Street and
newstreetsshallbeprovidedwithactiveuses
at ground floor.
Enhance the main court of the Town Hall
and its entrance from the junction of
WandsworthHighStreetandFairfieldStreet
as an important component of the public
realm offer through enabling its use for civic
and community functions.
Buildontheopportunitiesthattheproposed
Wandsworth Gyratory improvements will
bring in relation to enhancing and enlivening
the site frontages along Wandsworth High
Street and Fairfield Street and provide
enhanced greening to the streetscape.
Developmentshouldmaximiseopportunities
to provide enhanced public access and
permeability through the site, including
through east-west connections between
Fairfield Street and Ram Street (linking into
the Ram Quarter), and north-south to
provide a link to the southern side of
Wandsworth High Street to facilitate access
totheGarrattLaneOldBurialGround.This
includes the creation of a new high-quality
publicspaceattheheartofthedevelopment.This would improve the links between open
spacesoftheadjacentRamBrewery,andthe
town centre to create a green network and
a more pedestrian focused environment.
Explore opportunities to reduce the level of
vehicle movements into the site, including
through the removal of on-site car parking
provision except for that necessary to
support the proper functioning of the uses
on the site and for those with disabilities.
4.156 Context - Any proposals, including in relation to
buildingheightsandthelocationoftallerbuildings,
will need to respond to the site’s location within
the Wandsworth Town Conservation Area and
adjoining historic sites including those located
within the Ram Quarter. Any proposals should
maximisetheopportunitytocelebratetheheritage
of the site and protect and enhance the building’s
setting and significance.
4.157 Building Heights - In accordance with the
mid-rise building maps in Appendix 2, part of the
siteislocatedinmid-risebuildingzoneMB-G1-07,
andthemaximumappropriateheightforthezone
is 6 storeys. The height of developments within
that zone should not exceed the heights of, and

94Development Considerations
Enhancing Southside’s retail and leisure offer
through appropriate adaptation and/or
through its redevelopment. Flexible retail,
leisure and other town centre uses should
be supported to ensure the town centre is
capableofrespondingtothechangingnature
ofretailingandworking,andwhereitcanbe
demonstrated that a proposal will not
negatively impact the vitality and viability of
the town centre.
Improvements to the existing leisure offer
including food, beverage and entertainment
uses, supporting the evening and night-time
economy.
Improvements to the existing residential
environment should be explored.
Opportunities for additional residential
accommodation is appropriate within this
sustainable town centre location.
Improvesocialinfrastructureandcommunity
facilities to support the local community.
Development should respond positively to
the site’s proximity to King George’s Park
through improved public realm and creation
of active ground floor uses. A new public
square to the north of the site should be
provided, which will build off the
opportunities presented by the proposed
improvementstotheWandsworthGyratory
and the regeneration of the Ram Quarter.
This public space will provide a key focal
point for the town centre.
Developmentshouldrespondtotheneedto
maintain and strengthen active town centre
frontages along Garratt Lane and
Wandsworth High Street and the important
role of retail, including that currently played
by the shopping centre, to support the local
community and the wider area. Alternative
flexible town centre uses to replace surplus
retail floorspace may be acceptable where it
canbedemonstratedthatalternativeusesat
groundfloorarerequiredinordertosupport
the long-term viability of the Town Centre.
New development should ensure that a
balance is achieved between maximising theuse of the site and minimising its visual
dominance including for pedestrians using
Garratt Lane. This includes giving careful
consideration to building heights across the
site and ensuring that street frontages are
articulated to minimise its bulk, scale and
massing. New development should carefully
consider the site’s location adjacent to the
Conservation Area including the uses,
locationofentrancesandcontributiontothe
adjacent street scene.
Development should improve permeability
through the site to strengthen links and
integration with the locality including
east-west between King George’s Park and
Garratt Lane including to the Old Burial
Ground, and north-south to integrate the
site with the Ram Quarter. The Wandle is a
natural asset which should be conserved,
improvedandenjoyed.Opportunitiestouse
design solutions that articulate the location
of the culverted River Wandle through the
site and open up access, or provide a

New pedestrian routes at grade level should
be provided.
An increase in the width of the pavement
along Garratt Lane will be sought in order
to provide for an improved active travel
environment and support opportunities for
street planting. Improved links to
Wandsworth High Street, Garratt Lane,
Buckhold Road, Mapleton Crescent and
NevilleGillCloseshouldbeprovidedaspart
of any scheme.
4.163 Context - Development should maximise
opportunities to enhance the living conditions of
existing and future residents within and adjacent
to the site. This could include opportunities to
make better use of roof areas for amenity space
designed for all year-round use. Opportunities to

5.1NineElmsformsthemajoritypartoftheVauxhall
Nine Elms Battersea Opportunity Area (VNEB
OA) and sits partly within the Central Activities
Zone (CAZ) as defined in the London Plan. The
remainder of the Opportunity Area is within the
London Borough of Lambeth. Between 2012 and
2022, the Nine Elms area has undergone rapid
change and development in anticipation of the
two-stop extension to the Northern Line that
openedinSeptember2021.Alongsideanewlinear

area as a cluster for digital and creative industries
- catalysed by Apple planning to make their home
at the redeveloped Power Station. This builds on
the vision for Nine Elms established in the VNEB
Opportunity Area Planning Framework (OAPF).
This strategy will ensure that by the end of the
Plan period, Nine Elms will have continued to
develop as a sustainable, distinctive, world-class,
mixed-use neighbourhood, known for its culture,
community and creativity, contributing and
connected to wider London. It will provide local
people with access to the river and new open
space, shops, employment opportunities and
community facilities and new and improved public
transport connections and active travel routes.
During the plan period, development of the
remainingSiteAllocationsisexpectedtohavebeen
completed or commenced construction, and the
finalphaseofplannedinvestmentininfrastructure
projects which support the developments will be
delivered.
Context
5.2Nine Elms, stretching from Vauxhall to Battersea
Power Station, includes the riverfront along the
Thames,theNewCoventGardenMarketandthe
existingQueenstownRoadindustrialarea.Before
the industrial revolution, much of the area was
occupied by a hamlet and farmland known as
'Battersea Fields'. The flat, fertile soils of the
Thames floodplain were cultivated for market
gardening to provide food for the city of London,
including asparagus that was sold as 'Battersea
Bundles'.Thelevellandscape,andproximitytothe
river for the transportation of goods, later made
NineElmsasuitablelocationforrailandindustry;
and by 1945, the dwellings associated with theformer hamlet had been demolished and replaced
by large industrial buildings interspersed with
wharves along the Thames, including gas-, water-,
and colour-works, a brewery, Battersea Power
Station and rail goods depots.
5.3Today, the area is home to one of the largest
regeneration projects in the country. The VNEB
OA has been the focus for considerable new
development since the adoption of the OAPF in
2012, and this is expected to continue with an
intense construction period in the years
immediatelyfollowingtheopeningoftheNorthern
Line Extension.
5.4Thethreemajordevelopmentsthatwereenvisaged
in the previous local plan as catalysts to the
economic and cultural regeneration of the area,
namely the re-use and conversion of Battersea
Power Station; the redevelopment of the New
Covent Garden Market site including the
construction of a new market; and the relocation
oftheUSEmbassyfromGrosvenorSquaretoNine

programme which will be completed within the
plan period.

Embassy Gardens Phase 3; demonstrating the
appetite for commercial space in the area.
5.9While the introduction of global headquarters
represents a step-change in the economic
transformation of the area, Nine Elms’ industrial
past and network of smaller businesses remains
an important aspect of the area. The area will
continue to accommodate several key industrial
sites, including: Cringle Dock (supporting a solid
wastetransferstation),KirtlingWharfandMiddle
Wharf,whicharesafeguardedforwaste,aggregates
and freight related activities and the Queenstown
Road,BatterseaStrategicIndustrialLocation(SIL),
which lies to the south-west of the CAZ. This is
designatedwithintheLondonPlanasformingpart
ofthecapital’sstrategicreservoirofindustrialland,
the protection of which is particularly important
given the proximity of this area to the CAZ. It
incorporates the Stewart’s Road Industrial area
and the Parkfield Industrial Estate, and features
distribution and logistics uses; warehousing and
manufacturing; heavy industrial uses, such as
LondonConcreteandTarmac;andtransportation
facilities, including the Abellio Bus Depot and the
Stewart’s Lane Goods Depot. These latter uses
particularlybenefitfromtheintersectionofrailway
lines within the area, known as the ‘BatterseaTangle’sincethesephysicallycutoffthesitesfrom
adjacent uses, and reduce the noise and visual
impact they create.
5.10The area will accommodate the retention,
consolidation and intensification of the New
Covent Garden Market site, to support the
development of a new market and food hub, as
well as new housing and employment
opportunities.TheCouncilpromotesandsupports
theemergenceofaFoodandHorticultureQuarter
incelebrationofthearea’smarketgardenheritage,
centred around the New Covent Garden Market
as set out in the Cultural Strategy for Battersea
and Nine Elms.
5.11The borough has identified the opportunity to
capitalise on the investment that is being made
within the VNEB OA to transform parts of the
QueenstownRoad,BatterseaSILandtheBattersea
Design and Technology Quarter LSIA. This seeks
to leverage the ‘Apple effect’, and to build on the
existing creative economy within the wider area
to support the intensification of the existing
industrial capacity by attracting a cluster of
start-upsandmicro-businessesinthecreative,tech
and digital sectors; establishing an economic
synergy with the larger tenants that are locating
within the CAZ. In support of this, We Made That
were commissioned in 2019 to undertake an
economic appraisal of the area, and to provide
guidance on a physical development framework
that would support the Council’s ambitions. The
resultant study has informed this Area Strategy.
5.12Alongside the longer-term aspirations for the
BDTQ,theareathatsurroundsKirtlingStreetand
CringleStreet–boundedbyRiverlighttotheeast;
the Western Riverside Waste Authority to the
west; and Nine Elms Lane to the south – is
emerging as the next key area for development in
the VNEB OA. The plans for the Kirtling Street
area are among the least developed of the whole
VNEB OA; whilst a number of these sites have
outlineplanningpermission,noneyethavedetailed

to the continued occupation of the area by the
Thames Tideway Tunnel Kirtling Street works. As
such, there is significant scope to shape this area
through a comprehensive place-based approach
whichconsidersitasanemergentneighbourhood
wellintegratedwithadjacentdevelopmentsrather
than a collection of individual sites. A key
component in the realisation of this objective is
that the location has been identified, subject to

117Development Considerations
Development on NE14 will need to account
for and incorporate the existing Thames
Water infrastructure within any mixed use
development proposal.
The site of the existing temporary building
supply (sub-station) on the Cable and
Wirelesssite(NE1)willneedtoberelocated
inordertoimplementtheproposedchanges
to the highway layout at this junction.
Entrances to ground floor and upper floor
uses to be directly from the street frontages
of Nine Elms Lane, Kirtling Street, and
Cringle Street. Proposals should encourage
independent shops and businesses,
emphasising local makers and artisans.
Developmentproposalsshouldmaximisethe
developmentpotentialfortheKirtlingWharf
and Cringle Dock sites (NE9, NE11), having
regard to their safeguarded wharf status (in
line with LP40 – Safeguarded Wharves) and
theirimportantfunctioninthetranshipment
of freight, waterborne freight handling use
andfreight-relatedactivities.Proposalsshould
considerthefeasibilityofthecomprehensive
and combined development of both sites.
Development of these or adjacent sites will
require further discussions with relevant
parties, including the agreement of the Port
of London Authority (PLA), the Greater
LondonAuthority(GLA)andThamesWater.
The construction of the Thames Tideway
Tunnel site at Kirtling Street is estimated to
be completed in early 2025 and the Council
willcontinuetoworkwithTidewaytoensure
a positive lasting legacy.
5.31 Public Realm - Proposals to the north of the
cluster at the Kirtling Wharf site (NE9) will be
requiredtoprovideapubliclyaccessiblelandscaped
area that connects to the proposed Nine Elms
Pimlico Bridge, the Thames Path and subject to
operation and maintenance requirements, the
Thames Tideway Tunnel access shaft. It will need
toconsidertheNineElmsPimlicoBridgestructure,
its future access and maintenance requirements,
the users of the bridge, the river walk as well as
providing a welcoming gateway to the area that
takes into account views to and from the
bridge. Proposals will be required to comply withtheLondonPlanPolicySI15Watertransportand
public realm landscaping should not conflict with
the safeguarded wharf use.
5.32 Access - Any improvements to the Pump House
Lane or Cringle Street junction with Nine Elms
Lane (NE1, NE3) should maintain appropriate
highway access for commercial vehicles to the
safeguardedwharves.Thiscanbeachievedthrough
implementation of the design proposals for TfL’s
Nine Elms corridor scheme. Proposals will need
to provide land which ensures all turning
movements at the junction can be facilitated
alongside the bus, cycle and pedestrian
infrastructurealongthecorridor.Theoverarching
issue for the cluster is the total number of vehicle
trips generated by its activity. The possibility of
transferring further quantities of aggregates by
watershouldbeconsidered.Accessrequirements
for commercial vehicles should not prevent the
provisionorfacilitationofsafewalkingandcycling
routes from the river south to Nine Elms Lane.
Additionally, the Battersea Ring Main site includes
accesstotheexistingThamesWaterinfrastructure
and the Kirtling Wharf site (NE9) includes access
to a Thames Tideway shaft site and ongoing
maintenance access will be required to both. The
Thames Water infrastructure and the shaft
maintenance regime and associated necessary
access should be considered as part of any
development proposal on either site.
5.33 Parking - A car club will be sought for
residential/commercialusesthroughoutthecluster
and surrounding area.
5.34 Public Transport - Opportunities should be
taken to enhance bus journey times especially on
Battersea Park Road-Nine Elms Lane and
Queenstown Road corridors. Proposals at NE1
and NE3 will be required to provide road space
along with financial contributions to design and
constructTfL’sNineElmsCorridorproposalwhich
will deliver consistent bus infrastructure.
5.35ActiveTravel- Improvenorth-southactivetravel
links including to the Thames riverside.
Developments should ensure pedestrian and
cycling movements are safe and connected to the
cycling network as set out in the NESB Cycling
Strategy and support the potential for future
onward connection to the proposed Nine Elms
Pimlico Bridge and Thames Path. A riverside walk
incorporatingprovisionforcyclistswillberequired
atNE9andNE11unlessanalternativerouteofan
1185.30 Usesequivalent width and equal amenity value around
or through the sites is necessary for safety or
operational reasons.
5.36 Relevant Management Plans - Developments
should ensure pedestrian and cycling movements
are safe and connected to the cycling network as
set out in the NESB Cycling Strategy.
Developments should support the potential for
future onward connection to the proposed Nine
Elms Pimlico Bridge and the Thames Path.
Design Requirements
5.37 Built Form - Proposals are required to improve
frontages, streetscape, public realm and signage
alongCringleStreet,KirtlingStreet,BatterseaPark
Road, and Nine Elms Lane with entrances directly
ontothosestreetsandtowardstheRiverThames.
AtCringleDock(NE11),buildingsshouldfronton
toCringleStreetandtheRiverThamesabovethe
waste transfer station or around the dock basin if
another river-related dock use is proposed. For
NE9 and NE11, a high-quality public realm should
be provided to the riverside walk drawing upon
theprinciplesestablishedatRiversideGardensand
Bourne Valley Wharf and areas further west and
east. Proposals should draw upon the principles
set out in the Nine Elms Public Realm Design
Guide.
Proposals will need to create a transport
environment that integrates public and
private transport with active travel towards
and within Battersea Power Station. Similar
consideration should be given to creating a
safeconnectionbetweenNineElmsLaneand
CringleStreet.Thesafeguardedpavementat
Riverlight that could potentially be used to
build this connection.
This cluster of sites and other adjacent sites
are located in the vicinity of the current
indicative landing site of the proposed Nine
ElmsPimlicoBridge.Developmentproposals
will need to consider the public realm and
walkingandcyclingconnectionstothebridge,
the riverside walk and street frontages, as
well as onward connections to Nine Elms
Lane to enable the bridge to be realised.
A riverside walk should be provided, and
options include taking a high-level walkway
above a boxed-in wharf if the site is used as
a waste transfer station, or around the edgeof the dock if other uses of the dock are
proposed. The Port of London Authority
should be consulted on any proposals and
consideration should also be given to how
this integrates with the proposed Nine Elms
Pimlico Bridge and the Thames Path.
Discontinuity of the walk, as a result of
construction sites and the Cringle Dock
Waste Transfer Station, should be mitigated.
5.39 Context - Taking a place-based approach, it is
necessarytoconsidertheinter-relationshipofthe
sites within the cluster and its integration with
surroundingdevelopmentsinaccordancewiththe
Area Strategy and the vision and objectives of the
Plan, rather than on a project by project or
individual development basis.
5.40 IdentityandArchitecturalExpression- NE9
is adjacent to the Thames Path, new public open
space, and potentially the southern landing point
for the proposed Nine Elms-Pimlico Bridge. It
would be appropriate for a landmark building to
be located here as a gateway into Wandsworth
subject to the ongoing maintenance and access
requirements of the Thames Tideway Tunnel’s
infrastructure as well as the requirements of the
safeguarded wharf designation.
5.41 Site Layout - Consideration should be given to
site layout and permeability of the Cable and
Wireless and Brooks Court sites (NE1, NE5) as
they will front on to the main access to Battersea
Power Station and the pedestrian/cycle route to
the proposed Nine Elms Pimlico Bridge and
Thames Path. Proposals should aim to transform
the entrance into a more pleasant place where all
users can be accommodated in a balanced way.
Proposals will need to create a layout where the
transportenvironmentintegratesvehicle,footand
cycle movements as well as public transport with
Battersea Power Station.
5.42 Building Heights- In accordance with the tall
buildingmapsinAppendix2,theclusterislocated
in tall building zone TB-B3-01. The maximum
appropriate height range for the zone is 8 to 25

5.47 Parking - A car club should be provided for
residential/commercial use and surrounding area.
5.48 Public Transport - Opportunities should be
taken to enhance bus journey times especially on
Battersea Park Road-Nine Elms Lane and
Queenstown Road corridors. Proposals will be
requiredtoprovideroadspacealongwithfinancial
contributions to design and construct TfL’s Nine
Elms Corridor proposal which will deliver
consistent bus infrastructure. Developers will be
expected to bring forward improvements such as
the upgrading of the signalised junction of the
CGMA/BPR/PumpHouseLanejunctionortofund
improvements if these are to be delivered as part
of the Nine Elms Corridor Scheme.
5.49ActiveTravel- Improvenorth-southactivetravel
links including to the Thames riverside. Proposals
should make improvements to Sleaford Street,
including ensuring a usable footway width on the
eastern side, as it is currently of a sub-standard
width. To the south, the site should ensure the
continuation of the east-west cycle route along
the viaduct, and the potential cycling and walking
bridge across the CGMA access road, including
land access.
TheNewCoventGardenMarketaccessroad
to the east of the site (NE12) is primarily
used for overnight market operations so
development proposals should consider this
and how it will be maintained, including
mitigation of impacts on residential uses and
the enhancement of the urban realm in that
area.
Ensure that any development does not have
a detrimental impact on the security and
operation of the existing MPS facility (site
allocation NE4) so long as it remains in use
as an MPS facility.
5.51 Address Social, Economic and
Environmental Disparities - The Cultural
Strategy for the site should give specific
consideration to how it contributes to the Food
and Horticultural Quarter, linking with the
proximitytotheNewCoventGardenMarketsite
(NE12).Design Requirements
5.52 BuiltForm- Improvefrontages,publicrealmand

126Design Requirements
For the Havelock Terrace site (NE6),
proposals should provide active frontage to
Havelock Terrace and positive frontage to
working yards and amenity spaces. Building
frontages should be provided on to
Bradmead, Palmerston Way and Havelock
Terrace. Working yards should be located
by the railway lines to create amenity spaces
at the centre of large plots.
For the Ingate Place site (NE7), proposals
should position frontages of workshops,
studiosandlightindustrialspacestosupport
and activate a shared amenity space.
A high-quality public realm is required in
accordancewiththeNineElmsPublicRealm
Design Guide.
5.77 Movement - A permeable network of streets
needs to be formulated using perimeter block
principles. The Havelock Terrace site (NE6) lies
oppositetheBatterseaPowerStationunderground
stationandaccessibilitytothissiteandconnections
across Battersea Park Road should be enhanced.
Future development will need to improve
accessibilityandconnectionstoQueenstownRoad
Station. The Council will support the creation of
a pedestrian and cycling tunnel between Havelock
Terrace (NE6) and Ingate Place (NE7), subject to
feasibility.
5.78 Identity and Architectural Expression - The
buildings closest to Battersea Park Road will need
to be distinctive in architectural expression to act
as a marker or gateway to the BDTQ and should
incorporate a hub space to invite permeability.
Proposalswillneedtodeliverwelldesignedmarker

railway, and reuse of the railway arches
immediately adjacent to the site for commercial
uses.
Development Considerations
5.127 OpenSpace- ThedevelopmentoftheApexSite
willberequiredtobewellintegratedwiththeMain
Market site and Garden Heart Building through
the creation of a high-quality public realm and
network of public spaces which could
accommodate outdoor market areas.
5.128 Access - Vehicle access to the Apex Site shall be
fromtheexistingroadsbeneaththeviaducttothe
northeast, which serves the Market. Pedestrian
and cycle access from the north shall be provided
through a separate arch.
5.129 Active Travel - Development will be required
to promote active travel through the provision of
high-qualitypedestrianandcyclerouteslinkingthe
Nine Elms station on Wandsworth Road with the
wider Nine Elms area to the north of the railway
viaduct. A wayfinding strategy will be required,
connectingandpromotingactiveuseofnewpublic
spaces and connections with Nine Elms Park and
the wider area through integrating facilities and
events.
5.130 Public Transport - The site is strategically
located adjacent to the Nine Elms station and
should provide high-quality pedestrian and cycle
connections between the station and the wider
NineElmsareatothenorthoftherailwayviaduct.
5.131 Relationship to the Main Market site - The
designoftheApexSiteshouldseektoextendthe
food centric experience from the Garden Heart
building on the Main Market site with provision
for food related uses on the lower levels of the
development and into the spaces below the rail
viaduct over time. The Cultural Strategy for the
site should give specific consideration to how it
contributestotheFoodandHorticulturalQuarter.
Design Requirements
5.132 Built Form - The massing, scale and location of
proposed buildings should minimise negative
daylight / sunlight effects on the existing buildings
along the south-eastern boundary. As the ‘linking’
sitefromtheNLEstationandexistingcommunitiesthroughtoNineElmsPark,activefrontagesshould
beprovidedalongtheplazasandthearchestothe
northandthemaineast-westroute.Thebuiltform
should reflect the heights of existing residential
buildings to the south and should be used to
establish the gateway to the site. The tallest
buildings should be located on the northern part
ofthesiteandadjacenttotherailwayviaduct,with
a stepping down to existing residential properties
to the south.
5.133 Public Realm - The landscape and public realm
should have a distinct character which reflects its
functionsandlocationadjacenttotheMainMarket
and Garden Heart building. With the aspiration
forthistobethenewfooddestinationforLondon,
a sequence of high-quality public spaces should be
provided including a central square framing the
Garden Heart building.
5.134 Movement - The development should provide
strongeast-westpedestrianandcycleconnections
withthewiderNineElmsareatothenorthofthe
railway, as well as to Battersea and Vauxhall
beyond.
5.135 Context - The built form should integrate with
the emerging context and the existing residential
buildings to the south.
5.136 Identity and Architectural Expression - A
consistent architectural language is required to
unify and strengthen the urban character of the
area. This should respond to the industrial and
railway heritage of the site.
5.137 Site Layout - The site layout should enhance
visual links and connectivity to the Garden Heart
building and the main east-west pedestrian/cycle
route.

138Introduction
6.1TheAreaStrategysetsoutaholisticapproachthat
will steer development activity in the area to
strengthenClaphamJunction’sroleasamaintown
centre. This will create an enhanced urban heart
with an improved station and public transport
interchange, new housing and jobs alongside the
necessarysocialandotherinfrastructuretosustain
growth whilst maintaining the area’s distinctive
character. It seeks to enhance the existing sense
ofplaceandcelebratethekeycharacteristicswhich
contribute to this – notably the existing Victorian
and Edwardian shop terraces and residential
streets;landmarkheritagebuildings;culturalvenues
such as Battersea Arts Centre and the small scale
and independent retail and food and drink offer
on Northcote Road; St John’s Hill; Lavender Hill
and Battersea Rise – through high-quality
development that is respectful of character and
scale and well-integrated with the existing
townscape.
Context
6.2Clapham Junction Town Centre is framed by the
twoprincipalcrossroadsofSt.John’sHill/St.Johns
Road and Northcote Road/Battersea Rise. The
Town Centre rapidly developed after the opening
of the railways in the mid-19thcentury, growing
into an important commercial and cultural
destination. Today, it has a bustling streetscape
and is used by residents, shoppers, commuters,
and workers. There is a good selection of
comparisonandconvenienceshopping,withseveral
high-quality ‘national multiple’ retailers, and four
large food stores complemented with a number
of ‘top up’ alternatives.
6.3The town centre has established a reputation for
a lively evening and entertainment offer, including
pubs, clubs and restaurants and a diverse food
scene, much of which is clustered on Northcote
Road, Battersea Rise; and along Lavender Hill and
StJohn’sHill.TheLondonPlanclassifiesnight-time
activity in Clapham Junction as ‘NT2’, indicating
thatithasaregional/sub-regionalsignificance.The
area also hosts a number of cultural organisations
and large venues, notably the Battersea Arts
Centre and the Clapham Grand. Due to its
excellent transport links, Clapham Junction
presents the opportunity to extend its existing
cultural and creative offer as a desirable location
for leading cultural organisations.
town centre
6.4Given the retail and leisure focus of Clapham
Junction,thereiscurrentlylimitedofficeprovision
withinthecentre,exceptforPCSHouseandsome
smallerofficesonLavenderHill. However,inview
of the high levels of public transport connectivity
and the potential for enhanced public transport
services, Clapham Junction provides an excellent
location for office development and there is the
opportunity for additional office provision as part
ofmixed-usedevelopments.Thisisdemonstrated
by the Arding & Hobbs building – formerly
Debenhams – which has planning permission for
offices and ground floor retail uses. This will add
to the vitality of the centre.
6.5ClaphamJunctionStationisoneofEurope'sbusiest
rail interchanges but prior to the COVID-19
pandemic it was operating at close to capacity in
termsofrailservicesandpassengernumbers,and
suffered from over-crowding at peak
times. Reconfiguration of rail infrastructure and
the station is essential to increase capacity, meet
safetyrequirementsandimprovepassengers’public
transport experience. Parts of the station and
adjoining lands are safeguarded for the
implementation of Crossrail 2 and associated
surface works and in the future. Crossrail 2 has
thepotentialtobeakeydriverofchangeandopen
up new development opportunities. The Council
recognises this as unique opportunity to deliver

Character
6.10Thetight-knit urbanformofClaphamJunction
createsahigh-quality anddistinctivetownscape
withbuildingfrontagesgivingenclosuretostreets,
andthefrequencyofintersections facilitates
wayfindingaroundthetowncentre.Thecharacter
oftheareaisderivedfromitssurvivingVictorian
andEdwardiantownscape,asexemplified bythe
modestlyscaledterracedshopsalongStJohn's
Road,StJohn'sHill,LavenderHillandNorthcote
Road,whichremainthecentre’sfocusforretail.
Thereareseverallandmark andlistedbuildings
141that contribute to the townscape, including; the
Arding & Hobbs building, the octagonal cupola of
which marks the focal point of the centre and is a
locally valued heritage asset providing a strong
senseofplaceandidentity;BatterseaArtsCentre,
and Battersea Central Library. Other valued
heritage assets, such as the Clapham Grand, the
former Granada Cinema and the Falcon public
house, all located within the Clapham Junction
Conservation Area, contribute to the distinctive
character of the area. As a result of this tight knit
urban character, there are relatively few street
trees and limited green space within the centre,
although Clapham Common and Wandsworth
Common both serve the area and are some 300
metres away. Although limited, there are some
small public open spaces which help to soften the
urban character of the streets and provide
opportunitiesforseatingandamenity.Theclosure
of Northcote Road to through traffic as part of
the COVID-19 response has demonstrated the
importance of public space and a good quality
pedestrianenvironmenttothevitalityofthecentre
and the potential for extending this in the future.
6.11Northcote Road is a distinctive and high-quality
shopping street with an established built form
comprised of three/four storey, mainly Victorian,
buildings, which together with the ground floor
retail and café/restaurant uses produce a
townscapeofhigh-quality,architecturalandhistoric
interest. Whilst there has been a change in the
nature of occupiers on Northcote Road, it has
largely maintained its physical character with
well-maintained and attractive frontages. The
ground floor predominantly consists of smaller
units, many of which continue to be occupied by
independentbusinesses,oftenofaspecialistnaturewith a growing presence of hospitality/food retail,
which add to the varied offer and vitality of the
centre. The weekend pedestrianisation of
Northcote Road which was introduced as part of
the COVID-19 recovery has been particularly
successfulandthereissignificantsupportforthese
measures to be extended.
6.12Whilst it was the key driver for the growth of
Clapham Junction, the railway presents a major
physical barrier which confines the centre largely
to the area south of the station; fragmenting the
area and reducing permeability and legibility and
north-south connections. This is exacerbated by
the lack of active frontages on Falcon Road and
poor-quality appearance and layout of the
development around Falcon Lane, which
adversely affect the setting of the centre and
Conservation Area. Many of the upper floors of
buildings in the central area would benefit from
increased maintenance, and have shop frontages
that are less in keeping with the surrounding
context. These factors influence the generally
strong sense of place in the area, highlighting the
importance of a strategy which will conserve and
enhance the character of the area, including the
historic shop terraces, residential streets and
landmark buildings.

151Development Considerations
6.23 Uses - The northern section of site, adjacent to
railway, may be required for track/platform
straighteningworks.Considerationshouldbegiven
to the relationship of new development to
adjoiningresidentialpropertiesinMossburyRoad.
6.24 Landowner Assembly - It is desirable that the
multiple landowners take a holistic approach to
development, which allows each site to come
forward independently as part of the phased
redevelopment of the site or as a single
development. The site forms part of the Urban
Heart Masterplan which will be prepared in
collaboration with stakeholders including the
landowners, Network Rail, TfL and the local
community
6.25OpenSpace- Thereisanopportunitytoprovide
a small urban square adjoining the Lavender Hill
frontage. This could create a vibrant public space
with al fresco restaurants and cafes, as this area
has the most access to the sun, facing south. The
spaceshouldbelandscapedtoincludehigh-quality
green features.
6.26 Access- Entrancestobuildings(groundfloorand
upper floor uses) should be directly from the
streets to create active frontages.
6.27 Parking - Car club provision for
residential/commercial use and the surrounding
area will be required as part of a strategy to
promote active transport modes.
6.28 Public Transport - A contribution to public
transport infrastructure and services should be
considered, including bus service
enhancements, access improvements to Clapham

Design Requirements
6.29 Movement - The section of Falcon Road under
the railway bridge should be enhanced to become
more pedestrian and cyclist friendly. As the
southern entrance connects to the north-west
corner of the site, it should provide space for the
pedestrian route to continue. This could beachieved through a combination of measures
including pavement widening, improved lighting
and art installations.
6.30 Site Layout - Active ground floor frontages with
retailprovisionshouldbeprovidedtoFalconLane
and consideration should be given to re-align
Falcon Lane to facilitate a retail frontage to the
southside. Future proposals must ensure that the
amenities of the occupiers of adjacent Mossbury
Road properties are not unacceptably affected.

153Development Considerations
Proposals should re-provide at least the
existing quantity of office and retail
floorspace, incorporating the provision of
affordableworkspacethatistargetedatSMEs
and start-up businesses.
Development of this site must not prejudice
the longer-term opportunity for developing
the main Clapham Junction Station site and
other surrounding land which could be
unlocked by Crossrail 2. The phasing of
development will be addressed in the Urban
Heart Masterplan. It is acknowledged that
given the anticipated timescale for the
developmentofCrossrail2,theopportunity
for a comprehensive over-station
development may take some time to come
forward under the Opportunity Area
designation. The potential for this site to
deliver new jobs and homes as part of an
earlier phased development will be
considered as part of the
masterplanning exercise.
The northern section of site, adjacent to
railway, may be required for track/platform
straightening works.
Consideration should be given to provision
within the site allocation for cultural use in
order to help develop the area as a creative
quarter.
6.35 Open Space - A new public space that acts as a
meetingspaceshouldbeconsideredaspartofany
development proposal and to provide a setting to
the main entrance to the station. This could
incorporate active retail frontage at ground floor
to complement the retail offer of the town
centre. Anotheropenspaceshouldbeconsidered
at the Brighton Yard Entrance to improve access
to the station.
6.36 Access - Redevelopment of the site should
consider the creation of a new access to the
Brighton Yard Entrance to the west of the site.
6.37 Public Transport - Enhanced pedestrian areas
should be provided around the new station
entranceandontheStJohn’sHillandFalconRoad
frontages. Adequate off-street servicing
arrangements will be required for all elements of
thedevelopment.WorkingwithNetworkRailand
TfL,theCouncilwishestosecuresuitablestoppingfacilities for buses and taxis, bus standing facilities
and adequate cycle parking close to the station
entrance.
6.38 Relationship to other Allocated Sites - The
sitehasacloseinterrelationshipwithsiteallocation
CJ4 (Land at Clapham Junction Station). There is
a strong case for considering both sites as part of
a comprehensive approach to redevelopment of
the station and adjoining land including in the
longer term the potential for over-station
development. The Urban Heart Masterplan will
consider the interrelationship of these sites and
how to integrate the existing railway
marshalling yards and their facilities with new
development.
6.39 StakeholderEngagement- Itwillbenecessary

preparation of proposals including improvements
to the station entrance and facilities. The Urban

Design Requirements
6.40 Built Form - The station is a major public
transport interchange and critical to the role of
Clapham Junction as a Major Centre and to
unlocking growth. The station and its facilities
should be improved to provide first class facilities
for passengers and should be designed to be
inclusiveandtoprovideahigh-qualitycivicbuilding
and public spaces.
6.41 Movement - The section of Falcon Road under
theRailwayBridgeshouldbeimprovedtobecome
more pedestrian friendly and create a safer more
inclusive environment. As the southern entrance
connects to the site, it should provide space for
the pedestrian route to continue.
6.42 Context - Future proposals must be integrated

Context
7.2Putney is a historic, riverside settlement that
developed due to its important role as a river
crossing:initiallybyferryinthe1300sandwiththe
first permanent bridge completed in 1729. The
erection of a new stone bridge in 1886 (and its
subsequent widening in 1933 to create a
high-capacity crossing) supported increased
volumes of traffic, enabling Putney to develop as
one of the borough's five town centres, providing
servicesinparticularformanycommunitiesinthe
west of the borough.7.3The centre is concentrated on two axes: the
shopping frontages along Upper Richmond Road,
running east to west; and on the historic core
along Putney High Street, which runs south to
north, leading on to the Victorian-era Putney
Bridge. The latter forms the core of the area’s
shoppingprovision,includingthePutneyExchange
indoorshoppingcentre,andiswherethemajority
of the centre’s large units (over 200 sqm) and
multiple retailers are located. The centre is
generally well provided with a range of service
facilities, restaurants, bars, and cafes; a mix of
national multiples and independent retailers; and
threemid-sizesupermarkets,withagoodprovision
of small food and grocery retailers suitable for
main and top-up food shopping. The quality and
rangeofshopshastraditionallybeenwellregarded,
however retail in Putney has been adversely
affected by both the growth of online shopping
andthelossofofficepremises,andlocalresidents
andhigh-streetusershaveidentifiedthattherehas
been a reduction in the number of independent
shopsinthecentre.Thisisreflectedinthecentre’s
shop vacancy rate – of 13% (Retail Needs
Assessment(RNA,2020)–whichisthehighestin
the borough, and which has increased significantly
in the last few years, from 4-7% in 2004.

riverside bars, restaurants on the Putney
Embankment and in the area upstream of Putney
Bridge. The attractive setting of the centre on the
banks of the Thames could be better capitalised
on through improved linkages to Putney High
Street, creating a more integrated experience
betweentheusesalongtheHighStreet,whichare
predominantly focused on daytime activities, and
those on the riverside, which cater more to
evening uses. This will help to create a diverse
offeringwithinthecentreandwillfurtherenhance
Putney’s existing and vibrant night-time economy,
which is classified in the London Plan as NT3 –
having a ‘more than local’ significance.
7.5Putney functions as a local office centre, which
commands high average rents and generally has a
good standard of facility, the majority of which is
locatedontheUpperRichmondRoad.Theextent
of provision, however, has been significantly
diminished in recent years, driven by high relative
residential values, the centre experienced an
approximately 20% loss in office floorspace
between 2016 and 2018, predominantly through
the demolition and redevelopment of 1960s and
1970spurpose-builtpremiseswhichoncecatered
to large single employers. Although much of the
redevelopment has been for new residential uses,
therehasalsobeenalimitedamountofnewofficeprovision, such as at Tileman House, which
provides space for the small to medium sized
occupiers. There are opportunities for the
enhancement of the centre’s office provision, as
partofmixed-usedevelopment.AlongPutneyHigh
Street, there are a limited number of commercial
premises providing small office space above retail
premises, which are generally of lower quality
stock. Associated with the ongoing structural
changes to the centre’s retail provision, there are
opportunities for enhancements to the
smaller-scale business provision, including
co-working and flexible ‘touchdown’ workspaces,
in smaller units within the town centre’s more
peripheral locations, or in units above the ground
floor over the existing retail provision.
7.6The area benefits from excellent public transport
accessibility: it is served by Putney Rail Station,
locatedintheheartofthecentre;thenearbyEast
Putney Underground Station; as well as several
bus routes, which offer access to a wide range of
destinations across London, indicating good
potential for car-free living. Putney also benefits
from its riverboat service providing access to the
City and beyond. Recent environmental
improvementstoPutneyHighStreet,includingthe
wideningofpavements,installationofparkletsand
provision of ‘Copenhagen Crossings’, brought
substantialimprovementstothepublicrealmwhich
contributed to encouraging active travel.
7.7Despite the improvements, Putney continues to

centre is constrained by significant through-traffic

8.1The London Plan identifies parts of Tooting as a
StrategicAreaforRegeneration.Althoughthearea
has witnessed a substantial reduction in the level
ofdeprivationoverthelastdecade,areflectionto
some extent of a shifting demographic towards
young professionals, limited pockets still remain.
This strategy sets out a holistic approach that will
steer regeneration activity and direct locally
sensitive action to improve the quality of life for
local people, ensuring that new development is
sensitive to – and enhances – the existing positive
elements of the neighbourhood, both built
environmentandsenseofcommunity.Thiswillbe
achievedbydeliveringimprovementstothepublic
realm,encouragingsustainablemodesoftransport
and contributing to the health and well-being of
the people of Tooting. The area covered by the
strategylieswithintheTootingBecandBroadway
Neighbourhood Area, which was designated as
such in April 2017 under the Government’s
Neighbourhood Planning initiative. The Tooting
Bec and Broadway Neighbourhood Forum are
currently in the process of drafting their
NeighbourhoodPlanandtheinitialoutputsofthis
process have been considered and incorporated
into the Area Strategy. This strategy and the
proposed Neighbourhood Plan will inform and
complement each other.
Context
8.2Tootingisalinearcentreradiatingalongtwomain
roads from Tooting Broadway Station: to the
north, Tooting High Street / Upper Tooting Road
(with commercial uses ultimately merging with
Tooting Bec) and Mitcham Road, which runs
south-east. The area has pre-Saxon origins and
was a focus for trade with its position on Stane
Street, a Roman road. Tooting witnessed a
substantialinvestmentanddevelopmentinthelate
1920s and 1930s following the extension of the
NorthernLinein1926,bringinganinfluxofpeople
and galvanising cultural life. Today, Tooting is an
attractiveplacetolivewithagenerallyprosperous
community,althoughpartsoftheareaexhibitsigns
of deprivation, particularly in terms of quality of
livingenvironment,crimeandbarrierstoservices.
Nevertheless, the unique identity of the area and
vibrant economy provide strong foundations to
address these challenges.
8.3Tooting Town Centre has a good range of shops,
local services and community facilities, including a
number of religious buildings. At its heart, two
indoormarketsoriginatingfromthe1930s,Tooting
Market and the larger Broadway Market, provide
anarrayoffoodstallsandindependentshops,both
relative newcomers and longer-serving traders,
and which collectively account for around a third
of all the shops, bars/restaurants and services
facilities within the centre. They epitomise the
vibrancy and cultural diversity that the area has
become renowned for, and form a popular draw
throughout the week and on weekends. The
markets provide a high degree of flexibility,
includingopportunitiesforpop-upandtemporary
usesalongsideestablishedtradersanddaytimeand
evening uses; and sustaining an effective balance
betweenthesewillbekeyinsupportingeconomic
recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tooting is particularly notable for its nightlife and
vibrant food scene, which extends beyond the
market to include the area’s much loved and
long-standing curry houses and South Asian
restaurants, which are clustered to the southern
end of Tooting High Street and on Upper Tooting
Road. Mitcham Road, to the south-east, features
a cluster of pubs and entertainment venues,
includingtheformerGranadaTheatre(nowaBuzz
Bingo), which provides a link to Tooting’s past
entertainmentofferofmusicconcertsanddancing
shows. Over the years the area has increasingly
188Picture 8. 1Tooting Market (locally listed) - vibrant colours and a
diverse range of food culturesattracted tourism and the London Plan classifies
the centre as NT3, meaning that its evening
economy has a ‘more than local’ significance.
8.4Thecentreaccommodatesagoodrangeofnational
multiples and, smaller-scale independent shops,
including specialist provision, which contribute
positively to the identity of the area. To the
northern end of the High Street, approaching
Tooting Bec Station, there is some evidence of
mixed management and maintenance of shop
frontages, including some blank facades and the
degradation of historic features on upper storeys,
which is detrimental to the overall shopping
experience. There is an opportunity to address
thisthroughthesmall-scaleintensificationofupper
floors to provide residential or office units, the
latter of which forms the mainstay of the centre’s
dedicated economic floorspace.
8.5The Retail Needs Assessment 2020, undertaken
beforetheCOVID-19pandemic,hasidentifiedthat
therearelimitedrequirementsforadditionalretail
and food/beverage by 2030, with a very limited
amount of demand for additional convenience
shoppingwhichiscapableofbeingabsorbedwithin
existingvacantunits.By2035,thereisacumulative
identifieddemandforretailandfoodandbeverage
floorspace (of c. 1,300 sqm), though this could be
accommodated within the centre’s vacant
floorspace. As such, it is not necessary to identify
new sites for retail/town centre development,
rather that the short to medium-term strategy
should be the protection and improvement of the
existing provision to ensure that the facilities are
suitable to meet modern retailing requirements.8.6Tootinghasexcellentpublictransportaccessibility,
with Northern Line stations at Tooting Bec and
Tooting Broadway, as well as a national rail line at
nearby Tooting train station (located just outside
of Wandsworth in the Borough of Merton). The
area, however, suffers from heavy traffic, which
combined with narrow pavements, creates a busy
and noisy environment. The ‘ladder’ formation of
Upper Tooting Road, with frequent intersections,
further prioritises cars over pedestrians, creating
an interrupted walking experience. Although
TootingislocatedontheCS7CycleSuperhighway,
offering local people a direct route into the City,
certain sections of the bicycle link are of
poor-qualityandrequireanupgrade,andissuesof
cars parking on this amenity are also prevalent.
Localresidentsandvisitorsarealsofacedwiththe
absence of public open space, a lack of well
positionedorattractivebenchesandrestingplaces,
and a tendency for street clutter, all of which
further diminishes the quality of the townscape.
Tooting is also designated as an Air Quality Focus
Area due to the high levels of pollutants on the
main roads.

203Introduction
9.1The Area Strategy for Roehampton and Alton
Estate Regeneration Area identifies opportunities
to create an improved sense of place for the area,
including celebrating the existing heritage assets
in the area and improving connections to
Roehampton High Street. It builds upon the
Roehampton SPD adopted in October 2015, and
subsequent proposals for the regeneration of the
Alton Estate which provide the opportunity to
increase local housing supply and deliver benefits
to the wider community through the provision of
new and improved community facilities, an
improved local retail offer, affordable workspace
for local businesses and enhanced open space and
play facilities. The Area Strategy will assist in
reconnecting the currently fragmented areas of
Roehampton Village and the Alton East and West
Estates, whilst providing improved facilities and
multi-functional spaces for local residents, and
facilitating the development of new retail and
employment uses to address recognised
deficiencies. These initiatives will contribute to
tackling deprivation, creating a better sense of
place, delivering more and better quality housing
andimprovedemploymentopportunities,reducing
carbondioxideemissions,andprovidingenhanced
opportunities for active travel for local
communities.

Context
9.2Roehampton is an area of considerable contrasts.
Itishometolarge-scalebuildingsofscenic,cultural
and historic value, many of which are of national
significance and much valued by local residents; of
Georgian family villas, and private sports clubs, all
of which are surrounded by spacious stretches of
Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), including
Richmond Park. Yet it is also an area of
socio-economic challenges, housing some of the
most deprived areas in the borough, with high
levels of economic inactivity and unemployment,
and pockets of higher than average crime levels
and ill health.
9.3Roehampton is designated as a ‘Local Centre’ in
the Local Plan, with the area’s shops and
communityfacilitiesfocusedaroundthetwinaxes
ofDaneburyAvenueandRoehamptonHighStreet.
The relationship between the two, however, is
disjointed due to severance by Roehampton
Lane. The area as a whole lacks a clear focus and
a coherent centre. Danebury Avenue is noted in
theUrbanDesignStudy(2021)aslackingvibrancy
and interest, a result of a lack of leisure,
community and entertainment facilities or
restaurants, and it also suffers from a poor public
realm and the maintenance and condition of the
buildings. The redevelopment of the area through
the estate regeneration scheme should seek to
addressthisbyattractinginvestmentintothearea
to create a vibrant new heart for Roehampton,
including the provision of improved commercial,

206Character
9.7Roehampton’s landscape is a palimpsest made up
of different layers of historic developments, with
GeorgianandVictorianmansionsnestlingalongside
post-war housing estates, and buildings from
different eras on the university campus.
Historically, the area was occupied by Georgian
countryestatesreflectingRoehampton'spopularity
asadestinationforaristocraticsummerresidences
close to Richmond Park. Several of the country
estates in their landscaped parkland settings still
survive(notablyMountClareandParksteadHouse,
(both Grade I) and Downshire House, Grade II*),
althoughmanyhavebeenaltered,extendedorpart
demolished. The Victorian era saw development
of villas in subdivided estate plots.
9.8The character of the area changed significantly in
themidtolate1950swiththeintroductionofthe
AltonEstate,saidtobeoneofthefinestexamples
in London of the post-war idealism of designing
residential buildings within a cherished landscape
setting. The Alton Estate is one of the largest
council estates in the UK. The design vision for
the Alton Estate was for elegant and harmonious
clusters of residential accommodation to form
distinctive landmark elements on the skyline in
views from Richmond Park, and set withingenerous parkland, with the aim to give residents
the impression of 'living in the park'. Mature trees
and undulating landform create a distinctive
landscape.However,manyofthelandscapedareas
areinneedofsympatheticenhancements,including
tothestreetlighting,toimprovepedestriansafety
and to make them more appealing.
9.9Most of the Alton Estate was designated a
conservation area in 1998 so that the landscape,
setting and other positive buildings in the area
could also be conserved and enhanced. The
Landscapes to Alton East and Alton West were
added to the Register of Parks and Gardens of
Special Historic Interest in England by Historic
England on 11 June 2020.
9.10Although the atmospheric landscaping, historic
layout and architectural quality of the buildings is
valued by local communities, the Alton Estate is
cut off from its surroundings by the A3 and
Roehampton Lane, as well as continuous fences
along Richmond Park and an adjacent golf course.
These features contribute to poor legibility and
connectivity. The area has also suffered from
additions and demolitions over the years,
obstructing views, and infilling of vacant sites with
poor quality developments. The incremental
change has eroded the overall vision and sense of
place and compromised the openness, harmony

221Introduction
10.1Balham benefits from a high-quality, human scale
townscape and is served by excellent
transportation links. The pedestrianised Hildreth
Street and surrounding streets constitute a local
destination for eating, drinking and shopping, and
isnotedforitsgoodrangeofindependentretailers.
Although Balham is already a good place to live,
the strategy shows that Balham has potential for
targeted growth that benefits the local
communitiesandenhancesthesenseofplace.New
developmentwillbringimprovementstothepublic
realm, create well-designed gateways to the town
centreandencourageactivetravel,therebyhelping
to reduce noise pollution and traffic congestion
associated with Balham High Road, and support
the health and well-being of communities.
Context
10.2Balhamdevelopedasasmalltowncentrefollowing
the opening of the railway in 1856. The station
stimulated development of the fields lying behind
the early ribbon development along Balham Hill
and Balham High Road, creating new residential
estates. This development and the commercial
growth of the centre was further accentuated by
subsequent transportation infrastructure
improvements:theintroductionofatramin1903,
andthentheextensionoftheUndergroundtothe
area in 1926.
10.3Today, Balham is an established and accessible
urban centre that forms a local destination for
eating, drinking and shopping, and which has
vibrancy and activity. The Town Centre is focused
on four roads: Balham Station Road, Balham HighRoad,BedfordHillandthepedestrianisedHildreth
Street, which create a triangular shopping circuit
with a Sainsbury’s store at its heart.
10.4The centre previously extended further up along
theHighRoad,joiningwithClaphamSouthstation,
with various commercial and leisure uses on this
strip including a cinema, hotel and theatre.
However bomb damage and subsequent
redevelopmentforresidentialusehaschangedthe
characterofthispartoftheHighRoad.Thecentre
benefitsfromthis,asithascreatedacompactretail
core that stretches for a little over 300 metres
along the High Road (between the junctions of
Balham Station Road and Balham Grove) and
accommodatesthemajorityofcentre’slargerretail
units(over200sqm)andmultipleretailoperators.
In turn, these serve as an anchor which supports
the area’s good provision of independent shops,
which help give the town a sense of local
distinctiveness. Balham also benefits greatly from
the pedestrianised Hildreth Street, which hosts a
popular street market and has an emerging al
fresco café culture.
10.5The centre is generally well served with regards
to convenience shopping – there are two
supermarkets, as well as a baker, butcher, off
licencesandahealthstore.Thereisgoodprovision
ofcomparisonshoppingandservices,althoughthe
centre includes a large number of estate agents
and charity shops. The borough’s Town Centre
Health Check, referenced in the Retail Needs
Assessment 2020, reflecting pre-COVID rates,
identified that Balham has a shop vacancy rate of
12% in 2018 - comparable with the then UK
223Picture 10. 1Temporary pedestrianisation of Bedford Hillaverage, but above that for the Greater London
Authority(GLA)area(8.6%).In2020–underearly
conditions of lockdown in response to the
pandemic–longer-termvacancywasestimatedto
have risen to 14%. Looking forward, the Retail
Needs Assessment 2020 projects that there is a
small oversupply of retail and food/beverage
floorspace by 2030, but that by 2035 the growth
of the centre will result in capacity for a small
amountofadditionalconvenienceandcomparison
shopping. Such future growth could be absorbed
by the existing vacant floorspace, and as such the
strategic priority should be the reoccupation of
these premises over new provision. The centre is
well provided for with community facilities, and
includes two places of worship, a library, social
clubs, two doctor’s surgeries and two dentists.
10.6Office floorspace in Balham is generally limited to
units above ground floor retail premises. The
Sainsbury’s site and car park within the ‘Balham
triangle’ could present an opportunity for
redevelopmentandintensificationoflandforamix
of uses in the town centre, particularly were a
Crossrail 2 station to be realised here. The
environs of Balham station are being considered
asapotentialstationonthefutureCrossrail2link,
though Tooting is the current preferred route. In
addition to relieving congestion on the Northern
Line, this would provide Balham with a rapid and
direct connection to major London stations such
as Clapham Junction, Victoria, Tottenham Court
Road and Euston.
10.7The presence of rail and underground stations,
combinedwithbusroutes,enableexcellentaccess
to public transport in Balham. The stations act as
a transport interchange for the local community
and visitors. Although Balham benefits from
excellent public transport accessibility, the area is
dominated by car parks, with parking for both
supermarkets occupying prominent locations at
the heart of the town centre. These features
negatively affect the streetscene and attract a lot
of private vehicle travel on the main road, which
in turn has a negative effect on bus speeds. In
addition, Balham High Road is busy and generally
difficult to cross, detracting from the perceptual
quality of the place. Even though the area benefits
from the access to Cycle Superhighway, there are
issues with the quality of the cycle lane, and there
is also insufficient provision of local cycle lanes,
which would provide an easy access to nearby
amenities for the local community.Character
10.8Balham is characterised by 3-4 storey Victorian
and Edwardian terraces with ground floor shops
andofficesorresidentialabove.Manyoftheseare
sited on narrow plots with red or yellow brick
façades and gabled frontages to the streets.
Generally, frontages are positive, and contribute
to the street scene, with a sense of diversity,
varietyandcolour.Thereisasenseofindividuality
tobuildings(e.g.shopfrontsalongHildrethStreet),
yet these create a coherent overall unity.
Occasional use of ceramic tiles, such as the area
of public realm near the southern end of Hildreth
Street, lend a sense of texture and richness.
Overall,thebuildingscreateadistinctrecognisable
proportion to the overall street scene.
10.9The sense of place is greatly enhanced by positive
landmarks on corner plots, including the Bedford
and Devonshire pubs. Historic interest is also
provided by the locally listed Du Cane Court, a
distinctive8storey1930sresidentialblockfinished
with red brick, and churches: St Mary's Church
(Grade II listed) and Polish Church of Christ the
King. There are also notable examples of early
19th century villas, nos. 207 and 211 Balham High
Road, both of which would benefit from an
enhancement to their condition and setting.
10.10Althoughmanylandmarksremaininplace,Balham
sufferedsubstantialdamageduringtheWorldWar
II, with the loss of Royal Duchess Palace theatre,
and extensive losses to the Victorian terraces
around the High Road, Caistor Road and the area
around the station. As a result, there is a high
incidence of post-war infill development, some of

Development Considerations
10.15 Open Space - The existing pocket open space
to the north of the site on Bedford Hill should be
enhanced as part of the pedestrian route through
toBalhamStationRoadalongthewestofthesite.
Adequate servicing arrangements to retail
units must be maintained. Servicing of the
supermarket shall be from Balham Station

bays to footways where space permits.
Access to the car park and servicing shall be
from Balham Station Road. It is suggested
thataccesstoSainsbury’ssupermarketshould
be at basement level perpendicular to the
proposed pedestrian route as well as at
ground floor.
10.17 Parking - Car club provision should be provided
on site. Proposals should provide cycle parking
provision to the south west corner of the site to
support commuters using Balham Station as a
transport interchange.
Design Requirements
10.18Movement- Anorth/southpedestrianrouteshall
be provided between Bedford Hill and Balham
Station Road to improve permeability in moving
aroundthetowncentre.Proposalsshouldinclude
a permeable site layout to ensure the open space
is accessible and the frontage does not dominate
the townscape.
10.19 Context - The design should reflect Balham’s
character which derives from a tight knit urban
grain based on 6m plot front frontages.
10.20 Identity & Architectural Expression - A
contemporarydesignisrequiredpickinguponthe
architectural vocabulary and cues inherent in the
built fabric of Balham. The three corners of the
perimeter block should be distinctive particularly
opposite the Grade II listed Bedford Hotel as the
development will announce the gateway to the
town centre. A legible form to the block should
bearticulatedattheapexes.Highqualitymaterials
should be used for the footways around the
development and for the pocket public space.
10.21SiteLayout- Atriangular-shapedperimeterblock
with retail/commercial uses on the ground floor
with active frontages to all three sides, and with a
basement and first floor car park as part of the
podium is suggested. The interior of the block
above the podium would be suitable for private
amenityspacetoservetheresidentialunits.Street
frontages are required on all sides of the site,
including to the elevated railway line to the south
of the site with active retail and commercial uses
on the ground floor. Whilst some
retail/commercial use could be accommodated at
first floor level, upper floors could accommodate
residentialunits.Pedestrianlinksalongthewesternedge from north to south should be improved.
Frontages to the east should replicate the retail
and commercial uses opposite it on Bedford Hill.
10.22Massing- Tallerelementsshouldbelocatedclose

232Introduction
11.1Wandsworth’s Riverside continues to play an
importantroleindefiningthedistinctivecharacter
of the borough by offering places to gather, rest,
play, work, and enjoy the views of the Thames.
Despite the riverside’s unique setting and
importancetotheborough,improvementstothis
area can still be made. The Area Strategy sets out
theoverallvisionforhowWandsworth’sRiverside
can realise those improvements over the next
10-15 years to become a high-quality destination
with better connected, new and enhanced public
space benefitting the borough and its Thames
setting, and supporting future growth. The Area
Strategy makes the case for a joined-up approach
to future activities on and around the Thames to
make the most of the heritage and cultural
resources that already exist, to stimulate further
enhancementstotheriverside’sparticularqualities,
and to better connect it to the borough’s existing
and emerging town centres. The area intersects
withseveraloftheAreaStrategiesdiscussedabove,
mostly notably Putney, Wandsworth Town,
Clapham Junction and York Road / Winstanley
RegenerationArea,andNineElms.Thevisionand
policies set out within those strategies work in
tandem with the Area Strategy for Wandsworth’s
Riverside, but are not repeated here.
Context
11.2The borough has five miles of Thames riverside
stretching from Putney in the west downstream
to Nine Elms in the east. Originally developed for
industry,wharvesandwarehousing,thereleaseof
land on the riverside through de-industrialisation
in the second half of the twentieth century has
enabledconsiderableredevelopmenttotakeplace
in the last twenty years, providing new homes
alongside economic and commercial floorspace.
11.3TheCouncilhassoughttoleverageandencourage
thisinvestment,designatingparticularstretchesof
the riverside as Focal Points of Activity. These are
now well established at Putney Wharf,
Wandsworth Riverside Quarter/Point Pleasant,
and Ransome’s Dock. As the Area Strategies of
the Plan are gradually implemented through
development activity, the existing Focal Points of
Activity will benefit greatly from increased footfall
and activity, enhancing their purpose to provide
mixed-use vibrant areas which complement the
borough’scentresandmaingrowthareas.Intheselocations, redevelopment of the former industrial
areas has already helped in attracting people to
theriverside,creatingasenseofvibrancythrough
a mix of leisure facilities, including restaurants,
cafes, bars and small-scale retail uses; by creating
new and high-quality public spaces; and providing
new economic floorspace targeted at SMEs.
Collectively, this investment has seen parts of the
riverside benefit from an improved public realm,
which is better designed to make use of the
amenities offered by the riverside.
11.4Despite this success, there remain sections with
unrealised placemaking potential, and the Area
Strategysetsoutpoliciesandallocationstosupport
their continued structured regeneration, making
them destinations that are accessible to a wider
range of local residents and visitors by supporting
their local economy. The area with the greatest
opportunity for change lies to the north of
WandsworthTown,intheWandleDeltasub-area,
which is being cohesively planned through the
Wandsworth Town Area Strategy. There also
remainsastretch,focusedonLombardRoad/York
Road, where regeneration is an ongoing process
– with some sites recently completed, underway
or planned for, and others yet to be redeveloped.
The concentration of riverside Site Allocations
within this location reflects this opportunity, and
the area will continue to transform through
residential-led mixed-use development, including
withthescopeforsometallbuildings.Asinother

createneweconomic opportunitieswhichmeet
theborough’sidentified need.
23511.7The River Thames itself also continues to provide
an important economic function through its five
workingwharves:Smuggler'sWayWharfandPier
Wharf in Wandsworth and Cringle Dock, Kirtling
WharfandMiddleWharfatNineElms,allofwhich
are safeguarded within the Local Plan for the
transhipment of waterborne freight, including
waste and aggregates. The movement of goods by
water rather than road can help relieve traffic
congestion and air and noise pollution, and is
consistent with the principle of sustainable
development. These wharves are located in the
main areas for change identified at the Wandle
Delta sub-area and Nine Elms, and it is important
tominimisetheconflictbetweennewdevelopment
and the wharves to protect their important
function to both the borough and London.
11.8One of the largest sewer infrastructure projects
in Europe, the Thames Tideway Tunnel, is
currentlybeingbuiltwithitsmainshaftsitelocated
in the riverside area of Kirtling Street, Nine Elms.
Dueforcompletionin2025thesewerwillreplace
London’s150-year-oldsewernetworkandprevent
tensofmillionsoftonnesofsewagefrompolluting
the River Thames every year. The project, which
has six large construction sites mainly located in
the riverside area, will provide positive lastinglegacy delivering environmental improvements,
jobs, skills and economic investment. Alongside
operationandmaintenancerequirements,thesites
will be transformed into new public open spaces,
including new promontories in the Thames at
Putney embankment and Nine Elms (Heathwall
Pumping Station), and opening up new areas of
riversidewalkinNineElms(whilstmaintainingsafe
access and operation of infrastructure). The
Council will continue to work with Tideway to
ensure its legacy is sustainable, ensuring that the
relationship between the sites and their
surroundings is developed in partnership with
residents and community groups.
11.9Leisure activity is a valuable element that adds to
the character and the appeal of the riverside.
Rowing and boating activity on the river is part of
Wandsworth’s heritage. There is scope to
promote and enhance river related recreational
activitiesalongtheriver,butparticularlyatPutney
Embankment, where there is a concentration of
boat servicing and repair facilities, moorings,
boathouses, slipways, steps, stairs and landing
places used in connection with river sports and
general recreational use of the river. The Port of
LondonAuthorityhavedesignatedtheareaaround
Putney as a ‘sport opportunity zone’ within their

furtherwest,WandsworthParkmarksadistinct
237changetothemoreurbananddenserenvironment
of Wandsworth Town. The riverside north of
Wandsworth Town is characterised by a mixture
oftallresidentialbuildingsandremainingindustrial
sites. The area benefits from the openness of the
River Thames, local boat traffic, and the interest
of the piers and moorings. Similarly to Putney
Embankment, there are issues of lack of clear,
legible routes connecting the town centre to the
River Thames and Wandle River. There are also
issues of inappropriate landscape treatments,
including areas that feel overly private. These
matters are discussed in more detail in the Area
Strategy for Wandsworth Town.
11.15Further to the east is Battersea Riverside. It is
generally characterised by a coarse urban grain
with limited tree cover and large-scale buildings,
as well as trading estates and car dealerships on
Lombard/York Road. There are few leisure or
entertainment destinations, and much of the area
feels 'private'. This, together with the lack of
functionalpublicrealmandopenspace,contributes
totherelativeabsenceofactivityorvibrancyalong
much part of this riverside. Exceptions include
Vicarage Gardens and the area around St Mary's
churchyard open space, which forms part of
Battersea Square Conservation Area. The square
has a strong sense of place and a coherent,
distinctive historic character. In addition, it
provides valuable space for gathering, eating and
drinking,creatingapleasantenvironment.Thearea
also benefits from the presence of wharves which
are valued for visual interest, colour and richness,
particularly where they retain historic elements
such as at Ransome's Dock, downstream of
Battersea Bridge.
11.16Further to the east is Albert Bridge, which marks
the transition to Battersea Park, a Grade II*
Registered Historic Park and Garden of
outstanding landscape interest and quality. Its
historic landscape is based on the formal and
informal compositions within the park, its
tree-lined carriageway drives, embankment
promenade,lakesidesettings,theviewswithinand
from the park and its relationship to the River
Thames. These combine to provide a high scenic
quality and a feeling of serenity and tranquillity,
withthepromenadealongtheThamespopularfor

12.1The Wandle Valley is a valuable asset for
Wandsworth, which provides both an important
environmental and ecological resource, as well as
accommodating much of the borough’s strategic
industrial land, which caters for a wide range of
economic activity – from storage and distribution
to rehearsal spaces. There are opportunities for
targeted intervention that can realise greater
environmental benefits, while retaining and
supporting the area’s economic role, building
enduringsocialcapitalandresilienceforitsgrowing
communities.ThisAreaStrategysetsouthowthis
can be achieved. The strategy is focused on the
stretch of the Wandle Valley located between the
boundary with London Borough of Merton and
the northern end of King George's Park. The
opportunities associated with the remaining part
of the Wandle Valley, located to the north of the
borough, are addressed in the Area Strategy for
Wandsworth Town.
Context
12.2The Wandle Valley corridor, which runs from
Croydon to the confluence with the Thames in
WandsworthTown,ischaracterisedbyestablished
industrial areas and open spaces. The River
Wandle, once described as “Europe’s hardest
working river”, has a remarkable industrial and
cultural heritage. From the 17th century, the area
was a focus of industry and manufacturing, with
mills and factories developing along the river to
takeadvantageofthepoweritprovided.Industries
included production and processing of iron,
gunpowder, leather, linen and copper. From the
19th century, settlement developed around the
edges, with terraced streets of worker's dwellings
around Bendon Valley, as well as a public house
and school.
12.3This industrial heritage is present within the
contemporarylandscape:theareaincludesalarge
proportion of the borough’s protected industrial
areas,whichformastrategicreservoirofindustrial
capacity, accommodating a dense ecosystem of
industrial businesses that make a major
contribution to the economy of the borough and
theprovisionofjobsinthelocalarea.Themajority
of these sites are designated as Locally Significant
Industrial Areas (LSIAs), including those at Old
Sergeant; Kimber Road; Lydden Road; and
Thornsett Road. As part of the London Plan, the
Summerstown/Garratt Business Park area, which
borders with and extends into the North
WimbledonIndustrialareaintheLondonBorough
of Merton, is designated as a ‘Strategic Industrial
Location’, a Greater London Authority (GLA)
designation which recognises the importance of
the area to the effective functioning of London’s
wider economy. This Plan supports that
designation which formalises the protection and
will help to strengthen investor confidence.
12.4All of these industrial locations benefit from good
access to the Transport for London Road
Network,viaGarrattLane,andencompassabroad
range of uses including warehousing, self-storage
facilities, light industrial uses, as well as creative
andculturalindustries–suchasrecordingstudios
and rehearsal space – with some ancillary office
provision. Across the sites, the majority of the
building stock is of a good quality, and rents are
266Picture 12. 1Mature trees in King George's Park help to soften tall
buildings in Wandsworth Town Centre into the landscapegenerally low: the Earlsfield ward, in which the
majority of the industrial estates in the Wandle
Valley is located, has an average rent of £207 per
sqm of industrial floorspace (in 2020). That
notwithstanding,therearealsoexamplesofpoorer
quality buildings, particularly in the Lydden Road
LSIA, which could be redeveloped to provide
facilities which are more fit for purpose, including
workshops and warehousing space, with limited
ancillary office units. This floorspace should be
targeted at small and medium sized enterprises
(SMEs),forwhichtheLSIAsandSILalreadyprovide
an important source of land and floorspace. The
ease of access to the TLRN makes many of these
sites particularly suitable for storage and
distribution uses, which is the industrial use with
the greatest amount of forecast demand over the
Local Plan period.
12.5TheLyddenRoadLSIAformerlyextendedfurther
south,encompassingalargerareaoflandthatwas
predominantly occupied by a leisure centre with
a large car park, as well as a self-storage unit. As
part of the Local Plan (Employment and Industry
Document) this land – alongside the Riverside
Business Centre – was re-designated as an
Economic Use Intensification Area (EUIAs). This
designationseekstointensifytheeconomicuseof
this underutilised land, encouraging investment in
modernindustrialpremisesalongsidetheprovision
of residential uses and business floorspace. This
site, close to Wandsworth Town Centre, has the
potential to contribute to the wider strategicregenerationambitionsandreconnectingwiththe
Wandle, a process which has begun with the
redevelopmentoftheRamBreweryfurthernorth.
12.6Whilst past industrialisation and urbanisation had
little regard to the natural and ecological value of
the River, the value of the Wandle Valley as a
strategic ecological resource for the borough and
London is now recognised. The protection and
restoration of its natural qualities, alongside the
enrichment of its diverse visitor offer, will play an
important role in making a vital and vibrant piece
of green infrastructure. An important future
challenge for the Wandle Valley is to create a
better relationship between industrial areas and
thegreenspacenetworkwhichitborders;working
with landowners to allow greater safe access
between or through industrial sites, improving
permeability for pedestrians, cyclists and adjacent
communities. To achieve this, there is a need to
improve the connectivity along the River Wandle,
which currently suffers from the severance effect
of Wandsworth Gyratory, thereby restricting
north-south movement on foot and by bicycle. It
is also important to complete the missing link of
WandleTrail,apedestrianandcyclingroutewhich
follows the course of the river, bar for an
interruptedareainEarlsfield.Atpresent,travelling
north from Plough Lane, the Trail follows the
alignment of the river until Summerley Street. At
this point access to the river is restricted by
development. Pedestrians and cyclists are forced
to continue to Garratt Lane, before linking into
267Picture 12. 2Tennis courts, King George's Park
Penwith Road and following residential roads to
King George's Park. Providing effective and
sustainable transport links along the Valley is
integral to its success.
Character
12.7Thecharacteroftheareaisdefinedbythecourse
oftheRiverWandleanditsvalley,comprisingopen
space and industrial uses. The former includes
Garratt and King George's Parks, both of which
form part of the wider Wandle Valley Regional
Park. The abundant open space creates a sense of
openness, providing relief from surrounding
development.
12.8King George's Park, designed by Stephen Percival
Cane and opened in 1923 by King George V, is a
large public park with municipal character. The
lake, water fountain, tennis courts and formal
design to the north of the park are all remnants
of the original 1920s vision. Today, the park is
valuedbylocalcommunitiesforitsrecreationand
leisure interests, and as a space for formal and
informalsports.Apartfromtenniscourts,facilities
include a skatepark and playing fields to the south
of Kimber Road. The park is also valued for its
flexible and accessible paths and spaces, which
provide an important, albeit underutilised, active
travel route to the town centre.
12.9TheRiverWandledoesnothaveastrongpresence
in the park. This is largely due to the municipal
characteroftheparkincludingornamentalplanting,
and a lack of indication of the watercourse by
typical riverside trees such as willow, alder or
poplar. The Wandle Trail runs alongside the river,
but diverts away from it around the southern end
of King George's Park, where it follows roads
withintheresidentialareasaroundSouthfieldsand
Earlsfield. The trail sheds light on the biodiversity
valueofWandleValley,partofwhichisdesignated
as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation
(SINC). The grassland, woodland, standing water
priority habitats, and the ecological value of the
River Wandle are particularly treasured, which is
reflected in a Grade I designation of SINC
importance.

ontheperipheryofthegreenspacesisprominent
and, especially where trees are lacking at the
perimeters, becomes the dominant feature. It
consists primarily of large-scale industrial units,
education and retail units, transitioning to
residential towers in Wandsworth Town Centre.
These are noticeable, but mature trees help to
integrate them into the landscape. Few historic
featuresoftheformermillsremain(e.g.FlockMill),
whichhavebeenconvertedtoresidentialoroffice
uses.
12.11Theareahasanumberofdetractorswhichdonot
positivelycontributetothecharacteroftheplace.
In particular, this applies to the over-dominant
presence of industrial units or parking back onto
the river (e.g. Bendon Valley and Lydden Road,
Penwith Road area), which provide limited space
ontheriverbanksforwildlife,andnopublicaccess.
The hard, grey character of the industrial areas -
ofgeneric,blankfaçadesandsecurityfeaturessuch
as fencing – have little or negative visual interest
and detract from the scenic qualities of the park.
TheedgesofopenspacesinWandleValley,aswell
as areas along the River Wandle, often lack active
frontage. For instance, the urbanised part of the
Wandle Valley near Wandsworth Town has high
hard edges and is faced by backs of buildings,
whereastheopenspaceswestoftheHenryPrince
Estateareseparatedfromtheriverwithhighwalls

B.InclusiveGrowth
2691. Development within the Wandle Valley will help meet the borough’s housing target, as set out in Local
Plan Policy SDS1. The area has capacity to provide 619 homes by 2032/2033, over the first 10 years
of the Plan period.
2. Designated industrial land within the Wandle Valley will continue to provide a strategic reservoir of
land for economic uses, including logistics, services and industry, and land for waste management, and
will be protected in this capacity. The intensification of industrial uses within such locations, through
the more efficient use of space, the modernisation of poorer quality stock, and the development of
multi-storey schemes, is supported.
3. The redevelopment of sites within the Bendon Valley EUIA should capitalise on underutilised land to
provide intensified economic uses, including modern industrial floorspace, alongside the provision of
high-quality homes, and enhance public access to and the relationship with the Wandle River.
4. To utilise the open space network and minimise flood risk, development proposals should seek to
reduce water run-off by promoting the installation of green roofs and sustainable urban drainage.
C. People First
1. Measures to improve pedestrian and cycling accessibility within the river corridor, to Wandsworth
Town and the Wandle Delta sub-area/ Wandsworth’s Riverside will be supported. Proposals should
aim to improve physical connections and remove barriers to access to the open spaces along, across
and into the Wandle Valley. Access routes through and around industrial estates and housing
developments will be created and encouraged to celebrate the heritage of the area using arts and
culture.
2. Proposals should enhance the Wandle Trail, and in particular, should complete the missing link in
EarlsfieldtoremovetheneedforpedestriansandcycliststodivertthroughEarlsfieldcentreviaGarratt
Lane.
4. Proposals for improved landscaping and planting in the existing parks and along the River Wandle will
besupported.Newgreeninfrastructureshouldaimtomaketherivermoreprominentinthelandscape
and enhance the riparian character of the Wandle Valley by planting species such as poplar, willow, flag
iris and marsh marigold.
5. Whereappropriate,theCouncilwillseekcontributionsfromnewdevelopmentstowardstheprovision
or upgrading of riverside infrastructure through planning obligations.
6. Development/renewal proposals should accord with the King George's Park Management and
Maintenance Plan. The Council will work in partnership with the Wandle Valley Regional Park Trust,
as well as other stakeholders, including landowners, community organisations, charities and statutory
bodies–toimprovethecoherence,resilienceandqualityoftheWandleValley,andimproveitsidentity,
quality and heritage value.
2703. The special character of the River Wandle as a valuable re source for wildlife and biodiversity, including
wildlife corridors and green chains, must be preserved and enhanced.SiteAllocations

295G. The Council will seek to restrict proposals for mid-rise buildings outside the identified tall and mid-rise
building zones.
H. Proposals for mid-rise buildings should not exceed the appropriate height identified within the relevant
mid-rise building zones as identified at Appendix 2 of this Plan.
14.27Tall buildings can make a positive contribution to
the character and legibility of an area as well as
optimising the use of land which makes a positive
contributiontothesupplyofnewhomes,including
affordable homes, and the local economy.
However,heightisnottheonlyoneconsideration
when assessing the acceptability of a planning
applicationandwhetheritisofahigh-qualitydesign
which makes a positive contribution within its
context.
14.28Part A of this Policy sets out the Council’s
definitionofatallbuildingbasedonlocalevidence
which reflects the predominantly low-rise and
sensitive character of large parts of the borough.
The use of a single definition of a tall building
provides an approach which is simple and easy to
understand for both local communities and
applicants,andwhichprovidescertaintyastohow
the Council will implement the policy. The
definitionsetoutinPartAisingeneralconformity
with Policy D9 of the London Plan. The London
Plan tall building definition excludes the height of
the uppermost storey. Therefore, for the sake of
clarity the Council has defined a tall building as
being either seven storeys or over or 21 metres
or more from the ground level (as defined in the
Glossary to this Plan) to the top of the building.
Thetopofthebuildingdoesnotincludestructures
and plant typically found at roof level, including
railings, parapets, plant equipment, maintenance
cranes or elevator shafts. The provision of such
structures and plant will be assessed within the
context of relevant criteria within this Policy.
Buildings will be considered tall where they meet
the definitions set out in Part A of Policy LP4 and
Part A of Policy D9 of the London Plan. Where
theheightofabuildingmeasuredfromtheground
level to the floor level of the uppermost storey
does not trigger the London Plan definition, but
the height of the uppermost storey exceeds the
averagestoreyheightoftheremainingstoreysand
the total height of the building exceeds the
definition set out in Part A of policy LP4, the
building will be considered “tall” in line with Part
A of the policy.Figure 14.1 Tall and Mid-rise Buildings illustration
14.29It is recognised that some developments will have
differing floor heights, particularly at the ground
floor.ThedefinitionsetoutinPartAofthisPolicy
applies to whichever is the lower between the
number of the storeys and the metres above
ground level. Where applications involve the
additionofstoreysonabuildingthatwouldalready
be classed as 'tall' or the additional storeys would
cause the building to be considered 'tall' in
accordance with Policy LP4, any relevant planning
application will be assessed against the criteria of
this Policy.
14.30Tall buildings will only be an acceptable form of
development in tall building zones as identified by
the tall building maps included at Appendix 2 to
this Plan. The designation of an area as a tall
buildingzonedoesnotmeantheareahascapacity
to host tall buildings within the appropriate range
across the entire zone. Development proposals
will need to relate appropriately to the specific
contextofthesite,existingbuildingsinthelocality
and any other tall building proposals in the area,
including schemes with an extant planning
permission.Thisdesignationalsodoesnotpreclude
other forms of development. In areas identified as
tall building zones high density mid-rise or
mansion-block style development may also be
acceptable.Outsidetallbuildingzones,thereisno
presumption in favour of tall buildings.

LP14 Air Quality, Pollution and Managing Impacts of Development
A. The Council will seek to ensure that the local environmental impacts of all development proposals do not
lead to detrimental effects on the health, safety and amenity of existing and new users or occupiers of the
developmentsite,orthesurroundingland.Theseimpactsinclude,butarenotlimitedto,airpollution,noise
and vibration, light pollution, odours and fumes, solar glare and solar dazzle, and land contamination.
B. Planning applicants should have regard to any guidance provided by the Council on local environmental
impacts and pollution as well as on noise generating and noise sensitive development. Where necessary, the
Council will apply planning conditions to ensure that local environmental impacts on adjacent land uses are
maintained to acceptable levels.
Air Quality
C. The Council will support developments which incorporate ‘air quality positive’ design and the use of new
technologies. Development proposals must be at least ‘Air Quality Neutral’, and should not contribute to
worsening of air quality during the construction or operation stage, in accordance with Policy SI 1 of the
London Plan.
D. In order to assess the appropriateness of introducing new developments in areas already subject to poor
air quality, the following will be required:
1. An air quality impact assessment, supported by modelled data, where necessary.
2. Mitigation measures which are demonstrated to be effective in reducing the development's impact on
air quality, including the type of equipment to be installed, the provision of thermal insulation and
ducting abatement technology.
330checking compliance falls to the issuer of the
permit (the regulator). New facilities likely to
produce significant air quality, dust or noise
impacts are required to be fully enclosed in line
with London Plan Policy SI 8. However, it is
important that existing waste sites are able to
continue to operate without unreasonable
restrictionsbeingplacedonthembynewsensitive

provision. Where appropriate, conditions may be
imposed to protect specific uses.
Economic Use Protection Areas (EUPAs)
18.48Established industrial and office premises provide
a substantial amount of floorspace for local
businesses and are crucial in supporting the
borough’s economy, and that of London as a
whole.Outsideoftheprimarylocationsforoffices
and industry activities – Town Centres and the
strategic reservoir of industrial land, respectively
– economic uses are grouped into clusters. Such
clusteringcanbringsubstantialbenefits.Giventhe
identified need for economic premises over the
Local Plan period, it is essential that the Council
protectandretaintheseeconomicclusterswithin
any forthcoming redevelopment proposal, and to
intensify them where possible, through their
designation as EUPAs.
18.49Sites that are designated as EUPAs are as follows:
Smugglers Way, Jews Row and Battersea
Reach
BatterseaBusinessCentre,99-109Lavender

Economic Use Intensification Areas (EUIAs)
18.50The EUIA designation was introduced in the
Employment and Industry Document (2018) to
manage the planned release of under-utilised
industrial land that was previously designated
within the borough’s strategic reservoir. The
designation intends to promote investment in
modern industrial premises provide business
floorspace for SMEs to support the borough’s
economy, and deliver residential uses to meet the
borough’s housing needs. The designation
therefore requires that proposals provide
intensified industrial uses and increased business
floorspace and/or open workspace for SME
businesses. Residential uses will be appropriate
where they assist in developing more intensive
economicuses,andarecompatiblewiththoseuses
and the spatial objectives set out in the relevant
Area Strategy and/or Site Allocation.
38318.51Sites that are designated as EUIAs are as follows:
Bendon ValleyRiverside Business Centre and former
Bingo Hall
Wandsworth Delta
Panorama Antennas
Causeway Island, including land to the
east
Keltbray Site, Wentworth House and
adjacent land at Dormay Street
Ferrier Street
Frogmore Depot
Gasholder Site
Chelsea Cars and Kwikfit
Focal Points of Activity
18.52Focal Points of Activity are areas along the River
Thames in Wandsworth within which
residential-led mixed-use development is
encouraged (as set out in more detail in the
Wandsworth’s Riverside Area Strategy). There
are a range of different uses located within the
borough’sdesignatedFocalPointsofActivity,with
some areas being employment hubs and others
being primarily of residential character. Given theidentifieddemandforeconomicuses,wherethese
are located in Focal Points of Activity,
redevelopment proposals should seek to
re-provideasmuchexistingfloorspaceasisfeasible
as part of mixed-use schemes, ensuring that
successful employment clusters are retained and
this provision meets the contemporary
employment needs of businesses and residents. In
particular, co-working and/or open workspace is
encouragedintheselocations,providingadditional
flexibility for how local people work. Co-working
spaces should be open to passing members of the
public, and it is strongly encouraged that
memberships are provided to groups nominated
by the Council’s Economic Development Office.
To ensure that proposals for new economic
floorspacedonotnegativelyimpacttheborough’s
centres, proposals which result in a net increase
in office floorspace will be subject to a sequential
test, as outlined in Policy LP33. There are also
potential opportunities for redevelopment of
poor-qualityspaceandbuildingswithintheseareas
to accommodate intensified industrial uses, which
are likely to be focused on small industrial units
and maker-space facilities given their existing and
potential for proximity with residential uses.
LP36 Railway Arches
A. In order to maximise the contribution that railway arches, viaducts, and adjacent land, can make to the
provision of industrial and other economic floorspace within the borough, existing uses will be protected
and new uses supported in appropriate locations as follows:
1. TheuseofrailwayarcheswithintownandlocalcentresandtheCAZfortowncentreuses,community
uses,andstorageanddistributionuses(B8)willbesupported.Certainsuigenerisand/orindustrial(B2
uses), such as microbreweries, will be supported in these locations, subject to it being demonstrated
that they would not cause harm to the amenity of users of adjoining sites or the proper operation of
neighbouring uses;
2.Withinareasidentifiedasprovidingfortheborough’sstrategicreservoirofindustrialland,onlyindustrial
uses will be supported in accordance with Policy LP34. The use of planning conditions may be applied
to permissions in order to protect the long-term industrial function of such sites;
3. Within the Wandle Delta sub-area, railway arches should be prioritised for economic uses; however
other commercial uses will be acceptable where the policy requirements for the replacement or
intensificationofeconomicfloorspacecanbebetteraccommodatedelsewhereonthesite,theapproach

be required to support or complement the wholesale retail function of the market. The use of railway

391A.Theborough’sfivewharveswillbesafeguardedforthetranshipmentoffreight,includingwasteandaggregates,
and for freight-related activities. The loss of safeguarded wharves will not be permitted unless it is
demonstrated that the wharf is no longer viable nor capable of being made viable for cargo handling, or it
is being consolidated as part of a strategic land use change in an Opportunity Area, in accordance with the
London Plan Policy SI 15.
B. Proposalsfordevelopmentonsafeguardedwharfsitesmustbedesignedtoretainorimprovethelong-term
operation and use of the safeguarded wharf, including the retention of adequate access arrangements and
ensuring that the operational capacity of the facility is not reduced. Further considerations for each wharf
are set out within the relevant Site Allocation.
C. Development proposals on sites adjacent or in close proximity to safeguarded wharves should be designed
tominimisethepotentialconflictsofuseanddisturbance,inlinewiththeAgentofChangeprinciplesetout
within the London Plan Policy D13. The efficient operation of the wharves will be supported through the
protection of routes to the Transport for London Road Network serving safeguarded wharves.
18.78There are five working wharves within the
borough:
Wandle Delta sub-area
Smuggler's Way Wharf
Pier Wharf
Nine Elms
Cringle Dock
Kirtling Wharf
Middle Wharf
18.79The wharves provide an important economic
function to both the borough and to London
through the transhipment of waterborne freight,
in particular waste and aggregates, and their
long-term operation in this capacity will be
safeguarded.TheSecretaryofState’sSafeguarding
Directions for wharves took forward the
recommendations of the Implementation Report
- Safeguarded Wharves Review 2018-2019 that
this status is retained for all of Wandsworth’s
wharves, and all planning applications affecting
safeguarded wharves must be referred to the
Mayor.
18.80Themovementofgoodsbywaterfurtherprovides
a sustainable alternative to the use of lorries,
reducingtrafficcongestionanditsimpacts,andthe
continuedoperationofthewharvesthereforealso
makes an important contribution to borough’s
ambitionstorealisesustainabledevelopment.The
use of river transport for construction (includingremoval of waste) and bulk deliveries should be
assessed,andsecuredthroughplanningconditions
or obligations where appropriate.
18.81Only in circumstances in which it can be
demonstrated that a wharf is not economically
viable, nor could it be made viable, will the
redevelopment of a wharf for other land uses be
permitted. Factors that must be considered in
assessing the viability of a safeguarded wharf are
outlined in the London Plan Policy SI 15.
18.82The wharves are located within areas of
opportunity within the borough, where there is
high demand for other uses, including residential.
Developmentofsitesthatareadjacentorinclose
proximity to the wharves must be designed to
minimise the potential for conflicts between the
effective operation of the wharves (which can
occur over a 24-hour period) and the new land
use, and the Agent of Change principle will apply
as set out in the London Plan Policy D13.
18.83Proposalsforthemixed-useredevelopmentofthe
wharf sites are acceptable where the long-term
water freight use of the site is secured, and the
operationalcapacityiseitherimprovedorretained.
Proposals must be designed to mitigate any
potential conflict between the different uses, and
should be consistent with the specific
developmental and design considerations set out
within the relevant site allocation. Such proposals
should be brought forward in collaboration with
the GLA and the PLA, and any other relevant
parties. Development proposals relating either to
the wharf site itself or those adjacent to the site
must ensure that appropriate highway access to
thewharvesforcommercialvehiclesismaintained.

19.6TheNPPFrequiresLocalPlanstodefineanetwork
andhierarchyoftowncentres,andtopromote
theirlong-term vitalityandviability.In
Wandsworth,thisisawell-established approach,withahierarchyofcentresprovidingshopping and
complementar yfacilitiesthatisdividedintoTown
Centres,LocalCentres,andImportantLocal
Parades(ILPs),aswellasthePotentialCentral
396Activities Zone (CAZ) Retail Cluster at Battersea
PowerStationwithintheVNEBOA,asdesignated
in the London Plan. The latter is already in the
process of being developed, and the Local Plan
considers this to be ‘emerging’ – rather than
‘potential’–butretainsthelanguageoftheLondon
Plan for consistency with that document.
Collectively, the centres and parades are
well-distributed and cover much of the borough,
with few areas that are not within reasonable
walking distance (considered to be 400m) of one
of these designations. In such locations, very
localised provision exists through non-designated
parades and local shops, such as those located in
petrol filling stations and as part of the riverside
developments (See Policy LP44 Local Shops and
Services). In addition, the borough’s residents are
also served by centres in neighbouring boroughs,
including a smaller potential CAZ retail cluster at
Vauxhall Cross in the part of the VNEB OA
located in the London Borough of Lambeth.
19.7Wandsworth does not have one single strategic
retail centre, but rather five Town Centres which
serve five distinct areas of the borough. The main
centres have an important role to play, providing
shops, services, employment opportunities,
housing, and functioning as the focus for
communityandculturallife.Themaincentres,and
thepotentialCAZretailclusteratBatterseaPower
Station, should be the focus for large-scale
shopping and major trip-generating development.
The centres are all highly accessible by public
transport and are recognised within the London
Plan’s Town Centre Network. Accommodating
main town centre uses in locations where
customers are able to undertake linked trips
contributestosustainabilityobjectivesbyreducing
the need to travel, as well as providing for
improved customer choice and competition. In
this way, the benefits of new development will
serve to reinforce the vitality and viability of the
existing centre. The inclusion of large-scale
communityfacilitieswithintowncentrescanrealise
benefits including enhancing social cohesion,
creating vibrancy and reinforcing the importance
of the centres. The Council also recognises the
contribution of culture to the identity of the
centres,andproposalstoenhanceculturalactivities
and provision are supported. Each of the centreshas distinctive qualities and strengths, as well as
opportunitiesforgrowthandenhancement.These
are discussed in more detail within the Area
Strategies, which outline a place-based approach
for each of the five town centres.
19.9ImportantLocalParadescompriseasmallgrouping

a newsagent, general grocery store, post office,
and occasionally a pharmacy, hairdresser or other

immediatelocalneedsonly,providingconvenience
goods within walking distance of people’s homes.
Thereissomevariationintheirsize,vacancyrates
and shopping function, however, and certain
parades have a significant evening economy.
19.10The designation of the VNEB OA provides the
basisforthelarge-scaleregenerationofthisformer
low-density industrial area to include new homes,
employment, and retail floorspace. The London
Plan identifies potential CAZ retail clusters at
Battersea Power Station and at Vauxhall Cross
(located within LB Lambeth). These are both
recognised as significant mixed-use clusters, with
a predominant retail function, which – in terms of
scale – are broadly comparable to the GLA’s
designations of Major or District centres outside
of the CAZ. The potential CAZ retail cluster at
Battersea Power Station is to be the larger of the
two, and is intended to be comparable in scale
and type with the borough’s other main centres.
Further information is included within the Nine
Elms Area Strategy.
39719.8Local Centres provide a focus for local
communities,providingarangeoffacilitiesforfood
and household goods shopping as well as service
and other employment, leisure and recreational
functions.Theyaregenerallywellservedbypublic
transport (with the exception ofRoehampton).
The variation in size, role andcharacter of
individual centres reflects thecatchment
population – some may provide a widerange of
shops whilst others may have a morelimited
offer. There is scope for residential-led
developmentinsomeofthesecentres,inparticular
Roehampton, which is discussed in more detail in

425LP54 Open Space, Sport and Recreation
A. Any proposal that would result in a loss of sports pitches, playing fields, or land last used for outdoor sport,
or which would prejudice the land's future use for sport in terms of quality or quantity of facilities, will not
be permitted unless it can be clearly demonstrated that:
2. It would meet the priorities identified in the Playing Pitch Strategy.
B. Anyproposalinvolvingthelossofindoorsportsfacilitiesandrecreationfacilitieswillnotbepermittedunless
it can be clearly demonstrated that:
1. There is no current or future need or demand for the facility, either in its current use or for any
alternative sports or recreation use; or
2. Replacement provision of an equivalent or better quantity and quality which supports any identified
current and future need will be provided in an appropriate location.
C. Proposals for new, or improvements to existing, sports facilities and indoor recreation and leisure
developments should:
1. Be developed in accordance with and meet the needs of the Playing Pitch Strategy or the Indoor Built
Facilities Assessment/ Strategy, as appropriate;
2.Increaseorenhancetheprovisionoffacilitiesinaccessiblelocations,well-connectedtopublictransport
and link to networks for walking and cycling;
3. Maximise the multiple use of facilities, and encourage the co-location of services between sports
providers, schools, colleges, universities and other community facilities; and
4. Support the provision of sports lighting within reasonable hours, where there is an identified need for
sports facilities, and lighting is required to increase their potential usage, unless the lighting gives rise
to demonstrable harm to the local community, open space, local amenity or biodiversity.
D. Publicaccesstoopenspaceandsportsandrecreationfacilitiesonprivatelandwillbesupported,particularly
in areas with an identified deficiency in open space.
E.Proposalsinvolvingalossofchildren'splayfacilitieswillnotbepermittedunlessitcanbeclearlydemonstrated

quality and quantity of provision in an appropriate location.
21.15Open spaces, play areas, and sport and recreation
facilities are important natural resources in
Wandsworth.Theextensiveprovisionofplayareas
and open spaces in the borough, including formal
and informal land and facilities for sport and
recreation, close to homes and places of work,
will contribute to developing community and
encouraginghealthierlifestylesaswellasincreased
walking and cycling with positive health benefits.
Play areas and open spaces are particularly
important in promoting activity in young children,

identified areas of deficiency.
21.16Open spaces can be beneficial as tranquil spaces
where unwelcome noise is low. Opportunities to
interact with the natural environment can be key
toprotectingandimprovingqualityoflifeinurban
areas. 'Quiet Areas' may be formally identified in
the future and are likely to include the borough's
open spaces. New development near quiet and
tranquil areas should be sensitive to this and not
cause an increase in environmental noise.

biodiversity,ecosystem servicesandhuman

429adapting to the effects of climate change on living
organismsandsocietiesisincreasinglyattheheart
of environmental management strategies.
21.29Guidance on the use of native species and climate
change can be found in the Wandsworth Open
Space Study, Wandsworth Biodiversity Strategy,
BiodiversityActionPlan(forthcoming),theMayor
of London's Biodiversity Strategy and the London
Tree and Woodland Framework. Information on
areas of deficiency in access to nature in London

of habitat survey findings for the borough’s SINC
sites can be found at Enable’s website
https://enablelc .org/parks-about-us/biodiv ersity/sinc .
21.30The protection and enhancement of biodiversity
should be treated as integral to any new
development scheme, not as an ‘add-on’. Layout,
design, buildings, external lighting and landscaping
schemes should take account of existing
biodiversity features and habitats. New
development should include new or enhanced
features and habitats, design (such as green roofs)
and landscaping (including trees) that promote
biodiversity, including provision for their
management. Proposals should give consideration
to the need for species to move between habitats
andthereforeseektoconnectwithexistinggreen
corridors where it is appropriate to do so. All
development,particularlyfornewandreplacement
buildingsandextensionstobuildings,shouldutilise
opportunitiestoattractnewspeciestoasite.Thiscan include the incorporation of artificial nest
boxes and bricks in buildings to provide nesting
and roosting opportunities for birds, including
speciesunderthreatsuchasswifts,housemartins,
swallows and house sparrows, and where
appropriate,bats.Swiftbricksintegratedintonew
buildings are preferred, as these are suitable for
multiple bird species. As outlined in the National
Planning Practice Guidance, these relatively small
featurescanachieveimportantbenefitsforwildlife.
Applicants will be expected to provide details of
such features as part of planning applications. All
these features must also be protected during
construction works, and this may be secured by a
planningcondition,aswillsubsequentmaintenance
and monitoring.
21.31National Government's guidance for Habitat
RegulationsAssessmentsspecifiesthatassessments
must consider any project that might have an
impact on a designation. When assessing
development proposals, the Council will consider
theimpacttheproposalhasonthedesignationor
incloseproximitytothedesignation.Whetheror
not a proposed development impacts on a
designatedsitewilldependonthetypeofproposal,
the reason for designation, and the level of
designation. More mobile priority or protected
species are more likely to be impacted by
developments further away than static or site
faithful species.
21.32Biodiversity net gain is an approach to
development that aims to leave the natural
environment in a measurably better state than
previously found. The Environment Act mandates
nationallya10%increaseinthenetbiodiversityof
landseekingplanningpermission.TheActrequires
that biodiversity net gain will be delivered within
theexistingplanninganddevelopmentprocessand
that a grant of planning permission will be subject
to a pre-commencement condition requiring a
biodiversitynetgainplantobeapproved.TheAct
also requires the creation of Local Nature
RecoveryNetworksandStrategieswhichcanhelp
identify and support the recovery of important
habitats in the borough. Once the relevant
mandatory requirement inserted into the Town
and Country Planning Act 1990, it will be
consideredalongsidetheLocalPlanrequirements.

landscape and character; and
3. Require the provision of planting, including new trees, shrubs and other significant vegetation where
appropriate.
21.33One of the distinctive qualities of Wandsworth is
its well-treed landscape, green and open spaces,
as well as its streets and residential areas. The
Council looks after more than 60,000 trees in its
parks, commons and open spaces while around
16,000 grow in residential streets and on the
borough’s housing estates. Wandsworth Council
planted over 1,200 trees in the last two winters
of 2019 and 2020 and are actively exploring new
areas to plant street trees
21.34Conservation Areas cover around 50% of the
borough and all trees are generally protected in
these areas by the provisions of the Town and
Country Planning Act (1990). In addition, the
Council has made around 400 Tree Preservation
Orders (TPO) to protect individual trees and
groups of trees of high amenity value.
21.35Theterm'landscape'istakentorefertothedesign
of all space between buildings and includes walls
andboundaries,pavingaswellasplanting.Itrefers
to both 'soft' as well as 'hard' landscape and
materials.21.36Trees and landscaping are key components of
Wandsworth’s ecological and green and blue
infrastructure network. They soften the hardness
of buildings and streets, help create the amenity,
add to place-making and character of the street
scene, add life, colour and character to the urban
landscape and enhance open spaces and the
riverside landscape. Trees and other planting,
including contiguous gardens and green oases,
delivermultiplebenefits:theyprovideanimportant
habitatforwildlife;reducelevelsofcarbondioxide
andairbornepollutants(suchasnitrogendioxide)
and harmful particulates (such as PM10's and
PM2.5's);dampennoisefromtrafficandcongestion;
increase the supply of oxygen; and provide shade
for streets, open areas and parks as well as for
buildings. Trees and other landscape features can
help areas to adapt to the likely effects of climate
change;forexample,theyhaveacoolingeffectand
contribute to the reduction of urban heat islands
by regulating local temperature extremes, which
is important due to projected future increases in
temperature as a result of climate change. In
addition, they can assist in reducing surface water
run off rates and flash floods during heavy rainfall
events through absorption and infiltration.
21.37Developmentproposalsarerequiredtoretainand
protect existing trees, and minimise any impacts
on trees, landscaping, shrubs and other significant
vegetation, including through the provision of
sufficient space for the crowns and root systems
of existing and proposed trees, including their
future growth. Developer contributions towards
trees within the public realm may be required
where appropriate.
21.38With all proposals, particular attention should be
giventotheuseoftreeplantinginenhancingpublic
areas within developments and views into sites
from surrounding viewpoints, taking into account
the need to ensure that clear sightlines and open
outlook are maintained as necessary to ensure
community safety is not adversely affected.

for office and industrial floorspace, and identifying
sitesandinwardinvestmentopportunitiesinorder
to meet anticipated needs over the lifetime of the
Plan.TheCouncilwillcontinuetomonitorgrowth
against forecast need to consider the effects that
external factors may have on economic trends.
22.8Demand for retail floorspace in the short to
medium term is expected to be accommodated
through the implementation of existing
commitments, take up of vacant floorspace and
increases in efficiency. As such, the priority is to
directnewmaintowncentreusesprimarilytothe
borough’s centres. The policy approach also
recognises the need for flexibility in order to
respond to changes in the operation of retail and
town centre uses over the lifetime of this Plan.
22.9Improvements to transport infrastructure,
particularly to public transport as well as cycling
and walking, will be essential to support the
delivery of the Spatial Development Strategy. The
London Plan sets out strategic schemes and
proposals for London, a number of which will
benefittheborough,includingCrossrail2,London
undergroundimprovementsandincreasingcapacity
onSouthwestRailroutes.TheCouncilwillsupport
the delivery of improvements to public transport
and accessibility opportunities and the
reconfiguring the Wandsworth Gyratory. These
improvements will largely be delivered by TfL and
transport operating companies. Funding for
improvements will be provided by Government,
TfL, private investment and the Council, through
the Council’s Community Infrastructure Levy
scheme, and where appropriate, financial
contributions through Planning Obligations or
on-site improvements on relevant development
sites.
22.10A key challenge for the borough over the lifetime
ofthisPlanwillbethedeliveryofsufficientschool
places to meet the needs of the borough’s
residents. The Council will work with partners,
including the Education Funding Agency as well as
educational providers, to ensure the provision of
thequantityanddiversityofschoolplacesneeded
within the borough.
22.11The Council will work with service providers and
developers to ensure the adequate provision of
communityservicesandfacilities,especiallyinareas
where there is an identified need or shortage.
Existing facilities will be protected whereappropriate and new community and social
infrastructurefacilitieswillbedeliveredonavariety
of sites as identified through this Plan.
Improvements to open spaces as well as play
facilities will be required in line with Policy LP19
Play Space and LP20 New Open Space.
22.12The activities of other key partner agencies and
bodies, such as the Wandsworth Clinical
Commissioning Group (CCG), and NHS partner
organisations, who are responsible for delivering
healthservicesintheborough,willalsocontribute
to delivering the Strategic Vision and Spatial
Development Strategy.
Site Delivery
Viability
22.14TheCouncilhasundertakena‘wholePlan’viability
assessment. However, it is recognised that the
housing and commercial property markets are
inherentlycyclicalsuchthatafullypolicycompliant
scheme may make some development proposals
unviable at the time of submitting a planning
application. The Plan sets out the approach that
the Council will take to assessing such proposals
and the mechanisms that it will adopt to ensure
that schemes contribute fully should viability
improve.
Infrastructure Delivery
22.15Deliveryofinfrastructureiscriticaltothedelivery
of the Strategic Objectives, Vision and Spatial
StrategyoftheLocalPlan.Futuredevelopment,as
set out in this Local Plan, will need to be enabled
and supported by the timely delivery of
infrastructure.Infrastructureplanningensuresthat

44122.13The Site Allocations in the Local Plan will be the
keydeliverymechanismforachievingtheidentified
housing, employment, retail and infrastructure
needs set out in the Local Plan. It is therefore
crucial to the delivery of the Spatial Development
Strategy that development sites come forward
asplanned;anditwillbevitalthatlandownersand
developers engage with the Council as soon as
possible in the development process, through the
Council’s pre-application advice service, and with
local communities to inform the design of their
proposals. The Council will also work
cooperativelywithcommunitiesinthepreparation
of area-based plans and proposals.ordevelopment canbedeliveredinatimely
