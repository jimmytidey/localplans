New Local  
Plan Review 
Publication  
(Regulation 19)
October 2022Key information about this consultation 
What
 is the New 
Local Plan 
Review?  A Local Plan is the key planning policy document setting a vision for 
the future development of the Borough. It identifies development sites and planning policies to achieve this vision. It is used to determine planning applications in the Borough. We are n ow undertaking a 
review to produce a new Local Plan for the next 20 years.  
What is this 
consultation about ? We have undertaken a lot of engagement through a variety of means 
in developing the New Local Plan Review (NLPR) . Three rounds of 
consultation have been undertaken, two of which were non statutory. 
The two early engagement stages were very helpful to understand the 
issues i mportant to our residents and other stakeholders and to get 
their views on options to develop policies . The previous stage of 
consultation was on draft policies (known as Regulation 18). We have considered the responses from the last stage alongside the evidence 
and have now produced “Publication” planning policies  (known as 
Regulation 19).  
The purpose of this consultation is to ask if you consider the NLPR to 
be “sound”. Plans are “sound” if they are - positively  prepared, justified, 
effective and consistent with national policy. Further details of these national ly defined tests are set out in the accompanying response 
form.  
Following this consultation, we will submit the NLPR to the Secretary 
of State for examination. You can indicate on the response form if you would like to attend the examination as a participant.  
Who is this consultation for?  We want to hear from our communities, businesses and other stakeholders about shaping future development in the Borough.  
Duration of consultation This consultation will run for  eight  weeks, from 27 October  to 
11:59pm 22 December  2022.

The Grenfell Tower tragedy showed us just how important key place shaping documents like 
our Local Plan can be. They are a vehicle for ensuring the needs and priorities of our residents are protected. They set the tone for the development and changes to our shared place, and make sure that they work for all of our communities.  
This
 is why I am so pleased to have heard from so many members of our community while 
shaping these policies. We have put our communities at the heart of their development and have heard from people through traditional and modern routes of engagement, with more than 
1,500 individuals using a new digital platform enabling us to hear from a much wider audience. 
Our
 approach to the Local Plan has  evolved significantly over the last 5 years. The bereaved 
and survivors from Grenfell challenged us to build more social rented housing as a proportion of affordable housing provision in the Borough. When we adopted the current Local Plan in 
September 2019, I made a commitment to do this and have it ready for examination within the next three years. We undertook early work to bring this forward as a policy and adopted the 
Community Housing Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) in June 2020. The publication 
of these NLPR - Draft Policies delivers on those commitments. As promised, we are now at 
the “publication” stage after which the NLPR will be submitted for examination early next year.   
From the feedback we have had recently, it is clear that green issues, affordability of homes and the architecture, historic streets and townscape of the Borough are very important to our communities. I recognise what a special place Kensington and Chelsea is; I want to protect its 
unique character for all our communities, and this will be a driving vision through this Local Plan. 
Our
 plan has three key strands to deliver this vision: Green, Inclusive and Liveable. 
•Gr
een in that we will put the environment at the heart of all new developments,
following through on our net-zero commitments and saving our residents money ontheir energy bills. We will do this in a sensitive way that protects the character of ourbuildings and embraces modern technology and constructions methods to minimise the
impact on the climate.
•Inclusive i
n that we commit to providing truly affordable homes (a significant
proportion at social rent), employment opportunities and ensure that access to a range
of social and leisure facilities are provided. Narrowing the equality gap that exists in our
borough and providing the best services for all our residents.
We wi
ll push back on building houses for the sake of hitting housing targets, and
instead focus on building the homes/places that residents need. Our housing policies
set out a trajectory for delivering homes that will meet and exceed our ten -year housing
target of 4,480 homes set by the London Plan. Our approach recognises the uniqueconstraints and character of the Borough with a lower figure delivered in the first fiveyear and delivery ramping up as the Opportunity Area sites start to deliver much
needed homes.
•Liveable i
n that we recognise that we need to protect and indeed enhance the
Borough’s outstanding special  townscape by ensuring that the design of new
development is of the highest quality and safety standards, reinforcing an area’s
character.7 We will develop our cultural offer and support our internationally recognised town 
centres and their shops, theatres, museums, events, festivals, and markets so we 
create a highly attractive place to live, work and learn. 
We wi
ll also ensure they retain the vibrancy and mix of uses so cherished by our 
residents and visitors and embed the positive changes that were introduced in the pandemic, such as alfresco dining. It is a joy to walk around the beautiful streets, 
garden squares and public piazzas of the Borough and so we also want to encourage more walking and cycling.  
As the Leader of the Council, I tak e the stewardship of our o utstanding bui lt-environment very 
seriously. We have the most historic s treets i n London, and i t is vital tha t we both protect them 
and keep them ac cessible for al l of our c ommunities. This i s something that is hi ghly v al ued 
and makes the Borough one of the most liveabl e, diverse, and des irable areas of London 
attracting people from all over the world.  
I believe the NLPR will provide a firm foundation for the future as it delivers  on our ambitions, 
and m
ost importantly, our r esident and community as pirations. We look f orward to hearing 
more from y ou in this f inal s tage of consultation too.

 1. Introduction 
What is a Local Plan? 
1.1 The Local Plan sets out the vision for future development in the B orough 
over a 20 year period and includes the planning policies to help achieve 
this vision.  It can do so by identifying locations that are suitable for good 
growth as well as for conservati on and by setting clear guidelines for 
appropriate  land uses , the form and design of development. The aim is to 
achieve good accessible placemaking that protects and improves 
residents ’ health and well- being, provides good quality homes, enhanc ing 
the economy and the environment.   
Why are we reviewing the Local Plan now? 
1.2 The Council is required to review its Local Plan every five years. Our 
current Local Plan was adopted in September 2019. We are undertaking 
an early review to reflect the Council’s new priorities and values following 
the Grenfell Tower tragedy . As a Council we have adopted new values 
which are putting communities first, respecting others, acting with integrity 
and working together.  
1.3 Our New  Local Plan Review (NLPR)  will contribute to recover y from the 
crisis caused by the Covid- 19 pandemic. It will do so by providing the 
planning framework for our businesses to bounce back and for  our town 
centres to remain relevant in a very different world.    
1.4 In May 2022 the Government published the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill. This will change the nature of Local Plans and of the wider planning system. We do not know the final form that these reforms will take but we have written the policies in this Local Plan so they are deliverable and flexible and do not duplicate policies elsewhere nationally 
or in the London Plan.  
What are publication policies? 
1.5 These publication policies are the policies that we intend to submit  to the 
Secretary of State for  examination in early 2023. They are the local 
development plan policies which we expect to form our new Local Plan.  
1.6 The previous R egulation 18 “ Draft Policy” consultation was the opportunity 
for stakeholders to comment on the nature of the proposed or draft 
policies.   
1.7 The purpose of this Regulation 19  consultation is to ask if you consider the 
NLPR to be “ sound” . Plans are “sound” if they are – positively prepared,  
9 
 justified, effective and consistent with national policy1. Furthe r details of 
these nationally defined tests are set out in the accompanying response 
form.  
1.8 Following this consultation, the NLPR wi ll be submitted to the Secretary of 
State for examination in early 2023. Local plans are examined to assess whether they have been prepared in accordance with legal and procedural requirements, and whether they are “ sound” . The Secretary of State will 
appoint a Planning Inspector to conduct the examination. Al l comments 
received will be passed to the P lanning Inspectorate, and will be 
considered in the forthcoming examination.  
1.9 A number of other documents will also be submitted. These include technical evidence, an Integrated Impact Assessment (IIA) which includes a Sustainability Appraisal of the policies and an Equalities Impact Assessment as well as a series of policy formulation reports providing the detailed justification for the submitted policies.  
What are saved policies? 
1.10 In addition,  we are proposing to “save” some  policies which means that 
these existing  policies are still fit for purpose and will be retained. As we 
are not inviting comments on these “ saved” policies they are not repeated 
in this document,  but the title is included in the appropriate loc ation. These 
are also listed  together  in Appendix 2.  
The Local Plan process 
1.11 The drafting of a Local Plan is not a quick process. It must go through several  formal stages before it can be adopted.  The various stages are set 
out in Figure 1.1 below . 
1.12 We are a Council that  puts our communities first in the planning process 
and we recognise that , if the NLPR is to be successful , it must  draw upon 
the experiences of our residents  and local businesses . Details of how we 
are doing this are set out in our Statement of Community Involvement , 
published in February 2020.  We committed to undertake early 
engagement so that residents could  tell us what  was important  to them 
before we started writing planning policies.  We undertook two stages of 
early engagement and issued a set of draft policies. This is the fourth 
stage, where we have produced “publication policies”, or those which we expect to be the subject of the examination in the spring of 2023.   
 
 
1 The tests of soundness are set out in paragraph 35 of the National Planning Policy Framework.

 How does the Local Plan link w ith the Council’s p riorities? 
1.13 In 2019 we published our Council Plan. This was a document which 
recognis ed the strengths of the Borough, and also acknowledged the need 
to better engage with our residents in all of our dealings with them. We 
saw it as a blueprint which reflected w hat our communities value most , 
what we wanted to achieve together and what you could expect from the 
Council.   
1.14 In March 2022, we published our progress since 2019. Whilst  many of our 
priorities  have remained the same, o thers have emerged. So , alongsi de 
our green ambitions , the need for safer and greener streets , the need to 
build new homes and the need to continue to fund a community -led 
recov ery from the Grenfell t ragedy, the new Council Plan reflects the 
increased emphasis on the need to s upport the local economy, boost 
employment opportunities an d support physical and mental heal th.   
11 
 1.15 The Local Plan will be the spatial expression of the Council Plan and of all 
the Council’s strategies , as explained visually in Figure 1.2 below . It will 
help us deliver the Council’s priorities in new developments .  
Figure 1.2: Linking Council Plan priorities to the Local Plan   
Overall vision for the Local Plan 
1.16 The Planning Act s require that e ach local planning authority must identify 
the strategic  priorities for the development and use of land in the 
authority’s area. We intend to do this through the Local Plan, with an 
ambitious and succinct overall vision that reflects  our ambitions  and our 
priorities  for future development.  
1.17 This vision for the Borough is set out below . 
V1 Vision for the Borough  
The Local Plan will  support good growth and future development in 
the Borough to be:   
• Green. It w ill put the environment at the heart of all new 
development,  and support sensitive and safe retrofitting of 
existing buildings  so we can support the health and well -being of 
our residents and our visitors, now and long into the future;   
 
12 
 • Inclusive . It will  narrow the inequality which exists across the 
Borough, and ensure that we provide the truly affordable homes, 
the employment opportunities  and access to a wide range of 
facilities that meet our residents ’ day-to-day needs, including 
open space, social , education and sports /leisure  facilities;   
• Liveable. It will enhance the Borough’s outstanding townscape, 
preserving and conserving the context where required and by 
ensuring that the design of new development is of the highest 
quality  and saf ety standards, re inforc ing an area’s character in 
addition to developing our cultural offer and supporting our 
internationally recognised town centres and their shops, theatres, 
museums, events, festivals and markets  to create a highly 
desirable place to live . 
1.18 The vi sion supports good growth in the Borough and by “Good Growth” we 
mean growth that is socially and economically inclusive and 
environmentally sustainable. It means that we need to build new homes and workspaces and provide the services needed by a growing population, but development will not be allowed at any cost. We expect it to be of the highest quality and create successful, inclusive and sustainable places. It must benefit all of those who live here, be sensitive to local context and be environmentally sustainable and physically accessible.  
Green  
1.19 Climate Change is one of the greatest challenges of our times and in October 2019, the Council declared a Climate Change Emergency.  
1.20 The Local Plan will be one of the key documents which will allow us to drive this forward and promote and require best practice in the built environment so that the Borough can meet its commitment to be carbon neutral by 2040. However, we recognise that a “green borough” is more than about mitigating long- term trends. The Local Plan policies can have 
real and immediate impacts. They can ensure that designers think about minimising the carbon footprint of a scheme right at the outset of planning 
a development and all the way through the process of design, construction and the finished development. The Local Plan can help improve air quality, support urban greening and sustainable urban drainage, minimise flood risk and promote biodiversity. It can set high energy standards for new 
developments and support the shift to more electric vehicles by requiring the necessary infrastructure.  
1.21 We will use the opportunities associated with being one of the country’s smallest boroughs to reduce our dependence on cars. We will improve the built environment to make walking and cycling attractive for local  journeys  
to make it easy to access our town centres, or the hubs for our “village-
like” neighbourhoods. Not only does this improve our carbon footprint, but 
this also helps support the health and well -being of those who live in and 
visit the Borough.   
13 
 Inclusive 
1.22 We value, respect and celebrate the diversity of the communities we 
serve. We also recognise that Kensington and Chelsea is a borough of 
contrasts , and narrowing the gap is one of the cross- cutting themes of our 
Council Plan. If our community is to t hrive, the Local Plan must shape 
development which serves all our residents. The Local Plan will therefore 
support a range of social and community uses, high standards of 
accessibility , providing the same standards of access to open space, and 
the provision of more genuinely affordable homes and workspaces . It will 
support the “walkable neighbourhood” so that all those living within the 
Borough will be able to easily walk or cycle to the range of  local facilities,  
open spaces, education, sports and social and community facilities that will meet their day -to-day needs and will reduce heal th inequality.  The Council 
also recognises the value of education and the role it has in addressing 
inequalities . 
1.23 It will provide the premises needed by our businesses, to ensure that the needs of our residents are met and that the Borough plays a full part in contributing to London’s economy.  
Liveable 
1.24 Kensington and Chelsea is one of the most liveable areas of London and 
attracts people from all over the world to live, work a nd visit . Part of this 
attraction comes from the variety in our cultural off er including the Notting 
Hill Carnival a nd the museums  and also from our internationally  renowned 
town centres.  The other element that provides a distinct character to the 
Borough ’s sense of place is the village -like character  of some of our 
neighbourhoods and the large number of historic buildings, townscapes, 
squares , parks  and public spaces. This rich architectural heritage is 
something unique that new  development must respect  and therefore be of 
the highest quality in its own right  while conserving and enhancing the 
historic elements. All new development must drive up the quality of design, constructed to the highest safety standards  and improve the Borough’s 
built environment , its liveability , and the quality of life of its residents.

 “The National Model Design 
Code sets a baseline standard of quality and practice which local planning authorities are expected to take into 
account when developing 
local design codes and guides and when determining planning applications.”  
14 
 1.25
 By the same token, the Local Plan will support its town centres, its cultural 
institutions, its local and its international attractions  to make sure the 
Borough remains special; a place which serve the needs of its residents as 
well as for visitors from across the world.    
Our Strategy to deliver the Vision 
1.26 The Local Plan first sets out our planning policies that will shape all 
development in the Borough and help deliver our  Vision. There is a 
distinction between strategic and non- strategic policies as required by 
national policy and these are listed in Appendix 3.  
1.27 The Local Plan recognises the many distinctive places within the Borough and includes a vision for each of these Places in Chapter 9 . The list of 
Places in the Local Plan may not be exhaustive as we have focused on 
those areas where there is some expected growth or change likely to 
occur during the plan period. These areas are focussed on our two Opportunity Areas  where most of the growth will take place, those areas 
expected to undergo some change – mainly the three employment zones 
and the Lancaster West Estate and Notting Dale, the larger town centres, 
some of national or international reputation and other neighbourhoods and 
local centres that are so important in making the Borough the place that it is.  
1.28 We have identified sites where development will take place and these are set out in Chapter 10.  15 1.29 We support our policies  and growth strategy  with the requi rement to 
deliver much needed infrastructure alongside so we can truly achieve good 
growth.

 The Development Plan 
1.31 Planning applications have to be decided in line with the relevant local 
planning authority’s (LPA) development plan,  unless there is a very good 
reason not to do so.  Our development plan is made up of the Local Plan, 
the London Plan and, where relevant, the Neighbourhood Plan.  
The Local Plan   
1.32 This is a locally determined document which sets out how we would like development to take place in the Bo rough.  However, we do not have a 
free hand as the Local Plan must be consistent with national policy, and particularly the content of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and of the national Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) . 
The London Plan   
1.33 T his has been prepared by the Mayor for London.  It is a higher level 
strategic document which both informs the nature of this Local Plan and helps us determine larger planning applications.  The Local Plan must be in 
general conformity with the London Plan.  
Neighbourhood Plans    
1.34 The Localism Act 2011 introduced new rights and powers to allow local communities to shape new development by coming together to prepare Neighbourhood Plans.  We currently have two neighbourhood pl ans, the St 
Quintin and Woodlands Neighbourhood Plan and the Norland 
Neighbourhood Plan.  
1.35 The policies within these plans must be used when determining any planning application within the relevant area.  Whist this Local Plan 
postdates each Neighbourhood Plan, we fully endorse, and aim to 
imple ment, all the policies within the Neighbourhood Plans.   
1.36 As required  by the NPPF, we have set out in A ppendix 3 which of our 
policies are strategic . Neighbourhood Plans must be in general conformity 
with these strategic policies.

 2 Green -Blue Future  
Introduction 
2.1 We live in an urban b orough where we  can sometimes feel detached from 
the natural world around us. However, our location by the River Thames 
and some outstanding open spa ces helps with our me ntal and physical 
well-being. We all have an important role to ensur e that  the environment  is 
respected and protected for future generations . Climate Change is one of 
the greatest challenges of our times. In October 2019, the Council declared a Climate Change Emergency and made a commitment to 
become a carbon neutral Borough by 2040. The Local Plan place s the 
environment at the centre of our consideration of new development proposals  to ensure development contributes to the mitigation and 
adaptation to climate change.  
2.2 The Council is on a mission to reduce carbon emissions not only through its own operations but also tackling this challenge holistically. It is only by 
rethinking what and how we build, how we travel, and reduce, reuse and 
recycle our waste that we will meet this commitment. The Council has already taken a positive step in producing the Greening Supplementary 
Planning Document (SPD)  in June 2021.  
2.3 This Chapter  sets out  our policy  on the circular economy ; whole life -cycle 
carbon; energy  and net zero carbon; controlling air pollution, light pollution, 
odour , noise and vibration; managing flooding  and flood risk ; protection 
and enhancement of gr een infrastructure, biodiversity and trees;  as well as 
waste  and contaminated land. W e recognise that greening is a topic  that 
cuts across all themes of  the Local Plan. It drives our ambition to support 
sustainable forms of transport and the need to ensure that the right type of development is directed to the right parts of our B orough.  
Key facts 
• 22 Sites of Nature Conservation Importance (including the Grand 
Union Cana l, River Thames and Chelsea Creek)  home to 62 protected 
and priority species.  
• The entire Borough is an Air Quality Management Area and has three 
Air Quality Focus Areas.  
• The Borough contains some of the Capital ’s pollution hotspots .  
Although we have seen a gradual decline in pollutant concentrations in recent years some roadside locations continue to exceed the Government ’s recommended annual  average level of nitrogen dioxide. 
A recent m odelling exercise also predicted that  two thirds  of the 
Borough exceeds the World Health Organisation’s 2005 air quality 
guideline  value for PM
2.5.  
21 
 • Four critical drainage areas to try to reduce the risk of flooding in the 
parts of the Borough most prone . 
• The Council collected 76,829 tonnes of waste in 2019- 20 (including 
50,829 tonnes of domestic waste) . 
Policy GB 1: Sustainable Retrofitting  
GB1: Sustainable Retrofitting  
A. Sensitive , sustainable and safe retrofitting of  all our  existing 
building stock is supported. For  large retrofit schemes , third 
party voluntary standards su ch as EnerPHit  for retrofit projects, 
the AECB Silver Standard an d Energiesprong for whole house 
retrofit of existing homes should be used.   
B. Retrofitting  of historic and listed buildings as well as properties 
within conservation areas must be  carried out so that it  does  
not harm the special historic or architectural int erest  of the 
building or character and appearance of the conservation area.  
C. Sensitive installation of double- glazed window replacements is 
supported subject to fulfilling the Council’s statutory duties in 
relation to conservation areas and listed buildings . 
D. Sensitive installation of solar panels in an appropriate position 
to maximise solar gain is supported subject to fulfilling the 
Council’s statutory duties in relation to conservation areas and 
listed buildings.  
Sustainable retrofitting 
2.4
 Sustainable retrofitting is when existing buildings can be upgraded to be more energy efficient  and use cleaner energy , for example in the form of  
solar  PV panels. In a typical British home up to a third of the heat 
produced by central heating systems is lost through the roof, walls, floor 
and windows. For a poorly insulated property, this means that £1 out of every £3 spent on energy is wasted. You can see how much heat your building is losing by viewing the Council’s heat loss map
2. The London 
Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) consider that around 18 per cent of our annual national CO2 emissions come from existing homes.  Retrofitting  
existing buildings is  critical to achieve the Borough’s net zero targets  but 
they can also be a significant cost saving measure for  householders in the 
 
2 Heat loss in your home | Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (rbkc.gov.uk)   
22 
 long term. We have produced a H ouseholder Guide3 to assist  our 
residents to retrofit their homes.  
2.5 There are a range of voluntary energy standards that have been 
developed that focus on improving building energy performance. T hese 
include the Passivhaus Standard developed by the Passivhaus Trust ; its 
equivalent EnerPHit for retrofit projects ; the AECB Silver Standard ; and 
Energiesprong, an established standard for the whole house ret rofit of 
existing homes. The Council strongly support s the use of voluntary 
industry standards and assessment methods.  
2.6 About three quarters  of the Borough is within conservation areas and the 
Borough contains over 4,000 listed buildings.  The Borough’s building 
stock, therefore, represents a significant amount of embodied carbon. In 
addition, it is estimate d that 60- 65 per cent of the total built environment 
CO 2 emissions for the Borough are associated with buildings in a 
conservation area.  Conservation and protection of the historic environment  
is therefore  a key constraint to the achievement of net zero carbon in the 
Borough4. As such, we also need to support sensitive and appropriate 
sustainable retrofit of historic and listed buildings, as well as buildings in conservation areas .  
2.7 We cannot expect existing buildings, particularly historic and listed buildings to meet the same high energy standards expected of new development, and the re-use and refurbishment of historic buildings is 
already a win in terms of whole- life carbon costs. However, applicants are 
expected to aim to meet the requirements and targets for new development as outlined in Policy GB 4 as far as demonstrably practical . 
2.8 Parts L1B and L2B of the Building Regulations require that when existing buildings are extended or renovated it is done in a way which means they use no more fuel and power than is reasonable in the circumstances. There is an exemption from this requirement for dwellings (L1B) and non-dwellings (L2B) which are listed buildings, buildings within conservation areas and scheduled ancient monuments if the energy efficiency 
requirements would unacceptably alter their character or appearance. Special considerations are also applied to non- designated historic 
buildings and buildings of traditional construction, where works to i mprove 
energy efficiency should not prejudice the character of the building or increase the risk of long- term deterioration of the fabric or fittings.  
2.9 Nonetheless, the Council will seek the highest standards of energy conservation that can be achieved within these limits. Approved documents LB1 and LB2 set out the calculations that need to be made to

 understand whether any improvements have been achieved. Advice on 
the application of these can be found on the Planning Portal website, or 
from the Council’s Building Control Service or other approved inspector. 
The Historic England publication ‘Building Regulations and Energy Efficiency’ (2017)  provides advice on ‘resolving potential conflicts between 
the requirements of Part L and the conservation of historic  buildings’.  
2.10 Historic England acknowledges the importance of making reasonable alterations to the existing building stock to mitigate climate change and states that often the energy efficiency of the historic buildings can be increased in ways sympathetic to their historic character
5.  
Windows 
2.11 Owners of unlisted houses in conservation areas are allowed to change windows to double glazed without planning permission,  provided similar 
materials are used, unless additional restrictions in the form of Ar ticle 4 
directions are in place. Meanwhile for flats or commercial buildings 
planning permission may be required if the appearance of the building will 
be materially altered. Adopting appropriate detailing which follows traditional window styles in the area and uses slimline double glazing, integrated glazing bars where possible, and painted timber will help to ensure that new double- glazed windows meet any planning requirements 
and preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area.   
2.12 Window replacements in listed buildings require careful design, and the repair rather than replacement of historic fabric is beneficial in terms of sustainability and whole- life costs as well as sustaining the special 
architectural and historic interest. However, there will be situations in which non- historic or inappropriate replacement windows may be replaced 
with double glazing to increase the energy efficiency of the building. Vacuum glazing is a new product where new slimline glazing that performs as well as tr iple glazing can be fitted into existing frames. Secondary 
glazing is another option that can be considered. It can provide superior performance particularly when the window is split into many panes. 
Particularly in listed buildings, the glazing bars should align with those on the original windows so as to be as unobtrusive as possible. Detailed advice will be provided by the Council to hel p residents  meet the 
requirements for appropriately designed replacements which ensure that the significance of the building or area is maintained.  
Solar Panels 
2.13 Permitted development rights already allow solar panels to be installed on 
unlisted domestic buildings in conservation areas, provided they are 
discreetly located. T he Council will provide detailed advice to residents in 
 
5 English Heritage, Climate Change and the Historic Environment , January 2008.   
24 
 the relevant Conservation Area Management Plans (CAMPs) about the 
most appropriate ways to fulfil these conditions. Using rear roof slopes or roofs hidden behind parapets, and careful thought as to the arrangement and siting of panels, their colour  and surface finish can all play a part in 
installing solar equipment which has a minimal effect on what is special about a conservation area. To make it easier to retrofit listed buildings, the Council has made use of a Local Listed Building Consent Order  which 
grant s a blanket consent for solar panels, subject to conditions to make 
sure they are appropriately designed and located and preserve the special 
architectural and historic interest of the building.  
Listed Buildings 
2.14 While listed buildings generally  represent a greater challenge in terms of 
retrofitting for carbon reduction, it is possible in most cases to avoid 
causing harm to the special architectural character or historic interest of the building. The Council will produce detailed advice to help r esidents 
and businesses to take up appropriate retrofitting measures for listed buildings. Where installation of double glazing is not possible, for instance, 
a range of options is available for achieving greater energy efficiency of windows . This  might in clude secondary glazing, installation of shutters, 
blinds and draft proofing systems, or reglazing of existing historic frames with more energy efficient glass. These proposals will be assessed on a case- by-case basis. The Council will support the installation of “cold- roof” 
insulation, draught -proofing, and better -fitting windows wherever this can 
be done without significant harm  to the fabric or character of the building. 
The Council will work on incorporating some of these improvements, 
alongside double glazing, in a further Local Listed Building Consent Order. However, changes of this kind may not be possible in all cases and w here 
it is not possible to demonstrate that harm to the building will not result then the Council is likely to resist such propos als. 
2.15 Chapter 9 of the Borough’s Greening SPD , June 2021 provides detailed 
guidance specific to historic and listed buildings as well as building in conser vation areas. In addition, the Council’s Householder Guide to the 
Greening SPD  provided guidance specific to householder projects.  
Policy G B2: Circular E conomy  
GB2: Circular Economy 
A. Major development s must  follow circular economy principles and 
aim to be net zer o-waste . A circular economy statement meeting 
the requirements of the London Plan must be submitted. 
2.16 A cir cular economy is defined in London Plan 2021 Policy SI 7 Reducing 
waste and supporting the Circular Economy’  “as one where materials are  
25 
 retained in use at their highest value for as long as possible and are then 
reused or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual waste. ”6 For buildings , 
this means creating a regenerative built environment that prioritises 
retention and refurbishment over demolition and rebuilding. It means designing buildings that can be adapted, reconstructed, and deconstructed to extend their life and that allow components and materials to be salvaged for reuse or recycling
7.  
2.17 The London Plan 2021 promotes  the incorporation of circular economy 
principles  into the design of development s and the submission of circular 
economy statements through Policy D38 and S I 7. In addition, Part C of 
Policy SI 7  states that “Development Plans that apply circular economy 
principles and set local lower thresholds for the application of Circular Economy Statements for development proposals are supported.”
9  
2.18 For our Borough using circular economy principles makes perfect sense at all scales of development. This is because we have a high concentration of heritage assets which have been occupied, sometimes by different uses,  and refurbished over a long time. Much of our development takes 
place via changes of use and upgrading existing buildings. Construction traffic has also been an issue in the Borough with its narrow streets  and 
applying circular economy principles to minimise waste can help to reduce this. 
2.19 Considering the local relevance of the circular economy , the RBKC 
Evidence Study on Greening Issues sets out a clear recommendation for the Council  to require all major development s to submit a circular economy 
statement
10.  
2.20 Circular Economy Statements are required at the pre- application/outline 
application (step 1), full planning application submission (step 2 ) and post -
completion (step 3) stages as defined in the Mayor of London’s Circular 
Economy Statement Guidance11. Applicants should refer to this guidance 
to ensure the correct information is provided at each stage.  The 
requirement to undertake and submit the post -completion stage (step 3 ) of 
the circular economy statement will be secured through a planning condition or s106 legal  agreement.  
2.21 While the requirements apply to major developments, all applicants are strongly encouraged to consider circular economy principles  in their 
development schemes. As such, proposals for minor development are

 strongly encouraged to undertake and submit the pre -applicati on stage of 
the circular economy statement (step one).   
2.22 Further guidance is provided in chapter 3 of the Borough’s G reening SPD , 
June 2021. 
Policy G B3:  Whole Life -cycle Carbon   
GB3: Whole Life- cycle Carbon  
A. Applicants for m ajor development proposals are required to 
calculate whole life- cycle carbon emissions and demonstrate 
actions taken to reduce whole life -cycle carbon emissions  
through submi ssion o f a whole life -cycle carbon assessment . 
 
2.23 In addition to the running of a building during its operation, emissions are 
pr
oduced during a building’s construction and later during its maintenance. 
These non-operational greenhouse gas emissions associated with a 
building’s lifecycle  are technically known as embodied emissions. They 
include : a) the emissions that have already happened before a building is 
completed such as during construction and b ) other ‘locked in’ non-
operational emissions associated with subsequent stages of the building lifecycle (maintenance, repair, retrofitting, demolition, and disposal).  
2.24 This is a significant proportion, but such emissions are not covered by current Building Regulations. To ensure that we capture the opportunity to reduce the impact of such sizeable emissions we need a whole life -cycle 
approach as set out in paragraph 9.2.11 of the London Plan 2021. This states, “a whole life- cycle approach is needed to capture… unregulated 
emissions (i.e. those associated with cooking and small appliances)… embodied emissions (i.e. those associated with raw material extraction, manufacture and transport of building materials and construction) and emissions associated with maintenance, repair and replacement as well as dismantling, demolition and eventual material disposal. ”
12 
2.25 Retention and refurbishment of existing buildings over demolition and rebuild provides the greatest opportunity to minimise the embodied carbon emissions of a development scheme. This highlights the significa nt 
crossover between the whole life -cycle carbon approach and the circular 
economy. As such, a circular economy statement should feed into a whole life-cycle carbon assessment.  
2.26 T he whole life- cycle carbon approach also covers carbon emissions  
resulting fr om the operational energy use of a building, including 
 
12 Mayor of London, London Plan 2021 , March 2021 – page 345, paragraph 9.2.11.   
27 
 unregulated operational emissions  (Use Stage - Module B6 as defined in 
the Mayor of London’s Whole Life- Cycle Carbon Assessments 
Guidance13). Unregulated emissions are not covered by Building 
Regulations  and are largely produced by the energy use of plug- in 
appliances. Although developers have limited scope to influence these 
emissions , major development should target LETI Energy In Use 
consumption targets14 within the whole life -cycle carbon assessment  and 
demonstrate improvement measures for unregulated emissions , 
quantify ing the energy use associated with landlord areas and external 
features, such as lighting.  
2.27 Part F of London Plan 2021 Policy SI 2 – Minimising Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions15 requires  referable schemes to follow a nationally recognised 
Whole Life- Cycle Carbon Assessment and demonstrate actions taken to 
reduce life- cycle carbon emissions. The same approach will be followed 
for major developments.  This is supported by the RBKC Evidence S tudy 
on Greening Issues , which  sets out a clear recommendation for the 
Council to require all major development schemes to undertake and 
submit a whole life -cycle carbon assessment16.  
2.28 Whole Life- Cycle Carbon Assessments are required at the pre- application 
(stage 1), full planning application submission (stage 2) and post-
construction (stage 3) stages  as defined in the Mayor of London’s Whole 
Life-Cycle Carbon Assessment s Guidance17. Applicants should refer to 
this guidance to ensure the correct information is provided at each stage 
and compare their schemes against appropriate benchmarks . The 
requirement to undertake and submit the post -construction stage of the 
whole life -cycle carbon assessment will be secured through a planning 
condition or s106 legal agreement.  
2.29 W hile the requirements apply to major developments, all applicants are 
strongly encouraged to consider taking a whole life- cycle approach  in their 
development schemes.  
2.30 Further guidance is provided in C hapter 4 of  the Borough’s Greening SPD ,

heat source for a communal heating system should be selected 
in accordance with the London Plan heating hierarchy19. 
F. Large- scale development  schemes , such as  those in 
Opportunity Areas, must  explore opportunities to deliver heat 
networks and should develop energy masterplans in 
accordance with the London Plan .

Energy and Net Zero Carbon  
2.31
 In October 2019 the Council declared a climate emergency and made a 
commitment to be a carbon neutral Borough by 2040 (10 years sooner than the national 2050 target)
21. The pressing need to decarbonise our 
built e nvironment was also a key issue raised consistently throughout our 
NLPR consultations22.   
2.32 The London Plan establishes a policy framework for development to 
reduce regulated carbon emissions associated with energy demand and 
supply  through the energy hierarchy  (Policy SI 2 – Minimising Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions23). Regulated emissions  are emissions  arising from energy 
used by fixed building services defined in Approved Document Part L of the Building Regulations.  
2.33 London Plan Policy SI 2 set a requirement for major development to be 
net-zero carbon and achieve a 35  percent  on-site reduction in carbon

 emissions  against Part L of the B uilding Regulations 2013. However, the 
GLA published updated energy assessment guidance24 in response to the 
2021 update to Part L of the Building Regulations introduced in June 2022 
as an interim uplift to Building Regulations ahead of the Future Homes and 
Buildings Standard, which is expected to come into force in 2025. The 
GLA’s updated guidance now requires major development to achieve a 
minimum 35 per cent on-site carbon reduction over Part L 2021. Major 
residential schemes are expected to exceed this  minimum target  and 
should aim to meet a 50 percent plus  improvement over Part L 202125. 
The Council will apply any future updates to this guidance/London Plan policy.  
2.34 The Local Plan Viability Study  supports a net zero requirement for major 
development , concluding that requiring all new development to be net zero 
carbon will not undermine development  viability
26. 
Building Design and Reducing Energy Demand 
2.35 Building design can play a critical role in reducing energy demand and is 
the first step in following the principle of the Energy Hierarchy.  The 
specification of the fabric, materials and heating and cool ing systems will 
all have a significant impact on the energy demand of a building. However, 
even more fundamental are some key design decisions which are typically shaped very early on. These are the orientation, glazing ratio and form 
factor s.  
2.36 A building ’s orientation combined with its glazing ratio is key to minimising 
energy demand. In the UK over the course of a year, north facing windows nearly always lead to net heat loss, whereas south facing ones can normally be designed to achieve a net heat gain.  The amount of south 
facing glazing should also be optimised to prevent the risk of summer overheating.  The optimum glazing ratios for the UK climate are up to 25 
per cent glazed on the southern elevation, no more than 20 per cent on the east/west elevations and as little as possible on the northern elevat ion. 
Clearly in the dense built environment of the Borough, the plot may not allow the flexibility to orientate in the most optimum way, but these simple principles should be borne in mind.  
2.37 A building’s fo rm factor is the ratio of its external surface area (i.e. the 
parts of the building exposed to outdoor conditions) to the internal floor area. The greater the ratio, the less efficient the building and the greater the energy demand.  If a building is designed with a poor form factor, then 
the fabric efficie ncy will need to be increased significantly to achieve the 
 
24 Mayor of London, Energy Assessment Guidance, June 2022.  
25 Mayor of London, Energy Assessment Guidance, June 2022, page 6, paragraph 2.2 and Ta ble 1. 
26 RBKC , Local Plan Viability Study , September 2022   
31 
 optimum levels of performance. This will increase costs as more insulation 
and more efficient systems will be required.  Again, often the site cont ext, 
particularly as three- quarters of the Borough is designated as  
conservation areas, will define the building form and massing. However, this is a useful consideration.  
Third Party Standards and Assessments 
2.38 Paragraph 9.2.7 of the London Plan states that ‘Boroughs are encouraged 
to include BREEAM targets in their Local Plans where appropriate .’
27 
BREEAM is applied to non- residential development, and it is increasingly 
common practice to require that schemes achieve an “excellent” rating. 
The Council has applied the BREEAM ‘very good’ standard since the 2015 
Consolidated Local Plan. The Council’s  Evidence Study on Greening 
Issues highlights that there is already strong adoption of the BREEAM “excellent” standard in the Borough and recommends setting a blanket requirement for larger non- residential  schemes
28.  
2.39 Whilst not a requirement, the Council supports the use of appropriate third-
party standards/assessments for residential development including 
Passivhaus, EnerPHit and Energiesprong. In particular EnerPHit and Energiespong standards are suitable for retrofit projects. Detailed guidance on these supported standards is provided in the Council’s  
Greening SPD (see the section entitled voluntary standards within C hapter 
5). 
Carbon Offsetting  
2.40 W e wish to see zero carbon being achieved on-site. However, as a last 
resort,  developments that are unable to achieve the carbon emissions 
reduction targets set out in P olicy GB3 on-site will need to calculate their 
emissions shortfall in tonnes of carbon and offset  this via a cash in lieu 
payment . The value of the payment will be determined by multiplying the 
emissions shortfall by the local cost of carbon over a period of 30 years. Carbon offset funding will then be allocated to projects that will reduce carbon emissions elsewhere in the Borough. Details of how the Council’s  
Carbon Offset Fund contribution will be calculated and administered are 
set out in the P lanning Contributions  SPD. The Council  
 will use the latest  
carbon offset price which is currently set out as £95 per tonne of carbon dioxide for a period of 30 years in the London Plan 2021
29. Contributions 
to the Council’s carbon offset fund will  be secured via a legal agreement.

the Borough, be fully developed and deliverable by the applicant. This will 
be secured via a legal agreement . 
Heat Networks 
2.42 The Mayor of London has identified Heat Network Priority Areas, which can be found on the London Heat Map website
30. These identify where in 
London the heat density is sufficient for heat networks to provide a competitive solution for supplying heat to buildings and consumers
31. The 
whole of the Borough is within a Heat Network Priority Area.  
2.43 At the time of writing, there are no heat networks within  the Borough that 
new development can readily connect to. However, as set out in part B of PLV3, the planned Notting Dale Heat Network will deliver zero- carbon 
heating and hot water to the Lancaster West Estate and to other estates in 
Notting Dale ward. The ambition is that this heat network will be able to 
provide heat to the wider Notting Dale ward and beyond in the future. 
There will be the potential for new development to connect to this network.  
2.44 T he Government published a response to the consultation on its  proposal 
to introduce heat network zoning in England in June 2022
32. This 
consultation is the  first in what is intended to be a multi -year project 
developing the necessary legislation and processes for zoning. T he 
proposals for heat networking zoni ng support  the Council’s requirement for 
new development to be designed with the potential  to connect  to a future 
and/or proposed heat network  as outlined in Policy G B4.  
2.45 Under Part E of Policy GB4 the Borough’s Opportunity Areas – Kensal 
Canalside and Earl’s Court are expected to develop energy masterplans which establish the most effective energy supply  options. This will include 
explor ing opportunities to deliver heat networks .  
Energy Monitoring and Reporting 
2.46 The GLA has also produced ‘Be Seen’ Energy Monitoring Guidance
33, 
which explains how developers and owners of new major developments 
should monitor and report actual operational energy performance to 
comply with London Plan Policy SI 2. In accordance with the ‘ Be Seen’ 
guidance, energy performance data must be reported at the planning application, as -built and in- use stage.  The in -use stage r equires  actual 
operational energy use for at least 5 years to be reported to the GLA via 
the Mayor of London’s ‘ Be seen’ reporting templates . The requirement to

33 Mayor of London, ‘Be Seen’ Energy Monitoring Guidance , September 2021.  33 undertake and submit in -use monitoring will be secured through a planning 
condition or legal agreement.  
2.47 Again, while the requirements apply to major developments, all applicants 
are strongly encouraged to apply the principles of the energy hierarchy to reduce energy demand, incorporate renewable technologies and monitor energy use in their development schemes. Non- major schemes can 
demonstrate how they have considered and applied these principles in an energy strategy/assessment or planning statement.  
2.48 Further guidance is provided in Chapters 4 - 8 of the Borough’s Greening 
SPD, June 2021.  
Third Party Standards and Assessments 
2.49 Paragraph 9.2.7 of the London Plan states that ‘ Boroughs are encouraged 
to include BREEAM targets in their Local Plans where appropriate .’34 
BREEAM is applied to non- residential development,  and it is increasingly 
common practice to require that schemes achieve an “excellent” rating. 
The Council has applied the BREEAM ‘very good’ standard since the 2015 
Consolidated Local Plan. The RBKC Evidence Study on Greening Issues 
highlights  that there is already  strong adoption of the BREEAM “excellen t” 
standard in the Borough and recommends s etting a blanket requirement  
for larger non -residential schemes35.  
2.50 Whilst not a requirement,  the Council supports the use of appropriate third-
party standards /assessments  for residential development  including 
Pass ivhaus, EnerP Hit and Energiesprong. In particular EnerPHit and 
Energiespong standards are suitable for retrofit projects.  Detailed  
guidance on these supported standards is provided in the Council’s  
Greening SPD (see the section entitled  ‘Voluntary Standards’ within 
Chapter 5).  
Energy Strategies/Assessments 
2.51 Energy Strategies/Assessments must be submitted in accordance with Part J of Policy G B4. Applicants  must  follow the Mayor of London’s latest 
Energy Assessment Guidance to satisfy this requirement .

 Polic y GB5: Overheating  
2.52 Climate Change is resulting in higher than historic average temperatures 
and more severe hot weather events  across London. This, combined with 
a growing population, urbanisation and the urban heat island effect, 
means that London b oroughs  must manage heat risk in new 
developments38. This is particularly the case for densely developed 
boroughs  such as Kensington and Chelsea39. 
2.53 Policy SI  4 of the London Plan 2021 defines a cooling hierarchy that major  
development  must follow.  However,  it is applicable to all scales of 
development40. 
2.54 Many aspects of building design can lead to increases in overheating risk, 
including a high proportion of glazing and an increase in the air tightness 
of buildings. Single- aspect dwellings are more difficult to ventilate naturally 
and are more likely to overheat and should be avoided, in line with London 
Plan 2021 Policy D6 – ‘Housing Quality and Standards’41. There are a 
number of low energy measures that can mitigate overheating risk , 
including  solar shading, building orientation and solar -controlled glazing. 
Occupant behaviour will also have an impact on overheating risk.  
2.55 Passive cooling and ventilation should be prioritised, taking into account 
external noise and air quality considerations in determining the most appropr iate solution. The increased use of air conditioning systems is 
harmful  to the environment  as these have significant energy requirements  
and, under conventional operation, expel hot air, thereby adding to the urban heat island effect. If active cooling systems, such as air conditioning

produce.   
2.56 Applicants proposing air  conditioning, be it a single unit or at the whole 
building scale , should carefully consider the harmful environmental impact  
of air conditioning and fully explore passive cooling and ventilation measures/solutions in the first instance. Where a number of air conditioning units are proposed, applicants should consider a whole 
system/ property  passive approach could and implement t he most efficient 
solution possible.  
Overheating Risk Assessment  
2.57 The requirement for overheating assessments to be undertaken for major 
applications in London has been in place since a 2014 GLA guidance document . The C ouncil’s  Evidence Study on Greening Issues states that 
to ensure that new buildings in the Borough are resilient to the future 
impact s of climate change, it is imperative that they are designed to 
mitigate the risk of summer overheating. It is also important  that 
opportunities to reduce overheating risk are considered in schemes seeking to retrofit existing buildings
42.  
2.58 Part O of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations sets out requirements for the mitigation of overheating in new residential development and Approved Document O provides technical guidance on meeting these requirements
43.  
2.59 The Mayor of London’s  energy assessment  guidance sets out how 
applicants should demonstrate that the London Plan cooling hierarchy has 
been followed, that  appropriate overheating risk assessment has been 
undertaken and that the risk of overheating has been mitigated through the incorporation of passive design measures. 
44.  
2.60 The Mayor’s energy assessment  guidance requires applicants to complete 
the Good Homes Alliance (GHA) early stage overheating risk tool45 as 
early in the design process as possible to determine the risk of overheating based on the development’s site-specific parameters . As the 
GHA tool is freely available, t he Council’s  Evidence Study on Greening

SPD, June 2021.  
Policy G B6: Air Quality  
GB6: Air Quality  
A.All development is required to meet the  air qualit y neutral
benchmarks in accordance with the London Plan and
associated guidance47.
B.The following developments  are required to undertake and
submit an Air Quality Assessment :
i. All major development .
ii. All development introducing new population or
receptors in Air Quality Focus Areas  (AQFAs) .
iii. Development that introduces sensitive receptors
(e.g. hospitals, schools, residential dwellings,
medical facilities) into the location.
iv. Development s that include potentially polluting
sources,  uses or combustion- based tec hnologies .
v. Development that is  located within close proximity to
known pollution sources  (such as main roads or
railway lines etc.)  and introduces new population or
sensitive receptors  (such as, but not limited to, any
school or medical facility) .
vi. Developm ent which involve s significant demolition
(total volume of building to be demolished 20, 000m3
or more) or construction.
C.Major developments located in AQFAs , masterplans ,
development briefs and large- scale development proposals
(that are subject to Environmental Impact Assessments) are
required to deliver an ‘Air Quality Positive’ approach.

37 
 D. Applicants  will be required  to install non -combustion energy 
technology where available. Where this technology is not 
available combustion plant must be ultra- low NOx emitting.  
E. Emissions of particles and NO x must be minimised and 
controlled during demolition and construction activities. Dust 
Risk A ssessments  (DRA's)  must be produced to identify 
potential impacts and corresponding mitigation measures, 
including on site monitoring, if required by the Council. The 
Dust Risk Assessment and corresponding mitigation measures 
are to be in line with the Mayor of London’s SPG ‘The Control of 
Dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition’ . All 
impacts must be addressed within  any submitted Air Quality 
Assessment. 
F. All m ajor development and smaller scale  development that 
involve s potentially ‘dusty works’, such as basement 
excavation, soil removal or import , are required to produce a 
Dust Risk Assessment to identify potential impacts and 
appropriate corresponding mitigation measures to protect local 
sensitive receptors from the impact  of dust . 
G. Measures to improve air quality should be implemented on- site, 
however , where it can be demonstrated that on- site provision is 
impractical  or inappropriate, off -site measures to improve local 
air quality may be acceptable (such as financial contributions to 
deliver the actions contained within the Council ’s Air Quality 
Action Plan), provided that equivalent air quality benefits can be 
demonstrated.  
H. Air intake points should be located away from existing and 
potential pollution sources (e.g. busy roads and combustion 
flues). Whilst fossil fuel systems are not supported, where they 
are utilised for back up emergency systems, all combustion 
flues should terminate at least 1 m above the roof height of the 
tallest part of the development and ensure maximum  dispersion 
of pollutants  by having a sufficient efflux velocity . 
2.62 Air pollution causes significant detrimental health, environmental and 
econom
ic impacts. The entire Borough has been declared an Air Quality 
Management Area (AQMA)  as levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and 
particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) exceed the National Air Quality 
Objectives (NAQO ).  
38 
 2.63 T he London Plan identifies  three Air Qualit y Focus Areas (AQFA s) within 
the Borough48. AQFAs are locations that not only exceed the EU annual 
mean limit value for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) but are also locations with high 
human exposure. The three AQFAs located within the Borough are:  
• Earl's Court R oad and War wick R oad (A3220) from Cromwell R oad to 
Cremorne R oad. 
• A315 from Knightsbridge to Kensington High St reet, A4204 Kensington 
Church St reet to Notting Hill Gate .  
• A4 Cromwell Road from Talgarth/Earl ’s Court/Gloucester Road/Thurloe 
Place/Knigh tsbridge.

ir quality is among the top environmental concerns for residents49. The 
pressing need to improve ambient  air quality is recognised in national and 
regional policy. The Government ’s Clean Air Strategy50 as well as  the 
Mayor of  London’s Health Inequalities Strategy51 and the London 
Environment Strategy52 are all clear that improving air quality is a key 
objective.

 2.65 The Council has produced a new five -year Air Quality Action Plan ( 2022-
2027)53, which inclu des a dynamic list of measures to reduce pollution, 
reduce exposure, increase resilience, and influence behaviour  change. It 
has been adopted alongside a new Climate Emergency Action Plan and 
Biodivers ity Action Plan .  
2.66 The Council is also producing an updated Air Quality SPD which will 
provide more detailed guidance on the requirements for improving air quality in new development.  
2.67 All the policies in this  chapter of the Local Plan come together to contribute 
towards improv ing air quality in the Borough. G reen infrastructure, tree 
planting, biodiversity,  sustainable building design, energy efficiency , travel  
and construction site management  all play a role in reducing air pollution 
and improving air quality . 
Air Quality Assessments 
2.68 Air Quality Assessments (AQ As) should identify the potential for air quality 
to impact on, or be a ffected  by, new development and demonstrate how 
these impacts are being appropriately minimised and mitigat ed. IAQM 
Guidance sets out the c riteria for developing air quality assessments.  
Air Quality Neutral and Positive 
2.69 Policy G B6 adopts  the air quality positive and neutral approach set out  in 
the London Plan54. All development proposals are required, at the very 
least, to not make air quality worse and are strongly  encouraged to 
achieve an overall improvement to the local air quality.  
2.70 An Air Quality Neutral development is one that meets, or improves upon, the air quality neutral benchmarks published in guidance from the GLA. The benchmarks set out the maximum allowable emissions of NOx and Particulate Matter based on the size and use class of the proposed 
development. Separate benchmarks are set out for emissions arising from the development and from transport associated with the development. Air 
Quality Neutral applies only to the completed development and does not include impacts arising from construction, which should be separately assessed in the Air Quality Assessment.  
2.71 The requirement for Ai r Quality Neutral should be demonstrated through 
the calculation of site -specific  Transport Emission Benchmarks and 
Building Emission Benchmarks which will be compared against the 
 
53 RBKC, Air Quality Action Plan  – In Summary , A ugust 2022. . 
54 Mayor of London, London Plan 2021 , March 2021 -  Policy SI 1 , page 335 – 336.  
41 
 reference benchmarks published in the GLA Guidance document55. These 
developments will also be required to demonstrate that design measures 
have been incorporated to minimise exposure to poor air quality in accordance with Policy SI 1 of the London Plan
56. 
2.72 Major developments and large masterplan developments are likely to have the greatest potential to implement  methods  and interventions  to improve 
local air quality . Therefore, large- scale development schemes  subject to 
an EIA  (such as the Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area and the Earl ’s 
Court Opportunity Area) and major developments  in the Air Quality Focus 
Areas need to consider an air quality positive  approach in accordance with 
London Plan Policy SI 1(C)
57. 
2.73 Given the ongoing exceedances of air pollutants throughout the Borough, every opportunity must be taken to improve air quality. Demolition and Construction Environmental Management Plans (DCEMPs) and Dust 
Management Plans (DMP s) play a key role in controlling emissions during 
the demolition and construction phases of development . The Council will 
revise our requirements for construction traffic as set out in construction 
traffic management plans over the lifetime of the plan to ensure that electric vehicles are used to mitigate air quality impacts when it is reasonable to do so.  
2.74 T he Council has specific  policies  to take decisive action to reduce 
emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants which is set out in the previous Air Quality and Climate Change Action Plan (2016- 2021)  and the 
new standalone Air Quality Action Plan and Climate Emergency Action Plan, adopted in  2022 .  
2.75 The Council requires air quality neutral benchmarks to be achieved on-site 
in accordance with Part E of Policy SI 1 of the London Plan. However, i f air 
quality neutral benchmarks cannot  be achieved and the C ouncil is 
satisfied that the development has exploited all relevant on- site me asures 
it will consider additional mitigation or offsetting payments  as a last 
measure. The process and calculation for  this are set out in Section 5 of 
the GLA ’s Air Quality  Neutral Planning Support D ocument

 Policy G B7: Construction Management  
GB7: Construction Management  
A. Relevant  development s as specified in the RBKC Code of 
Construction Practice (the Code)  must  minimise demolition and 
construction impact s by complying with the Code59. 
2.76 Given the nature of the Borough with its densely built -up environment  and 
Central London location with narrow streets, issues around noise and air 
quality,  it is important that  construction impacts are carefully managed. 
The Council adopted a revised Code of Construction Practice in April 2019 (the Code)  and this Code, and any future updates must be followed. The 
Code categorises sites based on their size and likely impac ts, and a pre-
commencement planning condition requires that the specified details are 
agreed with the Council’s  Construction Management Team. This applies to 
major developments, basement excavation, full demolition (Category 1 
sites
60); partial demol ition, residential and commercial extensions  
(Category 2 sites61) amongst other projects . Compliance with the Code is 
also required for smaller scale projects such as internal refurbishment work s, using the Control of Pollution Act 1974.  
2.77 The Code always requires Construction Traffic Management Plans (CTMPs) for all Category 1 sites . Some Category 2 sites may also require 
a CTMP particularly if the site is constrained. Further details are set out in the Code.

 Policy G B8: Noise and Vibration 
GB8: Noise and Vibration 
A. Noise and vibration impact must be minimised in dev elopments.  
B. The Council will require a Noise and Vibration Impact 
Assessment to assess the impact of noise and vibration 
generating sources which affect amenity during the construction 
and operational phases of development.  
C. New noise and vibration sensitive developments are required to 
mitigate and protect occupiers against existing sources  of noise 
and vibration in accordance with the Agent of Change Principle. 
D. Noise and vibration sensitive development  must be located in 
the most appropriate location and, wherever located, must be 
protected against existing sources of noise and vibration, 
through careful design, layout and use of materials to ensure 
adequate insulation from sound and vibration. This must be 
achieved while also providing suitable ventilation and thermal 
comfort for future occupants  
E. Developments which fail to meet adopted local noise and 
vibration standards  will be resisted.  
F. Applications for noise and vibration generating development 
and plant (including air conditioning units, ground- and air -
source heat pumps),  that would have an unacceptable noise 
and vibration impact on surrounding amenity , will be resisted.  
2.78 The domi nant sources of  ambient  noise in the B orough are road and rail 
traffic,  and construction activity . Other significant sources are building 
services plant, and operational noise from r estaurants , cafes  and pubs  
(including from outdoor areas such as beer gardens and pavement 
seating), night clubs,  shops and other businesses, and the noise generated 
by the associated deliveries and s ervicing .  
2.79 Vibration is typically  a discrete issue caused by specific , temporary 
construction activities , poorly i nsulated building services equipment,  or the 
movement of underground trains  where there are track condition issues . 
2.80 The evidence on noise and vibration shows that we need a policy to ensure that new noise sensitive development takes account of existing 
sources of noise and vibration, and proposed noise and vibration generating development does not impact on existing amenity.   
2.81 Noise sensitive development includes residential dwellings, schools , care , 
residential and nursing homes , and hospital uses.  The onus of  
44 
 responsibility is on the applicant introducing new noise sensitive 
development/uses to ensure these are protected against existing sources of noise and vibration in accordance with the Agent of Change Principle as it is defined in the NPPF (paragraph 187) and t he London Plan.  
2.82 Issues  of noise and nuisance are considered on a site -by-site basis having 
regard to the proposal, site context and surrounding uses. Owing to the 
specialist nature of interpreting technical acoustic reports and confirming 
compliance with  noise standards, the advice of the Council’s Noise and 
Nuisance Team  will be  sought on all applications where noise and 
vibration is likely to be an issue.  Local standards will reflect and 
incorporate national guidance and industry good practice documents to 
ensure the best protection for our residents.   
 
2.83 Permitted development rights allow a wide range of changes of use 
without the need for planning permission. Where a prior approval process 
allows for the consideration of noise issues, proposals should include acoustic mitigation to ensure unacceptable noise issues are prevented in the future.  
Policy G B9: Odour  
GB9: Odour  
A. Odour generat ing development must address the adverse 
impact of odour through the incorporation of appropriate 
mitigation measures in accordance with the Agent of Change 
Principle, adopting a precautionary approach.  
B. Where significant sources of cooking odours are proposed, 
kitchen extract systems  should terminate above the eaves  
height of the tallest part of the development to ensure the most 
effective  dispersion of smells and fumes.  
2.84 C ertain uses (such as restaurants, cafes and takeaways) can create 
odour s and fumes which can cause nuisance and harm the amenity of 
neighbouring residents  and businesses . It is important that applicant’s for 
uses and/or activities that are likely to create odour ensure that the issue is 
addressed early in the design and planning stage.  
2.85 Where appropriate, the Council  will require odour assessments to make 
sure potential impacts are appropriately mitigated. Where significant sources of odours and fumes are likely, the Council will resist proposals where extraction systems discharging at low -level are planned.   
Developers should consider at an early stage how a system , terminating at 
high level , will be achieved and will need to explore the relevant 
permissions that may be required from building owners.    
45 
 2.86 Permitted  development rights allow a wid e range of changes of use 
without the need for planning permission. As with noise, p roposals  for 
such uses, for example, premises  with hot cooking, will require mitigation 
measures to be incorporated to prevent future unacceptable odour issues 
arising . 
Policy G B10: Light Pollution  
GB10: Light Pollution 
A. Development must be designed to minimise the impact of glare 
and light spill on local residential  amenity  including 
neighbouring properties and communal gardens , biodiversity, 
highway and waterway users .  
2.87 Li ghting helps to keep the public realm accessible, legible and safe after 
dark. Artificial lighting can also help to extend the use of sports facilities f or 
communities. However, light spill and glare can have a negative impact on 
the amenity of residents and can also be a significant source of wasted 
energy.  It is also important to retain subtly  lit and dark spaces to protect 
biodiversity from light spill.  Developments backing on to public or 
communal gardens for example need to be mindful of light pollutio n on 
their setting. Where necessary the agent of change principle may also be 
applicable.  
2.88 Where appropriate, the Council will require lighting assessment s to 
demonstrate compliance with this policy.  The Council  will use the relevant 
professional standards such as those s et out by the Institute of Lighting 
Professionals  as a guide to assess light impacts. Applications for physical 
activity, leisure, sport and/or play facilities should follow Sport England’s Artificial Lighting Guidance

incorporate suitable flood risk measures to account for site 
conditions. These measures must be designed and 
implemented in accordance with Building Regulations, existing 
guidance and the recommendations of the site- specific Flood 
Risk Assessment, the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment and the 
Local Flood Risk Management Strategy. These measures 
should:  
1. Address all flood depths for the design storm event , 
including an appropriate allowance for  climate change66 to 
ensure the development will remain safe during a flood 
event throughout its lifetim e. 
2. Assess the risk of flooding from a breach in the tidal flood 
defences . 
3. Include an emergency plan to consider  access, egress and 
emergency exit routes  and ensure buildings remain safe for 
occupants in case of flooding. 
4. Ensure that  development at basement  or lower ground floor 
level connected to the sewer network is protected from 
sewer flooding through the installation of a suitable pumped 
device.  
5. Ensure that resilience and resistance to flooding are 
addressed.   
6. Prioritise natural flood management and gr een 
infrastructure.  
G. The Council supports the retrofitting of flood resilience and flood 
resistance measures to properties that have experienced 
flooding or are at risk of flooding. 
H. Flood risk measures and flood risk assets must be protected 
and maintained to provide adequate protection and remain 
operational for the lifetime of development.  
I. New development adjacent to the River Thames and Chelsea 
Creek must  be set back by 16m from the Thames flood 
defence, including tie rods and support structures, to enabl e the

 sustainable and cost -effective upgrade of flood defences in line 
with the requirements of the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan.  
2.89 The Bor ough has suffered flooding o n different  occasions. The most 
recent  surface water and sewer flooding in  July 2021 had severe impacts, 
leaving hundreds of residents displaced and over 75 business es, schools 
and community facilities affected. Although the B orough’s  natural  
boundaries are waterways  (the canal to the north and the Thames to the 
south), the most prevalent flood ri sk sources are surfac e water and sewer 
water.  
2.90 Climate change will lead to more intens e storms and increased probability 
of flooding. The combined sewer network  has limited capacity  to drain 
enough water away  to prevent flooding. New development should address 
flood risk and adapt to it by being resilient. New development should also 
reduce flood risk by introducing more and better -quality  green- blue 
infrastructure that can enhance natural drainage67.  
2.91 The Council is the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) with responsibilities 
for managing flooding  from surface water, groundwater and ordinary 
watercourses68. LLFAs are also statutory consultees for surface water 
drainage strategies in major development. The Council adopted a Local 
Flood Risk Management Strategy69 which includes an action plan to 
reduce flood risk locally. This strategy should be considered when developing proposals for new development. Flood Risk Management is also considered across London in Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021).  
Flood Risk Assessments 
2.92 For new development proposals, the risk of flooding to the development and the potential impact of the development on the risk of flooding elsewhere is assessed through Flood Risk Assessments
70. These reports 
should address all flooding sources  relevant to the site71 , both now and in 
the future because of climate change. They should ensure that development  (including basement development) is protected against  flood 
risk and will not lead to increase in the risk of flo oding elsewhere.  
2.93 Flood Risks  Assessments are required for development in Flood Zones  2 
and 3 as defined in our Strategic Flood Ris k Assessment
72 , as well as all 
 
67 Surface water management and sustainable drainage is addressed further in Polic y G12: Surface 
Water Runoff

 sites greater than one hectare in area. Vulnerable development is 
development to which flooding could be particularly dangerous. The Government has identified the vulnerability of different types of land use 
and provided guidance on where it should be located
73. Basements are 
considered highly vulnerable to flooding, so a Flood Ris k Assessment is 
required for any basement development, regardless of the risk of flooding.   
2.94 W ithin Critical Drainage A reas, as defined in the Surface Water 
Management Plan74, Flood Risk Assessments will be required in certain 
circumstances depending on the type and scale of the development. Flood 
Risk Assessments will be required in Critical Drainage Areas  for all 
development below ground or at ground level where there is an increase 
in vulnerability to flooding or an increase in the number of habitable units . 
Most development at first floor level and above may not require a Flood Risk Assessment  in Critical Drainage areas . Other assessments such as 
Sequential
75 and Exception Test76 may be required. The Council has 
produced a Sequential Test of the site allocations to support the development of this Plan.

Flood assets and measures  
2.95 Adequate flood resistance measures, such as drainage pumps, raised 
lightwell walls or flood doors, and flood resilience measures , such as solid 
concrete floors, sump pumps and raised electrical sockets, should be 
identified in the assessment to ensure that both the chance of flooding and the time to recover following a flood is minimised. Any  proposed flood risk 
measures and flood risk assets should be built to a n adequate  standard of 
protection and remain operational  for the lifetime of the development . 
Measures can affect the materials, layout,  and design of buildings so it is 
important that they are thought of early in the development process and  
51 
 shown in plans as part  of planning applications.  Safe access and escape 
routes should also be considered as part of the development process77.  
2.96 I n conservation areas or listed buildings, flood resistance and resilience 
measures are supported where they are sympathetic to the context of the 
property (such as the use of timber flood doors ). Measures are also 
supported where there would be no harm to the character or setting of the 
building (such as internal measures in conservation areas or those not on the princip al elevation). Measures should be designed in line with national 
guidance
78. 
Fluvial and tidal flooding 
2.97 A lthough the B orough is  well protected from river and tidal flooding by the 
Thames Barrier and the formal flood defence s, new development should 
also consider these risks. The Environment Agency Thames Estuary 2100 
Plan (TE2100) plan 79 focuses on the maintenance and raising of the River 
Thames tidal walls and embankments to protect the borough from current 
and future tidal flood risk. Any sites that are recommended suitable for 
development within 16m of the River Thames tidal walls and 
embankments must comply with the TE2100 policy. Proposals adjacent to 
flood defences/river walls must  not have a detrimental impact on the 
integrity of the existing flood defences and should aim to be set back from 
the banks of the River Thames and those defences to allow their 
management, maintenance and raising to protect against current and 
future flood risk.  
2.98 In addition, developers and riparian owners  will have responsibility 
to maintain, enhance, or replace flood defence walls, banks, and flood 
control  structures to provide adequate protection for the lifetime of the 
development, including ensuring adequate provision of space for this in 
the local plan allocation areas. Where possible new flood defences should 
be set back to allow more space for water and to provide space for 
environmental improvement work.   
2.99 Where it is not feasible to raise flood defences to the required levels as 
part of the development applicants must demonstrate how the tidal flood 
defences can be raised to the required Thames Estuary 2100 levels in the 
future. This should be done through submission of plans and cross -
sections of the proposed raising. Where opportunities do exist, developers 
should be encouraged to raise defences to the required heights as part of 
their development.   
2.100 Deve lopment must also demonstrate the provision of improved access to 
existing defences, or where opportunities exist to realign or set back

 defences; this is also in line with Policy SI 12 – Flood risk management (f) 
of the London Plan.  
2.101 Further requirements for development along the Borough’s waterways are 
contained in Policy GB14:  Waterways.  
Policy G B 12 : Sustainable Drainage  
GB12: Sustainable Drainage  
A. Development must contribute towards a reduction in the rate 
and volume of surface water run -off into the combined sewer 
network through measures that promote multifunctional 
benefits.  
Run-off rates 
B. Major development must  achieve greenfield run- off rates and 
minor development must achieve a reduction of 50 per cent  of 
existing run -off rates . Householder applications80 must reduce 
the rate of runoff from the site in a way that is proportionate to 
the scale of development  and reflects the site constraints .  
SuDS design and details 
C. Surface water run- off must be managed as close to its source 
as possible  (following the London Plan SuDS hierarchy) , 
through:  
1. Storing rainwater for later use ( such as rainwater harvesting 
for irrigation or domestic water butts) . 
2. An increase of permeable or porous surfaces  and green 
infrastructure , including trees and urban hedgerows,  to 
enhance natural drainage. 
3. The implementation of green/blue roofs o n all flat roofs 
including extensions.  
4. Recognising opportunities for SuDS to provide other 
environmental benefits.  
5. Prioritising sustainable, natural  green SuDS, over 
engineered  options  (underground attenuation tanks  or 
overs ized pipes ). 
 
80 As defined on the Planning Portal - https://www.planningportal.co.uk/planning/planning -
applications/consent -types/householder -planning- consent    
53 
 6. Supporting water efficiency measures, the reuse of 
greywater and water harvesting measures to reduce water 
demand and sewerage flows . 
D. SuDS proposals should meet national  and local guidance to 
ensure SuDS are adequately designed, built and maintained for 
the lifetime of development.  
E. Impermeable surfaces in gardens and landscaped areas will not 
be permitted as part of a development . 
F. The Council encourages the retrofitting of SuDS in any 
development (even if the proposed development will not have 
drainage implications).  
2.102 The r eduction in the rate and volume of surface water run- off through the 
introduction of permeable surfaces and construction of Sustainable 
Drainage Systems (SuDS) is important as i t will decrease the overall flows 
into the combined sewer system. All development, regardless of size,  
should ensure that there is a net reduction in flows to the combined sewer 
network. Target rates of runoff for development are intentionally ambitious 
in the plan and will be proportionate to the type of  development and scale 
of development. T he Council recognises the constraints of smaller sites  to 
implement SuD S, as well as sites that may have below ground constraints 
such as buried services or easements.  
2.103 T he policy seeks to prioritise green infrastructure and permeable surfacing 
over attenuation tanks, which should only be considered as a last resort  
and will o nly be permitted once all other more sustainable drainage 
options set out in the drainage hierarchy have been considered and justifiably discoun ted. The Greening SPD
81 includes further information 
about the expectations and information required for planning applications .  
2.104 The implementation of green/blue roofs on flat roofs will need to be 
balanced with any plant and energy efficiency meas ures sited on them.  
“Bio-solar”, roofs that combine photovoltaic  panels  with green or blue 
roofs, are now recognised as creating beneficial micro- climates for the 
plants on the roof while also reducing the temperature of the photovoltaics  
panels thereby improving efficiency . Living  roofs  are strongly supported on 
domestic  extensions where these have been shown to be deliverable and 
maintainable.  
2.105 The Council  has produced SuDS guidance82 and support s green and 
sustainable drainage measures as they will provide multiple benefits  other 
than reducing Flood Risk (G B11) such as biodiversity enhancem ents

 (Policy G B17) , amenity benefit s, water quality  improvements  and urban 
heat island effect reduction 83. The Council also encourages the retrofitting 
of SuDS in existing development  not associated with a development 
application.  
Policy G B13: Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure  
GB13: Water and Wastewater Infrastructure 
A. The Council s upport s the provision of strategic water and 
wastewater  infrastructure which will lead to an increased 
security of water supply, a substantial and long- term reduction 
of local sewer flooding,  and an increase in sustainability  
objectives . 
B. The Council will r equire Integrated Water Management 
Strategies  in Opportunity Areas  and s upport s major applications 
taking an integrated approach to water supply and surface 
water management . 
C. Any off-site upgrades to necessary water or  wastewater 
infrastructure must be delivered ahead of  occupation.  
D. All new residential development will be required to meet the 
optional requirement for water efficiency set out in Part G of the 
Building Regulations of 110 litres/person/day.  
E. Commercial development should achieve at least the BREEAM 
“excellent” standard for the ‘Wat 01’ water category or 
equivalent . 
2.106 The C ouncil worked on the Counters Creek project with Thames Water 
from 2008 to 2020 to protect basement properties that had previously 
reported sewer flooding84. During the July 2021 extreme storm event other 
basement properties were impacted by sewer flooding. Therefore, the Council will continue to work with Thames Water, Ofwat and other stakeholders to implement basement flood protection measures and secure measures to increase flooding resilience in the borough in light of the recent extreme storm  events and climate change.    
2.107 As the B orough suffers from lack of sewerage capacity, large-scale 
development in Opportunity Areas should be informed by Integrated Water Management Strategies at an early stage to address capacity issues and 
consider the water cycle holistically.  The reuse of grey water and rainwater 
harvesting should be considered in Integrated Water Management Strategies .

 2.108 Developers  are encouraged to contact  Thames  Water  as early  as possible 
to discuss their development  proposals  and intended delivery  programme 
to assist with identifying  any potential  water  and wastewater  network  
reinforcement  requirements.  Where there is a capacity  constraint  the 
Council  will, where appropriate,  apply  phasing  conditions  to any approval  
to ensure that any necessary infrastructure  upgrades  are delivered ahead 
of the occupation of the relevant  phase of development.   
2.109 Policy SI 5 of the London Plan 2021 aims to protect water supplies and 
resources and improve water infrastructure. The expectation is for major development to minimise the use of mains water to meet the Optional 
Requirement of the Building Regulations (residential development) of 105 litres or less per head per day (excluding allowance of up to five litres for external water consumption). A condition requiring this will be applied to all 
new planning permissions.  For commercial development, the requirement 
is to achieve at least the BREEAM excellent standard for the ‘Wat 01’ water category or equivalent. Measures such as smart metering, water saving, and recycling measures (in new development and retrofit) could 
help to achieve these standards.   
Policy GB14: Waterways 
GB14: Waterways 
A. Relevant development must protect and enhance waterways in 
the Borough. 
B. Require opportunities to be taken to safeguard and improve 
public access to the River Thames , Chelsea Creek  and the 
Grand Union Canal, as well as  promote their use for education, 
tourism, leisure and recreation, health, well -being and transport  
for both passengers and freight . 
C. Development in the Thames Policy Area  and adjacent to the 
flood defences should take account of the actions and 
recommendations of the Thames Strategy – Kew to Chelsea 
and the Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100) Plan. 
D. Resist permanently moored vessels on the River Thames and 
Chelsea Creek. Where new moorings are considered,  
applicants would need to demonstrate that there will be : 
1. No detrimental effect on the river as a transport route.  
2. N o detrimental impact in the River Thames foreshore – 
an important and often protected habitat . 
3. No adver se affect on the character or appearance of 
existing residential moorings .  
56 
 4. Safe access and egress from the mooring can be 
maintained at all times without impacting on, or 
preventing, future raising of the flood defences . 
E. Permit residential moorings on the Grand Union Canal provided 
that: 
1. T here are adequate services for permanently moored 
vessels; and, 
2. other canal users (both water and land based) are not 
adversely affected.  
2.110 The  Grand Union Canal,  runs through the north of the Borough and is a 
valuable public realm asset. It has the potential to provide for improved 
biodiversity as well as amenity space and pedestrian and cycle links should be explored.  
2.111 The River Thames forms the Borough’s  southern boundary and, like the 
Grand Union Canal to the north, the potential of the Thames as a leisure, recreation, biodiversity and transport resource remains underutilised. The River Thames is an important transport route, and with its foreshore and banks is a unique open space with a special environmental character. Permanently moored vessels or the extension of riverside sites into the 
river can have a detrimental effect and reduce the river’s potential as a navigable waterway.  
2.112 There is the need for a coordinated response to managing the links along the River Thames in accordance with London Plan Policy SI 14 Waterways – Strategic Role by taking into account the on- going work of 
the Thames Strategy – Kew to Chelsea and the Thames Estuary 2100 
Plan.  
2.113 Along  the River  Thames  there is the potential  to achieve significant public 
safety, public realm and environmental improvements when undertaking 
flood defence work, including improved public spaces by the riverside, improved access to the river including an enhanced Thames Path, and the potential creation of new intertidal habitats  in line with the Environment  
Agency’s  riverside strategy  approach

Policy G B15: Green Infrastructure 
GB15 : Green Infrastructure 
A. All development should maximise opportunities for 
incorporation of green infrastructure. 
 
Urban Greening Factor  
B. Major residential development is required to achieve an Urban 
Greening Factor score of 0.4.  
C. Major non- residential development is required to achieve an 
Urban Greening Factor score of 0.3. 
2.114 Gre en infrastructure  can be found in many  forms: parks, front and rear 
gardens, grassed areas, street trees, allotments, hedges, green roofs, 
green walls etc. The NPPF definition of green infrastructure also includes blue spaces such as rivers, ponds, canals etc. Green and bl ue 
infrastructure provides multiple benefits , including reducing pollution, 
improving air quality, enhancing biodiversity, screening noise, providing shading, improving natural drainage, reducing flood risk, providing benefits 
to mental and physical health, allowing for locally grown foods and it even has educational and fun values.  
 Urban Greening Factor  
2.115 The Urban Greening Factor (UGF)
88 allows us to understand the quality of 
the green infrastructure proposed in a development. It  was introduced by  
Policy G5 (Urban Greening) of the London Plan. The Council will use  the 
GLA’s recommended target score for major developments89. These are a 
score of 0.4 for developments that are predominantly residential, and a 
score of 0.3 for developments which are predominantly commercial. For 
mixed use developments, the target will be that of the predominant land 
use. In phased developments, each phase should demonstrate compliance on its own. Outline applications should also show compliance

 with final details submitted as part of reserved matters. These target 
scores are a minimum, so higher scores are encouraged. Existing green 
cover retained on-site also counts towards developments meeting the target.  
2.116 T he Council receives a large number of minor planning applications a year 
which could potentially enhance the Borough’s green infrastructure. It is important that green infrastructure is maximised in these developments as they will help reduce flood risk and increase biodiversity, supporting biodiversity net gain.  Applicants should refer to the Mayor of London’s 
Urban Greening for Biodiversity Net Gain: A Design Guide t
o ensure 
proposed green infrastructure also achieves a biodiversity net gain.  
Policy G B 16 : Parks, Gardens and Open Spaces  
GB16 : Parks, Gardens and Open Spaces  
A. The Council will protect, enhance and make the most of 
existing parks, gardens and open spaces, and require new 
high quality outdoor spaces to be provided.  
Existing parks, gardens and open spaces 
B. The following open spaces are protected,  and any loss will 
be resisted:  
1. Metropolitan Open Land;  
2. P ublic open space;  
3. P rivate communal open space;  
4. Local Green Spaces where these are designated in a 
neighbourhood plan or other development plan 
document.  
C. Resist development that has an adverse effect upon the 
environmental and open character, appearance and function 
of Conservation Areas, Metropolitan Open Land or sites 
which are listed within the Register of Parks and Gardens of 
Special Historic Interest in England, or their setting. 
D. Resist development that has an adverse effect on garden 
squares and communal gardens, including proposals for 
basements and rear extensions . 
Provision of new parks, gardens and open spaces  
E. Require major  development to make planning contributions 
towards improving existing or provid ing new publicly  
59 
 accessible open space which is suitable for a range of 
outdoor activities and users of all ages .  
F. Major developments that include residential floorspace will 
be required to provide on- site external play space in 
accordanc e with London Plan Policy S4 , including for under -
fives. 
G. Require all green open space to optimise biodiversity and 
wildlife habitat .  
H. Protect the open spaces surrounding the Royal Hospital 
from inappropriate development both in the landscaped 
areas themselves and in the neighbouring streets.  
I. Support the provision of a new open space at Chelsea 
Embankment  as part of the Thames Tideway Tunnel project.  
J. Suppor t the provision of a meanwhile open space at 
Cremorne Wharf until such a time as it is brought back into 
wharf use for  waste management or waterborne freight 
handling purposes.  
2.117 The benef it of open space is wider than pure aesthetics, it also provides a 
valuable  recreational resource, and contributes to wildlife habitats and 
biodiversity and has  benefits in minimising noise and air pollution. The 
Borough has a long history and tradition of high- quality parks and gardens, 
such as Kensington Gardens, the Physic Garden,  Holland Park, Royal 
Hospital and Ranelagh Gardens  as well as garden squares90. These are 
important features of the Borough that are characteristic of the area and 
enjoyed by residents and visitors.  
2.118 There are also 15 open spaces on England’s Registered Parks and Gardens
91 and four areas of Metropolitan Open Land (MOL): Kensington 
Gardens, Holland Park, Brompton and Kensal Cemeteries. These areas provide attractive breaks in the built -up area, provide open air facilities and 
contain features or landscapes of historic, recreational, or national 
importance. The NPPF provides for the designation of Local Green Spaces (LGSs)
92. The designation of LGSs will be considered in the

green open spaces, and benefits from close proximity of three 
Metropolitan Parks  – Hyde Park, Wormwood Scrubs and Battersea Park . 
Although these Metropolitan Parks are not located within Kensington and 
Chelsea, their position and catchment areas (3.2 km) mean that all the

 Borough’s residents are effectively served by public open space at this 
level in the hierarchy.  On a more local level, much of the Borough, 
particular ly in the south, lies beyond a five minute (400m) walk to the 
nearest public open space96. However , these areas have the most 
extensive provision of private communal garden squares , which play a 
valuable role in compensating for the public open space def iciency.  The 
Thames also serves an open space function as noted in the Waterways 
policy.  The Council will therefore look for opportunities from development 
to provide new or enhance existing open spaces.  
2.120 The Opportunity Area at Earl’s Court provides a key  opportunity to explore 
the potential for new public open space in the Borough. It is only in the largest sites that new publicly accessible open space can be provided. A recent example is the public linear park which , when complete, will stretch  
north-south through the Warwick Road sites. In addition, the Thames 
Tideway Tunnel project will deliver a new open space at Chelsea Embankment as part of their commitment to deliver  new public realm 
along the route of the River. The open space at Chelsea Embankment  
forms part of the Tideway Tunnel development consent order . Otherwise, 
there are limited opportunities to create larger areas of public open space because of the densely buil t-up nature of the Borough. Small areas of 
communal open space serving the development should always be explored. Even small open spaces can have significant health and well -
being benefits. Planning contributions towards the maintenance of the existing public open spaces with appropriate play facilities will be sought while communal external open space which can greatly improve the quality of life of residents, can be designed into quite small schemes.  
2.121 As part of major developments, new family sized accommodation will need to be provided in- line with Policy HO4 . This will necessitate the need to 
provide play facilities on- site depending on the scale of development.  
Where the Council is satisfied that due to compelling reasons such as site 
size the play space cannot be provided on site, financial contributions will 
be sought to provide new or improve nearby play space.  
2.122 Cremorne Wharf is a safeguarded Wharf and is temporarily being used for the delivery of the Thames Tideway Tunnel . When works  to the Thames  
Tideway Tunnel  are complet e in 2025 Cremorne Wharf will have the 
potential to provide additional waste management capacity in the Borough and can be brought back into use.  The London Plan
97 supports temporary 
uses on vacant safeguarded wharves providing that any existing freight -
handling infrastructure is maintained at a specified standard and limited by a temporary permission with a specific end date. The south of the Borough

62 
 has a smaller  number of publicly accessible open spaces98 and the 
creation of new temporary open space at Cremorne Wharf will be 
beneficial. Therefore, the Council supports a temporary open space 
meanwhile use at the Cremorne Wharf until such time the wharf is brought back into use.  
Policy G B17: Biodiversity 
GB17 : Biodiversity 
A. The Council will protect the biodiversity in, and adjacent to, the 
Borough ’s Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs) 
and/or require the provision of significantly  improved habitats to 
attract biodiversity in accordance with national, regional and 
local policy and biodiversity and ecosystem targets . 
B. The Council will protect the biodiversity value of Green 
Corridors and the Blue -Ribbon Network .  Development 
proposals will be required to create opportunities to extend or 
link Green Corridors and the Blue -Ribbon Network.  
C. All major development is required to undertake and submit  a 
site-specific Ecological Impact Assessment .  
D. Relevant development  including major development  must 
achieve a minimum  on-site biodiversity net -gain of 10 per cent  
in accordance with the Environment Act 2021 and forthcoming 
Regulations . 
E. A Biodiversity Net Gain Strategy is required for development 
adjacent to the River Thames . 
2.123 Bio diversity in the B orough is remarkably rich, with 24 Sites of Importance 
for Nature Conservation (SINCs) which include two open waterways (Grand Union Canal and the River Thames, including Chelsea Creek) forming the Blue- Ribbon Network and several linked sites forming Green 
Corridors.  
2.124 The B
 lue-Ribbon Network is London’s strategic network of water spaces  
defined in the London Plan. It includes t he River Thames, canals, tribut ary 
rivers, lakes, reservoirs and docks alongside smaller waterbodies.  Green 
corridors are a sequence of connected green spaces . They  link SINCs to 
create a continuous biodiversity network, allowing animals and plants to 
 
98 RBKC , Open Spaces Audit , January 2022.  
63 
 move between sites and be found further into dense urban areas. These 
also form part of the B orough- wide green infrastructure.  
2.125 The last full audit of the Borough’s biodiversity took place in 2014. T his 
was a partial review of the Boroughs habitats and only included the existing designated S INCs  and a few additional sites . Before this the last 
full survey was undertaken in 2002.  Therefore,  an updated baseline of our 
habitats is needed. The Council aims to commission a full Borough habitat survey, capturing all green spaces , by the end of  2022.  As a result , the 
number of SINCs located in the Borough and/or the boundaries of existing SINCs may change.  
2.126 All development is expected to follow the London Plan mitigation hierarchy
99, which will help to achieve no overall negative impact on 
biodiversity or  achieve a measurable net gain.  
2.127 National policy sets out that planning should provide biodiversity net gains 
where possible100. Delivering net gain is also referred to in the National 
Infrastructure Commission's Design Principles101, National Policy 
Statements  and the National design guide102.  
2.128 The Government's  25 Year Environment Plan103 sets out the aspiration to 
mainstream  biodiversity net gain in the planning system and move towards 
approaches that integrate natural capital benefits.  As such, the 
Environment Act  2021, which was passed into law in November 2021, 
introduces a requirement for all new development to achieve a 10 per cent  
biodiversity net -gain104. Further legislation on the biodiversity net -gain 
requirement is expected in Autumn 2023.  
2.129 Alongside the Environment Act 2021, Natural England launched a  new 
Biodiversity Metric 3105 in July 2021, which provides a means for  
assessing changes in biodiversity value (losses or gains) brought about by development or changes in land management. This metric is supported by DEFRA for the calculation of biodiversity net gain

 Metric107, designed to simplify the process of calculating biodiversity net 
gain on smaller development sites is also available.  
2.1 Applicants will need to provide a minimum 10 per cent  net gain in each 
habitat type that  are independent and cannot be offset by a greater gain 
within a different habitat type. Habitats must be secured for at least 30 
years via a legal agreement. Site that offer significant potential for achieving biodiversity net gain, e.g. currently characterised by very hard landscaping, will be most appropriate to deliver  significantly above the 10 
per cent minimum requirement. This will help support the Council’s response to the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis, and secure long- term positive outcomes for both nature and communities. The Council 
will produce a new SPD on Biodiversity Net Gain to provide more guidance on how to achieve the mandatory components.  
2.2 Where the River Thames  is within the red line boundary, the applicant 
should submit an aquatic biodiversity net gain strategy  to improve 
biodiversity adjacent to this watercourse.  
2.3 The  2022- 2027 (BAP)
108 provides a framework to protect and enhance 
the Borough’s biodiversity resource by improving the quality of the local 
environment  through practical management, habitat creation and 
protection of important wildlife sites. The implementation of the BAP is an important vehicle to improving the biodiversity of the Borough. There are species and habitats identified as priorities that, although may not have legal protection,  are still a material consideration. Applicants should 
ensure they refer to the BAP when considering how to meet the requirements of P olicy G B17.  
Policy G B18: Trees and Landscape  
GB18 : Trees and Landscape  
Protection of Trees 
A. The Council will resist the lo ss of trees of value, based on 
amenity, historic or ecological value.  
B. Exception to criterion A above will be where:  
1. T he tree is dead, dying or dangerous . 
2. T he tree is demonstrated as causing significant damage 
to adjacent structures . 
3. F elling is for reasons of good arboricultural practi ce.

C. Resist development  which results in the damage or loss of trees 
of townscape or amenity value, or gives rise to the threat, 
immediate or long term , which affects the continued well- being 
of such trees.  
 
D. Trees must be adequately protected throughout the course of 
development , including identified Root Protection Areas . 
E. The Council will serve Tree Preservation Orders or attach 
planning conditions to protect trees of townscape or amenity 
value that are under threat from development, inappropriate 
pruning works or removal . 
Loss of Trees  
F. Require where practicable an appropriate replacement of a 
suitable size for any tree that is felled and that safeguarding 
measures are implemented to ensure that the tree has the best 
possible opportunity of reaching maturity.  
G. Where the loss of a tree is unavoidable the Council will require 
that any new tree compliments  existing trees and assists in 
creating new, high quality green areas which deliver amenity 
and biodiversity benefits . 
H. New trees m ust be of a suitable species for the location and be 
compatible with the surrounding landscape and townscape, 
mitigate the effects of climate change and significant rainfall 
events . 
Landscape Design  
I. Require landscape design to:  
1. B e fit for purpose and funct ion. 
2. B e of a high quality and compatible with the surrounding 
landscape, townscape character and mitigate the effects 
of climate change and significant rainfall events .  
3. C learly defined as public or private space. 
4. O ptimise the benefit to wildlife habitat  including 
biodiversity net gain as set out in Policy GB17. 
5. Proactively encourage tree planting where this can 
contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change and 
flood risk . 
2.4 Tr ees are the ultimate carbon capture and storage machines. Like great 
carbon sinks, woods and forests absorb atmospheric carbon and lock it up  
66 
 for centuries  through the process of photosynthesis109. Trees theref ore 
play a critical role in our efforts to mitigat e the impacts of  climate change.  
2.5 The London Environment St rategy110 sets out several ambitions in relation 
to trees and woodlands. These include the protection and management of 
the existing urban forest (a forest or collection of trees that grow within a city, town , or urban area); increasing canopy cover by 10 per cent  of 
current levels; and creating 200 hectares of species -rich woodland by 
2050. These objectives are supported by the London Urban Forest Plan
111 
and the London Plan 2021, which promote planting of trees and woodlands in new developments, and where loss of trees is unavoidable, requires replacement based on the existing value of the trees removed. Policy G B18 is in conformity with th ese objectives . 
2.6 Trees and landscaping play an integral role in improving our health and well-being, combating climate change, acting as a haven for wildlife and 
biodiversity as well as contributing to the Borough’s high- quality character. 
Trees on private open space, such as those located within residential gardens can also contribute to the quality of  the public realm.  On this basis 
the starting point is that their loss will be resisted.  
2.7 New development should be designed not only to positively integrate existing trees and to ensure their long- term survival, but to ensure that 
planting and landscaping complement the proposed features of the development and its intended use, allowing for optimised visual, environmental and physical benefit. Development, particularly during construction and demolition can have a negative impact on the health of trees. As such, protective measures to ensure the trees long term survival will not only be expected but should be implemented and maintained.   
2.8 In view of the value of trees in terms of their amenity, historic or ecological value there are limited grounds as to why  a tree should be felled. Most 
commonly the tree will not have to be removed in its entirety – just the 
limbs causing the potential danger.  Good planning when selecting a tree 
will ensure the long- term function of the site and the trees longevity and 
can avoid unnecessary f elling.  
2.9 On those occasions when a replacement tree is required or where new 
planting or a landscaping scheme is proposed to ensure the planting 
becomes established the Council will use planning conditions to ensure that matters such as tree pits of an adequate size are provided and there is weeding, water and mulching (where appropriate) over the first five years of planting.

 Policy G B19: Waste Management  
GB19 : Waste Management  
A. The Council will ensure that waste is managed in accordance 
with circular ec onomy principles and contributes towards 
London’s recycling and net self -sufficiency targets by:  
Strategic Waste Management  
B. Meeting the Borough’s  London Plan waste apportionment from 
spare capacity including that arising  within  the London Bor ough 
of Hammersmith and Fulham and the Old Oak Park Royal 
Development Corporation.  
 
C. Safeguarding Cremorne Wharf, maximising its use for waste 
management and waterborne freight  handling purposes. Any 
proposals that come forward will need to contribute to m eeting 
the Boroughs waste apportionment target, reflect the 
safeguarded wharf status and the Thames Tideway 
Development Consent Order.  
 
D. The permanent loss of Cremorne Wharf  relating to Thames 
Tideway Tunnel maintenance will require  compensatory waste 
management capacity in another  appropriate location. This 
should in the first instance be within  the Borough, i f this is not 
possible then within the Western Riverside Waste Authority 
area, and if this is not possible within London.  
 
E. Assessing proposals for waste management facilities against 
the criteria in London Plan P olicy SI8, National Planning Policy 
for Waste and Local Plan Policies on air quality, odour and 
noise.  
Waste Management in New Development  
F.  On-site waste management f acilities will be sought as part of 
development at the Kensal Canalside and Earl’s Court  
Opportunity Areas’ to handle waste arising from the new uses 
on the sites  (this could include facilities such as recycling 
facilities , anaerobic digestion and other innovative waste 
management  facilities which are fully enclosed).  
 
G. Require that development proposals make use of the rail and 
the waterway network for the transportation of construction 
waste and other waste where suitable. Development proposals 
should also investigate how to maxim ise the use of sustainable 
modes of transport through the supply chain as part of the 
construction and demolition stages of the development.   
68 
  
H. Require applicants for major developments to prepare and 
implement Circular Economy Statements as required by Poli cy 
GB2 and Site Waste Management Plans.  
 
I. All developments will be expected to recycle construction, 
demolition and excavation (CD&E) waste on- site wherever 
practicable. For all development, 95 per cent of construction 
and demolition waste should be reused, recycled or recovered 
and 95 per cent of  excavation waste should be put to beneficial 
use. Disposal of CD&E waste in landfill should only take place 
where it has been demonstrated that alternative, more 
sustainable disposals are not feasible. This should be 
demonstrated through a Circular Economy Statement and/or a 
Site Waste Management Plan where appropriate.  
J. Some development proposals, such as hot food takeaways, will 
impact on the amenity of an area.  To ensure that there is no 
unacceptable impact from litter on the amenity of an area 
development proposals  are required to: 
1. T o provide details of the measures that will be put in 
place to reduce the litter associated with a proposed 
development .  
2. Provide  one or more litter bins within the surrounding 
area,  as appropriate to meet likely need. 
If necessary,  provide a commitment to undertake litter picking 
and advisory signage in the vicinity of the development site.  
Waste and Recycling Storage 
K. Require all new development to provide innovative internal and 
external well designed, functional and accessible waste and 
recycling (including food) storage space which allows for ease 
of collection in all developments; such facilities must:  
1. Be fully integrated into the wider design from the outset.  
2. Be within each flat / residential unit to allow for short term 
separate storage of recyclable materials, including food 
waste.  
3. Include external dedicated communal storage for waste, 
separated recyclables and food waste, pending its 
collection which is conveniently located for  users and 
waste collection services. Developments should provide 
enough receptacles for different recycling streams  
4. Manage impacts  on amenity including those caused by 
odour, noise and dust.  
5. Be secure, safe and well -lit for users.   
69 
 6. Include appropriate sig nage on what can and cannot be 
recycled and advice on encouraging reusing items  to 
help encourage and provide opportunities to move waste 
up the waste hierarchy .  
7. Set out adequate contingency measures to manage any 
failure of such facilities  in a waste management strategy  
for the development.   
8. Consider  on site composting for all sites with green 
space.  
2.10 P eople, businesses and new development generate waste. The Mayor of 
London wants as much waste as possible to be managed in London and 
encourages a move towards a circular economy to reduce the amount of waste that is produced.  
2.11 The Council has a number of  different roles and responsibilities related to 
waste, this includes the collection and disposal of household waste and some business waste in the Borough.  We also have a planning 
responsibility to ensure there is sufficient waste management capacity to meet the B orough’s identified waste needs.  
Strategic Waste Management  
2.12 Kensington and Chelsea is one of four London boroughs (along with Wandsworth, Hammersm ith and Fulham and Lambeth) for which the 
Western Riverside Waste Authority (WRWA) is the statutory waste disposal authority.  A thirty -year Waste Management Service Agreement 
(WMSA) was established between WRWA and Cory Environmental Ltd to dispose of WRW A waste , commencing in October 2002 and ending in 
2032.  
2.13 Kensington and Chelsea exports all of its municipal/household 
commercial/industrial waste.  Mixed recyclables are taken to the Materials Recycling Facility in Wandsworth to be sorted before their onward journey to be reprocessed into new products.  Segregated recyclate goes on to other facilities within and outside of London, and to Europe. Residual (“black bag”) waste is taken to Cringle Dock Transfer Station in Wandsworth and then transported down r iver to  the Belvedere energy 
recovery facility in the London Borough of Bexley.  
2.14 The Council is required to plan for seven waste streams including Municipal/household, Commercial/industrial and Construction/demolition waste. The London Plan 2021 sets a target of 123,000 tonnes of waste to be managed in the Borough by 2041. A summary of the waste management needs over the plan period is in the table below.

2.15 There are no operating licenced waste facilities in the Borough. Cremorne 
Wharf is a safeguarded Wharf and is temporarily being used for the delivery of the Thames Tideway Tunnel . Following completion of the 
Thames Tideway Tunnel,  part of the site will need to be permanently 
retained for ongoing maintenance access to the Tideway Tunnel. When these works are complet e in 202 5 Cremorne Wharf will have  potential to 
provide additional waste management capacity in the Borough and can be brought back into us e.  
2.16 The London Plan supports temporary uses on vacant safeguarded wharves providing that any existing freight -handling infrastructure is 
maintained at a specified standard and limited by  a temporary permission 
with a specific end date. Policy G B16 supports  a temporary open space 
meanwhile use at the wharf until such time the wharf is brought back into use.   
2.17 The permanent loss of Cremorne Wharf  relating to Thames Tideway 
Tunnel  maintenance will require compensatory waste management 
capacity , to the satisfac tion of the Council,  elsewhere in an appropriate 
location.  This will be achieved through a legal agreement. Compensatory 
provision should first be explored within the B orough. If it cannot be 
provided in the B orough then compensatory provision should be explored 
within the Western Riverside Waste Authority  area, and lastly if no suitable 
capacity can be found in that area the developer will need to explore compensatory provision elsewhere in London. Compensatory provision 
should be at or above the same level of the waste hierarchy of that which is lost and meet or exceed the maximum achievable throughput of the site. 
 
112 Kensington and Chelsea Waste Data Study (February 2022)   
71 
 Table 2.2 below provides the potential waste management capacity of the 
site.  
2.18 The Council ’s Waste Data Study establishes that there is a total waste 
management capacity of 90,600 tonnes per annum that contribute to 
meeting the London Plan Waste apportionment. This capacity is from the safeguarded Cremorne Wharf and exempt sites not requiring an 
Environment Agency Permits to operate. The built -up nature of the 
Borough limits the ability to meet this target. Therefore, the Council will need to work with other London b oroughs  to manage as much waste as 
possible within London.  
2.19 A summary of the capacity gap (in tonnes) is set out in the table below:  
Capacity Source  LACW/C&I (London 
Plan apportionment) 
capacity  C&D capacity  
Cremorne Wharf  23,400 - 
Exempt waste sites 67,200 4,700 
Total Potential Capacity  90,600 4,700 
Capacity Need by 2041 123,000 49,108 
Capacity Gap 32,400 44,408 
Table 2 .2: Wast e management capacity in Kensington and Chelsea  
 
2.20 The Council has worked with London Borough of Hammersmith  and 
Fulham , and the Old Oak and Park Royal  Development Corporation who 
have agree d, through a statement of common ground, to share surplus 
capacity arising within  their area to meet the Borough’s waste 
management needs. The Council will continue to work with W RWA Waste 
Planning Authorities, other London Borough’s and the GLA on cross -
boundary waste issues.  
2.21 The London Plan has targets of 95 percent  reuse/recycling/recovery of 
construction and demolition waste (C&D), and 95 percent  of excavation 
waste should be used for beneficial use.  This is waste arising from the construction, repair, maintenance and demolition of buildings and structures.  A significa nt proportion of C&D waste goes to transfer stations 
outside the Borough before its onward journey.  However, only a small proportion of C&D waste goes direct to landfill  and 60- 70 percent  is sent 
directly to recycling/recovery facilities each year.  
2.22 Management of waste is an important aspect of a Circular Economy . 
Circular Economy Principles should be considered in all scale of development as required by Policy  GB2 . Through the application of 
circular economy principles construction, demolition and municipal waste can be designed out and, or managed sustainably.  Policy G B2 requires   
72 
 Circular Economy  Statements to be submitted for m ajor development 
proposals, Site Waste Management Plans also feed into Circular Economy 
Statements and ensure that these types of  waste are managed in 
accordance with circular economy principles to achieve the London Plan 
targets.  
Waste Management  in New Development  
2.23 Development in the Opportunity Areas at Kensal Canalside  and Earl’s 
Court will have an impact on the Borough’s population, with an increase in the production of waste. It is important that waste management is taken into account in all development to handle waste arisings from the new uses. On- site waste management facilities provide for the management of 
waste on the site at which the waste arises. This is different from facilities for on- site storage or collection of waste. The London Plan, paragraph 
9.8.4, explains that waste is deemed to be managed if waste is used for energy recovery, solid recovered fuel (SRF) or high- quality refuse derived 
fuel (RDF) is produced and destined for energy recovery, waste is sorted or bulked for re- use or for recycling or if it is reused or recycled.  Where 
on-site waste management facilities are not feasible, detailed justification 
will be required including explanation of the options that were considered 
and the reasons they cannot be pursued.  
2.24 London boroughs  are expected to meet a London- wide recycling target of 
65 percent  municipal (household and business) waste by 2030. This is a 
challenging target for the Borough. The Council has agreed a waste 
Reduction and Recycling Plan with the GLA setting out how the C ouncil  
will work towards meeting waste reduction and recycling rate targets.   
This includes working with the Western Riverside Waste Authority (WRWA) and Re London to increase household and business reuse and 
recycling rates.  The current Reduction and Recycling Plan ( RRP) aims to 
achieve 22.44 percent  LACW recycling rate,  when including kerbside 
collection this will increase to 31. 7 percent . Full details of the RRP is 
available on the Mayor ’s Website. An updated RRP is being prepared by 
the Council with new targets to be agreed with the GLA, this will be published on the M ayor’s website once agreed. 
Waste and Recycling Storage 
2.25 Desig n of new developments will be important in improving recycling rates. 
A key element of increasing household waste recycling is to ensure that there is adequate and easily accessible storage space that supports the 
separate collection of dry recyclables , food waste as well as residual 
waste.  
2.26 Poorly designed and located, refuse and recycling storage facilities that do not cater for all can result in unacceptable environments for residents. Innovative approaches to optimise recycling and minimise cross -
contami nation will be strongly encouraged. The Greening SPD, July 2021 
sets out the local standards on how to provide adequate waste storage in new development.   
73 
 Policy G B20: Contaminated Land  
GB20: Contaminated Land 
A. A preliminary risk assessment of contaminated land is required 
at the planning application stage for all major development and 
the following smaller scale sensitive development . 
 
1. Conversions and refurbishments ( excluding smaller 
occupier led refurbishments ) that increase, maintain or 
reduce the number  of units .  
2. Basement developments . 
3. Increase in or reduction of ground levels or extensions of 
garden, yard,  or open space areas . 
4. Extensions on or within 20m of a potentially significant 
source of ground gases or vapours . 
5. Any development that may be impacted by land 
contamination or pose ris ks off -site.  
 
B. Where a satisfactory preliminary risk assessment identifies it is 
necessary, an intrusive site investigation and quantitative risk 
assessment are also required, in some cases at the planning 
application stage. 
 
C. Where the conclusions of a satisfactory  intrusive site 
investigation and quantitative risk assessment identifies it is 
necessary , an options appraisal  and remediation strategy  will 
be required , in all cases to be followed by a verification  report , 
in some cases at the planning application stage. 
 
D. Where less sensitive development may be impacted by land 
contamination or pose risks off -site, they should be addressed 
as set out in criteria A  - C.  
E. The requirements of criteria  A – D must be undertaken in line 
with best practi ce guidance and by a competent  environmental 
specialist  as defined in the Environment Agency  Land 
Contamination Risk Management guidance,  NPPF  and PPG . 
F. Where possible the excavation and disposal of  ground 
materials  offsite and the impor tation of clean soil s should be 
minimised using quantitative risk assessment and sustainable 
onsite remedial techniques . 
G. Development that  proposes potentially contaminating or 
polluting activities, or is located in close proximity to hazardous 
installation s or uses, must incorporate mitigation of  harmful 
effects to people and the environment , and where it is 
considered  necessary, provide mo nitoring of any impact.   
74 
  
H. On Opportunity Area sites and other large sites within the 
Borough, developers should work  collaboratively to consider the 
feasibility of a strategic approach to land remediation where 
feasible.  
Water Pollution 
I. New development must not pose an unacceptable risk to water 
quality . Development which has the potential to adversely 
impact water quality,  in the opinion of the Council or  the 
Environment Agency, will be required to provide appropriate 
monitoring and mitigation to alleviate the risk.  
 
J. Source Protection Zones (SPZs) should be taken into account 
when considering the environmental impact of a development.  
 
C
ontaminated Land 
 
2.27 Whilst , more recently, the B orough has been dominated by residential 
uses and in the distant past was widely farmed, a range of historical and 
current activities have resulted in some land being potentially 
contaminated.  These include larger uses such as gas works, motor works, 
brickworks and railways , as well as  smaller uses such as factories  and 
garages.   Like other urban areas, substances such as lead, asbestos and 
radon are widely present in the environment from a variety of activities 
including transport, development and building maintenance or naturally . 
 
2.28 The Council has powers under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to inspect potential areas of contaminated land in line with its Contaminated Land St rategy . However , the regulations do not usually 
apply to development land. Instead, contaminated land must be addressed 
during development in line with planning policies and guidance.   
 
Water Pollution  
2.29 Development activities may impact surface water and groundwater quality, 
for example through pollution incidents, misconnections or via disused 
wells that have not been decommissioned. S ource Protection Z ones
113, 
designated by the Environment Agency, are particularly vulnerable to pollution, central and southern areas of the Borough are also underlain by 
shallow groundwater.  While largely compromised due to past activities, 
 
113 Environment Agency, Source Protection Zones , July 2018.   
75 
 the Council is actively improving shallow ground water quality by ensuring 
the clean- up of the worst areas of pollution during development.  Actions  to 
address surface water and groundwater pollution should be addressed within Environmental Construction Management Plans and remedial 
strategies.

 3 Homes 
Introduct ion  
3.1 The Borough’s  central London location with its diversity of com munities , 
excellent transport  connections  and access to world class facilities in its 
iconic town centres and museums  make it a very attracti ve place to li ve. 
There is an overwhelming need for all types of homes in the Borough but 
particularly affordable homes  (we call these community homes) . The 
Council has already taken a positive step in producing the Communi t y 
Housing Supplementary Planning Document (SPD)  adopted i n June 2020 
to secure more genuinely affordable “community” homes  in the Borough. 
3.2 O ur  housing polici es need to ensure that we provide the diverse mix of 
types, sizes and tenures of homes to meet th e future housing needs. This 
will include making sure we have up to date policies  based on latest 
evidence in the Local Plan on community  homes, increasing the delivery of 
homes, providing enough homes for the elderly  and recognis ing the role of  
student accommodation, houses in multiple occupation along with other 
types of homes.  
Key facts 
• The median house price in the Borough is  36 times the median income 
level in the Borough making this ratio the highest by far anywhere in 
the country114. This i s eight  times more than the mortgage a bank 
would offer based on incomes115.  
• The Office for National  Statistics (ONS)116 reports that the median 
price paid for homes  at the end of September 2020 was c £1. 3 million  
in the B orough. This is also by far the highest anywhere in the country 
if not globally.  
• By contrast as of 31 July 2022 t here are about 3,090 households  on 
the housing register with 2, 133 in temporary accommodation.  
• F lats and maisonettes compris e 85 per cent  of the Borough’s housing

HO1: Delivery and protection of homes  
Delivery of New Homes 
A. Meet and exceed the London Plan target, which is currently  
4,480 new homes over 10 years  in the Borough by: 
1. Delivering 1,500 homes in the first five years of the Local 
Plan with an annual target of 300 homes . 
2. Delivering 2,980 homes in years six to ten of the Local Plan. 
3. Supporting the delivery of homes on site allocations . 
4. Optimis ing the homes delivered on all sites using a design 
led approach and benchmarking against the nationally 
described housing standards . 
5. Using  a design led approach on small sites .  
6. Resist very large homes by benchmarking floorspace 
against nationally described housing standards . 
Protect existing residential accommodation 
B. Protect existing market residential homes and floorspace 
across the Borough including by not allowing the a malgamation 
of existing self -contained (Class C3 ) homes.  Also see Policy 
HO3 P. protecting affordable homes   
C. Market residential homes and floorspace may be allowed to 
change to other uses : 
1. in higher order town centres, where the loss is to a town 
centre use;  
2. in employment zones, where the loss is to a business use, 
or other use which supports the character and function of 
the zone;  
3. where the proposal is for a very small office; or  
4. where the proposal is for a new social and community use 
which predominantly serves, or  which  provides significant 
benefits, to borough residents; or an arts and cultural use. 
D. Upgrading of existing Houses in Multiple Occupation ( HMOs ) to 
enable safe and good quality HMOs that meet specified Council 
standards is supported and may result in the loss of some HMO 
rooms.  
E. Loss of HMOs  will be resisted  unless in the exceptional  
circumstance that the existing building layout does  not lend  
78 
 itself to be upgrade d to meet the Council’s specified HMO 
standards . 
F. Where the exceptional circumstance is demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Council , conversion to studio flat s will be  
permitted . 
Housing Target  
3.
3 Every Council in the country  needs to have a housing target and is 
required by the Government to deliver this. O ur housing target is set 
through the London Plan process and currently  is 4,480 homes over ten 
years . This includes 1,290 homes from small sites , although as 
acknowledged i n the London Plan paragraph 4.2.3, the relative 
contribution from large and small sites in each borough may fluctuate 
across the target period, providing the overall 10 year borough target is met in a way that is consistent with the policies in the Plan.  
3.4 We will deliver this target with 1,500 homes delivered in the first five years and then stepping up to deliver the remaining  2,980 homes in years six to 
ten. This stepped trajectory of delivering homes is set out below  in Figure 
3.1. We need to plan proactively to deliver this target ; identify ing sites 
where housing can be provided. Figure 3.2 shows the sites which are 
identified for development in the Local Plan. We are allocating sites in this Local Plan which will deliver at least 746 homes  in the first five years . In 
total the site allocations will deliver 5,877 homes  in fifteen years.  
3.5 Despite changes  in the Government’s standard method for calculating 
housing need, the Planning Practice G uidance (PPG) on Housing and 
Economic Needs Assessment
117 is clear that the overall distribution of 
housing need in London lies with the Mayor , as opposed to individual 
boroughs . Therefor e, the Local Plan uses the London Plan target.  
Housing Supply - Stepped Housing Trajectory 
3.6 The Council failed the Housing Delivery Test 2021 with 43 per cent  
homes delivered against the last three years’ targets. The Council has produced a Housing Delivery Test Action Plan, August 2022 which sets out the actions it will take to increase housing supply. We also recognise due to the reasons below a stepped approach to delivery will be suitable in the Borough.  
3.7 A stepped housing trajectory approach recognises that housing delivery may not be evenly distributed annually throughout the plan period. Therefore, it is possible to reflect  housing delivery based on when 
 
117 Paragraph 34, ht tps://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing -and-economic -development -needs -
assessments    
79 
 development is likely to come forward. Such an approach is  supported in 
certain circumstances both in the London Plan (paragraph 4. 1.10)  and the 
PPG (paragraph 21)118 on Housing Supply and Delivery.  
3.8 The unique circumstances that apply in the Borough are the constrained 
and densely built up nature of the Borough which means we have very 
limited large sites . We have undertaken a “call for sites” during plan-
making and are allocating more sites but most  of these new sites are 
small. Our Opportunity Area sites are where most of the housing delivery 
will come from , with the  two sites together capable of delivering a 
minimum of 4,550 homes  in the housing trajectory. Kensal Canalside OA  
will not be delivering homes in the first five years  of the Local Plan and 
Earl’s Court will only deliver 100 homes in this period. While significant 
work has been undertaken by the Council to bring the sites forward, both sites need considerable infrastructure works and to undergo the planning 
process before homes start to be delivered. Other details  including the 
actions we have taken in the Housing Delivery Test Action Plan to increase delivery are all set out in the paper  RBKC Ste pped Housing 
Trajectory, October 2022.   
3.9 Our stepped housing trajectory is presented in Figure 3 .1 and includes our 
site allocations, sites with planning permission, sites to be delivered by the Council as part of its New Homes Delivery Programme, other major sites and a small -sites windfall element. The sites that  are included are set out 
in Appendix 1. The windfall element is included from year four onwards 
and is based on the figure in London Plan Table 4.2. Support for using this 
element is provided in the London Plan (paragraph 4.1.8) and the NPPF 
(paragraph 72). A 20 per cent buffer has been applied in the first -five years 
as this is required where there has been past under -delivery
119. The 
Council no longer protects offices throughout the Borough and takes a more  targeted approach to protect offices  and commercial uses. These 
areas are covered by an Article 4 Direction as shown in Figure 6.2. This approach will further assist in providing greater  certainty to the  small sites 
windfall assumption.  
3.10 The latest  London Plan target applies  from April 2021 a nd so far there has 
been one year of delivery against this target of 448 homes per annum. 
The homes completed in the Borough in 2021- 22 are 191 net homes 
which is below the target by 2 57 homes. This shortfall has been added to 
the first ten  years. While the Council is using a stepped housing target 
figure of 300 homes per annum  for the f irst five years , adding the one year 
of shortfall annualised as 26 homes over ten years and a 20 per cent 
buffer means delivery is calculated against 391 homes per annum in the 
first five years . Target figures are then adjusted to reduce the buffer that is 
 
118 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing -supply -and-delive ry#calculating  
119 NPPF (paragraph 74)  80 moved forward from  later in t he plan period but it i ncludes t he shortfall 
figure. In to tal, delivery i s sho wn against 4,737 homes over t en years. Thi s 
figure is derived by adding the 25 7 home shortfall for 2021/22 to the 4,480 
homes London Plan housing target over the next ten years. The Council is 
able to demonstr ate a 5.6 years housing land supply  and is seeking to 
confirm its five year housing land supply as par t of the Local Plan 
examination. Over a 10 year period the Council will meet and exceed the 
10 year London P lan target. 
Optimising
 sites  
3.11 Making effective use of land is a long standing national policy. We must  
ensure that  each site that comes forward is optimised in its  potential for 
housing delivery  using a design led approach . This would make the best 
use of our sites and deliver more homes without compromising on quality. 
This has to be done taking into account the context of the site and impact 
on the built and natural environment around it as well as our housing needs including the bedroom  size mix . Further guidance will emerge in the 
London Planning Guidance (LPG) on Optimising site capacity: A d esign-
led approach which is currently in a draft form.  
3.12 The nationally described minimum space standards as adopted in the London Plan must be used as a benchmark for the size of homes. This 
ensures that we are optimising sites and meeting these space standards but not going above them so significantly as to create very large homes. The provision of super prime large homes has an impact on the ability of the Borough to meet its housing supply targets as the sites for these 191163614

81 
 developments are often capable of accommodating a much larger number 
of smaller units. Very large homes are also linked to the issue of ‘buy to leave’ housing which are bought for investment rather than living and are 
not conducive to creating thriving communities for all which is the ambition of this Plan.  
Protecting existing homes 
3.13 Loss of existing homes reduces housing stock which is counter intuitive to the overwhelming need for new homes in the Borough. This also counts against our net housing delivery, making it even harder to meet our 
housing target. As mentioned in paragraph 3.6 above, the Council  failed 
the Government’s 2021 Housing Delivery test published in January 2022 , 
with only 4 3 per cent  homes completed against our housing targets over 
the last three years. Since September 2019 we have allowed two homes 
to be merged together to form a bigger single home as long as the new home is no more than 170 sq m . Even with these limits, there has  been a 
sustained loss of  homes to amalgamations as evident  in planning 
permissions resulting in the loss of 25 homes since the policy was 
adopted. Given only 51 new homes were delivered in 2018/19, this is still a significant number.  It may still be possible to amalgamate a maximum of 
two homes to one to bring them up to standard but only if  the existing 
homes are substandard. This would be where both the existing homes to 
be amalgamated are significantly below the minimum size standards for 
even a studio and without adequate natural daylight and ventilation.   
3.14 The Council commissioned a stock condition survey
120 in 2020 which 
estimates 8,244 houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) in the Borough. 
However, there are only 157 licensed HMOs, of the scale that require planning permission to change to and from the use as a single residential dwelling . Smaller HMOs  which have three to six residents sharing facilities 
are in planning U se Class C4 and do not need planning permission to 
change to a self -containe d home.  HMOs play a role in the private rented 
sector in providing low cost accommodation. These can be accessed by a range of key workers as well as by professionals on middle incom e 
earnings but not sufficient  to enter home ownership
121. 
3.15 Our policy has been to allow conversion of houses in multiple occupation 
(HMOs) to studio flats, but we continue to lose HMOs in this way . Since 
April 2019, the Borough has lost 228 rooms in HMOs. The Government calculates this loss as 127 self -contained homes based on a ratio of 1 to 
1.8. Therefore, we need to limit HMO losses in the Local Plan.

82 
 3.16 However, the Council supports bringing a substandard HMO up to 
standard so it is safe and provides a good quality accommodation. The 
Counc il has adopted its own minimum HMO standards which should be 
followed122. This would enable the HMO use to continue and while there 
may be a loss of some rooms th e HMO standard would be improved 
overall.   
3.17 There may be exceptional circumstance where the C ouncil will allow an 
HMO to be converted to studio flats. This is described in Part F of Policy 
HO1. Studio flats while more expensive than an HMO still offer relatively low cost accommodation enabling those at lower end of income levels to access housing in the private market in the Borough.  
3.18 A limited number of situations  are set out in Policy HO1 in which loss  of 
private homes  will be permitted in order to achieve the vision of  this Plan. 
Arts and cultural uses referred to in Policy HO1  include museums, art 
galleries, exhibition spaces, theatre, cinemas and studios. S mall offices, 
are defined in the glossary . Policy HO3 Community Housing protects 
affordable homes and floorspace.

Policy H O2: Small Sites  
HO2: Small Sites 
A.The development of new homes on small sites is  supported as
follows:
1. Optimising small sites  using a design led approach in the
Borough to help meet and exceed our overall housing
target  including the small  sites component  as set out in
the London Plan.
2. Well- designed upward extensions creating new homes
that respond sensitively to the surrounding context .84 3. Well- designed homes on small infill sites  which do not
harm identified local views  and gaps .
4. Self- build homes including the provi sion of serviced
plots123 subject to availability .
Small  sites  
3.19 Small sites are those which have an area less than 0.25 hectares. The 
London Plan housing target includes 1,290 homes in the next ten years 
from small sites . Given the nature of the Borough, most of our homes are 
delivered on small sites. This is evident in our site allocations , many of 
which are classed as small sites.  Our design policies set out in C hapter 6 
provide the policy context for all developments to respond sensit ively 
amongst other issues to their context , ensure good living conditions  for 
occupiers of new development and their neighbours  and deliver high 
quality design. The Council will use a design led approach to optimise 
such sites. Further guidance will emerge in the London Planning Guidance 
(LPG) o n Optimising site capacity: A design- led approach which is 
currently in a draft form.  
Upward extensions 
3.20 In recent years  the Government has introduced permitted development 
rights124  outside of conservation areas to create new homes by extending 
upwards  in commercial and mixed use and residential buildings . These are 
subject to a number of conditions  and instead of planning permission are 
subject to a prior approval process. The policy supports the creation of new homes by extending upwards in and out of conservation areas. 
Where planning permission is required,  this will be subject to other 
relevant policies including Policy CD11 Existing Buildings – Roof 
Alterations/Additi onal Storeys.  
Small infill developments 
3.21 While the Borough is very densely built up, there may be occasional sites 
that co me forward for i nfill deve lopment. R ecent exa mples hav e included 
small disus ed garages . Subject  to other r elevant pol icies i ncluding on 
conservation and design or ot her impacts su ch as on flooding or t ransport 
the policy supports well-d esigned new homes on such sites.  
123 As defined in the Housing and Planning Act 2016  85 3.22 Self-build or custom build homes are generally those designed and built 
with the first owner’s input as a home that they intend t o live in. Our Local 
Housing Needs Assessment (LHNA), January 2022 concludes that 
demand in the Borough is low for self-build and custom build homes 
compared to, for example the pressing demand for affordable homes . 
There are also no suitable plots of land that have been identified in the 
Borough for this purpose.  
3.23 However, the Council recognises that self -build homes have the potential 
to make a small contribution to increasing the supply  of housing in the 
Borough, coming forward on small sites which may not be of interest to  
larger developers. The Council will therefore offer support to such 
proposals where they are meeting local housing need subject to meeting 
the requirements of the development plan as a whole.  Such proposals if  
designed to a high qualit y can have a positive impact on the overall 
townscape.  
Policy H O3: Community Housing 
HO3: Community Housing 
Floorspace threshold 
A.The Council will seek to maximise the provision of community
housing in the Borough and require community housing from
devel opment (including extensions)  creating new  residential
floorspace of  650 sq m GIA or more.
B.Where the floorspace threshold in criterion A has  been met or
exceeded, communi ty housing requirements will apply
collectively to all gross  residential floorspace (GIA)  on-site.
Percentage of Community Housing 
C.Community housing will be required to be delivered through the
threshold approach as set out in the London Plan including
using the fast track route where community housing at the level
set out in criterion D is  provided.
D.Developments should provide at  least 35 per cent community
housing by floorspace on-site on private land and at least  50
per cent  by floorspace on- site on public land where there is no
portfolio agreement with the Mayor .
E.To benefit from the fas t track route of the London Plan
threshold approach, as set out in criterion D. above,  all other
policy requirements for community housing mu st also be met.Self-build and custom build homes    
86 
 F. All exception s to criterion D. will be require d to follow the  a 
viability tested route as set out in the London Plan to 
demonstrate the maximum deliverable amount of community 
housing through an open book financial viability assessment.   
G. An open book financial viability assessment will always  be 
required for redevelopment involving  any existing affordable 
homes, off -site provision of community homes or payment in 
lieu of community housing. 
On-site delivery of C ommunity Housing  
H. Community housing must be provided on- site unless 
exceptional circumstances justified by robust evidence support s 
the provision off- site within the Borough or by providing a 
payment in lieu. 
I. Where ‘off site’ community housing is proposed the application 
must be concurrently made with the main planning application. 
The two applications must be linked through a s106 agreement 
or unilateral undertaking. 
J. To calculate payment in lie u of community housing,  two 
financial viability assessments  comparing the residual land 
value must be undertaken. First reflecting the maximum 
reasonable amount of community housing provision on- site and 
the second assuming 100 per cent market housing. The 
difference between the two financial viability assessments  
should be the payment.  
Tenure mix of Community Housing 
K. Community housing must be provided as 70 per cent social rent 
(preferred) or London Affordable Rent in some limited  
circumstances such as where grant funding is available to 
deliver additional homes . 
L. The remaining 30 per cent community housing must be 
provi ded as intermediate with the preferred product being 
London Living Rent at the lowest ward level in the Borough.  
Other intermediate product s including home ownership 
products can be provided as long as they cater to a variety of 
income levels well below the maximum household income caps. 
M. In North Kensington125, where with a 30 per cent discount from 
market value of homes the price cap for First Homes is not 
 
125 Corresponding to the boundary of CIL Zone F (North Kensington) and H (Kensal Canalside)   
87 
 exceeded , the 30 per cent intermediate provision of community 
housing should be 25 per cent First Homes and 5 per cent 
London Living Rent.  
Design and community space 
N. Community housing and market housing should be integrated in 
any development and have the same external appearance.  
O. Community and marke t housing should have equivalent 
amenity in relation to factors including views, siting, daylight, 
noise and proximity to open space, play space, community 
facilities and shops.  
P. Schemes that include 100 or more community homes must 
carry out a community space audit and include community 
space within the development proposal where there is a 
demonstrable need.  
Protect Existing Affordable Housing 
Q. Resist the net loss of affordable housing floorspace and homes 
throughout the B orough including by not allowing the 
amalgamation of existing self -contained (Class C3) homes . 
R. Where it is accepted that affordable housing is to be re -
provided, it must be  provided on a like for like basis i.e. s ocial 
rent with social rent and intermediate with intermediate.  
S. All scheme s involving demolition and replacement of affordable 
housing will be required to follow  the viability tested route and 
should seek to provide an uplift in affordable housing in addition 
to the replacement of affordable housing floorspace in 
accordance with the London Plan.   
Community Housing  
3.
24 ‘Community Housing’ is the term we use to describe genuinely affordable 
housing in the Borough. This essentially comprises social rent, London Affordable Rent and London Living Rents at the lowest ward level which is currently Notting Dale ward. Other forms of affordable housing as defined in the NPPF can also be provided as long as they cater to a wide range of income levels below the maximum cap of £90,000 for intermediate homes. 
The Council adopted a Community Ho using SPD i
n June 2020 which 
provides more guidance on this  subject .  
3.25 The re is a pressing need for more community homes in the Borough, as of 
31 July 2022 there were 3,089 households  on the Council’s housing 
register and 2,133 households  in temporary accommodation. Our LHNA  
88 
 has identified a net annual need for community housing of 1,018 homes 
per annum. This is more than double our housing target.  
3.26 Whilst the scale of need per annum cannot be accommodated given the limited capacity in the Borough, it demonstrates that we must ensure that we require the maximum reasonable amount of community homes from our sites.   
Floorspace threshold 
3.27 National policy says we should be requiring community homes from housin g development only where 10 or more homes are being created or 
the site area is 0.5 hectares or more (major development). However, t he 
Local Plan’s Viability Study , September  2022, shows that community 
housing requirements can be viably applied to smaller  sites of 500 sq m 
residential floorspace or more.  
3.28 The Council has been operating a policy since September 2019 where 
community housing r equirement s apply to residential developments of 650 
sq m or more. Given the intention of national policy it is conside red that the 
trigger point is retained at 650 sq m  as this floorspace is closer to the 
Government’s 10 homes threshold. Given that much of our development comes from small sites and we have very high land values in the Borough and a pressing need for more community homes , we will continue to seek 
community housing from small scale residential developments  of this 
scale.  
3.29 New residential floorspace in Policy HO 3 will generally  be in addition to 
existing residential floorspace. However, where existing residential  
floorspace is subject to substantial demolition this will also be considered 
new floorspace. In all cases where the trigger floorspace of 650 sq m of new residential is reached community housing will be calculated collectively on all gross residential floorspace (GIA) on the site.  
Percentage of Community H ousing 
3.30 We recognise the London Plan strategic target of 50 per  cent of all new 
homes delivered across London to be genuinely affordable. We will require 
a minimum of 35 per cent affordable housing by floorspace on private land 
and 50 per cent on public land. A threshold approach as set out in London 
Plan Policy H5 will be used.  
3.31 For public sector land a portfolio approach as set out in the London Plan (paragraph 4.4.7) may be used. This is where p ublic sector landowners 
with an agreement with the Mayor may provide 50 per cent affordable housing across a portfolio of sites provided at least 35 per cent affordable housing is provided on each site, with the required affordable housing tenure split on the initial 35 per cent.  To help meet our community housing 
needs the Council will require all sites being relied upon to meet the 50 per 
cent target within the portfolio to be in the Borough.   
89 
 3.32 Where the proportion of community homes on- site is  less than the 
minimum policy requirement an open book financial viability  assessment 
must be submitted. This must be undertaken using the recommended 
approach in the National Planning Policy Guidance on Viability and 
guidance set out by the Mayor of London. It must use standardised inputs. The viability appraisal  must demonstra te that the development is 
maximising the community housing that can be provided  on the site. This 
must  demonstrate that the maximum reasonable amount is being 
provided.  
3.33 Given the overwhelming need for community housing in the Borough, a financial viabilit y assessment will always be required for schemes  involving 
demolition of existing community housing.   
3.34 N ational policy
126 provides an incentive for brownfield development on 
sites containing vacant buildings , generally known as vacant building 
credit . It requires that the developer should be offered a financial credit 
equivalent to the existing gross floorspace of relevant vacant buildings when the local planning authority calculates any affordable housing contribution which will be sought. Since the introduction of this policy the Council  has followed the approach that vacant building credit does not 
apply to development in the Borough. This is based on a number of factors including that all sites in the Borough are brownfield and given the exceptionally high land values a further incentive is not required to bring 
forward development. Furthermore, developments that claim vacant building credit then cannot claim a reduction in CIL for an “in- use” building.  
3.35 Where a develop er claims vacant building credit they will have to go 
through a viability tested route with the floorspace not subject to the 
vacant building credit expected to maximise community housing. 
On-site delivery of C ommunity Housing  
3.36 The policy is to require community housing on- site. An exception can only 
be made where the off -site location is in the Borough in the vicinity of the 
development site and the off -site provision can secure a signific antly 
higher provision of community housing.   
3.37 A payment in lieu will only be acceptable as a last resort  where it is 
physically impracticable to provide the community housing on- site or it is 
inappropriate in terms of the numbers that can be provided on-si te. 
3.38 Where a payment in lieu is secured, it must  be calculated by deducting the 
residual land value of a scheme that incorporates a viable percentage of affordable housing on -site from a scheme that assumes 100 per cent  
private housing i.e. the difference in residual land value between the two schemes is the value of the payment in lieu. This approach allows for the 
 
126 NPPF paragraph 64   
90 
 most accurate assessment of the value of the payment in lieu based on 
the principle that  the provision of a monetary contribution or provision on-
site is  financially neutral for the developer.  
Tenure Mix 
3.39 Within community housing the Council  prefer s three housing products that  
are considered genuinely affordable and enable us to meet identified 
needs. These are social rent ; London Affordable Rent (similar rent levels 
to social rents but set by the Mayor of London) ; and intermediate rent s set 
at London Living Rents at the lowest ward level (currently Notting Dale).  
London Living Rent (LLR) , is a type of affordable housing for middle -
income Londoners. These rents are published by the Mayor of London for each London ward annually.  Actual rents for these three products are 
shown in Figure 3.3 below.  
 
Figure 3 .3: Weekly rental levels for community housing products  by bedroom size 
of homes  
3.40 The LHNA, January 2022 shows a need for 1,018 community homes per 
annum. Of these the need for social rent remains high and together with London Affordable Rent is 65  per cent with 35 per cent need for 
intermediate homes.   
3.41 The Council’s preference is for 70 per cent of the community homes to be delivered as social rent. However, some London Affordable Rent may be secured on schemes that are referred to the Mayor. If grant funding from the Mayor is being used to provide additional homes over and above policy requirements, London Affordable Rent may also be suitable. Further £156£165£174£183

 guidance is available in the Council’s Community Housing SPD, June 
2020.  
3.42 The Government has  introduced a new requirement that 25 per cent of the 
affordable housing provision should be First Homes127 . First Homes are 
an affordable home ownership product with a price cap of £420,000 and a 
requirement of a 30 per cent  discount from market value. Due to the high 
land values in large parts of the Borough this product could only b e 
provided in North Kensi ngton128 to meet the price cap.

 3.43 The LHNA shows that  27 per cent  of those in need may have an income to 
be able to afford First Homes . However, only 14 per cent  require a one or 
two bedroom  home which would be suitable as a first home and within the 
price cap while the remainder  need a larger home.  On this basis  we do not 
consider that  there is an overwhelming need for First Homes, not enough 
to require bigger discounts of 40 per cent  or 50 per cent  to enable more 
expensive properties to fall within the bracket of a First Home. In any event 
discounts even higher than 50 per cent  will be needed in many parts of the 
Borough due to extremely  high land values  which does not comply with 
national policy .   
3.44 While  the household income cap for First Homes is  £90,000, to meet 
housing needs , community homes should cater to a variety of income 
levels below this cap.  
3.45 The Council supports housing for k ey workers as defined in the Council’s 
Key Worker and Intermediate Housing Policy 2022. Key worker housing is considered to be a subset of intermediate housing and the Council’s Key Worker and Intermediate Housing Policy 2022 will be used to allocate intermediate homes to key workers by the housing authority.   
3.46 In addition to these products, the Council supports community led housing
129 development where a local community group or organisation 
owns, manages or stewards their homes. There are many different types of community led housing but generally in such schemes  the housing 
development must be of true benefit for the local community or a specific group of people. Such benefits should be legally protected in perpetuity.   
Design and community space 
3.47 The affordable and market housing should be designed so that it is not possible to identify either tenure. This is to ensure all residents enjoy the same high standards of design and to aid integration of the various communities living within a housing developm ent. 
3.48 Significant housing development proposing 100 or more new community homes should carry out a community space audit and provide evidence of the needs of the community in that area. The audit should include an assessment of existing provision. This must  be both quantitative and 
qualitative. It should include an assessment of the quality and the nature 
of existing facilities as well as their distribution. If a shortfall is identified and there is a demonstrable need, it should be included as part of the development proposals. Early consultation with the community  living in the 
area will form an essential element of collating this evidence. Proposals which include community space based on the above evidence should also 
 
129 https://www.communityledhomes.org.uk/  C ommunity -led homes is a partnership between the 
Condeferation of Co- operative housing, Locality, the National Community Land Trust Network and 
UK Cohousing   
93 
 include sustainable and long- term management plans for these uses. 
Facilities should be designed so that they are accessible to all sections of 
the community (including older and disabled people). Provision should be proportionate to the scale of the proposal  and must reflect the nature of 
the of the development itself.  
Protect Existing Affordable Housing 
3.49 The Council will resist the net loss of any form of affordable housing both in floorspace and units across the Borough. If the existing use is considered affordable, this policy will apply regardless of whether the existing use was secured with or without a legal agreement or covenant.  
Policy H O4: Housing Size and Standards 
HO4: Housing Size and Standards  
A. New residential developments  must include a mix of types and 
sizes of homes to reflect the varying local needs of  the 
Borough, taking into account the characteristics of the site, and 
current evidence in relation to housing need.  
B. All new homes must be designed to be accessible. To ensure 
this: 
1. 90 per cent of new homes must meet Building Regul ations 
requirement to be M4 (2) “ accessible and adaptable 
dwellings ”. 
2. A minimum of 10 per cent of new homes must meet 
Building Regulations requirement M4(3) “ wheelchair user 
dwellings ”. 
C. All new homes must me et the minimum space standards as set 
out in the Nationally Described Space Standards.  
Bedr oom  size mix  
3.50 Residential  development s should provide a mix of homes of an 
appropriate size to cater to the identified local need.  The LHNA, January 
2022 identifies a different bedroom  size mix for market and commu nity 
housing. The interpretation of this policy will need to be informed by and 
reflect the latest LHNA.  
3.51 The LHNA  January 2022 concludes that the Borough is likely to see a 7 
per cent  decrease, in households with children. By 2040 the Borough will 
have lost 13 per cent of its younger households. At the same time,  it find s 
that there is a high level of under occupancy around 44 per cent particularly (though not exclusively) in the owner -occupied sector. 
Therefore, to address this high level of under occupancy in the market  
94 
 sector the LHNA  identifies  a much higher need for smaller homes.  Where 
two bedroom homes are provided these should be for four persons which 
allows the flexibility to accommodate young families. This would be help in 
providing homes suitable for families as a proactive step to encourage 
more families and stem the loss of this cohort from the Borough.  The 
bedroom size requirement  is set out in Table 3.1.  
 
Dwelling Size  Percentage  
1 Bedroom  35 per cent  
2 Bedroom  40 per cent  
3 Bedroom  20 per cent  
4+ Bedroom  5 per cent  
Table 3.1 : Market Housing breakdown of need by bedroom size  
3.52 For Community Housing the LHNA , January 2022 has found that the 
greatest need i s for two bedroom homes followed by three bedroom 
homes. It should be noted that the need based on the Council’s housing register and waiting list is for the two bedroom homes to be for four 
persons so they can also cater for  families.  It should also be noted that 
although small, there is a demand for  homes from families with a child on 
the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for three bedroom homes, where it 
may be inappropriate for the child to share a bedroom with a sibling . The 
need for community housing is set out in Table 3.2.  
 
Dwelling Size  Percentage  
1 Bedroom  16 per cent  
2 Bedroom  44 per cent  
3 Bedroom  28 per cent  
4+ Bedroom  12 per cent  
Table 3.2: Community Housing breakdown of need by bedroom size  
Accessible Homes  
3.53 The latest data on people with a physical disability is from the 2011 
Census. The Strategic Housing Market Assessment, 2015 found that 12 
per cent of the population is likely to have some form of long- term health 
problem or disability. Given the increase expected in older population alongside this need all new homes should be designed to be accessible.  
3.54 The relevant category of Building Regulations will be secured through planning condition and each dwelling will need to meet all the  
95 
 requirements set out in Part M of the Building Regulations. Approved 
Document Part M provides clear guidance on how to meet these requirements . The policy applies  only to buildings covered by Part M 
Volume 1 of the Building Regulations  which are new  build  homes  and 
homes undergoing material alteration. It does  not therefore apply to other 
forms of housing that are not C3 such as student housing o r HMOs.    
3.55 To ensure that all potential residents have choice within a development, the requirement for M4(3) wheelchair user dwellings applies to all tenures. M4 (3) ‘wheelchair user dwellings’, distinguishes between homes  designed 
to be wheelchair access ible, (ready to be used by a wheelchair user on 
completion M4 (3) (b)) or wheelchair adaptable (easily adaptable for a 
wheelchair user  M4 (3) (a)). The PPG
130 states that Local Plan policies for 
wheelchair accessible homes M4 (3) (b) should only be applied to those dwellings where the local authority is responsible for allocating or nominating a person to live in that dwelling, otherwise they should be 
adaptable. The Council prefers these dwellings to be located no higher 
than the fourth  floor based on the local needs of those on the Council’s 
housing register.  
Space Standards  
3.56 To ensure minimum space standards the Council will use the nationally described space standards as set out in the London Plan Policy D6 and 
Table 3.1. It should be noted that  the London Plan requires  a minimum 
floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75 per cent  of the gross internal 
area. This is in response to the unique heat island effect of London and the distinct density and flatted nature of most of its residential development.  
3.57 As the space standards are a minimum , developments are encouraged to 
exceed the standards but not so significantly as to create very large homes and hinder the optimisation of sites as set out in Policy HO1.

 Policy H O5: Specialist Housing  
HO5: Specialist Housing 
Housing for Older People 
A. Support the provision of older people’s housing including new 
extra care, sheltered housing and care homes  to meet identified 
local needs . 
B. Protect  existing older people’s housing unless the loss is to 
improve substandard accommodation or increase the existing 
provision on the site. 
C. With the exception of care homes, extra care , sheltered housing 
and any other specialist form of older people’s housing, 
development must provide on- site community (affordable) 
housing as per the requirements  set out in Policy HO3.  
D. The community housing will be required for occupation by older 
people in the same form as the specialist housing scheme i.e. 
community  extra care or community sheltered housing at price 
bands to be agreed with the Council . 
E. Older people’s accommodation should be of the highest design 
quality including accessibility, dementia friendly , quality of care 
to be provided and adequate storage for mobility scooters . 
Supported Housing 
F. Resist the loss of supported housing which meets identified 
community needs.  
G. Resist the loss of residential hostels except where the site w ill 
be used for another form of affordable housing.  
Housing for Older People 
3.58 The LHNA, January 2022 shows that number of residents aged 65 or more 
is projected to increase by 13,911 by 2040, a 54 per cent  increase; within 
this, an 82 per cent  increase for those aged 75 or more and a 131 per cent  
increase for those aged 85 or over is projected. T he LHNA also shows that 
during the Plan period the need is highest for private leasehold sheltered 
housing. An indicative annual borough benchmark for specialist older 
persons housing is set out in Table 4.3 of the London Plan. The figure for 
Kensington and Chelsea is 85 units per annum.  
3.59 Anecdotally , many older people would like to live independently in their 
own home for as long as possible. Some of this need can be met through  
97 
 independent living by providing new homes with higher accessibility 
standards  as set out in Policy HO4.  
3.60 Government guidance on housing for older and disabled people131 
(paragraph 10) specifies the types of specialist older people’s housing. This includes retirement living or sheltered housing, extra care housing or housing with care and residential care homes including homes suitable for 
people with dementia and nursing homes.  
3.61 Our LHNA is showing a 68 per cent increase in older people with mobility 
difficulties and a 47 per cent increase in the people with dementia from 2021 to 2040. Therefore, older people’s housing should be designed to 
provide accessible homes. They should include design features suitable 
for those with dementia. This should be within the home but also in 
outdoor spaces that are part of the development.  The Healthy Building 
Note 08- 02. Dementia- friendly Health and Social Care Environments 
(Department of Health, 2015) should be referred to.  
3.62 The requirement to provide community extra care housing does not apply 
to care homes . The characteristics of a care home are set out in some 
detail in the London Plan and we w ill use th ose criteria to determine if a 
development is a care home.   
3.63 The LHNA is showing a significant need for additional social rent extra 
care and sheltered housing in the Borough. Therefore, in developments involvin g these products community housing of the same type will be 
sought using Policy HO3.  
3.64 Specialist housing of older people must be designed with  disabled car 
parking spaces i n line with  London Plan Policy T6.1 (G and H) .  Proposals 
should deliver suitable levels of safe storage and charging facilities for residents’ mobility scooters and pick up and drop off facilities close to the principal entrance suitable for taxis, minibuses and ambulances.  
Supported Housing 
3.65 The Council will support the provision of housing to meet specialist needs where the proposed accommodation would meet an identified need as set out in the LHNA i.e. accommodation for homeless families, victims of 
domestic abuse,  and other identified groups.  
3.66 The LHNA also suggests that the number of rough sleepers has increased 
in recent years and is projected to continue increasing. A lack of available stock for women and families facing domestic abuse was also identified.  
3.67 Residential hostels within the B orough have traditionally catered f or 
groups such as the single homeless, people who are mentally ill or 
 
131 https://www.gov.uk / guidance/housing -for-older -and-disabled -people#accessible- and-adaptable-
housing   
98 
 disabled and women who have experienced domestic abuse. It is 
recognised that the traditional type of hostel may, in some cases, no 
longer be the most appropriate form of accommodation and therefore the change of a hostel site to a different form of affordable housing may be appropriate.  
Policy H O6: Other housing products  
HO6: Other Housing Products  
Build to Rent  
A. Build to Rent  schemes are not supported in the Borough. 
However, if such a scheme comes forward,  the Council  will 
seek community housing as London Affordable Rents and 
London Living Rents as per Policy HO3 . 
Co-living  
B. Co-living schemes are not supported in the Borough. Where 
such a scheme comes forward, the Council will seek 35 per 
cent on- site community housing.  A 1.8 ratio132 will be applied to 
the proportion of community co- living rooms to calculate the 
equivalent number of self-contained on- site community housing.  
Student Housing 
C. Protect existing s tudent accommodation unless the change is to 
another type of low cost shared living accommodation such as 
HMOs.  
D. Require PBSA to have an undertaking with a specified higher 
education provider (s) that specifies that the accommodation will 
be occupied by students of that  higher education provider(s) . 
E. Maximum level of accommodation will be secured as affordable 
student accommodation as defined in the London Plan H 15. 
Policy HO3 will be applied to such developments  to secure the 
affordable element . 
 
 
 
132 As per the Government’s Housing Delivery Test rule book for non self -contained accommodation 
or any update if the ratio is changed   
99 
 Build to Rent  
3.68 P roducts such as Build to Rent Homes  are relatively new . These homes 
are generally provided at a large scale and managed by a single 
commercial provider.  
3.69 In accordance with the NPPG on Build to Rent our LHNA, January 2022 has considered the need for those who wish to rent. The private rented sector (PRS) houses 44 per cent  of residents
133, and is  the largest single 
sector in the B orough. There are some indications that the PRS has now 
plateaued. The LHNA  concludes that  Build to Rent is unlikely to contribute 
to me eting the housing needs of key workers and others requiri ng 
affordable housing. Therefore, the product appears to fail on all counts as 
a suitable planning policy priority for the authority.  
3.70 While we do not support Build to Rent schemes, where they do come forward , they can viably provide 35 per cent discounted market rent 
housing, let at rents not exceeding London Affordable Rents and London Living Rents
134. The PPG on Build to Rent states that 20 per cent  is 
generally a suitable benchmark for the affordable element  on such 
schemes. B y default this would be in the form  of affordable private rent 
homes (to be maintained in perpetuity).  However, the PPG  does provide 
that a different proportion can be set in L ocal Plans if it is justified by 
evidence in the LHNA. Furthermore it also allows for other types of affordable housing. Therefore, based on our pressing need for community 
homes as set out in the LHNA the Council will require 35 per cent community homes  at London Affordable Rent or London Living Rent at 
Notting Dale ward levels.  These units should be maintained at these 
tenures in perpetuity.  
Co-living  
3.71 Co-living or large scale shared living developments provide a housing 
option for single person households who cannot afford to or choose not to 
live in self -contained homes or HMOs. The accommodation is more akin to 
small hotel rooms with shared amenities such as cinemas, gym, cafes, swimming pools, laundry and co- working spaces amongst other  facilities . 
The developments are run commercially . 
3.72 The rent levels are high with existing schemes in London starting at £1,087 per month to £1,647 per month depending on the size of the room 
or studio. These rents  could not be afforded by most  keyworkers
135. 
 
133 RBKC LHNA, January 2022 
134 RBKC Viability Study, September 2022  
135 LHNA, January 2022   
100 
 Therefore, the product is not supported in the Borough as it does not link 
with any identified local  housing need. 
3.73 However, where such a scheme comes forward , based on viability 
evidence,  we will seek 35 per cent of the accommodation as community 
housing. As co -living rooms will not be suitable to house those in need of 
community housing, a ratio of 1.8 will be applied to the number of rooms to 
convert these to an equivalent number of self -contained homes which 
should then be provided on- site. In-line wit h London Plan Policy H16, 
where on- site provision is not possible, a payment -in-lieu can be provided 
although on-site provision of self -contained C3 community housing will be 
preferred. The payment in lieu will be calculated using the approach of 
requiring two financial viability assessments as set out in Policy HO3.  
3.74 The quality of the schemes should meet the criteria set out in London Plan Policy H16.  
Student Housing 
3.75 There is a much larger need for self -contained homes in the Borough and 
the LHNA does not identify additional purpose- built student 
accommodation (PBSA)  as a priority local housing need. The o nly 
University -specific PBSA in the Borough is owned by Imperial College who 
indicate they have additional needs. Given the expansion of Imperial College into White City , much of their student accommodation needs may  
have already  been met  and any existing student accommodation must be 
protected.  
3.76 Where we do get proposals for new PBSA, we would expect these to be linked to a specified higher education provider in the Borough. There should be a nomination agreement for occupation by students of that the higher education provider.  
3.77 W e will seek the maximum amount possible as affordable student 
accommodation from PBSA schemes and will use our Local Plan Policy  
HO3 and London Plan Policy H15 to secure this.  
Policy HO7: Estate Renewal  
HO7: Estate Renewal  
A. For estate renewal proposals , retaining existing buildings and 
improving them in- line with Circular Economy principles must  be 
considered first before proposals for any redevelopment.  
B. Where the redevelopment of social rented housing estates is 
proposed, a compelling case must be demonstrated that the 
long term benefits outweigh the considerable uncertainty and 
disruption such projects will cause.   
101 
 C. The maximum deliverable amount of affordable housing  must 
be provided  bearing in mind the criteria in E . and F . below . 
Such schemes must always submit a financial viability 
assessment . 
D. Estate renewal schemes must be co- designed with the 
community.  
E. There must be no net loss of existing social rented provision or 
other community housing tenures in terms of units and 
floorspa ce. Existing tenures of homes must be replaced with 
like for like tenure i.e. social rent with social rent.  
F. Estate renewal  schemes must robustly demonstrate 
consideration to provide additional community housing provision 
both in terms of floorspace and units on- site. 
G. A guarantee must be provided that all existing tenants have an 
opportunity of a home that meets their needs, with those 
wishing to stay in the neighbourhood being able to do so.  
H. The mix of house sizes for the re-p rovided social rented 
housing will be determined by the housing needs of the tenants 
of the estate and by the housing needs of the B orough, at the 
time that an application is submitted.  
I. Recognise that cross subsidy between estates may also be 
required where proposals involve several estates. The 
principles set out above for one estate would be applied to two 
or more estates, taken as a whole.  
3.78 Fol lowing the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the Council made a commitment to 
end estate regeneration on Council owned estates. There is no change to 
this commitment. The Council has committed  to a major seven year 
programme of investment  in its homes,  including upgrading the housing 
stock to improve energy performance and other  environmental 
improvements. This includes the Notting Dale District Heating Network referred to in Chapter  9. 
3.79 Policy HO7 can  help guide developments on housing estates owned by 
registered providers.  Policy G1 as set out in C hapter 4 highlights the 
importance of using Circular E conomy principles in all major 
developments. This approach can have a dual benefit of not just in 
mitigating Climate Change but also a social benefit in causing the least 
disruption to people who live on the estates.  
3.80 In-line with the London Plan Policy H8, the Council will require viability 
appraisals for proposals that include demolition and replacement of affordable housing. The minimum expectation is re- provision of the 
existing floorspace and units and that the Council will seek an uplift in the  
102 
 provision. For the purposes of this policy, existing affordable housing 
floorspace includes both occupied and vacant floorspace regardless of the 
current condition of the stock.  
3.81 The Council puts co- designing at the heart of engagement with residents . 
It would like registered providers to use the same principles on est ates 
under their ownership. The Mayor of London supports mandatory ballots
136 for estate regeneration and has made it a condition where his 
funding is sought.  
3.82 The Mayor’s Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration137 provides 
detailed guidance for assessing suita ble approaches to estate 
regeneration. In particular, only once the objectives of an estate regeneration scheme have been formulated in consultation with residents, should the physical interventions required to achieve them be c onsidered.  
3.83 A housing needs assessment of the estate will be required to enable an understanding of the needs to meet the requirements of criterion G. and H. 
of the policy.  
Policy H O8: Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation 
HO8: Gypsies and Traveller Accommodati on 
A. The Council will work closely with London Borough of 
Hammersmith and Fulham ( LBHF ), the Mayor of London and 
TfL to protect, improve and, where necessary and if possible, 
increase the capacity of the existing Travellers’ site at Stable 
Way. Additional Si tes for temporary or permanent use and any 
applications at Stable Way should meet National Planning 
Policy for Traveller Sites and the following criteria .  
1. The site can provide for a satisfactory arrangement of 
pitches, permanent buildings and open space;  
2. Appropriate essential services including water and waste 
disposal can be provided;  
3. Use of the site would have an acceptable effect on the 
safety and amenity of occupiers of adjoining land;  
4. Use of the site would be acceptable in terms of amenity, 
safety and local environment for future and / or current 
Gypsy and Traveller occupiers;

 5. The use could be supported by adequate physical and social 
infrastructure (such as access to education, health, welfare 
and employment) in the locality.  
6. The site is not located in an area at high risk of flooding, 
including functional floodplains.   
3.84 The C ouncil has a duty under the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites to 
assess the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers as their 
needs differ greatly from those who live in traditional housing. This is 
reiterated in London Plan Policy H14.  The London Plan (paragraph 4.14.2)  
commits the GLA to undertak ing a London wide Gypsy and Traveller needs 
assessment, but in the absence of this it requires London boroughs to update their needs assessments as part of the development plan process.  
3.85 There is one Gypsy and Traveller site in the Borough at Stable Way which is a permanent site and comprises a total of 19 available authorised pitches.  
3.86 The Joint Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs Assessment (2016) concluded that there will be a requirement for three additional pitches between 2015 and 2020, and nine in total across RBKC and LBHF between 2015 and 2030.  
3.87 We will need to do further work together with London Borough of  
Hammersmith an d Fulham on establishing and meeting the need of our 
Gypsy and Traveller community living in Stable Way.  An update of the 
Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Needs is underway, following the completion of this, the two Council’s will actively explore options  on how 
provision can be made in accordance with Policy HO8.

 4 Conservation and Design 
Introduction 
4.1 The Borough’s built environment has  a large variety of distinctive and 
diverse areas, each of which has its own unique identity and character.  It 
includes areas  such as the museum quarter at South Kensington, the 
bustling street markets of Portobello and the shopping area of 
Knightsbridge.  
4.2 The Borough has a large number of historic buildings and townscapes. 
Over 4,000 buildings are ‘listed’ and there are over 100 garden squares. Conservation areas cover more than 73 per cent of the Borough. The built environment of traditional houses is interspersed with corner shops, pubs, studios and small pockets of mixed uses, and there are also t wentieth 
century buildings which continue the legacy of high quality design. Our listed buildings and conservation areas contribute to local distinctiveness both within the Borough and London as a whole.  
4.3 Our design polic ies seek to maintain and enhance the Borough’s  character 
and distinctiveness . However, we must also ensure that the much- needed 
new development in the Borough is built to exemplary design standards, using the design- led approach to establish the most appropriate capacity 
and form of development for each site
138.  
4.4 There is inevitable pressure for change upon the built environment to meet today’s needs and changing lifestyles. These  changes are not only 
physical, they can put pressure on the finely grained mix of uses that are 
inters persed in our residential  areas. The mixed uses in the Borough are 
an integral part of its character. Even small changes of use can be 
damaging to character and should be carefully considered as part of the 
response to context that informs development proposals.  
4.5 Maintaining and improving the mixed- use and architectural character, 
quality, inclusivity  and setting of the Borough’s exceptional built 
environment is vital. Our policies seek to drive up the quality of design to improve the quality  of the Borough’s  built environment.  The local context , 
understood as the buildings and their settings, including the public realm,  
is of primary  importance in achieving this. 
4.6 To ensure continued design excellence in the Borough, the Council has appointed a Quality Review Panel. The purpose of the panel is to review 
key planning proposals and offer support and advice to the Council’s 
 
138 As per Policy D3 of the London Plan   
105 
 officers and planning application committees, and for planning applicants 
to deliver high quality architecture within the Bor ough.  
Key facts 
• Nearly three quarters of the Borough is within a Conservation Area . 
• There are over 4,000 listed buildings in the Borough which have special architectural or historic interest and are protected by law . 
• Building heights in the Borough vary wi dely but there are few very tall 
buildings

 Policy CD1 Context and character  
CD1 Context and character  
A. Deve lopment is required to be beautiful , respect ing the existing 
context, character and appearance, including historic 
characteristics. Where relevant, development should:  
 
1. Enhance the quality and character of buildings . 
2. Improve connectivity and function, including making it 
inclusive for all . 
B. Opportunities should be taken to contribute positively and 
respond to the local townscape through its architecture and 
urban form  by: 
1. Addressing matters such as scale, height, bulk, mass  and 
proportion. 
2. Considering how the plot width, building lines, street form, 
rhythm, and roofscape responds to the context . 
3. Considering how  materials are used and how they relate to 
any historic fabric . 
4. Considering vistas, views, gaps, and open space, including 
how planting, trees and greenery contribute to their 
character . 
C. Require the density of development to be optimised using a 
design- led approach in a manner sensitive to context . 
D. Require riverside and canalside development to enhance the 
waterside character and setting, including opening up views 
and securing access to the waterway . 
E. Require development within the Thames Policy Area to protect 
and improve the strategic importance and iconic role that the 
Thames plays in London. 
F. Require a comprehensive approach to site layout and design 
including adjacent sites where these are suitable for 
redevelopment, resisting schemes which prejudice future 
development potential and/or quality . 
G. Carefully consider how development in backland sites is 
integrated into the existing urban structure, includi ng: 
1. ensuring vehicular and pedestrian access is properly 
integrated into the surrounding street network .  
108 
 2. that the scale and massing respect the hierarchy of the 
existing urban block so as to enhance the character of the 
area. 
H. Ensure that, in carrying out alterations and extensions, the 
characteristics of the type of building, such as mews, villa s, 
terrace or mansion block, be preserved and enhanced. 
I. Resist the demolition of, and inappropriate alterations and 
extensions to, artists’ studios . 
J. For strategic development sites, such as the Borough ’s 
Opportunity Areas, require development to relate positively to 
existing context, even where development is at a scale that it 
can set a new character in itself.  
4.7 The Bor ough’s townscape is unique in its high quality, finely grained, 
historic built environment and has a strong sense of identity and character. 
The character and appearance of the Borough is highly valued, locally, 
nationally and internationally. Its townscape is a good example of how high- density development can be completely compatible with a high-
quality environment. It is home to considerable residential densities but surprisingly modest building scales.  
4.8 The Borough’s townscape is rich in detail. Paying attention to detail, as 
well as to  matters such as  height, form and mass, is therefore important in 
ensuring new high- quality development.  The character of the B orough is 
also greatly enhanced by mature trees and landscape, including within private gardens. They are important not only on environmental grounds, as in relation to P olicies G B15 and G B16, but they provide visual amenity and 
form a setting for the architecture and public realm.  
4.9 It is important that the Council resists design that fails to take t he 
opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, including opportunities to enhance and create new green infrastructure. Assessment of planning applications is therefore 
based on whether  the development will assist in creating high quality, 
beautiful , and sustainable buildings and places as supported in national 
policy.   
4.10 Development proposals should therefore heed their local context; analysing and responding to context is important to achieving good design. The extent of the relevant context depends on the development.  
4.11 The design of a development  must take into account the character and 
scale of the area, the need to foster good design and the Council’s and community’s aspirations for the site and area. The density of the development should be the outcome of this design process , rather than 
the starting point , using the design- led approach as set out in Policy HO1  
109 
 A (4) .  Where appropriate, the Council will consider utilising co- design 
processes to guide development.  
4.12 A comprehensive approach should be taken towards site redevelopment 
to make the best use of the land and improve the appearance of the area. 
Where appropriate this should include an assessment of the development potential of nearby sites to avoid piecemeal and uncoordinated development.  
4.13 The B orough is a highly desirable place to live, shown by  some of  the 
highest average home prices in England
139. These residential land values 
have led to strong pressure to change buildings to residential use. The principle of change of use from commercial or social uses is addressed in policies in the Business and Social Infrastructure chapters of the Local Plan. However, the part that use plays in character must not be 
overlooked.  The distinctive character of many buildings comes from their 
use, their role in the community, the facilities they provide and the activity they generate as much as their physical appearance. A building’s use can therefore contribute to the character of a conservation area and to a sense of place.  
Specific conditions  
4.14 Developments close to the River Thames and the Grand Union Canal 
should have regard to and enhance the special character and distinctiveness of those areas. In conformity with the London Plan parts of the Borough adjoining the River Thames have been designated as the Thames Policy Area, to ensure developments in this area reflect the strategic role of the Thames in London.  
4.15 Backland sites - sites surrounded by other development with limited or no 
street frontage - may be difficult integrate into the surrounding context, and 
so need to be carefully planned to be successful in design terms.  
4.16 The many mews streets in the Borough form an integral part of the 19th 
Century pattern of development of this area of London. They are an effective form of development for making good use of the space within larger perimeter blocks. Indeed, the mews as a feature of the townscape is one of the factors that distinguish London from other cities. While their 
origin as stable blocks for large houses means that they are generally of  
modest design, they do have a distinct character based on their 
consistency, simplicity and unity.  
4.17 Artists’ studios emerged in the middle of the nineteenth century and there are significant numbers of them in the Borough, making an important contribution to its particular character and appearance. A distinctive 
building type, they are characterised by a number of features including 
 
139 As shown in the UK Price Index   
110 
 large windows and expanses of studio space behind. They exist in many 
forms from grand studio houses commissioned by famous artists of the day, to more modest and utilitarian speculatively built groups. There is considerable pressure upon them  both for the introduction of new uses 
and the carrying out of alterations. This pressure is threatening the essence and character of thes e studios and consequently, undermining 
the artistic traditions of the Borough.  
Policy CD2: Design quality, character and growth  
CD2: Design quality, character and growth 
A. Require all development to meet the highest standards of urban 
design and architectural quality, taking opportunities to improve 
the local area, its character , and the way it functions.  
B. The Council  will require all development to be:  
1. Functional - fit for purpose. 
2. Legible  - easy to understand in its role and relationship to its 
context, and contributing to easy wayfinding and navigation.   
3. Robust - well built, easy to maintain and adaptable to 
changes of use, lifestyle, demography and climate. 
4. Attractive - pleasing in its composition, materials and 
craftsmanship. 
5. Locally distinctive - responding well to its context . 
6. Sustainable - incorporating principles for sustainable design 
from the outset, considering the use of resources, including 
energy, as well as the whole life cycle of the building(s) . 
7. Inclusive - accessible to all . 
8. Secure - designi ng out crime.  
C. An appropriate architectural response is required, on a site by -
site basis, to:  
1. The context of the site, including in terms of scale, height, 
mass and bulk . 
2. The building’s proposed design, form and use. 
3. Whether the townscape is of uniform or varied character . 
4. Its relationship with the public realm around it . 
 
4.18 C hapter 12 of the NPPF recognises that one of the fundamental 
requirements of the planning and development process is to deliver well designed, high quality buildings and spaces. It puts  the onus on local 
authorities to proactively support high quality new development by working  
111 
 with local communities to identify the type, scale and character of new 
buildings that will be acceptable across the Borough.  
4.19 The distinctive townscapes of the Borough vary from large buildings such as the museums and mansion blocks , through terraces, villas, squares  
and crescents , to the relative modesty of the mews, often with a wide 
variety of architectural styles within relatively small areas. These 
characteri stics, together with the garden squares, give a unique character 
to the Borough. In some places there are striking juxtapositions of buildings of different scales. In this context, a sensitive, contextual approach to the architectural design of new buildings, and to extensions 
and modifications to existing buildings will be required. This should be to a high quality, with very high quality expected within conservation areas.  
4.20 The quality  of the architecture,  richness in detailing and material ity of the  
buildings  is the essence of what makes  the Borough ’s built environment 
beautiful . These are the elements that are widely appreciated by residents 
and visitors. New development that builds on this local distinctiveness , 
uses  the local palette and is attractive will contribute to maintaining and 
enhancing the local character, ensuring it will be appreciated in the future just as much as  the existing local  heritage does today . Many historic areas 
of the Borough are characterised by traditional material s such as brick and 
stone. F ully glazed facades  are uncharacteristic of the Borough and are 
unlikely to deliver on the quality and character Policy CD2 is seeking. Excessive use of glazing on facades  is likely to contribute to overheating 
through solar gain, which developments must minimise in accordance with 
Policy GB5.  
4.21 The Borough’s design policies put the preservation of its character at their heart. About three quarters of the Borough lies within conservation areas. Our Conservation Area Appraisals provide comprehensive reviews of character in these areas and identify the positive features which should be conserved, as well as negative features which indicate scope for future enhancements.  
4.22 Moreover, our Conservation Area Management Plans provide proposals for preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of the conservation area, and also provide design advice as appropriate.  
4.23 The Borough’s Character Study provides high- level character guidance for 
development across the Borough, with a focus on those parts of the Borough which lie outside of conservation areas. It identifies key typologies for development which may be suitable in parts of the Borough and identifies the areas where there may be opportunities for good growth. The Council will develop further guidance for those areas to drive design quality, engaging the community to ensure local views, needs and aspirations are captured and embedded in guidance so that they can inform developers’ proposals. Development should demonstrate that local, regional and national design guidance has been taken on board when 
developing design proposals.   
112 
 4.24 Design proposals should be based on a thorough analysis and 
understanding of the site’s setting, context and character, including careful consideration of building lines, roof lines and setbacks, streetscape rhythm and landscape features, history and use.  
4.25 Where the quality of an area has been eroded, whether or not in a conservation area, the Council will take steps to ensure that new development and other schemes such as streetscape works improve the environment.  
Policy CD3: Heritage Assets – Conservation Areas 
CD3: Heritage Assets - C onservation Areas  
A. Require development to preserve or enhance the character or 
appearance of the conservation area and thereby protect the 
special architectural or historic interest of the area and its 
setting. 
B. Development in conservation areas should take opportunities to 
enhance the character and appearance of its setting. 
C. Resist the change of use of any building where the current use 
contri butes to the character of the surrounding conservation 
area and to its sense of place unless it can be demonstrated 
that there is no demand, and it is not viable to maintain it within 
its current use, or a new use is identified which will also 
contribute positively to the sense of place.  
D. Resist de molition in conservation areas unless it can be 
demonstrated that:  
1. In the case of substantial harm or loss to the significance of 
the conservation area it is necessary to achieve substantial 
public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss . 
2. In the case of less than substantial harm to the significance 
of the conservation area, that the public benefits outweigh 
that harm . 
3. The building or part of the building or structure makes no 
positive contribution to the character  or appearance of the 
area. 
E. Require full planning applications in conservation areas.   
113 
 4.26 The historic environment is central to the character of the Borough and the 
Council has a duty140 to pay special attention to the desirability of 
preserving or  enhancing the character or appearance o f its conservation 
areas.  
4.27 The character and appearance of a conservation area is not only provided by the high quality and appearance of individual buildings within the area but their relationship with each other and with the spaces between them.  
It is experienced in whole and partial street views as well as views into and out of the area. Therefore, development that impacts positive elements within the area or affects its setting, including through an effect on view s, 
gaps and vistas and other character and appearance issues identified in Conservation Area Appraisal documents, needs to be assessed to ensure 
that the character and appearance of the area is conserved.  
4.28 Developers will be encouraged to take opportunities  to enhance the 
cherished and familiar local scene. The C ouncil will give appropriate 
weight to such enhancements gained in development proposals.  
4.29 Individual buildings within conservation areas, even if unlisted, may have features that it is important to preserve for their positive contribution to the conservat ion area.   Where planning permission is required for works which 
affect such features, this will be taken into account.   Where there is clear 
evidence about the form of lost historic features the rei nstatement of which 
could enhance the character or appearance of the conservation area, we will seek their reinstatement where appropriate.   
4.30 In addition, a building’s use can contribute to the character of a conservation area and to a sense of place not only due to its appearance 
but also through the patterns of  activity it creates, or even sounds and 
smells. The Borough contains a scatter of incidental mixed uses within its residential neighbourhoods, which offer variety, surprise and delight. These punctuate the street scene and add to the vitality and character of a conservation area. Their loss diminishes the character of the townscape, the cherished local scene and the vitality and diversity of the area. The Council will take account of the nature of the current or last use when assessing character.  
4.31 Conservat ion Areas are designated heritage assets and may contain other 
designated heritage assets including listed buildings.  The partial or full demolition of a building which makes a positive contribution to a 
conservation area, whether it be a listed building or unlisted structure of historic or architectural merit, can cause irreversible damage to the character and appearance of our high quality townscape. The harm caused will therefore be carefully weighed against any public benefit that 
 
140 s.72 of the  Planning (Listed  Buildings  and Conservation Areas  Act) 1990.  
  
114 
 might result, and, as  heritage assets are irreplaceable, any harm or loss 
will require clear and convincing justification.  Demolition which would 
cause substantial harm to the conservation area would be seen as exceptional, and substantial public benefits would need to be demonstrated in justification.   
4.32 As the majority of the Borough is covered by conservation areas, opportunities for new development are limited by the presumption to retain the original built fabric, whether it faces the street or not, where it contributes positively to the character of the conservation area. New buildings should contribute positively to the character and appearance of the conservation area. There have been past instances of inappropriate or premature demolition in conservation areas and so applications for demolition in conservation areas should always be accompanied by detailed proposals for the replacement building. There have also been examples of buildings being allowed to deteriorate.  However, this is no justification for demolition, and the Council will take all appropriate 
measures available to it to ensure that there is no incentive for such action.  
4.33 As the character and appearance of a conservation area can be dependent on the detail of developments, outline planning applications are insufficient within a conservation area; full y detailed applications are 
needed.  
4.34 The Council is producing and updating Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans for its conservation areas to s upport the 
implementation of P olicy CD3.  
Policy CD4: Designated Heritage Assets – Listed Buildings  
CD4 Heritage Assets - Listed Buildings 
A. Require development to protect the heritage significance of 
listed buildings.  
 
B. Require all development and any works for alterations or     
extensions related to listed buildings to preserve the heritage 
significance of the building, or its setting or any features of  
special architectural or historic interest it possesses.  
 
C. Resist the total or substantial demolition of listed buildings and 
resist the alteration of listed buildings which involves the removal 
or modification of features of architectural importance, both 
internal and external, unless a clear and convincing justification 
can be made for doing so. 
  
115 
 In delivering this take opportunities to:  
1. Reinstate internal and external features of special 
architectural or historic significance, commensurate with the 
extent of proposed development . 
2. Take opportunities to remove internal and external features 
that harm the architectural or historic significance of the 
asset, commensurate with the extent of proposed 
development.  
E. Resist the change of use of a listed building that would 
materially harm its cha racter . 
F. Require any work to a listed building to sustain the significance 
of the heritage asset and as such strongly encourage any works 
to a listed building to be carried out in a correct, scholarly 
manner informed by appropriate specialists . 
 
G. Take opport unities to secure the repair of listed buildings which 
have been identified as being at risk.  
 D. Require the preservation of original architectural features and 
later features of interest both internal and external . 
4.35 Ther e are about 4,000 listed structures in the Borough, many listed as part 
of larger groups such as terraces. In addition to buildings, local historic 
features such as memorials (particularly war memorials, including those on private land or within buildings), statues, plaques, coal plates, horse and cattle troughs, historic bollards, post boxes and telephone boxes ar e 
heritage assets worthy of protection.  
4.36 The special architectural or historic interest of listed buildings goes beyond appearance. It includes the integrity of the building as a whole, the locat ion 
and hierarchy of rooms, historic floor plans and levels, the structure of the building including foundations, as well as features such as original staircases, original roof structures, later additions, and other features identified as being of signific ance.  
4.37 The setting of a listed building and the surroundings i n which it is 
experienced can also contribute to its special interest. The extent of 
relevant setting will be proportionate to the   significance of the asset. 
4.38 Listed buildings can be negatively affected not only by inappropriate additions, internal and external alterations, and demolition, but also by inappropriate use and unsympathetic neighbouring development. Such changes can diminish the architectural and historic value and detract from their setting.   
116 
 4.39 When development takes place to listed buildings, it is appropriate to take 
opportunities to reinstate missing features which are considered important to their special interest or to remove additions or modifications that harm the significance of  the building.  
4.40 Listed buildings are best used for their original purpose, although this is not always possible.  Where that original purpose has become obsolete, sensitive adaptation can keep the building in beneficial use and secure its upkeep.  
4.41 The standard of workmanship in carrying out modifications to historic structures is not something that is readily controlled through the planning system. It is, however, of vital importance to the quality of the building, and owners are urged to employ the appropriate specialists.  
Policy CD5: Scheduled Ancient Monuments and A rchaeology  
CD5 S cheduled Ancient Monuments and Archaeology  
A. The Council will require development in the setting of 
Scheduled Ancient Monuments to protect their heritage 
significance.   
B. The Council will require applications for development to make 
proportionate provision for the assessment and evaluation of 
archaeol ogy on the site, including : 
1. Desk based assessments and, where necessary, field 
evaluation for major developments proposed in 
Archaeological Priority Areas . 
2. Desk based archaeological assessments and, where 
necessary , field evaluation for small developments within 
Archaeological Priority Areas and major developments 
outside of Archaeological Priority Areas unless pre-
application advice has been obtained from the Greater 
London Archaeological Advisory Service that this is not 
necessary, taking into account the impact of the proposed 
development and including proportionate mitigation 
measures, and, where appropriate taking opportunities 
better to reveal or reinterpret archaeological remains and 
discoveri es for the local community.  
4.42 A rchaeological remains constitute some of the most important surviving 
evidence of the Borough’s past, but they are a finite and fragile resource. Such remains (and their settings) should not be harmed, directly or indirectly, without clear justification taking into account the significance of 
the remains and the need for the development, to ensure the Borough’s past is not needlessly lost.   
117 
 4.43 The Borough contains two Scheduled Ancient Monuments: the Brick Kiln 
in Walmer Road and Kensington Palace, which are designated heritage assets. Any changes to these are controlled by a separate consent system, administered by Historic England, but development close to them may affect their setting.  
4.44 There are also a number of Archaeological Priority Areas in the Borough.   An Archaeological Priority Area (APA) is a defined area where, according to existing information, there is significant known archaeological interest or particular potential for new discoveries. APAs have been categorised into one of Tiers 1- 3 while all other areas within the Borough will be regarded 
as being in Tier 4. Tier levels indicate when there is a need to understand the potential impact of the proposed development on the heritage asset’s significance.  
4.45 The Borough has  two Tier 1 APAs focused on Kensington Palace and the 
Chelsea Porcelain Factory, and five Tier 2 APAs based on historic settlements and features which are set out in the Proposals Map. Any major development proposal within these areas must be accompanied by desk based archaeological assessments and where necessary field evaluation. For small developments (those below the threshold of major development) within APAs and major developments outside of APAs (Tier 4) pre- application advice should be sought from the Greater London 
Archaeologi cal Advisory Service (GLAAS) about the need to undertake a 
desk based archaeological assessments and where necessary field evaluation. Guidelines on consulting GLAAS are available from Historic England
141. As a minimu m the Greater London Historic Environment 
Record should have been consulted and the heritage assets assessed using appropriate expertise where necessary.  
Policy CD6: 
Registered Parks and Gardens 
CD6 Registered Parks and Gardens  
A. D evelopment in or in the setting of Registered Parks and 
Gardens should preserve their heritage significance or setting.  
B. To ensure criterion A is delivered such development should 
take opportunities  to: 
1. Reinstate landscape or built features which 
contribute positively to the historic interest of the 
park or garden. 
 
141 Greater London Archaeological Priority Areas | Historic England   
118 
 2. Remove landscape or built features that harm the 
historic interest of the asset . 
3. Where extensions are proposed to properties 
backing on to registered communal gardens, they 
must preserve the significance of views into, from, 
and across the garden, including any impacts from  
artificial lighting.  
C. D evelopments within a Registered Park or Garden should 
sustain the significance of the heritage asset and be carried 
out in a correct, scholarly manner  informed by  appropriate 
speci alists.  
4.46 The B orough has a long history and tradition of high- quality parks and 
gardens, such as Kensington Gardens, the Physic Garden, Holland Park, 
Royal Hospital and Ranelagh Gardens.  There are also 100 garden squares within the Borough, which are recognized and protected from development within them by the London Garden Squares Act 1931. There are 15 open spaces on the national Register of Parks and Gardens, including three at the highest grade, Kensal Green and Brompton Cemeteries and the Chelsea Physic Gardens.  Several, including in the Boltons and the Ladbroke Estate, are communal gardens integral to the planned development of housing in the nineteenth century, while others such as Holland Park and Kensington Gardens are more conventional parks.  Kensington Roof Gardens is unique, the only roof garden on the 
national register.   
4.47 In addition to their recreational, health and biodiversity benefits, h istoric 
parks and gardens too are a fragile and finite resource, and a familiar and cherished aspect of our envir onment . As designated heritage assets, the 
Council needs to take account in planning decisions of the special historic interest of these parks and gardens or their settings, and how they may be 
affected by development.  
4.48 In the case of extensions backing onto registered communal gardens, precedent will not be taken from older, ill -fitting existing extensions , also 
taking into account their impact on views  and carefully consider ing their 
potential impact with regards to light pollution, which can be harmful t o 
wildlife a source of annoyance to people. In particular , care should be 
taken so that any lighting does not negatively affect neighbours’ amenity , 
as per S aved Policy CD8 Living conditions.  
  119 Policy CD7: Tall Buildings 
CD7: Tall Buildings 
Definition  
A.There are two definitions of t all Buildings  in the Borough based
on where they are located. These are show n in Figure 4.3, and
are:
1.21m or more in height from the ground level to the top of
the building142 (as measured externally) .
2.30m or more in height from the ground level to the top of
the building143 (as measured externally) .
B.Proposals that meet or exceed the definition of a tall building in
criterion A will be assessed in accordance with London Plan
Policy D9.
C.Criterion B will not apply to single storey roof extensions on
individual dwelling  houses/homes.
Suitable Locations for Tall Buildings
D.Tall buildings will only be acceptable within those locations that
are identified as suitable for tall buildings  as shown in Figure
4.4 and at the heights specified in the relevant site allocations.
E.Introducing new buildings which are tall relative to their context
should be done with careful consideration of the impact they
may have in the surrounding townscape. Buildings that are tall
in their context should contribute to enhancing the character
and legibility of the local area.
Assessment criteria
F. The Council  will expect tall building s to be of exemplary design
quality. This includes:
1.Requiring any homes  and other accommodation provided to
be of the highest quality, including any external amenity
space.

Definition  
4.49 Tall
 buildings are generally those that are substantially taller than their 
surroundings and cause a significant change to the skyline144. The 
London Plan 2021 Policy D9: Tall Buildings requires that our Loc al Plan  
should define what is considered a tall building for specific localities, the 
height of which will vary between and within different parts of London but 
should not be less than 6 storeys or 18 metres measured from ground to the floor level of the uppermost storey . Boroughs are also required to 
identify locations  where tall buildings may be an appropriate form of 
development, as well as the maximum heights that could be acceptable in these locations.  
4.50 The Borou
 gh’s past approach has been to consider a building that is 1.5 
times the general height of its context to be a tall building. This has been long been established and has been effective in ensuring that proposals are assessed proportionally  to their impact. Whilst a building that is 
marginally taller than its context can have a significant impact especially in areas of very consistent townscape, Policies CD1 and CD2 set out the requiremen ts to ensure development is appropriate in their setting.  
144 Para graph 3.9.3 London Plan 2021  121 4.51 There are relatively modest and consistent building heights within 
Kensington and Chelsea,  reflecting the primarily residential character of 
the Borough, yet there is great variety of architectural styles and character. 
As described in the Character Study, a range of building typologies exist as well as building heights.  
4.52 Therefore, whether a building can be considered tall depends on the average building heights around it, as well as the level of consistency in the character and built  form. The local definition is made of two specific 
thresholds both based on existing context  and applies to different parts of 
the Borough. These thresholds will  establish if a proposal for development 
meets the definit ion of ‘tall’, as shown in Figure 4.3 . The lower threshold at 
21 m from ground level to the top of the building would  approximately  be 7 
storeys, and the higher threshold, at  30 m from ground level to the top of 
the building would  approximately be 10 storeys. F or the purpose of the 
Local Plan, the top of  a building would normally be measured externally at 
the height of the roof parapet of the uppermost  storey , excludi ng minor 
elements such as lift overruns and plant enclosures.   This definition does 
not mean that buildings of these heights or below would be automatically acceptable, as they are subject to heritage and design considerations as part of other policies. It only means policy requirements for tall buildings are triggered only once the local threshold has been exceeded.  
4.53 Tall buildings will be assessed against criterion s C and D  of the London 
Plan Policy D9, which set out  the impacts development proposals should 
address , and establish a requirement  for public access where appropriate, 
respectively.  
4.54 Due to the varied nature of the Borough’s townscape and building heights, there are areas where some of the existing building heights are only marginally lower than the tall building definitions as set out above. A proposal for  a rooftop alteration or a single additional storey to an existing 
building could therefore meet or exceed the definition for tall buildings in that specific locality. In order to ensure policy is proportional to development proposals, where such extensions are proposed on individual,  purpose built dwellinghouses or on houses that have been sub-
divided into flats, Criterion B of the policy will not apply, and these will not be subject to assessment according to Policy D9 of the London Plan.  122 Figure 4 .3: Tall building  definition for specific localities  
123 Suitable Locations for Tall Buildings 
4.55 The Borough’s two ‘Opportunity Areas’ – Earl’s Court and Kensal 
Canalside are identified by the Mayor of London as significant locations 
with development capacity to accommodate new housing, commercial development and infrastructure. The scale of these sites enables them to set their own character. The London Plan states that “In large areas of extensive change, such as Opportunity Areas, the threshold for what constitutes a tall building should relate to the evolving (not just the existing) context
145” Given the need for these sites to fully realise their 
growth and regeneration potential as per London Plan Policy SD1, the scale of development will include tall buildings. This is also indicated in the adopted Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area SPD .  
4.56 Therefore, the Council has commissioned a Height Analy sis for the 
Borough’s Opportunity Areas. The study sets out an indicative t ownscape 
response to scale and building heights within each Opportunity Area in relation to visual impact upon the immediate and wider context for each site. Please refer to site allocations SA1 Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area and SA2 Earl’s Court Exhibition Centre in Section 3 for further detail.   In these cases , tall buildings should be set within the parameters identified 
for each relevant site allocation.  
4.57 Site allocations with  extant planning permission for tall buildings are 
recognised as locations that ar e appr opriate for t all buildings.  These  are 
set out in ch apter  3 and are SA3 100/100A West Cromwell Road, SA4 245 
Warwick
 Road and SA10 Newcombe House. 
4.58 Two further locations are identified as suitable for tall buildings. These are 
SA6 Lots Road South and SA7 Edenham Way. The heights set for  these 
si
tes will be subject  to further t esting and may only be appropriate on part 
of
 the site.  
145 Para graph 3.9.3 London Plan 2021  124 Figure 4 .4: Suitable  locations for tall buildings and their maximum heights  125 Assessment criteria  
4.59 There are few very tall buildings within the Borough. Most of the 
townscape, with its strong heritage features and character, is very sensitive to buildings that are taller than their context. It is important that the Council carefully manages the  height of new development that may 
otherwise erode the Borough’s  distinctive  character. This is especially 
important within conservation areas.  
4.60 New buildings can strengthen the existing townscape, both through 
individual buildings carefully designed to respect their immediate context and through larger developments, which can seek to introduce new legible environments that build upon the Borough’s character.  
4.61 Tall buildings have a greater impact on their environment than other building types, posing challenges of microclimate, overshadowing and overlooking. Residential  environments and amenity spaces are particularly 
sensitive to these potential impacts, which need to be avoided through careful siting and design (see Saved Policy CD8).  
4.62 Tall buildings should make a positive contribution to the existing townscape by contributing to legibility, also keeping the design of the skyline in mind. Buildings that rise above the prevailing building height  are 
most successful where, depending on their impact, they give meaning to 
the local or borough townscape, highlighting locations or activities of importance.  
4.63 Tall buildings must be of the highest design quality in terms of their appearance, but also internally and in their environmental performance, 
sustainability , urban design, and safety against fire, as described in P olicy 
CD15 . This includes carefully considering scale, height, massing and 
silhouette. The proportions of the building, especially as they are visible above the prevailing building height, are particularly important. Bulky tall buildings are not attractive to look at and disfigure the skyline; slender ones are more successful. Where relevant, the careful incorporation of building services and telecommunications equipment should also be considered.  
4.64 The base of the building and how it meets the ground is equally impor tant, 
as is defining how the building functionally relates to the street. Successful tall buildings  are those that create meaningful public realm, interacting 
positively with the surrounding buildings and spaces. This includes contributions to permeability  and connectivity, defining edges that reinforce 
existing building lines and give a coherent form to open space, and providing active ground floor frontages and a stimulating and inclusive 
public realm (see Policies T1 and T2).  
4.65 Visibility must be assessed contextually to ensure that the visual impact of proposals for tall buildings  is properly understood. A computer -generated 
zone of visual influence that includes an accurate model of the relevant 
context is an essential tool for these purposes.  126 4.66 The London Plan  sets out strategic views of landmark buildings that make 
a very significant contribution to the image of London. There is only one 
such view that passes through the Borough which is from King Henry VIII’s Mound in Richmond Park to St Paul’s Cathedral.  This is shown in Figure 
4.1 at the beginning of this chapter . Please refer to Policy CD1 4, which 
requires developments to protect and enhance local views . The visual 
impact of tall buildings on these views is an important consideration.  
4.67 Where tall buildings are proposed near the River Thames, and in particular within the Thames Policy Area, they should protect and enhance the open quality of the river and the riverside public realm, in line with Policy D9, Paragraph C(f) of the London Plan 20 21.

A.Require roof alterations and additional storeys to be
sympathetic to the form and character of the building or group
of buildings.
B.Permit appropriately designed additional storeys and roof level
alterations where they make a positive contribution to the
townscape, including in circumstances where  the character of a
terrace or group of properties has been severely compromised
by a variety of  roof extensions and where infilling between them
would help to reunite the group.
C.Resist additional storeys  on:
1.Complete terraces or groups of buildings where the existing
roof line is unimpaired by extensions, even where a proposal
involves adding to the whole terrace or group as a co- 
ordinated design.
2.Buildings or terraces that already have an additional storey
or mansard . 
127 
 3. Buildings that have a roof structure or form of historic or 
architectural interest . 
4. Buildings w here additional storeys would detrac t from 
significant skylines or profiles . 
5. Buildings or terraces where the roof line or party walls are 
exposed to long views from public spaces, and where they 
would have an intrusive impact on that view or would 
impede the view of an important building or open space 
beyond. 
6. Buildings that, by the nature of the roof construction and 
architectural style, are unsuitable for additional storeys, e.g. 
pitched roofs with eaves . 
7. Mansion blocks of flats where an additional storey would 
add significantly to the bulk or unbalance the architectural 
composition. 
8. Terraces that are already broken only by isolated roof 
additions.  
9. Terraces where the alteration would harm the architectural 
symmetry of the terrace . 
 
D. Resist  alterations  to dor mer windows  of architectural  and 
historical interest,  even where others  on the same terrace  have 
been altered.  
4.
68 Adding additional space at roof level of a building can be a way of adding 
extra accommodation to existing buildings, including the provision of new homes. When done carefully, thi s is a useful form of gentle densification 
which may be appropriate in some locations within the Borough.  
4.69 The Character Study identifies the building typologies where roof alterations/additional storeys may be suitable, such as linear blocks or other flat  roofed buildings, as well as potential areas within the Borough 
which may be less sensitive to this type of development. It also provides key design principles to ensure that impact is acceptable upon the host building and its context. Conservation Area Management Plans will include 
specific guidance as appropriate on changes to roofs which may be 
accepted and on those which would be resisted. Neighbourhood Plan 
policies  also include guidance on roof extensions and alterations  which is 
locally specifi c. 
4.70 However, additional storeys and roof level alterations may change the 
character of the street, the skyline as seen from neighbouring houses and streets, and daylighting and sunlighting to neighbouring properties.   Small 
scale additions in the form of plant or equipment may also create intrusive elements if sited or designed without thought for their visual impact.   
128 
 4.71 Proposals must be assessed carefully and ensure they do not individually 
or cumulatively dominate the original building or surrounding townscape, or detract from architecturally interesting skylines.  
4.72 Groups of properties within a terrace that change their architectural style, character or height but are joined are considered as separate terraces. Roof extensions on one are not regarded as precedents for the other terraces within the street.  
4.73 Many of our historic buildings have dormer windows that  are an important 
integral part of their original architecture. Many of these have been inappropriately enlarged over the years. They are, however, an important architectural feature, and where the original dormers remain it is important to conserve them. Enlarged dormers also risk causing overheating, especially when south -facing.

of the area.  
B. Resist development which interrupts, disrupts or detracts from 
strategic and local vistas, views, and gaps and the skyline. 
C. Require developments whose visual impacts extend beyond 
that of the immediate street, to demonstrate how views are 
protected or enhanced . 
D. Require, within conservation areas, development to preserve or 
enhance views:  
1. Identified in conservation area appraisals and conservation 
area management plans . 
2. Generally within, into, and out of conservation areas, 
including to the rear of properties  in proportion to the 
townscape significance of the view . 
3. That affect the setting of and from development on sites 
adjacent to conservation areas and listed buildings .  
129 
 E. Require development to respect the setting of a landmark, 
taking care not to create intrusive elements in its foreground, 
middle ground or background.  
4.74 The qual ity and character of an area is not only provided by the individual 
buildings, but it is also gained from views into, within, and out of the area. 
When considering development that will have impacts on views and gaps, it is important to respect the  local context.  
4.75 The Borough contains some of the best examples of Victorian and Edwardian townscape in London. Overall, the residential environment is of the highest quality. This is evident not only in the public realm, but also at the rear and sides of properties, particularly around areas of private gardens. The presence of mature rear gardens and greenery softens the dense urban scene and provides relief and visual interest when viewed from the street through gaps between buildings or when a corner buil ding 
has an open return frontage. A similar pleasant contrast may occur by a view of the sky or rear elevations of nearby properties . 
4.76 Residents’ appreciation and enjoyment of the Borough as a whole and the special character and appearance of conservation a reas, derives from 
both public viewpoints and views from within their dwellings. Not only the street scene, but views from other buildings, including upper floors, and gardens, are important to residents’ living conditions. These will be considered as prop ortionate to the significance of the view. In particular, 
careful regard will be had to C onservation Area Appraisals and 
Conservation Area Management Plans which identify views of specific 
importance and character. On the occasions that development has an impact beyond the immediate street, a wider assessment of the impact needs to be carried out as part of a comprehensive assessment of the townscape impact of the proposals.  
4.77 It is important that the impact of development on views within the townscape, including in and around conservation areas, as well as of landmarks defining points of townscape interest is taken into account. In addition to the strategic view from St Paul’s to King Henry’s Mound in Richmond Park, identified in the London Plan, the Borough also has specifically recognised views that are important to protect. These are shown in Figure 4.5 below.

B. Major development and all relevant buildings under Planning 
Gateway One must have a Fire Statement  submitted  with the 
planning application. 
C. Tall buildings of 50 m or more (measured from the ground level 
to the floor level of the top most storey)  must have a Qualitative 
Design Review (QDR) panel report submitted with the planning 
application.  
D. ‘Minor’ or ‘other’ planning applications, must have a Planning 
Fire Safety Strategy (PFSS)  submitted. 
E. The forthcoming London Plan Guidance on Fire Safety should 
be followed for all developments.  
4.78 The N PPF has always recognised the importance of ensuring that 
developments provide access for emergency vehicles and have access to 
sufficient water supply. However, following the tragic events of the Grenfell Tower fire, and in particular, since the Independent Review of Building 
Regulations and Fire Safety, which was published in May 2018, fire safety has been recognised as a material consideration within the planning regime. As a result, we have had a number of policy changes in recent years. This includes the requirement for adequate means of escape for 
buildings.  
4.79 From August 2021, all developments within the scope of the Building Safety Regulator (BSR) are subject to Planning Gateway One. Currently residential buildings (with two or more dwellings/educational accommodation) over 18 m in height measured from ground level to the floor level of the top most storey  or higher than six storeys, are categorised 
as ‘relevant buildings’ and developers are required to submit  a fire 
statement with their planning application. Please see national  guidance on 
Fire Safety and high- rise residential buildings146 for the definition of a 
relevant building and how the height of a relevant building is measured. .   
4.80 Under Planning Gateway One the planning authority is required to consult the Building Safety Regulator (BSR) as a statutory consultee. Approval by 
 
146 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fire -safety -and-high-rise-residential -buildings -from-1-august -2021    
132 
 the BSR is required in this first ‘Gateway’ for the development to be able to 
move to the Second Gateway ( Construction).  
4.81 For tall buildings, the F ire Strategy as required under the Building Control 
Regime will be developed by the applicant through a QDR process as 
described in BS 9991 and BS 7974.  Policy CD15 requi res a QDR to be 
submitted with applications proposing buildings of 50 m or more. For these applicat ions a ‘review panel’ will be established by the planning authority, 
consisting of fire safety experts, who will be able to assess the means of escape proposals set out in the QDR, with particular reference to the number of stairs being proposed. The costs  associated with the ‘review 
panel’ will be met by the applicant.  
4.82 London Plan Policy D12(A) sets out the aim that all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety. To demonstrate development proposals have achieved the highest st andards 
of fire safety, applicants should submit a Planning Fire Safety Strategy (PFSS) with their application. It is important to note that a PFSS is not the same as a Fire Strategy submitted with a building control application, instead it is a high level  fire safety document as set out in Policy D12(A) 
guidance.  
4.83 The Mayor of London has produced a Draft London Plan Guidance (LPG) on Fire Safety in February 2022. This guidance advises what should be included within a Fire Statement to meet the requirements under London Plan Policy D12 as well as a PFSS.  It also sets out that a Reasonable 
Exception Statement (RES) can be submitted where part of or all  of 
London Plan Policy D12A are not considered relevant by the applicant. The RES should then explain which policy criteria is not relevant to the development and why.  
4.84 A RES should generally be submitted for planning applications where no additional dwellings or commercial units are created, no lifts are provided, the external materials are not altered and there are no alterations to the internal or external communal areas that support the evacuation strategy for the property. In these applications, the applicant should confirm that current fire safety measures are appropriate and will not be negatively affected by the development. Where existing fire safety measures will be altered, the applicant should identify any mitigation measures. The requirement for RES may change in the final version of the LPG on Fire Safety and the latest guidance should be followed.  
4.85 Policy CD15 allows for the submission of a RES for a ‘minor’ or ‘other’ planning application except for where development involves the creation of a new/or change of use to a building in Use Class: Class C: C1: Hotels; C2: Residential Institutions; C2A: Secure Residential Institutions; C4: Houses in Multiple Occupation; Class E: Commercial, Business and Services (All classes) Class F: F1:  Learning and non- residential 
institutions; F2: Local community; and Sui Generis.  
 133 5 Town Centres 
Introduction 
5.1 The Borough’s town centres make the Borough the special place that it is. 
They contain some of London’s most iconic shopping areas and are the 
places where people from across the capital gather to meet or to enjoy an 
extraordinary array of world class culture and entertainment.  But they are also the centres  that drive the walkable neighbourhood, the hubs for our 
communities, the places that contain the range of uses which are essential 
if day -to-day needs are to be met.   
5.2 Care must be taken if our centres are to continue to thrive as patterns of shopping and of work rapidly change. We must make sure that, where possible, new commercial development is directed into these town centres, 
and any new “town centre” uses are of a scale and nature that support each centre and allows  it to serve its proper function.  
5.3 Most of our higher order town centres have two main functions: places to shop and to visit, but also the places which serve the day -to-day needs of 
our residents.  The Council recognises that our town centres  must also be 
allowed to diversify if they are to remain relevant. They must be able to offer something the internet cannot. This may be a new experience, a place to work, to ga ther, or to enjoy.   
5.4 Our smaller centres and our isolated shops are no less important.  They 
form a tight network of local hubs, which supplement our larger higher order centres, to ensure that the more local day -to-day needs of our 
residents can be met.

Town Centre first  
A.In order to support the vitality and viability of Kensington and
Chelsea’s network of town centres, the Council will apply a
town centre first approach to any proposal for a retail or other
main town centre use which requires planning permission.
The sequential approach
B.The Council will apply a sequential approach to proposed retail
and other main town centre uses which are neither in an
existing centre nor in accordance with the other policies in the
development plan. Retail and other main town centre uses
should be located in designated centres. Only if suitable sites
cannot be found within designated centres, will the Council
consider edge of centre locations or if no edge of centres are
available, out of centre locations .
C.To encourage the walkable neighbourhood and to improve the
access of a range of facilities to all our residents, the Council
will not require a sequential assessment for new shops of less
than 400 sq m (GEA) in areas of retail deficiency.
Impact assessment
D.The Council will require an impact assessment for proposals for
new, or extensions to existing, edge or out of centre
development for retail, leisure and office uses unless that
proposal is in accordance with other policies within the
Development Plan or lies with an Employment Zone and will
support the commercial function of that area.
E.The threshold for the need for an impact assessment is:
1.400 sq m (GEA) for a retail (Class E (a) use); or
2.2,500 sq m (GEA) for the other non- retail main town centre
uses.
F.Applications that  are likely to have significant adverse impacts
will be refused.138 New town centres  
G.The Council will support the establishment for new town centres
in the Kensal Canalside and Earl’s Court and West Kensington
Opportunity Areas.
1.the retail provision must be of a scale that will serve the
day-to-day needs of the development only; and
2.any new centre must comply with the requirements o f the
NPPF and be of a scale and nature that does not have an
unacceptable impact on existing centres.
Town Centre first and the Sequential Approach  
5.8
 The Local Plan endorses the “town centre first approach” and a “sequential 
test” for any new main town centre uses, as defined within the N ational 
Planning Policy Framework  and the London Plan.   
5.9 The main town centre uses include retail, leisure, entertainment facilities, recreational uses, offices and arts, culture and tourist uses.  
5.10 Other uses may be suitable within a town centre, but not subject to the 
requirements of the sequential test or an impact assessment. These will 
include a range of social and community uses, schools, universit ies and 
other education uses as well, in certain circumstances, housing.  
5.11 The Local Plan does not require development  which includes retail or the 
other main town centre use to seek sites within our designated centres 
within any hierarchal order, provided that the development meets the 
policy objectives for that centre as described in C hapter  9, Places . 
5.12 The NPPF definition of an edge- of centre site for retail purposes is any site 
within 300 sq m of a town centre boundary. This  is not considered relevant 
in this B orough as almost the entire B orough would be edge- of-centre 
within this definition. To address the compact nat ure of this B orough and 
the number of centres within it, the Council considers edge- of-centre 
development to be that which is adjacent to an existing cent re. Given their 
immediate proximity to our existing centres these areas will have excellent links to the adjoining centre.  
Impact Assessment 
5.13 An impact assessment will be required for new retail, leisure and office uses, which are not in accordance with the policies within our Development Plan. This is as required by Policy SD7 of the London Plan. Assessments should consider the impact on existi ng, committed and 
planned public and private investment in a centre or centres in the catchment area of the propos al, and the impact on town centre vitality and 
viability.   
139 
 5.14 The Council will only seek an impact assessment for leisure and office 
uses when more than 2,500 sq m ( GIA) floorspace is proposed. This is a 
scale which has the potential to have an impact on our existing town centres. However, this threshold w ill be 400 sq m (GIA) for new retail 
floorspace, or of a scale which often equates to a ‘local’  format small 
supermarket . Floorspace of this scale is  unlikely to have an impact on 
nearby centres. Larger retail  units do have the potential to have more of an 
impact.  
5.15 The nature of the assessment should be proportionate to the scale of the development proposed.  An assessment will not be necessary w hen the 
proposal complies with the policies in this Plan or where it  lies with an 
Employment Zone and will support the commercial function of that area. These are all circumstances where the creation of new town centres uses will be welcomed.  
5.16 The Council recognises that units beneath railway arches may provide opportunities to accommodate a range of E class and other commercial uses. This will be supported subject to the provisions of the sequential test and a proportionate impact assessment.  
5.17 The Council recognises that many town centre uses now fall within the single “commercial, business and service” Class E use. Whilst c hanges of 
use within the use class will not ordinarily require planning permission, t he 
creation of additional floorspace does. The Council will  ask applicants to 
specify the nature of the C lass E use sought. This will allow the Council to 
properly assess the proposal against the relevant policies and allow us to assess the likely impact on the vitality of a centre or upon the living 
conditions of  nearby residents.   
5.18 Where applicants are not in a position to do so we will assess each application against each of the possible C lass E uses. Where necessary 
we will use planning conditions to specify the nature of the C lass E use 
which is acceptable.  
5.19 This Local Plan promotes the concept of the “walkable neighbourhood”, or the idea that everyone living within the B orough should have access to a 
range of facilities that will meet their day to day needs. To this end, the 
Council supports the provision of new small shops (less than 400 sq m  
(GIA)) in areas of retail deficiency. This area is  shown on F igure 5.3. The 
area of retail deficiency is one which lies beyond  400 m. This  equates to a 
five minu te walk, less than the 15 minutes promoted for the other uses 
which make up the walkable neighbourhood. This reflects the importance 
of having a range of day to day shops within a very easy reach of all of our 
residents.     
140 
  
Figure 5.3: Town Centres and areas of retail  deficiency  
5.20 The Council has recently published a Retail and Leisure Impact 
Assessment154 which predicts the need for additional  retail floorspace up 
to 2043. This reflects the changing retail  patterns,  grow th in the spending 
power  of those who visit our centres as well as changes in how  retailers 
stock their shops.  This study concludes that  we do not need any new 
comparison floorspace over the lifetime of the plan. By the same token, it  
is not predicting any significant over supply of comparison floorspace over the same period.  Rather than looking for new space,  the Council  will seek 
to consolidate and improve the space that we do have and to continue to 
support healthy  town centres.   
 
154 Retail and Leisure Needs Assessment (Urban Shape) January 2022.  
 
141 
 5.21 The Council recognise s that there may be circumstances where the 
creation of  new town centre uses close to a centre may assist in the 
fulfilment of th e vision for that cent re. Such proposals ma y be supported, 
subject to the town centre first requirements.     
5.22 The study suggest s that there will be a modest need of 8,900 sq m of 
additional convenience floorspace needed by the end of the plan period.  
Much of this  will be accomm odated within our town centres either by the 
filling of vacant units  or by the development of town centre sites identified 
in Chapter 10. The Council also notes that some of this need is likely to be 
accommodated through the creation of new town centres within the Kensal 
Canalside and Earl’s Court and West Kensington Opportunity Areas. These centres will help tie these new places into the area as well as serve the needs of both those living nearby and those living in the newly created homes. We expect these centres to serve a localised retail catchment only, 
providing the convenience goods and services required by the local 
community , or predominantly the need generated by these developments.  
In the case of the Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area we do rec ognise, 
and support,  the wider catchme nt of the existing supermarket .   
5.23 The extent to which, from a retail perspective, there is scope for a larger centre on either of the sites will depend on a detailed analysis of retail need, taking account of the vitality and viability of existing centres (both in this and neighbouring boroughs) both at the time of the development and in the longer term.   
Development within Town Centres 
Policy TC2: Development within T own Centres 
TC2: Nature of Development within Town Centres   
A. Require the scale and nature of development to relate to the 
size, role and function of that town centre, to reflect the 
position of the centre within the town centre network  and to 
assist in the implementation of the strategy for that centre; and  
B. Require a range of shop unit sizes in major new retail 
development, and to resist the amalgamation of shop units, 
where the retention of the existing units contributes to 
achieving the vision for the centre.  
5.24 O ur town centres have different roles. A role will be determined by a 
centre’s size, its location, its catchment and perhaps its history. These roles have been reflected by the “level” of the centre and its position in the 
London Plan’s Town Centre Network  as set out in paragraph 5.5  above.  
These roles  are not static and may change over time.  However, the 
primary role s of our town centre are, and will continue to be, the centres  
142 
 for shops and leisure uses, the places which meet the day -to-day needs of 
our residen ts, places t o work , places to shop and the places which drive 
our economy.    
5.25 Our centres are undergoing rapid change as what people want from them 
is transformed.  The Council will take a pivotal role in trying to shape these 
changes, and to ensure that our centres can evolve in such a way as to remain relevant. To this end the Council has worked with those who use or run businesses in our centres to develop a series of future visions, or strategies to shape their future evolution. These are set out in C hapter  9. 
These include support for new Business Improvement Districts and a series of small scale public realm improvements.  We will require proposals 
which include new town centre uses, to support these visions.  
5.26 The changes to planning regulations mean that planning permission will not normally be needed for changes of use of one C lass E use to another. 
However, planning permission will continue to be required for any associated changes to the outside of the building. It is essential that all properties within our town centres retain an active frontage so that these areas remain attractive places to visit and to invest in.    
5.27 The Council  recognise s that the planning system does not normally allow 
for a local planning authority to control the amalgamation of shop units. Planning conditions, however, do allow the Council to maintain newly created smaller units where these play a significant role in maintaining the character of a centre and to help support a dynamic, competitive and diverse town centre.  It is these smaller units which are often favoured by 
the indepe ndent sector, a sector with an important role in maintaining a 
diverse offer and countering the homogenisation of our town centres.  
Policy TC3: Diversity of uses within Town Centres  
TC3: Diversity of uses within Town Centres  
A. The Council will require development to the support the vitality 
and the viability of our town centres.  
B. Support the provision of a diverse range of town centre uses 
where they contribute to the character, function and viability of 
that centre, whilst retaining the core retail function of our larger 
town centres . 
C. Proposals that are consistent with the Council’s policy on al 
fresco hospitality will be supported.  
D. Support the use of vacant properties within our town centres for 
a range of meanwhile town centre uses.

members of the public .

arcades and hot food takeaways 
F. Resist betting shops, payday loan stores , pawn brokers  and 
amusement arcades  and hot food takeaways  within  our higher 
order  town centres, when these will make up more than: 
1. 25 per cent  of ground floor units in the relevant street 
frontage of our primary retail frontages;  or 
2. or 50 per cent  of ground floor units in the relevant street 
frontage of our secondary  retail frontages . 
G. Such uses will not be appropriate in our neighbourhood centres.  
New homes in Town Centres  
H. Support the provision of housing within town centres where:  
1. no t at gr ound floor level, fronting the street . 
2. does not adversely affect the character and function of the 
centre; and 
3. complies with the “agent of change” principle.  
Use of conditions  
I. When planning permission is required, the Council may use 
planning conditions to specify the particular use within Class E, 
which may be suitable within a building, or part of a building.  
 
Di
versity of uses within Town Centres  
5.28 For a town centre to be successful it must contain the mix of uses which 
make it a place which people choose to visit. This mix will vary, but for our centres it is the shopping element which remains key. It is the core, or primary frontages, which contain the critical mass of shops  with the 
peripheral parts being home to more cafés, restaurants and other service uses. It is this range of uses which make our centres the successful places that they are.   
5.29 But one size does not fit all, and what may be right for one centre may not be right for another.  Each centre has a slightly different function, has  
144 
 different challenges and different strengths. This is considered in chapter 
9, the “Places”, where the Council seeks to build upon its work of its Town 
Centres  Task Force and draw up visions for our larger centres, or the 
strategies we believed will allow them to thrive in the future. Offering something different, an attraction, an experience, a new place to work or a place to learn will be key if our larger town centres are to remain rel evant.  
5.30 The Council will have particular regard to the needs of those who live within, or close to our town centres.  Where possible, we will support our larger centres in meeting these needs.    
5.31 Our smaller neighbourhood centres  are no less important. Their primary 
role differs in that they tend to offer less comparison shops (shops where, for example, one might buy clothes, books, or kitchenware) but more convenience uses , or those which meet the day -to-day needs of our 
resident s. This may include a food shop, the dentist, the beau ty salon or 
the hairdresser.  
5.32 However, we must also recognise that the recent changes to planning 
regulations means that it is no longer a Council’s role to try to curate what 
it might see as the best balance of uses in a centre.  A shop, a restaurant, 
an office or a health centre all fall within the single “commercial, business and service” use class and it is for individual landowners, not the planners, to decide how the unit is used.  
5.33 This has its benefits. It allows greater fle xibility and innovation as a 
business can adapt quickly and not be constrained by the requirements of the former U se Classes O rder. The Council welcomes this flexibility and 
will support any main town centre use where we are satisfied that it support s the vitality of our town centre, and where the amenity of those 
living within, or near , our centres is not significantly affected.  
5.34 The Council will also support the temporary  or “meanwhile use” of 
otherwise vacant properties  across our town centres  and in other 
appropriate locations across the B orough.  Meanwhile uses are generally of 
the benefit to the local community, offering for example, meeting spaces, 
learning spaces, temporary rehearsal spaces , pop up s hops and 
exhibitions, or spaces where new entrepreneurs  can test their products. 
This will largely, but not exclusively, be within town centre locations.   
5.35 The provision of an active frontage is an essential element of any new use within the town centre. It will help ensure that  the new use is fully 
integrated into the centre, supports footfall, and adds to the natural surveillance of the area.  
Betting shops, payday loan stores, pawn brokers, amusement arcades and hot food takeaways 
5.36 Whilst the “Commercial, business and service” C lass E use now contains 
the majority of commercial town centre uses, planning regulations keep certain categories of use outside of the use classes order, or in planning  
145 
 parlance being “sui generis”. These are largely the uses which have the 
potential to have a particular adverse impact  on the vitality of a centre, its 
character or upon the lives of those who live nearby. These are uses which 
still require planning permission. These include betting shops, pawn brokers, amusement arcades and similar uses.  
5.37 The Council recognises that a  proliferation of these uses can damage the 
character, vitality and viability of a town centre, particularly when within the primary shopping area of our larger centres.  If poorly managed they can 
be associated with anti -social behaviour as well as diluting the main retail 
or service function of a centre.  Such uses will not be appr opriate on our 
neighbourhood centres.  
5.38 P ubs and bars are also sui generis uses. However,  like restaurants, these 
are uses which have an important role to play in  supporting the vi tality of 
our centres. They may increase dwell time for shoppers and encourage 
use of our centres in the evenings.  But they are also the uses which do 
have the capacity to cause noise and nuisance to those who live nearby.  
When planning permission is required,  the Council will consider the impact 
of any proposal on its neighbours. When it is not required the Council will 
use other regimes, particularly its powers through licencing and noise and 
nuisance to mitigate the potential impact.  Hot food takeaways are also a 
sui generis use, which  like bars and restaurants, can support the viability of a centre.  However, an over provision will both harm the viability of a centre, may cause anti -social behaviour and may have a particular impact 
on the amenity of those living nearby.  An over provision can also have a detrimental impact on the health of those who use them.  
5.39 The policy  threshold set out in part E relates to all of these specified uses 
and not to each use alone.   
5.40 The impact of the plant associated with a restaurant, a bar, a take- away or 
similar use can still be assessed through the planning process, including through L ocal Plan Policy G 9, “Odours”.  
5.41 The Council welcomes the provision of offices and other similar business uses within our town centres. It is a use which benefits from a highly 
accessible town centre location, but which also attracts visitors to a centre 
and generate footfall. The right business space can create a dynamic use which can generate life and interest, a use which may be particularly valuable when the role of retail is becoming less important.    
Active frontages  
5.42 However, care needs to be taken to ensure that the business premises being provided are of a type which support s the viability of  a centre. Where 
planning permission is required, office uses which create dead frontage at ground floor level will be resisted.  
5.43 The NPPF encourages boroughs to support “town centre living”. The two 
uses can complement one another. The town centre is a vibrant and  
146 
 exciting place to live, whilst those living  in a centre directly contribute to its 
vibrancy . The Council  also recognises that our  town centres may be the 
places which have some capacity to provide new homes.  
5.44 Whilst the Council cannot control changes of use within the E Classes, we 
do have an  Article 4 direction in place which allows us to require planning 
permission for any change of use of an Class E use to residential  within 
most of our higher order and smaller neighbourhood town centres.  
New Homes in Town Centres  
5.45 T he Council will support the building of new homes in our town centres but 
only when we are satisfied that the vitality of our town centres  is 
maintained. Regard will be had to the impact that the change of use will 
have upon the supply of small offices. The Council will also have regard to the nature of the unit that remains and whether it is of a size and nature which may be suitable for a range of occupiers. This will include the need for storage as well as tradable space.  
Use of Conditions 
5.46 Regard must be had to the “agent of change principle” as articulated by Policy D13 of the London Plan.  New development must be designed to 
ensure that any established noise generating uses can remain viable and can continue to grow without unreasonable restrictions being placed on them. This places the responsibility for mitigating impacts from existing noise and other nuisance- generating activities or uses on the proposed 
new noise- sensitive development.  
5.47 Whilst planning permission will not normally be required for the change of one town centre use to another, it will be where new floorspace is being provided. In these circumstances the Council will not normally seek to constrain the flexibility that would otherwise be allowed through Class E. However, there may be circumstances where we will use planning conditions to ensure that the policies within this Local Plan can be properly implemented.   
147 
 Policy TC4: The evening economy 
TC4: The evening economy  
A. Proposals that enhance or diversify the B orough’s 
evening economy will be supported where they:  
1. are located within the B orough’s designated higher 
order centres, or the Earl’s Court or Kensal 
Canalside Opportunity Areas, and are of a size and 
type that reflects the role and function of that centre;  
and 
2. will not result in a negative impact on the amenity of 
the surrounding residential uses.  
B. Proposals that are consistent with the Council’s policy on 
al fresco hospitality (T3)  will be supported.   
C. Where appropriate, the Council will use planning 
conditions to mitigate the potential impact  of such us es. 
5.48 The C ouncil recognises the contribution that restaurants, takeaways, bars 
and pubs, cinemas and theatres can have an important role in supporting 
the vitality of our town centres. They can add to the cultural draw and in providing for the uses valued by the local community and by  visitors to the 
Borough. In addition, these uses can provide jobs and support the local 
economy. These uses may have a strong role in letting our town centre evolve as they adapt to a post Covid- 19 world and may be a key 
component of the future vision of some of our centres .  
5.49 The value of “evening uses”  is reflected by the Council’s support for al 
fresco dining , hospitality on our streets and spaces. The Council has 
adopted a policy to license al fresco terraces within the publ ic realm 
normally until 10pm. This policy aims to increase activity on our streets  in 
the evening. Further details are set out  in Polic y T3 (Living Streets and 
outdoor  life), and in the Streets and Transport C hapter  of this plan.  
5.50 However, the Council recognises that, if not properly managed, 
entertainment uses  are also uses which have the potential to disturb those 
who live nearby. This disturbance may be from the use itself but also through the associated servicing, plant and the noise caused by  people 
arriving and leaving the premises.  This disturbance can be particularly 
pronounced when similar uses are clustered in certain areas.  
5.51 The Council recognises that a number of “evening uses” have evolved to successfully operate within our neighbourhood cent res.  Indeed a popular 
local pub or a well -loved local restaurant can both provide a local service 
and help create the sense of place so valued by our residents.  Al fresco dining for existing uses will be supported in our neighbourhood centres,  
148 
 where it c ompl ies with the provisions of Policy T3.  However, the creation 
of a new evening use, where before there  was none, will not generally be 
supported (w here planning permission is required), in neighbourhood 
centres as this has the potential to conflict with the otherwise residential 
character of the area.  The introduction of a new “evening” use will only be 
supported where it can be shown not to harm the character of the centre, not to have a detrimental impact on the amenity of those living within or 
close to the centre, and that it complies with the agent of change principle.  
5.52 Evening uses will be supported in the neighbourhood centres created within the Earl’s Court or Kensal Canalside Opportunity Areas, where they will form part of the mix of commercial uses  which support the function of 
these distinct  “places”.  
5.53 The 2021 changes to planning regulations means that the change use of a 
premises from one class E “commercial, business or service use” to  
another will not need planning permission. However, permi ssion is still 
required for the creation of the majority of these other “evening uses”.  These include “sui generis” uses such as bars, clubs and takeaways. Planning permission will also be required for the plant often needed to operate an evening use effectively.  
5.54 T he Council can use the licencing and the environmental heath regimes to 
ensure that the potential of disturbance or anti -social behaviour is 
mitigated irrespective as to whether planning permission is required.  
5.55 Where planning permission is required  we can use a range of planning 
conditions to help mitigate the impact. These can include, for example,  the hours of operation, limiting the number of those who can visit, or how these units can be serviced. Planning permission will also be required for the plant often needed to operate an evening use effectively . However, 
there will be circumstances where the use of conditions will not be able to effectively mitigate the impact. In these cases planning permission will be refused.  
5.56 The Council recognises the importance of effective enforcement to ensure 
that the requirements required under the planning, licencing or environmental health regimes are properly implemented.  
   
149 
 Policy TC5: Local Shopping and other Facilities which support the 
Walkable Neighbourhood  
TC5: Local Shopping and other Facilities which support day- to 
day needs.  
A. Where planning permission is required, the Council will:  
1. protect individual shops outside of designated town centres ; 
and 
2. resist the loss of restaurants outside of higher order town 
centres  
B. Resist the loss of public houses and other drinking 
establishments throughout the B orough.  
5.57 The C ouncil supports walkable neighbourhoods, or trying to ensure that 
everyone living in our B orough has easy access to a range and a choice of 
facilities which they may need on a regular basis.  
5.58 One part of this is the need to protect, where possible, a range of local 
shopping and other similar uses. For the purpose of this policy this 
includes a range of Class E, Commercial, Business and Services uses,  
including shops  and restaurants as well as public houses.  
5.59 The Council’s Article 4 direction means that planning permission is still 
required for the loss of any C lass E use to residential  across much of the 
Borough. However, the Council recognises that planning permission is not 
required for any change of use within the C lass E use .   
5.60 Where possible we will protect individual shops and those within small parades as it is often these premises which prove useful for “top- up” 
shopping.  These shops are particularly valuable to elderly, or less mobile shoppers and those with young children.   
5.61 Public houses  are valued by many of our residents.  Not only do they 
make a contribution to the community and cultural life of the B orough, but 
at neighbourhood level they  offer a source of identity and distinctiveness, 
providing  opportunities for social interaction and places to meet. They  
support community cohesion – in short the essential ingredients of a sense 
of community and place.  
5.62 The Council will have regard to Policy HC7 of the London Plan, “Protecting public houses”, when considering any application which includes the loss of a public house or pub floorspace. This policy, and associated supporting text, sets out the nature of the marketing evidence that will be required to demonstrate that there is no realistic prospect of the building being used as a pub in the foreseeable future. This includes marketing as a pub for at  
150 
 least 24 months at an agreed price following an independent valuation in a 
condition that allows  the property to continue functioning as a pub 
5.63 Any proposal which includes the loss of upper floors or ancillary uses such 
as function rooms and staff accommodation must demonstrate that this loss will not compromise the operation or viability of the public house. Measures must be put in place which would mitigate the impacts of noise for new and subsequent residents is accordance with the “agents of change” principle.  
5.64 I t is not only public houses that support community cohesion. Other uses 
such as restaurants  and cafes are also valued, for both the service that 
they provide and their wider social role.  This essential mix of uses in the 
Borough’s predominantly residential areas helps to provide services locally 
for the community and beyond, but adds to the character and distinctiveness of the Borough as a whole. The approach of maintaining 
and protecting a broader range of uses also brings greater benefit to the 
wider community, rather than favouring a particular group within it.  
SAVED Policy TC 6: Street Mark ets  
SAVED Policy TC7: Art and Culture uses  
Policy TC8: Hotels  
TC8: Hotels and other forms of tourist accommodation 
The Council will:  
A. support the provision of new hotels:   
1. within, or adjacent to the Borough’s higher order town 
centres;  
2. within the Earl’s  Court and West Kensington Opportunity 
Area; or  
3. other areas where the new hotel would support the function 
of the area, where:  
a. there is no loss of permanent residential 
accommodation; and 
b. there will be no unacceptable harm to amenity or to 
the residential character of an area.  
B. protect hotels and hotel bedrooms across the B orough, save 
within the SW 5 postcode area,.  
151 
 C. encourage the expansion, upgrading and diversification of 
existing hotels where:  
1. this will assist in maintaining the vitality if a town centre;  
2. this will not result in  the loss of any permanent residential 
accommodation; and  
3. there will be no unacceptable harm to amenity or to the 
residential character of an area.  
D. resist the provision of holiday lets and other forms of temporary 
sleeping accommodation where:  
1. it involves the loss of permanent residential 
accommodation; or  
2. it will have significant impact on the amenity or to the 
residential character of an area.  
5.65 Tour ism is one of the Borough’s key economic drivers.  Whilst the Covid-
19 pandemic has greatly reduced visitor numbers in the short term, we 
fully expect to welcome visitor s back in the numbers we had before.  
5.66 In 2019, it was estimated that Kensington and Chelsea befitted more than any other borough from the spending power of tourists, at just over £5 billion pounds, with the tourist industry providing 121,000 jobs. There will be a symbiotic relationship between spend, jobs and the hotel sector. Tourists stay in our hotels, visit our attractions and shop in our centres. As a “main town centre use”, we would expect new hotels to be located within, 
or adjacent to our higher order town centres, although we  recognise that a 
hotel may also be appropriate in other areas which lie close to major 
tourist attractions, or where they m ight otherwise support the function of an 
area.  This includes within the Earl’s Court and West Kensington 
Opportunity Area.  
5.67 The Borough’s stock of hotels can play a significant role in the London 
Plan’s ambition  of creating an additional 58,000 bedrooms across the 
capit al by between 2015 and 2041. Whilst the additional demand for new 
bedspaces within the B orough to 2041 is minimal, any loss will have to be 
made up elsewhere, and will  generally  be resisted.  
5.68 The only exception are the hotels within the SW5 post code area ( Figure 
5.4). This covers Earl’s Court ward as well as the wester n part o f Courtfie ld 
ward  and a small part of the north of Redcliffe  ward.  This is part of the 
Borough where there is a particular concentration of hotels which have 
evolved to serve the Exhi bition Centre. With the loss of the Exhibition 
Centre demand has fallen and some hotels are struggling to maintain the 
occupancy levels need ed to allow continued investment in the business.  
5.69 The Council recognise s that the nature of demand for different types of 
visitor accommodation is changing, and there may be some hotels elsewhere in the B orough which are also struggling to adapt. The Council  
152 
 may permit the loss of a hotel where we are satisfied that there is no long 
term future for that particular hotel.   
5.70 The evidence required will include marketing as a hotel for at least 24 months at an agreed price following an independent valuation in a 
condition that allows the property to continue functioning as a hotel.   
5.71 The loss of any hotel within the Borough should not harm the viability of a town centre. Where a hotel lies within a town centre an active commercial ground floor frontage must be maintained.  
5.72 The upgrading or diversification of the facilities offered by existing hotels can have considerable benefits to the nature of the Borough’s stock of visitor accommodation. It can keep the Borough’s hotel offer relevant and, when located within, or adjoining a centre, can ensure that the vitality of 
that town centres is supported. Often refurbishment will not requi re 
planning permission, but where it does it is essential that it is not at the expense of existing permanent residential units or of the living conditions of those living nearby.  
5.73 Airbnb and likeminded lettin g platforms  have transformed the Borough’s 
tourist sector. The visitor can now choose to stay in someone’s home as 
well as in one of the Borough’s 180 hotels. This innovation in the sector has attracted many more to the Borough, to spend in our centres and to 
visit our attractions . 
5.74 Whilst the Council re cognises the provisions of the Deregulations Act  
(2015)  and will continue to support innovation across the sector, we 
recognise that less formal “homestays” may not be without  their problems. 
They can result in the loss of the homes needed by our residents and, when not properly managed, unneighbourly behaviour can harm those who live nearby.  The latest data
155 suggests that the Air BnB alone now 
accounts for some 4,700 homes across the Borough, or 7 per cent  of our 
entire housing stock. These are homes that are no longer available for our residents to live in. The creation of new visitor short term lets will, therefore, only be supported when not at the expense of existing homes.

 6 Business 
Introduction  
6.1 The Borough is not a strategic office location in the way that the City of 
London or the Isle of Dogs are, and the Council does not require the 
provision of very significant amounts of new office floorspace over the 
lifetime of the P lan.  However, we are home to a vibrant and a varied 
business sector which makes an important contribution to the country’s 
economy. Our business sector is also greatly valued at a more local level 
for the jobs it provides,  the role it plays in servicing the Central Activities 
Zone, for the contribution it makes to the character of our streets and for 
the people it brings to our town centres.  It is a key tool in the way we can 
begin to address inequality . 
6.2 Covid -19 has accelerated the changes in the way that many of us work. 
Some may work from home and others may take a hybrid approach and travel to their offices for two or three days a week. These changes have 
had an impact on the amount of new office floorspace that is needed in the 
Borough over the lifetime of plan. However, this need is not insignificant. It 
can only be met through the provision of new businesses on some sites and, provide the planning policy framework to protect  the business uses 
that we have.   
Key Facts  
• 470,000 sq m office floorspace.  
• 94,000 sq m of ‘ industrial ’ floorspace.
157 
• Concentrat ion of  business uses  in town cent res and the three 
Employment Zones, but  also scattered across the B orough. 
• S ome 42,500 people employed in the office sector.  
• 69 per cent  individual office s less than 100 sq m is size, and 90 
per cent  employ less than 10 people.  
• A particular strength in the information and communications, 
fashion, publishing, music and wider creative industries.   
• Pre Covid -19 vacancy rates just 2.2 per cent, rising to 5.8 per cent  
(June 2021),  but expected to fall back in 2023.   
• A need for 60,500 sq m of net additional office floorspace by 2043.  
 
 
157 Includes light industri al uses as well as general industrial and storage and distribution uses .

 Policy BC1: Business Uses  
BC1: Business uses  
Protecting existing Office  space 
A. Where planning permission is required, protect all offices and 
office floorspace, except where: 
1. within an Employment Zone and being replaced by a use 
which supports the commercial character and function of the 
zone;  
2. within a town centre and being replaced by an alternative 
(non- residential) town centre use; or   
3. the office is being replaced by a social and community use. 
Locations for New office space 
B. Permit small and medium sized offices anywhere in the 
Borough. 
C. Require new large scale offices t o be located within a town 
centre, other accessible areas, Opportunity Areas or within an 
Employment Zone, unless the development  would meet the 
requirements of the sequential test.   
D. New offices will be supported within the town centres where 
they  contribute to the character, function and viability of that 
centre.  
E. Require new offices within a town centre to create an active 
frontage.     
F. New large scale offices outside of existing town centres will be 
subject to a n impact  assessment.  
Industrial and Warehouse uses  
G. Where planning permission is required, protect :  
1. industrial uses ; 
2. storage and distribution uses unless to an office  Class E( c) 
or light industrial Class (E(g) use; and 
3. veh icle repair garages and MOT centres .

Meeting the need for office floorspace  
6.3 The Council’s Employment Land Study ,
,  October 2021 forecasts a demand 
of 60,500 sq m of net additional office floorspace by 2043. This is a level 
that reflects the health of our business sector and the ongoing growth of 
our creative industries , a sector well represented across the B orough.  
However, it is also a level which reflects the different ways we are likely to work in a post -pandemic era.  
 
6.4 The Council  will try to meet this demand so that the B orough, and its 
residents, can reap the benefits  associated with the provision of the 
diverse mix of business premises.  
 
6.5 There are likely to be a num ber of elements in meeting this need. We will 
need to protect  the offices that we do have; we must continue to work with 
developers to encourage those proposals  which have planning permission 
to be delivered; and we will have to find new opportunities  for new 
business development.  Many of these will be associated with the 
intensification of existing sites, be this within, or outside our Employment Zones and our larger town centres , or through the creation of commercial 
space in our Opportunity Areas .  H. Intensif ication of existing and new  industrial uses are supported 
within Employment Zones, the Opportunity Areas and other 
areas where it can be demonstrated that residential living 
conditions are not harmed. 
Employment Zones 
I. Promote Employment Zones as : 
1) centres for innovation, locations for large and small 
businesses and workshops,  
2) places for other town centres uses, where such uses 
contribute to the vitality of the zone and to the wider area.  
J. In the Kensal, Lots Road and those parts of the Freston/Latimer 
Road Employment Zone which lie south of the Westway: 
support the creation of residential floorspace where it is shown 
to bring a significant uplift in both the quantity and the quality of 
the business uses on site.  
K. In the Freston/ Latimer Road Employment Zone north of the 
Westway: support the creation of residential floorspace where 
the exi sting commercial floorspace is retained or re- provided 
and where its quality is improved. 
L. All development within the Employment Zone must  comply with 
the agent of change principle.  
159 
  
Protecting existing office floorspace  
6.6 The Council recognise s that planning permission will not be required for 
the loss of some offices to an alternative Class  E “commercial, business 
and service use”. Some of these changes of use may not be welcomed, 
whilst others may. The Council’s policies do not to relate to any change of use which does not require planning permission.  
 
6.7 W here the loss of the office is not to an alternative C lass E use, planning 
permission will be required, and ordinarily any loss be will resi sted. 
However, we do recognise t hat there may be circumstances  when a 
change of use may be beneficial. This may include an office being used as 
a warehouse; a use which directly serves the needs of the communit y or; 
when within a town centre, being used as another town centre use which may support the viability of the centre.     
 
6.8 The Council has an Article 4 direction in place which means that planning 
permission is still required for the change of use of most  Class E use to a 
new home.
159 Whilst the Council generally welcome the provi sion of new 
homes, this  must not be at the expense of business uses.   
 
 
159 The parts of  the borough covered by the Article 4 direction removing the freedoms offered under 
Class MA of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the GPDO (2015) can be viewed on the Council’s website.

Figure 6.2: Areas where Article 4 Direction for removal of Permitted Development Rights 
for changes of use from Class E (Commercial, Business and Service Uses) to Class C3

6.9 The Council recognises that that the reconfiguration and re- provisi on of 
business floorspace with a single property, or a number of properties in an 
area, can result in the more efficient use of space. However, the Council will resist land use swaps where these result in a reduction in the diversity of the types of offices on offer. The Council will not support the loss of an office within an accessible high value area within a town centre to a more peripheral location in another part of the B orough. The Council will also 
resist proposals that would result in the reduction in the quality of office 
floorspace, such as with underground rooms or in spaces without windows and natural ventilation.    
New offices  
6.10 The London Plan notes that as a “ main  town centre use” any proposal 
which includes the provision of new offices (when they are not in 
 
161 
 accordance with the Development Plan) will be subject to the provisions of 
the town centres first principle, the sequential test and where appropriate, require an impact assessment.   
 
6.11 The Council will, therefore, direct new large scale offices (1,000 sq m + GEA) to town centres, to edge of centre sites, to other accessible areas. An accessible location is one with a Public Transport Accessibility (PTAL) score i s 4 of greater. This will allow new  offices to support the conti nued 
viability of the town centres and ensure that as many people as possible can reach these areas by public transport, or by foot or bicycle. Large 
scale offices may be appropriate in other areas, and in particular the Employment Zones, when shown to meet the requirements of the sequential test  and where this is supported by proportionate  
improvements to walking, cycling and public transport connectivity and capacity.  Outside of our larger town centres it is the Employment Zones 
that are the main concentrations of commercial uses, and centres of 
economic activity.   
 
6.12 While medium -size (3 00 to 1,000 sq m (GEA )) and small offices  (100 to 
300 sq m  (GEA) ) do benefit from proximity to a town centr e, their 
distribution across the Borough shows that they can also thrive in other 
locations. They are an integral part of the mix of premises available to those who wish to locate, or expand their business within the B orough. As 
such, they will be supported throughout the B orough.  
 
6.13 The Council will also require the provision of business uses within both the Earl’s Court and West Kensington and Kensal Canalside Opportunity Areas. The scale required will reflect the London Plan designation.  Business space will help create an active use and create a sense of place.  
Details are included in Chapter 10 : Site Allocation s. 
Industrial and warehouse uses  
6.14 The Council’s Employment Land Study, October 2021 has considered the 
future need for industrial floorspace over the lifetime of the plan. It has 
identified  a modest  additional need of 9,000 sq m. We recognise that the 
development economics of the B orough means that new industrial 
floorspace is very unlikely to come forward.  Therefore, the most appropriate approach is to protect those industrial uses that we do have and to encourage the provision or intensification of industrial uses when they come forward. This may include within our Employment Zones or the Opportunity Areas where industrial/light industrial uses may form part of the mix of active uses which make these areas successful.  Light industrial uses may also be suitable for smaller sites, such as beneath railway arches, where the Council is satisfied that they will not harm the living conditions  of those living nearby.  
 
6.15 This will help us provide for a type of premises which  meet the 
employment needs of a particular sector of our residents, and which support the role that our borough has as an area which will provide for the  
162 
 essential services to London’s Central Activities Zone.  This may i nclude 
sustainable ‘last mile’ distribution/ logistics and ‘just -in-time’ servicing such 
as food service activities, printing, administrative and support services. It 
will also,  in the case of car repair garages, help protect a valued local 
service.  
6.16 The Council recognises that much of our industrial stock will be considered to be “light industrial”, a Class E use. Planning permission will not be required for this to a change to an alternative C lass E use. 
 
6.17 The Borough contains a small number of storage and distribution uses. 
Whilst these are not of a scale that serve a strategic function they do provide a particular service used by both residents and by the small businesses scattered across the Borough. As with industrial premises, this 
dwindling sector is under pressure fr om changes of use to higher value 
uses. Whilst loss to an office or light industrial  use may see a change of 
function it will ensure that the important business function is retained.  
 
6.18 Where an applicant can demonstrate that there are no strong economic reasons to retain a warehouse use, the loss to a non- business use may be 
appropriate. However, the Council will have regard to the length of time that the warehouse has been in operation and must be satisfied that the warehouse use is established. Where this is not the case,  the Council will 
have regard to the contribution that the previous use had in meeting the ambitions of the Local Plan.  
Employment Zones 
6.19 The Borough’s Employment Zones continue to evolve from being 
concentrations of industrial, warehousing and office uses to highly dynamic employment areas so popular with the creative industries. If these areas are to become the innovation districts of the future they must be allowed to provide a wide range of premises to attract the widest range of businesses and occupiers. To this end, the Council will support the provision of a spectrum of business types and premises which allow these 
areas to grow and to thrive. There is a need for warehousing,  for micro -
offices for start- up businesses, the premises suitable for the larger well 
established businesses, and for everything in between. The C ouncil’s  
ambition for the Employment Zones is set out in C hapter  9. 
 
6.20 The boundaries of the Employment Zones are shown on the proposals 
map and on the digital map on the planning pages of the Council’s website . 
 
6.21 The Council  also notes the flexibility of use allowed by Class E. We do not 
wish to constrain this flexibility, recognising that many of these more traditional “town centre uses”  can greatly contribute to the commercial  
function of the Employment Zones. Gyms  or shops , for example, can 
provide a service to workers, whilst cafes  and restaurants  can become 
impromptu  meeting or working sp aces.     
163 
  
6.22 The Council recognises that whilst many of these changes of use no 
longer require planning permission, the creation of new space does. In these circumstances the Council will ensure that the wider business function of our Employment Zones is maintained. This may include a mix of Class E uses  as well as light industrial or warehousing uses . 
 
6.23 For clarity it should be noted that whilst the Employment Zones may be 
suitable for new town centre uses, they have not been identified as locations for new town centres. As set out in Policy TC1 , new town centre 
uses may be subject to the sequential test and an impact assessment.  
 
6.24 The Council recognises that our Employment Zones are locations which may have the potential to accommodate new homes. These new homes , 
be they part of residential or business led redevelopment,  may also 
introduce “value” into an area and help deliver new business floorspace.  
In order to ensure that the business potential of these zones is enhanced, residential uses will  normally  only be permitted when they also include a 
significant uplift in business floorspace. This floorspace must be at least of 
equal quality as that which currently exists.  
 
6.25 The only exception will be in those parts of the Freston/ Latimer Road Employment Zone which lie north of the Westway and within the area covered by the St Quintin and Woodland’s Neighbourhood Plan, the 
document which forms part of our  development plan. In order to reflect 
these locally determined policies and the more marginal nature of the commercial market in this small area, the Council will require new development to retain, or re -provide,  existing commercial floorspace but 
does not require an additional uplift in the quantum of this commercial floorspace.    
 
6.26 It is essential that the commercial function of an Employment Zone is not jeopardised  by the introduction /expansion of residential  uses. This will 
normally be ensured by appropriate design, through the retention of existing commercial floorspace, and through the maintenance of the 
business function of ground floor frontages. If the Council is not satisfied that the business function can be retained, the introduction of residential floorspace will be resisted.  
 
6.27 The Council recognises that the introduction of housing into an otherwise commercial area can cause difficulties. In line with the ‘ agent of change’ 
principle, any new development must be designed to ensure that pre-
existing uses can continue to operate or grow without unreasonable 
restrictions being placed on them . This could include, for example, the 
separation of residential and business elements, or the installation of effect ive noise insulation within the newly built homes.  
 
6.28 The Council expects all new housing being provided within the three Employment Zones to comply with the other policies in the plan. This  
164 
 includes the requirements for the provision of Community Housing as  set 
out in Policy HO3 and the requirements relating to Housing Size and 
Standards (Policy HO4).  
SAVED Policy BC2: Creative and Cultural Businesses 
Policy BC3: Affordable Workspace  
 
6.29 Average rents for offices and other business premises have risen significantly in  recent years  and the Borough is becoming increasingly 
unaffordable for many of our existing businesses as well as those looking to set up in the B orough for the first time. This is a particular issue for the BC3: Affordable Workspace  
A. The Opportunity Areas  
1. Earl’s Court O pportunity Area – A minimum of 10 per cent  
of the E(g) business floorspace on the site to be affordable 
workspace, with an upper limit subject to an assessment of 
need. This affordable workspace must be provided at a 
capped rate of at least 50 per cent  less than the prevailing 
market rate for comp arable premises in perpetuity . 
2. Kensal Canalside  O pportunity Area  – A minimum of 500 
sq m of affordable workspace, or a minimum of 10 per cent  
of any E(g) business floorspace provided on the 
Opportunity Area, if more than 5,000 sq m of E(g) 
floorspace is provided.  This affordable workspace must be 
provided at a capped rate of at least 50 per cent  less than 
the prevailing market rate for a period of at least 20 years.  
B. For all other sites, n ew developments that provide an uplift  of 
more than 5,000 sq m (GIA)  of Class E(g) business floorspace 
must provide affordable workspace, equating to a minimum of 
10 per cent  of the additional employment floorspace (GIA).   
1. For development in CIL charging zones F and H shown in 
Figure 6.3, thi s affordable workspace must be provided at 
a capped rate of at least 50 per cent  less than the 
prevailing market rate for comparable premises for a 
period of at least 20 years;  
2. For development in all other locations this affordable 
workspace must be provided at a capped rate of at least 
50 per cent  less than the prevailing market rate for 
comparable premises in perpetuity.  
C. New affordable workspace must  be provided on site.    
165 
 creatives and smaller or micro businesses who are generally more cost -
conscious and sensitive to rising rents. These are very much the type of 
business that make up the core of the B orough’s thriving business sector.   
 
6.30 In this context, the Council uses the London Plan ’s definition of affordable 
worksp ace as set out in Policy E3.  Affordable workspace is considered to 
be new -build employment floorspace provided at rents maintained below 
the market rates for that space for a specific social, cultural or economic development purpose. The Council expects this workspace to be operated and managed by a specialist workspace provider  or by the developer itself , 
as approved by the Council.  The discount required is that to the specialist 
provider and not to the end user, although it may be that a reduction in rent may be part of the offer provided by the specialist provider.   
 
6.31 All proposals which provide affordable workspace must prepare an Affordable Workspace Statement to be submitted alongside the relevant 
planning application, or where appropriate at the pre-a pplication stage.  
This will include details of how the provider will add social value, be this, 
for example, through rent affordability, through local employment opportunities, business mentoring and networking, apprenticeship opportunities or by cross -subsidy from more established firms to emerging 
firms operating in the low income sectors.  
 
6.32 The Borough’s Opportunity Areas are both sites where the scale of business development is appropriate for the provision of affordable workspace. The nature of this workspace will be of a type that can assist in the making of the pl ace. 
 
6.33 Given the Council will only require the provision of affordable workspace for proposals on large sites where at least 5,000 sq m of additional E(g) 
business  floor space is being provided the associated affordable 
workspace will be of a scale that can successfully operate in its own right. 
Given the paucity of sites of this type, this space must be provided in kind and on site.    
 
6.34 The affordable workspace should be made available for occupation at the same time as, or prior to, the first occupation of  50 per cent  of the non 
affordable element  of the remaining  economic floorspace in the 
development .

 7 Social Infrastructure  
Introduction 
7.1 For a B orough to function properly it must provide the uses which will meet 
the needs of those who live within it. This goes beyond places to shop, or 
places to work, and include those uses which are essential to the health 
and well -being of all our communities. These are the uses which allow us 
to educate our children, keep us healthy and bring people together and help make the Borough the place that it is.  
7.2 The Local Plan must  ensure that we have the right social infrastructure in 
the right places, both now and in the future. Properly done, this will allow us to build upon our walkable communities ’ or to make sure that everyone 
has access to the facilities they need. This will depend on the nature of the use, so while it may be fine to drive to a hospital, nowhere in the B orough 
should be more than a short walk  from a GP surgery.  
Key facts 
• 95 per cent  of the Borough lies within 400 m from a shopping centre.  
• 85 per cent  of the Borough lies within 800 m from a GP Surgery.  
• 94 per cent  of the Borough lies within 800 m from a primary school.  
• We are home to three NHS hospitals.  
• We have two  six form colleges, six  secondary schools, 27 primary 
schools and two  special schools.

 Policy S I1: Social  Infrastructure and Facilities 
SI1: Social  Infrastructure and Facilities 
A. The Council will ensure that s ocial and community uses are 
protected or enhanced throughout the B orough and will 
support the provision of new facilities.  
New social and community use s 
B. The Council will support the provision of new and the 
expansion of existing, social and community uses which 
predominantly serve, or which provide significant benefits 
to, borough residents, except where the proposal results in 
a shared or communal residential/social and community 
entrance.  
C. Where new facilities are provided, they should seek to make 
the best use of land and co- locat e a range of social and 
community uses where possible. The new provision should 
be well -designed, inclusive and easily accessible.  
Existing social and community uses 
D. The following sequential approach must be followed for 
existi ng social and community use:  
1. Protect land and/or buildings where the current use is or 
the last use was a social or community use, for re- use for 
the same, similar or related use.  
2. Permit the change of use of land and/ or buildings where 
the current or last  use was a social or community use 
from one social and community use to another social and 
community use which predominantly serves, or which 
provides significant benefits to b orough residents and 
where it is demonstrated that there is a greater benefit to 
the Borough resulting from this change of use.  
3. Permit  enabling development on land and/or  buildings 
where the current use is , or the last use was a social and 
community use in order to: significantly improve that use; 
provide another social and community use on site; 
significantly improve or provide new social and 
community uses elsewhere within the B orough and 
where it can be demonstrated that there is a greater 
benefit to the B orough resulting from this enabling 
development.  
  
170 
 Social and community facilities definition 
7.3 Social and community facilities are identified within the London Plan as a 
range of services and facilities that meet local and strategic needs and contribute towards a good quality of life. Their r ole in stimulating a sense of 
community and providing valuable social infrastructure is recognis ed 
through the protection and enhancement of these facilities, and is essential 
to the B orough’s status as one of London’s most desirable places to live.  
7.4 For the purposes of Policy SI1,  social and community uses are gr ouped 
into seven broad categories and are defined as follows:  
• Health and social care facilities, including (both private and NHS) GP practices, hospitals, community pharmacists, dental surgeries and 
other diagnostic and healthcare services . 
• Education and childcare facilities, including primary  and secondary, 
private and grant maintained, schools, creches, nurseries and youth facilities, as well as colleges and universities. It also includes Special Educational Needs and Disability provision and Further Educ ation 
provision. 
• Play and recreation f acilities , appropriate for all age groups, 
including early years, older children and teenagers . 
• Sports and recreation facilities , including sport halls, playing fields, 
playing pitches,  leisure centres, swimming pools, gyms, small fitness 
studios and river -based recreational facilities . 
• Cultural uses, including galleries, theatres, museums, rehearsal and dance studios, auction houses, exhibition spaces, cinemas . 
• Uses supporting the emergency sectors, including fire stations, 
police stations . 
• Other ‘valued use’ . These include (but are not restricted to) uses such 
as launderettes, public houses, pharmacies, post offices, petrol filling 
stations, libraries, community meeting rooms, places of  worship and 
bespoke premises for the voluntary sector.  
7.5 For clarity, th e Council consider s residential hostels catering to the 
vulnerable and care homes as housing, described in more detail in 
Chapter 3.  
7.6 The role of social infrastructure in developing strong and inclusive 
communit ies cannot be underestimated. The Borough’s c ommunity 
infrastructure needs will be kept under review to ensure they continue to be met. We will work with providers of local services to review existing provision, to identify future needs, and ensure the most efficient use of land in delivering services, with particular use made of the Infrastructure 
Delivery  Plan (IDP) .  
171 
 New social and community uses 
7.7 Where  new social and community facilities are provided as  part of a 
mixed -use development, they should be well -designed, inclusive and 
preferably  located on the ground level  to ensure accessibility. When 
provided on other floors these spaces must  be of high quality and should 
be easily accessible to the intended community.  Shared entrance with 
residential development  should be avoided as  this can impact on 
residential living con ditions  or vice versa.  
7.8 Co-location of a range of  social and community uses is strongly supported 
in the London Plan. Co-location can help facilitate the creation of new civic 
hubs and enable the best use of land available but it can also facilitate 
social interactions by bringing together diverse uses. The Council 
recognises the opportunities co- location presents and will encourage it  
where possible.  
Existing social and community uses  
7.9 The difference in land values between residential and social and 
community uses means that robust policies aiming to protect these valued 
uses are essential, so the present land bank of sites in these uses is maintained and preserved for future generations.  
7.10 Following  the introduction of the use class E and the flexibility this offers , 
the Council is unable to protect some social and community uses . 
Changes within  Class E do  not constitute development and therefore are 
not subject to planning control. However, s hould a Class E social and 
community us e change to a different use class (for example to sui 
generis), it would be subject to Policy SI1.   
7.11 The Council also acknowledges that the needs of communities change as 
well as the frameworks in which some of the social infrastructure providers 
operate. Therefore, while criterion D(1) of Policy SI1 requires the same or 
similar use or related use, if this need cannot be demonstrated other types 
of social and community uses can be provided. Robust evidence in the form of prolonged marketing and local needs assessment of social and 
community infrastructure should be submitted to demonstrate why criterion 
D(1) cannot be met. Similar evidence will be required if criterion D(2) also 
cannot be met. Where a proposal is seeking to meet the policy requirements to demonstrate b enefits to the local community or the 
Borough, evidence should be submitted in the form of a local needs 
assessment of social and community infrastructure need and the applicant 
should justify in some detail how the local community will be serve d by the 
development . 
7.12 Criterion D(3) of Policy SI1 can only be applied where the sequential 
approach has been followed and robustly demonstrated as set out above.

 8 Streets and Transport  
Introduction 
8.1 The quality of the B orough's streets is of national renown and, along with 
the cultural and commercial centres of the B orough, it is a key factor in 
making Kensington and Chelsea such an attractive place. Protecting and 
enhancing this heritage is a key objective for the Council and developers. Ensuring that new development does not worsen traffic and parking congestion is a key part of this. Given that the majority of the B orough’s 
streets were designed and laid out before the advent of the car this is a challenge, despite B orough residents having some of the lowest levels of 
car ownership in the country.  
8.2 The Borough’s streets should allow for eas e of movement  within a safe, 
healthy and green environment. To this end, the Mayor of London has defined a “Healthy Streets” approach within the London Plan that is  
reflected here. In  order to improve air quality, cut carbon emissions, 
reduce road traffic casualties, accommodate any growth in population and promote the health benefits of active travel, we need to continue to support walking, cycling and public transport , whilst managing motorised traffic as 
effectively as possible.  
Policy T1: Street Network 
T1: Street Network 
New Streets 
A. In areas of  large scale redevelopment, the Council will require 
new street network s to be inspired by the B orough’s historic 
street patterns to ensure optimal connectivity and accessibility . 
 
B. New street networks must  be established with a clear function, 
hierarchy and choice of routes, designed to optimise 
connectivity, accessibility and legibility, and to reflect the 
historic and finely grained block structure of the B orough. 
C. New streets to be designed to give priority to pedestrian and 
cyclist movement, be attractive, safe, provide planting, minimise 
opportunities for crime, and be inclusive to all, in line with the  
Healthy Streets approach 
D. New streets to be built to adoptable standards . 
E. Development that provides new links and removes barriers that 
disconnect access for pedestrians, cyclists and people with 
limited mobility is encouraged. The development of new gated  
173 
 communities and development that restricts access for 
pedestrians, cyclists and people with limited mobility to existing 
streets will be resisted.    
Existing Streets 
F. Development that changes  the existing street network including 
the addition or modification of accesses, street layouts and road 
crossings must serve to (i) improve street safety  in line with the 
Vision Zero approach,  (ii) provide for ease of movement for all 
pedestrian groups  (iii) contribute positively to the Healthy 
Streets  score.  
A connected and inclusive street network  
8.
3 “ Street network ” is about the role streets play in connecting places and the 
ease with which people can move from one place to another in the 
Borough.  Streets need to be adapt able to changing priorities, particularly in 
contributing to making the bor ough green, inclusive and liveable,  and in 
giving greater priority to active modes.  
8.4 The Borough’s historic streetscape is generally permeable and offers 
excellent connectivity, but there are areas where this has been eroded or 
there are barriers created by  infrastructure, changes to the original street 
pattern, or even open spaces  such as cemeteries . Improved co- ordination 
of the B orough’s street  form enhances the experience for pedestrians, 
cyclist and drivers . It provides for safer  routes to school, contributes to 
road safety, reduces the need to travel, improves the accessibility of 
London’s transport system and access to local services , contrib uting to 
social  inclusion.  
8.5 The public realm, particularly the street network, plays a vital role in 
providing good transport and mobility . Where the street network is less 
well connected opportunities should be taken to improve connectivity by breaking down or otherwise overcoming barriers.  
8.6 Road hierarchy is an important component of any street network. It helps  to navigate the built environment  and should facilitate safe and efficient  
movement through an area, especially for pedestrians and cyclists. Modal 
filters  designed to exclude through motorised traffic can be useful to that 
end.   
8.7 The provision of directional and way marking signage for pedestrians and cyclists within the street network makes getting around easier. Land uses that generate significant travel demand will be expected to contribute towards projects that improve wayfinding. Modifications to the B orough’s 
street network will be assessed against the Mayor’s H ealthy Streets 
Indicators.  
  
174 
 A safe public street network 
8.8 To ensure the public function of the road network is fulfilled, roads are 
‘adopted’ by the local authority. This ensures that they are built to proper standards and maintained for the expected levels of different types of 
traffic and pedestrians. Designing  streets so that they appear  as a 
continuation of the surrounding streetscape also contributes to protecting 
the charact er of the Borough, ensur ing a level of uniformity and so aiding , 
to an extent, social cohesion.  
8.9 Designing out opportunities for crime and making design more inclusive, particularly when it comes to the public realm and streets , is a positive 
step to creating a safer commun ity. 
SAVED Policy T 2: Three -dimensional  street form  
Policy T 3: Living streets  and outdoor life  
T3: Living streets and outdoor life  
A. Require opportunities to be taken within the street environment 
to create places  that support outdoor life, inclusive to all, adding 
to their attractiveness and vitality.  
Al fresco hospitality  
B. Support proposals for outdoor hospitality uses  that:  
1. contribute positively to the street scape by improving the 
visual and functional qualities of our streets ,  
2. maintain the safe, secure passage of pedestrians including 
those with mobility  needs and  
3. are proportionate in scale to their context.  
 
Markets 
C. Support proposals  for markets (including changes to existing 
markets ) on the public highway that  demonstrate that :  
1. sufficient  local acces s would be maintained; and  
2. satisfactory waste management  and traffic  management 
measures would be put in place.  
 
D. New isolated street trading pitches must contribute to the 
character and appearance of the street, have  no adverse  
175 
 impact on existing shops a nd residential amenity and allow  for 
the safe and secure passage of pedestrians.  
Events  
E. Require that the occasional or temporary use of parks, gardens 
and open spaces for special events be well managed, and that 
in the duration, frequency and scale they have no adverse 
impact upon:  
1. local residential amenity;  
2. the setting of historic listed buildings ; 
3. the setting of registered p arks and g ardens;  
4. the character and appearance of conservation areas;  
5. the predominant use as open space, taking the 
cumulative impact  into account;  
6. the road network ; 
7. biodiversity,  wildlife habitats and the quality of the natural 
environment.   
F. Require the submission of an Events Management Plan and a 
Management Strategy as part of a planning application for 
repeated use of an open space. 
8.10 The Bor ough is highly built -up and leads residents and visitors alike to put 
high value on all open spaces. The Council is therefore keen to maximise 
the benefit of the public realm by encouraging the shared use of public spaces.  
8.11 Not only does the public realm  have aesthetic value, but the outdoor 
spaces that make up our public realm also promote individual health and social well- being. This is achieved by the provision of opportunities for 
physical activity and of meeting places for social interaction.  The public 
realm also provides a source of local economy with our streets, squares, open spaces, parks and townscapes attracting many visitors, which in turn encourage enterprise, helping to keep local people in employment . 
Supporting al fresco hospitalit y  
8.12 The Council has long recognised the positive contribution that outdoor hospitality makes to enlivening our streets and creating attractive and successful places for residents and visitors to enjoy. For example, outdoor seating is key to the success of P avilion Road and Bute Street as 
destination s. During the Coronavirus pandemic, when indoor dining was 
restricted, the opportunity to eat outdoors was valued and enjoyed by many who live, work or visit the B orough. Many new outdoor venues 
opened up and they  have generally been very well received, safe and 
inviting. They have served to support our hospitality businesses and in turn the Borough’s local economy. In January 2022 the Council adopted a 176 Council policy to support al fresco dining on streets and publ ic space s. 
Applicants should have regard to the Council's published guidance on 
Supporting al fresco dining in Kensington and Chelsea.   
Markets 
8.13 Street traders, pavement cafés and festivals all bring life to the public realm, with Portobello Market, Duke of  York’s Square and the Notting Hill 
Carnival being good examples. However, the multifunctional use of space in the public realm needs to be carefully managed to ensure that it is inclusive and all users are catered for in a safe and successful manner. Even t management plans and management strategies for temporary and 
occasional uses can ensure that matters such as public health, pedestrian and traffic safety and waste management and the maintenance of access to public open space are all taken into account.  
Temporary use of open spaces 
8.14 Compared to other London boroughs there is a small amount of publicly accessible parks, gardens and open space. This makes any open space 
that does exist a precious asset. These spaces need to maintain their primary use as publicly accessible  and visibly open space. Special events 
held within open spaces need to be managed accordingly.  
Policy T4: Streetscape 
T4: Streetscape  
A.Require improvements to the visual, functional and inclusive
quality of our streets, ensuring they are designed and
maintained to a very high standard, that street clutter is
removed and that street furniture, advertisements and signs are
carefully controlled to avoid clutter to support the Council’s aim
of driving up the quality of the B orough’s streetscape.
B.All work to, or affecting, the public highway  must  be carried out
in accordance with the Council’s Streetscape Guid e.
1. Remove redundant street furniture.
2. Retain, and seek the maintenance and repair of, historic
street furniture such as post boxes and red Gilbert Scott
telephone boxes , where this does not adversely impact on
the safe functioning of the street .
3. Where there is an exceptional need for new street
furniture , it must be of high- quality  design and
construction, and placed with great care, so as to relate
well to the character and function of the street .177 4. Resist adverts , including on street furniture, that by reason
of size, siting, design, materials or method of illumination
harm amenity or public or road safety .
5. Resist freestanding structures such as telephone kiosks
where the function for the display of  adverts dominates
the primary purpose for the structure, whether sited on
streets, fore courts or roadsides .
6. Resist pavement crossovers and forecourt parking.
7. Resist the construction of  high garden walls and fences
along street boundaries .
Public Art  
C. All major development must  contribute to delivering new arts
and culture in line with the Council ’s Culture Plan that is of high
quality. This may  either  be on-site or where such on- site
provision is not  appropriate, through planning contributions
towards delivering the Council ’s Culture Plan.
Streetscape 
8.15
 The Council has produced online guidance entitled the Streetscape Guide 
which forms a reference manual of good practice for all concerned with the design and implementation of streetscape schemes and the maintenance 
of the highway. Development proposals will be assessed on whether they have taken opportunities to contribute positively towards achieving, maintaining or improving a good streetscape.  A new edition of the 
Streetscape Guide is expected to be published in 2023.  
Street function and l ayout  
8.16 New development increases the pressure on our streets by generating additional pedestrian and vehicular traffic, additional demand for parking and on street servicing and by increasing their use as places in which to spend time. These increased demands can compromise the functioning of streets and often cannot be accommodated without modifications to the street layout. Streetscape improvements will be required to mitigate development impacts on the functioning of our streets. Such interventions, 
related in scale and kind to the development, will be necessary to make development acceptable in planning terms.  At the same time, new 
developments create opportunities  to the improve the public realm and 
these should be taken.  
Street furniture and adverti sements 
8.17 Much of the B orough lies within designated conservation areas. The 
Council has a duty to ensure that new development within a conservation 
area preserves or enhances the character or appearance of that area. 178 Street furniture, such as guardrails , signs  and redundant  telephone kiosks, 
can both detract from this local character and hinder the safe passage for 
people with sensory and mobility difficulties.   
8.18 The excellent quality of our public realm is constantly under threat from poorly designed or uncoordinated development and the paraphernalia 
used to control traffic and pedestrians, public utility equipment, street 
furniture and advertising. This undermines the very quality that everyone values.  
8.19 Advertising hoardings and freestanding adverts can have a negative impact on visual amenity and can also have serious implications for public and road safety.  
Front gardens 
8.20 Front gardens offer a valuable contribution to the streetscape. The loss of front gardens to off -street  parking has long had harmful effects upon visual 
amenity and townscape quality. It can also reduce public safety.  The 
introduction of high opaque garden walls  that give a closed feel to the 
streetscape has also had harmful effects .  
Public Art  
8.21 Arts and culture can promote civic pride and help create of a sense of place and promote local  distinctiveness. The Council has developed a 
Culture Plan . The Council expects the concept and execution of arts and 
culture provision to be of a high standard and quality .  
Policy T 5: Land use and Transport 
T5: Land use and Transport 
A. Require  development to be located in suitable areas where the
transport requirements can be met in a sustainable manner,
and which actively encourages travel by sustainable modes.
B.High trip generating development to be located in areas of the
Borough where public transport accessibility has a PTAL score
of 4 or above and where there is sufficient public transport
capacity,  or that will ac hieve PTAL 4 and provide sufficient
capacity as a result of committed improvements to public
transport.
C.Large scale developments are required to submit Transport
Assessments and Travel Plans .179 D.Resist the loss of buildings and land used for public transport ,
active travel or related support functions (unless satisfactory
alternative facilities are provided).
Promoting sustai nable transport  
8.22 N ew development must  be appropriately located and must include from 
day one all the facilities needed to encourage walking, cycling and public 
transport use, while not encouraging the use of private cars. In other words , development must ‘build in’ sustainable travel patter ns from the 
outset  that support the realisation of walkable  neighbourhoods. This will 
involve the use of Travel Plans that include innovative facilities and measures to make walking, cycling and the use of public transport an attractive first choice.  
8.23 Development that generates a high number of new trips must be located in areas that have good public transport accessibility and where public 
transport has the capacity to accommodate the new demand. Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) 4 is recognised as a ‘good’ level of 
accessibility by Transport for London (TfL) and is the threshold at which 
the London Plan  requires car free development  for Inner London 
Boroughs.  The Council’s aim is to minimise the impact of new 
development on the transport network and maximise opportunities for sustainable tr avel.  Areas with a PTAL of 4 or higher are appropriate 
locations for high trip generating development  to achieve this aim . Higher 
density developments should generally be promoted in locations that ar e, 
or will be, well connected to jobs, services, infrastructure and amenities by public transport, walking and cyc ling.  180 Policy T 6: Active Travel    
T6: Active travel  
Promoting walking and cycling 
A. All new development to maximise trips made by sustainable
transport modes by making it easier and more attractive to walk
and cycle within the Borough.
B.Improvements  to the walking and cycling environment  are
required, including pedestrian and cycle links through new
developments  and through improving walking and cycling
routes to transport infrastructure, social infrastructure, green
spaces and  town centre uses . Necessary o ff-site improvements
shall be secured by planning obligation.
C.New development must incorporate measures to improve road
safety, and in particular the safety of walking  and cycling and
resist development that compromises road safety.
D.New development adjacent to the River Thames or Grand
Union Canal will be required to deliver improved access and
connections to the water for walking, cycling and recreation
alongside it.
Cycle park ing 
E.Development must  provide accessible, secure cycle parking
facilities and make provision for high quality ancillary facilities
that promote cycle usage including changing rooms, showers,
and lockers  in line with or above current  minimum standards .
Safeguarding public access 
F.Ensure that development does not reduce access to, or the
attractiveness of, existing footways and footpaths used by the
public, or land over which the public have a right of way.
Promoting wal king and cycling 
8.24 W alking and cycling as  space- efficient modes of tr avel are important in 
ensuring that new development  optimises the use of space and delivers  
crucial  environmental and health benefits . 
8.25 It is vital that new development serves to make the Borough more 
walkable and more conducive to cycling. New development has a 
significant role to play in strengthening and encouraging active t ravel 
within the Borough by providing improved and healthier spac es that offer  
improved permeability with direct, safe and attractive walking and cycling 181 links. This can be done by improving infrastructure, removing barriers to 
movement and by ensuring that all B orough residents live close to and are 
well connected to the amenities and services they need. Development 
contributions will sought to this end.   
8.26 There are significant barriers to increasing walking and cycling in some 
parts of  the Borough and significant improvements to the B orough’s 
streetscape are still needed. In particular many of the roads on the 
Transport for London road network continue to p resent a hostile 
environment to pedestrians and cyclists, despite containing important and well used routes. That said, the streetscape of much of the B orough is  of 
good quality , which can make walking and cycling a pleasant experience. 
Opportunity Area si tes at Earl's Court and Kensal provide significant 
development potential  and currently present significant barriers to 
movement in their respective parts of the Borough. It is essential that  
opportunities to provide cycle and pedestrian links and connectivity to 
surrounding areas and beyond should be taken.  
8.27 Despite measurable improvements to the safety of r oads within the 
Borough – the number of recorded road traffic casualties in the Borough 
has more than halved since 2005 – substantial improvements are required 
before all residents will feel safe and secure walking and cycling. Interv entions such as improved lighting, better road crossings and the 
provision of seating and cycle parking are needed if the benefits of active travel are to be realised by all.  
8.28 The enormous changes to travel patterns that have been seen as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic  provide an opportunity to increase levels of 
walking and especially cycling and new development should actively 
support this mode shift . 
Cycle routes 
8.29 The Council is committed to creating a borough- wide network of cycle 
routes  to en able more people to cycle . A plan of existing, approved,  and 
future potential cycle routes is included in  Figure 8.1 below . The Council 
will engage with Transport for London in respect of any  proposals for 
strategic cycle routes on the strategic Transport for London Road Network. 182 Figure 8.1 Cycle Routes Network 
Cycle Parking 
8.30 Cycle parking standards are set out in the London Plan 2021 and are 
expressed as minima. Additional bicycle hire docking stations or other shared micromobility facilities will be sought where appropriate.  
Safeguarding public access  
8.31 There are many footpaths and rights of way in the Borough that contribute towards creating an attractive and pleasant pedestrian environment. New development must not  compromise these routes or rights of way, either for 
pedestrians or other street users, and opportunities to improve them should be taken wherever possible.  
183  Policy T 7: Public Transport 
T7: Public transport 
A.Development to promote sustainable travel through the delivery
of enhancements to existing public transport infrastructure.
B.New developments must provide or contribute toward
improvements to public transport services, access to them and
interchange between them, giving priority to areas that current ly
have lower levels of accessibility .
C.Support improvements to West London Line services and
enhancements to facilities that improve access to the services.
Step -free access  
D.The Council will work with partners to ensure that step- free
access is delivered at all underground and rail stations,
requir ing new developments to contribute toward step- free
access and ensure it is delivered at U nderground and rail
stations in the B orough where there is a redevelopment
opportunity , giving priority to  those which deliver the greatest
overall benefits .
8.32 Public transport accessibility is generally good in much of the Borough but 
t
here are areas in the north west, along parts of the western boundary, 
along the River Thames and in the south west that are less accessible,  
particularly in terms of accessibility to the U nderground network.  
Buses  
8.33 There is an extensive bus network in the Borough. Over the last 20 years our focus has been on strengthening north- south bus connections within 
the Borough. We have secured devel opment contributions to that end 
under Local Plan policies and there have been modest improvements in north- south connectivity. Since the last Local Plan was adopted, London’s 
bus network has faced a multitude of challenges that have resulted in a trend towar ds the rationalisation of bus services, particularly in Inner 
London. It is now more important than ever that new development contributes to bus services, access to them and interchange between them.  
Rail 
8.34 The renaissance of the West London Line (WLL) and its incorporation within the London Overground network  is an opportunity to increase the 
public transport modal share. We wish to see more frequent trains on the WLL to improve the public transport offer in the Borough. The WLL does not currently serve N orth Kensington but a new station between 184 Shepherd’s Bush and Willesden Junction would beneficially improve public 
transport accessibility . Residents’ associations and rail user groups aspire 
for such a station, located just north of the Westway, to be known as 
‘Westway Circus ’. 
8.35 The Council recognises that an Elizabeth line station near Ladbroke Grove 
would transform transport links to North Kensington and offer considerable benefits to those living within, or working, in this part of the B orough. The 
Council,  working with Network Rail and Transport for London, has not yet 
been able to prove that the delivery of an Elizabeth line station at Kensal Canalside is feasible. No further feasibility work on the station is anticipated within the lifetime of the Local Plan. We intend to continue 
safeguarding the potential future site for a station which is on Network Rail land.  
8.36 The lands safeguarded for the future delivery of Crossrail 2, a regional rail 
line that would cross London via a station on the King’s Road, are included 
on the proposals map accompanying the L ocal Plan.  
Step -free access  
8.37 It is important that everyone can travel spontaneously and independently on public transport services. To this end it is important that as m any 
Underground stations as possible provide step free access. Earl’s Court remains the only fully step free Underground station in the Borough, although step- free access is due to be delivered at Knightsbridge in early 
2023.  There is a need to pursue opportunities for step- free funding from 
development as they arise, however due to the uncertainty of current and 
future funding for such facilities the delivery of all stations as step free within the lifespan of this Local Plan is highly improbable. In this  context 
there is a need to focus on funding those stations which would provide the greatest overall benefit including at Ladbroke Grove Station, High Street Kensington and South Kensington. The Council has made financial provisions to help support the delivery of step free facilities at these three stations.  
River services  
8.38 Limited river boat services are available from Cadogan P ier and from 
Chelsea Harbour Pier, nearby in Hammersmith and Fulham. The Council 
supports increased used of the river for passenger transport.  
Policy T 8: Car Parking 
T8: Car Parking 
A.Seek to minimise reliance on private car use arising from
new development and promote sustainable travel patterns by
managing congestion and the supply of car parking.185 B.Require it to be demonstrated that development will not
result in any material increase in traffic congestion or on-
street parking pressure.
C.All new additional residential development must be permit -
free. Car parking provided in new residential development
must be at or below the adopted car parking standards.
Parking in non- residential development must be for essential
need only.
D.All parking spaces within new development to be equipped
with electric vehicle  charging points.
E.Where a development creates new on- street parking, this
must be managed so that parking demand is controlled and
the need for off -street parking is minimised.
F.Resist new public car parks and the loss of off -street coach
parking.
Managing parking 
8.39
 The effective management of parking spaces and the management of 
parking demand is an important factor in influencing mode choice. W hilst 
in time, the likely widespread adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies, could have transformative effects on road conditions, the Borough’s streets and society generally, parking management  will continue 
to be a key tool given the prevalence of saturated parking conditions, local 
congestion, and poor level of a ir quality  across the whole Borough.  
8.40 Occupancy levels of on- street residents ’ and visitor parking bays  are h igh 
in most areas of the Borough despite the majority of households not 
having access to a car . Consequently,  demand for on- street parking from 
development must be managed. There is little scope, except in major redevelopment schemes, for new on- street parking to be created and 
where this is proposed , off-street  parking must be minimised to ensure 
there is no significant increase in parking demand or traffic congestion.  
8.41 The whole B orough is subject to one Controlled Parking Zone and 
therefore demand for parking from new development will not necessarily be focused in the area surrounding it. Permit -free agreements will be 
required for all new additional residential development. The C ouncil 
operates a Purple Badge scheme for people with disabilities living or working in the B orough. Purple Badge holders are exempt from the permit -
free requirements.  
Car parking standards 
8.42 Car parking standards for development are set out in the London P lan 
2021, and are expressed as maxima. Z ero levels of car parking are 186 encouraged in order to minimise the negative impacts of increased car use 
and traffic congestion.  In some locations and for some scales of 
development car parking will need to be below the maximum adopted standards in order to ensure the impacts of any additional car trips are acceptable.  
Traffic congestion and air quality 
8.43 The Borough’s road network is heavily constrained with limited possibility 
of capacity increases. Any significant increases in road traffic would have serious impacts on residential amenity. Some of the major road links into Central London from the west pass through the B orough, and these vital 
links will need to be maintained.  
8.44 Transport has an enormous impact  on air quality in the Borough, with many 
areas experiencing levels of pollution above government objective levels. Consequently , the entire B orough is designated an Air Quality Management 
Area.  This can be addressed by reducing congestion and by improving the 
environmental performance of the road traffic fleet .   
8.45 Electric vehicles are becoming more prevalent and new developments are required under the London Plan to provide one fifth of spaces with on- site 
charging points.  Whilst a move to electric vehicles will greatly reduce 
tailpipe emissions, it will not solve the issue of fine particles generated by braking and tyre wear. Walking and cycling remain the only truly zero-emission forms of transport , however any reductions in pollution that serve 
to encourage more walking and cycling will be doubly beneficial . 
Considering the relatively low levels of new off -street parking provided in 
the Borough and to support the Council’s 2040 carbon neutral target, and improving poor air quality, a more ambitious  requirement for off -street 
charging points is necessary.  
Policy T 9: Servicing 
T9: Servicing 
A.Servicing facilities and coach parking must be well designed,
built to accommodate the demands of new development and
minimise the number of servicing trips required. Facilities
should also be sensitively integrated into the development and
the surrounding townscape. In particular , servicing activities
and coach pick -up and drop- off should not give rise to traffic
congestion, conflict with pedestrians or be detrimental to
residential amenity.
B.Developments must provide sufficient on- site servicing space
where feasible, delivery consolidation floorspace, and coach
parking to accommodate the number and type of vehicles likely187 to be generated and to ensure that this can take place without 
manoeuvring on the highway . 
C.Require a Servicing Management Plan for all sites with on- site
servicing space that will control the hours of servicing, including
detail s on how vehicles will be managed, and controls on the
types and sizes of vehicles to ensure they are appropriate to
the local area and are environmentally acceptable.
D. All new developments with on- site servicing facilit ies must
provide sufficient electric vehicle charging points for the size
and number of vehicles likely to be generated.
E.New hotel developments including significant extensions to
existing hotels must provide coach drop- off and pick -up facilities
and a Coach Management Plan.
F.Where developments cannot provide onsite servicing space or
coach parking, appl icants must  demonstrate  that proposal can
function satisfactorily without giving rise to adverse effects on
traffic congestion, pedestrian safety, residential amenity or
impact on bus routes.  A Servicing Management Plan and/or
Coach Management Plan will be required in these instances .
G.Proposals for restaurants or take- aways, requiring planning
permission, must be supported by a Delivery Management Plan
to explain how any food delivery service would operate and to
demonstrate that there would be no resultant impact upon the
function of  the highway.
H.Proposals for larger developments, must be suppo rted by a
Delivery Management Plan  to explain how deliveries would be
consolidated (through use of a concierge or mail office) to limit
van traffic generation.
8.46 In recent years, a trend of falling traffic volumes has been reversed, largely 
due an i
ncrease in commercial vehicle traffic. Servicing requirements add 
to the already high demands on our roads and can be particularly harmful to the appearance and safe functioning of the street  if not suitably 
managed. 
8.47 Modern technological advances constantly shape the way we shop, work and our demand for travel through activities such as flexible working and internet shopping. Consumers who are now aware of the impact of private car use on traffic congestion, air quality and climate change, do not 
necessarily  recognise the link between their online shopping habits and 
the growth in the number of light vans on our streets . 
8.48 The servicing of sites, including coach and other vehicle parking, refuse storage and off -street loading bays, are essential for a site to function as 188 intended however there is a need to better manage servicing traffic in the 
Borough to ensure that developments  can be consolidated on- site such 
that overall vehicle requirements are reduced, and sites can accommodate 
delivery vehicles with improved environmental performance. The Council 
supports the use of cargo bic ycles and river freight to this end.  
Servici ng Management Plans 
8.49 Although the B orough is primarily residential in nature, there are several 
strategic traffic routes into and out of London which carry very high levels 
of traffic. Servicing in the B orough can give rise to traffic congestion, affect  
bus operations, conflict with pedestrians, and has the potential to create disturbance, particularly in or adjacent to residential areas. A Servicing Management Plan and/or Coach Management Plan will ensure the safe and effective movement of all service vehicles and minimise any  potential 
negative impacts on residential amenity, road function and pedestrian safety , including requiring that they occur outside of the busiest travel 
times . 
8.50 The provision of servicing is a balancing act. On one hand, the Council needs to ensure the safe and efficient management of servicing vehicles so that the road network is not hindered, while on the other, the Council wishes to ensure that the physical servicing area is not detrimental  to the 
character or appearance of an area, or detrimental to residential amenity. As the nature of the B orough is predominantly high density residential, the 
impacts of servicing can have a wider reaching impact and is therefore a matter of strategic importance.  189 9 Places - Areas for growth and change 
Introduction  
9.1 There are many distinctive Places in the Borough that give it its unique 
character and identity. Our communities take pride in their neighbourhoods 
and the Local Plan can help steer the right development to make these 
places even more successful. This will be guided by an understanding of the distinctive character of the Borough. Our Character Study, which identifies the Borough’s locally -distinctive character areas, will assist in this 
regard.  
9.2 This chapter highlights the many distinctive places within the Borough with varying levels of expected growth and sets out our Vision for them.  
Creating new neighbourhoods – Opportunity Areas 
9.3 There are two locations in the Borough where there is significant  capacity 
to build new homes and commercial space to create additional jobs. Kensal Canalside is a former gasworks and railway depot and is the largest brownfield site within the Borough. The site of the now demolished Earl’s Court Exhibition Centre provid es the second location for strategic 
development and growth in the Borough.  
9.4 These sites have been designated as two of the 48 Opportunity Areas in 
the London Plan. Opportunity Areas are London’s principal opportunities for accommodating large scale development to provide significant new 
employment and housing, with a mixed and intensive use of land and assisted by good public transport accessibility. Kensal Canalside lies wholly within RBKC, while the Earl’s Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area lies partially in LBHF.  
9.5 The Borough has an overall target to provide a minimum of 4,480 new homes over a ten- year period to 2028/29. The two Opportunity Areas are 
expected to deliver a significant quantum  of these homes, which will be 
later in the Plan period as  shown in the housing trajectory ( Appendix 1). 
9.6 In ter ms of employment, the London Plan sets an indicative capacity for 
jobs for each Opportunity Area, and this is then translated into the site 
allocations in this Local Plan so that the type and quantum of employment space can provide that number of jobs.  
9.7 It is vital that the Opportunity Areas are successful places, as well as 
providing homes and jobs. To create new neighbourhoods, they will need to be well integrated with their surroundings, supporting and complementing existing facilities, providing transport and social infrastructure together with green open spaces and opportunities for 
recreation and culture.  190 9.8 Developments  of such a large scale also present opportunities for 
innovative building design and exemplar sustainability standards, as part 
of the move to a circular economy.  
9.9 The requirements and design principles specific to each Opportunity Area 
are contained in their respective site allocations. See C hapter 3. The two 
Opportunity Areas and their  vision statements are included here:  
Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area 
9.10 Kensal Canalside lies in the very north of the Borough. The site sits close to borders with the London boroughs of Brent, Hammersmith and Fulham and Westminster. The Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation (OPDC) site adjoins the Opportunity Area site to the south west.  
9.11 The Kensal Canalside site is approximately 15.4 hectares. It is currently home to a large superstore, 16 homes, a third- sector community office 
building, an outdoor water activity centre with wharf, former railway land and sidings, a residential converted water tower and an underutilised former utilities site (gas holders).  
9.12 The site is split in two by the Great Western Mainline Railway. The Grand Union Canal forms the northern border of the site with the Grade I registered park and garden, Kensal Green Cemetery conservation area to its north. Ladbroke Grove forms the border to the east for the northern part of the site and Barlby Road sits to the south. The southern boundary consists of back gardens to the homes and residential estates of the Dalgarno ward.  The OPDC area sits to the west of the site and contains the western portion of the North Pole Railway Depot (east).  
9.13 The Council developed the Kensal Canalside SPD (2021) to help guide the development  of the site in conjunction with the landowners and local 
community. As part of this an encompassing vision has been developed. 191 Figure 9.1 : Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area  
PLV1:  Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area  
A.Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area will have been transformed from a
former gasworks  and railway depot into a thriving, well -connected mixed
and inclusive community  as per the Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area
SPD.
B. Prioritising affordable housing and infrastructure delivery the Council
supports  a high- density, environmentally sustainable and well -connected
development that can be delivered through high- quality architecture that
takes cues from the Borough’s urban form and existing typologies  and
townscape, public realm and open space, whilst appropriately managing
and mitigating the effects of climate change, pollution, water and waste.
192 Earl’s Court  Opportunity Area 
9.14 The Earl’s Court Opportunity Area site lies to the west of the Borough 
bordering the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, adjacent to 
the West London line. The surrounding area is largely residential in character with a range of different property types and tenures.   
9.15 The Earl’s Court  Opportunity Area site provides an opportunity for a new 
urban quarter to be created which will complement and enhance the existing District centre. It will be a destination in its own right , well served 
by existing public transport facilities which are in close proximity. A significant cultural facility , or facilities,  of world class  importance are 
anticipated together with a range of commercial and employment uses.    
Figure
 9.2: Earl’s C ourt Opportunity Area  
193 PLV2: Earl’s Court Opportunity Area  
A.The Opportunity Area will be come a lively  new urban quarter of cultural,
employment and residential uses  that is innovative, sustainable and
integrated with the surrounding neighbourhood.
B.A significant cultural facility of world class renown will res tore a distinctive
identity to the area and attract a variety of uses to make Earl’s Court a
vibrant destination , which will in turn enhance the wider neighbourhood
including the Earl’s Court Road District Centre.
C.A high quality public realm network made of streets and open spaces ,
including a public park,  will serve the needs of the local community and be
green and inclusive, offering continuity from the surrounding townscape
and new connections and routes within the site and through to key
destinations beyond.
Areas with potential for some change 
9.16 There are other parts of the Borough where change is envisaged, but it will 
not involve the quantum of good growth development provided at Kensal 
Canalside or Earl’s Court. These are areas with potential for some positive change which will involve being at  the vanguard of the carbon neutral 
agenda, the creation of successful mixed use development, improvements to the public realm and providing the necessary support for our town centres to remain as community hubs and for our higher order town centres to remain of national/ international reputation and importance.    
Lancaster West Estate and Notting Dale 
PLV3 : Lancaster West Estate and Notting Dale 
A.The Council is co- designing a vision for the Lancaster West Estate – and a
separate exercise for the ward as a whole - to become an eco-
neighbourhood that provides a model for the rest of the Borough, London
and the UK as a whole.
B.The Council’s ambition is for all of Notting Dale to be carbon neutral by
2040 with the Lancaster  West Estate becoming a 21st Century model for
social housing, that will also be carbon neutral by 2030.  The Council also
has ambitions for other estates and blocks in the ward including Silchester
Estate, Henry Dickens Estate, Nottingwood House, Allom House, Barlow
House, Bramley House, and other social housing in the ward to be carbon
neutral by 2030.194 C.The Notting Dale Heat Network will deliver zero- carbon heating and hot
water to Lancaster West Estate and other public buildings in Notting Dale
by 2030. The expectation is that there will be an oppor tunity for other
estates in the ward to join the network by 2030.
D.Given the above, all physical improvements and planned developments in
the area will be expected to meet or exceed the energy and environmental
standards set out in Chapter 4 of the Local P lan.
Figure 9.3 : Lancaster West Estate and Notting Dale 
9.17 The Council  considers that the area around Grenfell Tower and Lancaster 
Road (West) should be recognised as an area that will undergo positive 
change in partnership with residents, with the Lancaster West Neighbourhood Team providing  a range of Council  services and a  
dedicated point of community engagement in the area.  
9.18 The Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission has been s
 et up to ensure that 
the bereaved, survivors and North Kensington residents lead decision-
making on the long- term future of the Grenfell Tower site.  The Council 
recognises , and seeks  to assist  in this work, and through the Local Plan 
help in the provisi on of what is decided to be a suitable memorial.  
 
195 
 9.19 The Council has been working in partnership with local residents, through 
the Lancaster West Neighbourhood Team . As a result, alongside the 
commitment for Lancaster West to become a 21st century model for 
exemplary social housing, we also aim for it to be carbon neutral by 2030. The Council also has ambitions for other estates and blocks in the ward including Silchester Estate, Henry Dickens Estate, Nottingwood Hous e, 
Allom House, Barlow Ho use, Bramley House and other social housing in 
the ward to be carbon neutral by 2030. The Council’s ambition is for all of Notting Dale ward to be carbon neutral by 2040. The opportunity to connect properties in the ward to the Not ting Dale District Heatin g Network 
in the future will assist in meeting these ambitions.  
9.20 The C
 ouncil’s Lancaster West Neighbourhood Team is working with local 
residents to co- design a Future Neighbourhood Vision to become an eco-
neighbourhood that provides a model for the rest of the Borough, London 
and the UK as a whole. This includes building fabric, green energy, 
reducing waste, improving air quality, and creating green skills and jobs. This approach is intended to be replicated across the ward to the benefit of other housing es tates. An example of the innovative approach is the 
Notting Dale Heat Network, which will deliver zero carbon heating and hot water to Lancaster West Estate and other public buildings in Notting Dale by 2030. 
9.21 The Lancaster West  Future Neighbourhood Vision  will set out a road map 
to create an eco- neighbourhood, developing opportunities to deliver 
sustainable projects, increase social homes, improve accessibility to  
transport and housing and reduce social in equality . This approach will be 
replicated across the rest of Notting Dale to benefit residents in the local area.  
9.22 W e are working with all levels of government to explore the feasibility of 
improving the energy performance of all homes on the estate, and provide hot water and energy via renewable energy, rather than using fossil fuels as is currently the case.  The estate already hosts Kensington and 
Chelsea’s first low- energy council home in the Borough at Verity Close, 
which was completed in spring 2021.  
9.23 T he Council is committed to maximising investment opportunities to 
decarbonise homes across the ward as a whole, specifically Silchester Estate, Henry Dickens Estate, Nottingwood House, Allom House, Barlow House, Bramley House, and other social housing in the ward to be carbon-neutral by 2030.  
Priorities to achieve the vision  
1. Deliver on the projects identified in the co- designed Future 
Neighbourhood Vision for the area, which will improve energy performance of Council homes, generate green energy, improve ai r 
quality, and provide green jobs and training oppor tunities.   
196 
 2. Deliver the resident -led refurbishment of Lancaster West, and ensure 
that it is carbon- neutral by 2030.  
3. Deliver the Notting Dale Heat Network by 2030.  
4. Ensure other estates have the opportunity to connect to the Notting 
Dale Heat Network by 2030 and other properties in the ward have the opportunity by 2040.  
5. Ensure any new development or physical improvements work in the area towards delivering a net -zero carbon estate and eco-
neighbourhood by 2030. 
The Westway  
9.24 The Westway flyover and West Cross Route, built in the 1960s, passes east to west in the north of the Borough.  Approximately 23 acres of land sit below it and plays an important role in terms of employment land, the 
public realm and local context.  
9.25 The Westway Trust,  set up in partnership with the Council, manages the 
majority of the space underneath the raised A40 (Westway), which is owned by Transport for London. The land is used for a variety of commercial, industrial, retail, sports and community uses as well as a vintage clothing market.  These uses could be augmented and 
consolidated to provide further space for innovation, community and employment uses.     
9.26 Whilst the Westway has become a well established feature over the last 50 years , it still dominates the area visually and audibly and together with 
the West Cross route and the West London railway line creates a significant severance both within the area and access to the Borough boundary to the west.  
9.27 The eclectic mix of uses beneath the Westway includes leisure and sports facilities,  light industrial and storage, community and retail outlets. Whilst 
access along the space under the Westway is relatively good in the day there are a number of areas that do not have natural surveillance and there are pockets of l eftover  undeveloped land that become more 
unwelcoming during hours of darkness.  
9.28 There is the opportunity to improve connectivity, including pedestrian/cycle 
access to White City and Westfield and the Imperial College buildings to 
the east through a new underpass under the West London line, providing 
a better route beneath the Westway itself together with improvement to the public realm and improved security, both beneath and to the area immediately around the Westway.  
9.29 Opportunities should also be taken to improve the air quality along the 
Westway to ensure improved environment and continued use of the space is enjoyed by all.   197 Figure 9.4 : The Westway  
PLV4: The Westway Vision 
A.The land underneath the Westway will have been developed by the
Westway Trust to provide space for  innovation, employment, and
entrepreneurship alongside a well -connected and safe route beneath and
alongside the Westway together with improved public realm all of which
relates to the history, culture and local context.  Greater pedestrian/cycle
links will be developed east and west along the Westway with a new
underpass under the West London line to ensure greater connectivity  and
a much improved route.
Optimising employment areas  
9.30 Whilst the Borough is primarily residential in nature there are areas of  
concentrated employment generating uses.  Although relatively small in 
size they make an important contribution to the diversity of job opportunities and stock of business premises in the Borough whilst being vital to the Borough’s economic base.   
9.31 The types of commercial activities that operate in the Employment Zones have naturally led to a low -intensity, low -rise form of development. As we 
198 look to make best  use of land, there is an opportunity to optimise the 
Borough’s three Employment Zones, recognising that residential uses can 
unlock enhancements to the viability of wider improvements to the Employment Zones.   
9.32 It must, however, be clear that protecting and improving commercial spaces remains the priority for our Employment Zones. The provision of flexible and modern commercial space to meet the needs of local 
businesses will help ensure that they function primarily as areas that are important for employment. This is particularly important in light of the Covid pandemic , whereby flexibility, affordable workspace and diversity in 
offer are becoming increasingly in demand.   
9.33 In order to achieve both improvements to the employment offer in these areas and to optimise the sites, adding other uses such as housing could bring wider placemaking benefits as well as contributing to meeting housing need. Co- locating  commercial space, workshops, retail and 
residential is typical in the Borough; there are historic residential areas that have purpose- built studios and workshops. Mixed use areas have a rich 
character because many different activities are concentrated in one place. 
Ground floor shops, restaurants, workshops and other commercial uses bring activity and liveliness to the street. With this type of development, it is possible to add or improve commercial floor space as well as include flats on upper floors. This type of development can include refurbishing premises to help commercial uses to thrive, which also s upports 
businesses and jobs.  
9.34 The mix of uses should be compatible, to ensure the employment use now or in the future is not compromised. The introduction of housing should be informed by an understanding of existing commercial activities to ensure these are not undermined.  
9.35 These sites therefore have the capacity to accommodate good growth, by not only  helping meet evolving employment and local business needs, but 
also delivering housing as a complementary use.  
9.36 The land under the Westway is also an area of  significant employment 
land use.  Whilst not a designated employment zone there are a mix of 
comm ercial and recreational uses that contribute to community based 
activities and local employment opportunities.  
9.37 The three Employment Zones combined with the land underneath the 
Westway and the new commercial space in the Earl’s Court and Kensal  
Canalside O pportunity Areas form a ‘spine’ of creative activities and 
employment opportunities. The Council is seeking accreditation from the GLA to designate this spine as one of London’s Creative Enterprise Zones (CEZs). CEZs are zones where artists and creative businesses can find permanent affordable space to work; are supported to start -up and grow; 
and where local people are helped to learn creative sector skills and 
access pathways to employment. Residents who are unemployed and/or claiming benefits are concentrated in the north and parts of the south- west 199 of the Borough, while those with no qualifications and/or occupie d in lower 
paid occupations are particularly concentrated in the north of the Borough. 
These are the same areas that are home to the Borough's t hree 
Employment Zones, all of which have many creative and cultural businesses. The CEZ would provide a focus to link these communities with 
these sectors, providing important local employment opportunities and affordable workspace for local people.  
Kensal  Employment Zone  
9.38 The Kensal Employment Zone lies to the western end of Kensal Road and is the largest of the thr ee Employment Zones in the Borough. It comprises 
mostly small offices and light industrial uses. Businesses located here are typically engaged in recording media, advertising, design, printing, publishing and communications. The Employment Zone is on the w estern 
fringe of the central London office market, and, like Paddington, benefits from a canal -side location.  
9.39 The Kensal Canalside Employment W orkspace S trategy which covers a 
wider area than the E mployment Zone sets out Kensal’s wider creative 
ecosystem a nd needs. It contains guidance intended to aid development 
and assist design teams in successfully planning for the inclusion of creative and civil society sector workspace into new mixed- use 
developments as well as wider strategic advice on how to integrate public realm to support workspace.

Freston / Latimer Road Employment Zone 
9.40 The Freston / Latimer Road Employment Zone is located in the north west 
of the Borough, immediately to the east of the Borough boundary with 
Hammersmith and Fulham.  It stretches north/south along the boundary and is split by the Westway.   
9.41 Units 1 -14 Latimer Road which lies within the Employment Zone is subject 
to a Design Code Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) that  was 
produced with the community. The Employment Zone north of the Westway also sits within the St Quintin and Woodlands Neighbourhood Plan Area.  
9.42 The design code sets out a series of design guidelines to help shape the 
future  development of the area which in turn should act as a catalyst for 
positive change in the wider employment area.   
9.43 Building uses should support the creative and cultural industries.

Appropriate mixing of complimentary uses should be used to the south of
the Westway to deliver an uplift in employment and maximise commercial
floor space. To the north of the Westway, new development shall retain,
or re-provide, existing commercial floorspace.
 
202 
 Lots Road  Employment Zone 
9.44 The Lots Road Employment  Zone lies in the south west of the Borough 
and, together with the Lots Village Conservation Area, reflects the historic 
character of Chelsea’s working riverside heritage.   
9.45 The Employment Zone contains a cluster of antiques and art -related firms 
focused on the Bonhams and Lots Road auction houses, as well as designers and business services typically associated with the creative industries. There has been a recent emergence of interior design and 
business services in the area reinforced by the Design Centre nearby in 
the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.  
9.46 Thames Tideway Tunnel infrastructure is also located at Cremorne Wharf . 
Thames Water, through the Tideway Company should ensure that 
operations and maintenance, through their Development Consent Order remains compatible with surrounding development and future land uses so that the beneficial use of Cremorne Wharf for other activities can be maintained . 
9.47 We seek to maintain the vibrant mix of activities in the Employment Zone, protecting and supporting additional small business and light industrial uses so that the area retains its industrial character.  
9.48 The Council, as landowner, is working to comprehensively redevelop its Lots Road South site, on the western side of Lots  Road. The site, which 
straddles the boundary with the London Borough of Hammersmith and 
Fulham, is currently home to the Council’s car depot, salt store and street sweeping storage, as well as commercial floorspace. This redevelopment provides an opportunity to create additional, more modern commercial space to the Employment Zone, as well as co- locating residential uses to 
optimise the site with a vibrant mix of uses.  
9.49 A design guide for  the site, developed through a number of consultation 
workshops with local residents and businesses, will shape the development  and ensure it delivers wider placemaking benefits such as 
making the most of the access to Chelsea Creek, community uses and attractive public realm.  
PLV7: Lots Road Employment Zone Vision 
A. The Employment Zone will provide improved and additional workspaces 
and facilities for innovative and creative small and medium sized 
businesses with a focus on art, architecture, antiques  and interior design. 
To make the best use of land, complementary uses that contribute to the 
area’s eclectic mix and character will be incorporated.

Our larger Town Centres  
9.51 These are the town  centres which have traditionally attracted many visitors 
and have driven the Borough’s economy. These are the same areas which 
have been severely impacted by the Covid- 19 cr isis. Whilst  our town 
centres have begun to bounce back there is some uncertainty  around the 
direction of travel for the future of many high streets.  
9.52 Good high streets combine retail, hospitality, culture and essential services in a concentration that is compelling, sustainable and accessible to all. To 
deliver greater certainty and support for our high streets and town centres 
we have developed a number of high level placemaking principles, based 
on extensive community engagement
160.   
9.53 High streets within our town centre hierarchy will:  
 
160 High streets and place making: Phase 1 report from Centre for London ( January 2022)  
204 1.Be places people want to v isit and  spend time in by encouraging a
range of  facilities , services and attractions as well as exploring
opportunities for an evening economy.
2.Be adaptable and proactive to meet future needs by allowing for and
supporting innovative and creative solutions.
3.Work for everyone by ensuring the provision of accessible facilities,
commercial space and public realm that meets the needs of all ages
and disabilities.
4.Encourage active travel  by ensuring provision for cycle parking/hire,
pedestrian friendly public realm and supporting traffic reduction
schemes.
5.Be places that celebrate their own individual character and history bysupporting their unique needs and offering bespoke cultural events and
activities.
6.Be part of the solution to the climate crisis by reducing emissions andadapting to changing conditions, and encouraging greening
7.Be places for creativity, culture and art  by supporting festivals, events
and activities .
8.Support existing businesses and encourage economic growth byworking with and encouraging new Business Improvement Districts(BIDs), landowners and commercial tenants .
9.54 Drawing on these principles we will develop action plans  for the high 
streets  to aid the delivery of short term in terventions  and longer term 
strategic action plans. The action plans will help identify and focus activity 
on key areas, and help the Council build sustainable, Healthy Streets
161 
and walkable neighbourhoods. They will help to deliver public realm initiatives that encourage dwell time and are welcoming f or families as well 
as the youth and the elderly, pop up uses of vacant units, cultural and market activities, whilst contributing towards a strong visual identity for the high street.

A.The High Street will capitalise upon its traditional role as the civic  heart of
the Royal Borough. New development will improve and enhance the area’s
range of shops and uses that provide a rich eclectic mix of attractions with
office and residential space at upper levels. Cultural destinations will be
supported and enhanced and the evening economy will be supported.
Improvements to the streetscape will link together the area’s functions and
make it a better place for people to spend time.
Figure
 9.8: Kensington High Street  
9.55 Kensington High Street runs from east to west through the centre of the 
Borough, sitting to the north of Earl’s Court Road District Centre, and to 
the south of Notting Hill Gate District Centre. It is designated as a major centre in the London Plan and is home to a wide range of mainstream high street stores. 411 units run in linear format for approximately 900 metres along Kensington High Street, including Kensington Church Street.  
9.56 It is an important  shopping and leisure destination and is the focus for the 
local community providing public and community services such as the 
 
206 
 town hall, library, post office, pharmacies and banks and attracts visitors 
from outside the Borough. It is the Borough’s largest  town centre office 
location, with a range of drop in desk space and small offices above retail units, to larger offices in former department stores. Kensington High Street is also an important cultural centre, and is home to attractions such as Kensington  Palace, Leighton House, the Design Museum, Linley 
Sambourne House and Opera Holland Park. Kensington Gardens and Holland Park act as bookends to the street. It has been identified within the London Plan as having a night -time economy of regional or sub -
regional significance.  
9.57 Kensington High Street  benefits from be ing a Business Improvement 
District (BID), an area in which the local businesses have voted to inv est 
together to improve the environment of their local area.  
9.58 Priorities to achieve the vision are:  
1. Support of more regular and seasonal events and markets such as 
Phillimore Walk farmers market and events outside of the Town Hall, as part of the Council’s emerging Cultural Placemaking Strategy.  
2. Support a more diverse offering of uses, including meanwhile uses in vacant units.  
3. Explore opportunities to support and deliver an evening economy.

markets serving th e day -today needs of local residents and attracting 
visitors from across the world. The area will maintain a rich variety of 
small independent s hops offering ‘something different.’ , including art, 
antiques and collectibles .  
 
Figure 9.9: Portobello Road  
9.59 Portobello Road is a 1.5 km road running north from Notting Hill Gate. It is 
recognised in the London Plan as a Special District Centre and as a 
Strategic Market. The centre is located within the heart of a very diverse area in terms of race and ethnicity as well as socio -economic ally. There 
are significant Afro- Caribbean, Spanish, Portuguese, Moroccan, Somali, 
West Indian and East Asian communities in the area. The centre has a very extensive primary frontage and most of the units are owned by independents  (only 25 per cent  are multiples). Portobello Market is one of 
the most visited attractions in London and attracts very high footfall on Fridays and weekends with a broad range of retail and hospitality options, 
catering from local essential needs to high end specialty shops and 
restaurants.  The many outlets for art, antiques and collectibles, including 
208 those in the arcades, are a particularly important part of its attraction for 
visitors.    
9.60 Priorities to achieve the vision:  
1.Support existing independent businesses to adapt, diversify and
increase revenues to combat rent  and business rates.

district centres. It will build upon its long-st anding reputation for the arts,
culture and for the evening economy  while continuing to serve as an
important local shopping centre for residents in the surrounding area.  It will
also use the pull it has as a key employment area to provide the premises
needed by the types of agile business which will thrive in a post Covid- 19
world. The streetscape along Notting Hill Gate will be improved to make
the area more accessible and attractive. Outdated buildings will be
refurbished or redeveloped to improve the image of the area.209 Figure
 9.10 : Notting Hill Gate  
9.61 Notting Hill Gate developed along the route of the old Roman road to 
Silchester and remains a key route linking London to the west. The centre is surrounded by conservation areas, but the town centre itsel f was 
comprehensively redeveloped in the 1950s and is of a completely different scale and character to the surrounding residential areas. It forms a key gateway to the Portobello Road Market , as Notting Hill Gate Underground 
Station  is within walking dista nce and is one of its nearest and best -
connected transport hubs.

PLV1 7: Knightsbridge 
A.Knightsbridge will maintain its role as one of London’s most exclusive
national and international shopping destinations - attracting visitors from
across the world. It will also continue its role as an important residential
quarter and a service centre for residents in both Kensington and Chelsea
and Westminster. These two functions will exist together harmoniously, and
the public realm will have been improved to reflect both roles.
Figure 9.
17: Knightsbridge  
9.79 Knightsbridge is our largest town centre and is designated as an 
international shopping centre in the London Plan.  This reflects the concentration of flagship stores and department stores, most notably 
220 Harrods, which is the single largest visitor shopping attraction in the 
Borough. The centre includes the northern end of Sloane Street, recognised for its high end international shopping offer. The centre is surrounded by residential streets and the needs of these residents tend t o 
be served by the shops and services in the western part of the centre. Knightsbridge has been identified within the London Plan as having a night -time economy of “regional or sub- regional significance. 
9.80 This area also benefits from being a Business Improv ement District (BID), 
an area in which the local businesses have voted to invest together to improve the environment of their local area.  
9.81 Priorities to achieve the vision:  
1.Improve the attractiveness and walkability of the centre through
investments in the public realm and green space.
2.Take opportunities  to create space for and hold events and
mark ets.
3.Support the deliver y of more  accessible community  and cultural
uses.
4. Support the development of a Knightsbridge BID.
5.Support and promote the importance of Sloane Street as a key
connection between Knightsbridge and Kings Road to encouragefootfall between the two.
Fulham Road West  
PLV1 8: Fulham Road West  
A.Fulham Road West will continue to offer specialist and local provision of
goods , supporting independent shops and services and  ensuring a strong
diversity of uses is maintained across the centre. The existing evening
economy will be strengthened offering a range of activities and services
for locals and visitors.221 Figure 9.
18: Fulham Road West  
9.82 Fulham Road Wes t District Centre is located between the Kings Road and 
Earl’s Court and is on the western border of the Borough adjacent to the 
London Borough of Hammersmith  and Fulham. The District Centre has a 
mix of local shops, restaurants, cafes and services which largely serve the local population and workers.   
9.83 Priorities to achieve the vision:  
1.Take opportunities  to improve the attractiveness and walkability of
the centre through investments in the public realm and green space.
2.Improve cycling and active travel inf rastructure.
3.Support and encourage infrastructure improvements to enhance
connectivity in the area.
222 Our Local Centres and Neighbourhoods  
PLV1 9: Keeping life local – walkable neighbourhoods 
A.Support  walkable neighbourhoods and the role that our network
of town centres have in providing the range of services which
meet the day -to-day needs of our residents  by:
1. Maintaining  access to a range of neighbourhood facilities ,
both within and outside our town centres,  and seek ing to
increase the facilities which assist in creating walkable
neighbourhoods as opportunities arise.
2. Support ing initiatives to increase walkability  and access to
our town centres.
3. Support ing public realm improvements to local centres,
giving them a distinctive look and feel - promoting par tial
and full pedestrianisation in some locations, as well as
more trees and greenery and outdoor dining.
NOTE. The policy mechanisms are set out in Policies TC3 
(Diversity of uses within town centres), TC5 Local shopping and 
other facilities which support  day-to-day needs), C I1, (social 
infrastructure and facilities), T1 (Street Network) and T6 (Active 
Travel) . 
9.84 Our loc al centres and our neighbourhoods differ from the other “Places” 
identified in this chapter in that we do not expect these to be the main 
areas for growth or for change. However, they have been included to 
reflect they key role that they play in supplem enting the services provided 
by our larger centres and in helping support the walkable neighbourhood.  
9.85 The walkable neighbourhood is a simple concept, but one which sits at the very centre of the Council’s vision for an inclusive, green and liveable borough.  It means that that everyone who lives within the Borough is within a reasonable distance from the range of the services they need.  
9.86 The nature of the use will determine how close one should be from it.  So while all our residents should live within a 20 minute walk of a secondary  
school, a library or a larger shopping centre, a 5 minute walk will be more appropriate for a choice of shops which meet day -to day needs.   
223 
  
Figure 9.19 Elements of Walkable Neighbourhoods  
9.87 A successful walkable neighbourhood is more than simply having access 
to a single facility – it is also about choice. It is this choice that can 
increase the well -being of all our residents.  
9.88 The Council uses Space Syntax data to build upon our own understanding of the Borough to identify areas which have less access to a range of facilities than others. We have data for a myriad of uses and features, including GP surgeries and play spaces, as shown below, but also access  
to shops, to places of work and to cultural uses.  It helps us visualise the disparity, and therefore inequality, across the Borough. It helps us decide the new uses or facilities that may be needed in particular areas to strengthen our walkable neighbour hoods.  
9.89 The Council recognises that planning regulations mean that planning permission will not be needed for the loss of some of these valued uses.  However, we will c ontinue to use the powers that we do have to try to 
protect the character of our local centres as the places which serve the day-to-day needs of our residents. We will go further, and try, where 
possible, to increase access to these valued uses. This can be by seeking the provision of new facilities and uses as opportunities arise, by improving 
the public realm, and by improving the access to those facilities which already exist.

225 10 Site Allocations 
Introduction 
10.1 The Council has identified sites (site allocations) across the Borough 
which will allow us to deliver our vision for good growth and provide for the new homes, businesses and social and community uses needed by our residents. However, with a very dense built environment, much of  
which is within conservation areas, the Borough has very little space that 
is free for development. Most of the land that is not already built upon is 
protected in the form of parks, open spaces and cemeteries, some of significant historic value. Clearly, these open spaces are of great value to both physical and mental health and well -being of our residents and 
as such cannot be used for development.  
10.2 Therefore, we need to continue to make sensible choices about where we want new development to go.  
10.3 W e have divided these site allocations into three categories essentially 
by their size:  
•Opportunity Areas - Earl’s Court and Kensal Canalside: These are
the two parts of the Borough which have the greatest potential todeliver the largest number of new homes, businesses, jobs andservi ces that our residents need. These areas will become new
neighbourhoods in their own right.
•Large sites: A large proportion of development has been, and will
continue to be, directed to a small number of large sites. These aresite which are 0.25 hectares or more in size. Generally, these are
those sites / uses that we know are reaching the end of their currentlife.
•Small sites: The Council has also identified a number of smaller sites
which, taken together, have the potential to play a significant
contribution to the meeting our housing requirements. These aresites of less than 0.25 hectares but with a capacity to provide at leastfive new homes. This ties in with the requirement within the NPPFfor Local Planning Authorities to identify land to accommodate atleast 10 per cent of their housing requirements on smaller sites ofless than 1 hectare and will help meet the London Plan small sitestarget.226 10.4 The Council is satisfied that all these sites are available and either 
deliverable or developable162 over the lifetime of the Local Plan. We 
undertook a “call for sites” in the two early consultations while preparing this Local Plan. Further sites were also suggested during the Regulation 18 Draft Policies consultation. However, only sites which met our assessment criteria are included in the Local Plan. The methodology used to assess the sites received during the “call for sites” is set out in our Site Allocation Paper, September  2022
163.  
10.5 The site capacity for the site allocations has been determined through information available if the site already has a planning history. Where there is no planning history, site capacities have been determined using the principle of optimising the site through a design- led approach. 
Optimising site capacity does not mean maximising the use of the site 
but ensuring that a development responds to a site’s context and to its capacity for growth.  
Opportunity Area Sites 
Site Allocation SA1: Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area 
Site Context  
10.6 Kensal Canalside is the largest brownfield site in the Borough. It adjoins the Old Oak and Park Royal Opportunity Area to the west and has the potential to act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the whole of this part of northwest central London as development is likely to come for ward 
before the majority of the Old Oak and Park Royal can be developed.  
10.7 The Opportunity Area consists of the former Kensal Gasworks north of the railway line and the North Pole railway depot to the south. Part of the northern site is now occupied by a Sainsbury’s supermarket and petrol 
station. The site is bounded by the Grand Union Canal and Kensal Green Cemetery to the north.  
162 Deliverable and developable are defined in the NPPF glossary. Deliverable sites are those that 
will be built in the first five years of the Local Plan and developable sites will be built  later from year 
six onwards.

Relevant Planning 
History Planning application (PP/06/01619) was 
submitt
ed in 2006 for the central site for 790 
residential units (negotiated to 730 units)  and 
14,895 sq m of non- residential uses. The 
application was withdrawn in 2008 following a change in ownership.   
Delivery Developable  
Years 6 to 
10 – 1,950 homes  
Years 11 to 15 – 1,550 homes  
Planning Constraints •The site is a former gasworks and therefore
contami
nated, partial decontamination of the
central site has been undertaken.
•The development capacity of the site is
constrained by the road junction onto Ladbroke229 Grove which provides the  only access to the 
site.  
•Kensal Green Cemetery is a Grade I Registered
Park and Garden of Historic Interest and
contains several Grade I and II* listed buildings.Kensal House and Day Nursery are listedGrade II*. Views from the cemetery to thedevelopment will be particularly sensitive.
•The memorial to the victims of the LadbrokeGrove rail disaster is located on the site. Thememorial must be respected, and visitor accessmaintained.
•Borough Grade I and II Sites of NatureConservation Importance and identified greencorridors exist on site, notably along the r ailway
and canal. There is also a Site of NatureConservation of local importance.
•A Flood Risk Assessment should be submitted
to support any future planning application. This
assessment should take into account the newclimate change allowances and requi rements,
especially for surface water flooding. Newdevelopment needs to address surface water toreduce the peak flow into the combined sewernetwork such that surface water discharge intothe network is restricted to greenfield run- off
rates.

10.8 The site is considered to be suitable for tall buildings because of the 
development ca pacity pot ential identified through the site's designation 
in the London Plan as an Opportunity A rea, and having regard to local 
capacity st udi es und ertaken. The Council ha s com missioned a heights  
study in order t o asse ss the visual impact of devel opment on this site 
upon i
ts immediate and wider con text. Thi s wor k has been used to 
assess t ownscape impact and provide a response t o scale and building 
heights as sh own in Figure 10.1 . Precise lo c ations f or tall buildings will 
be the subject of det ailed masterplanning work and an assessment of 
impact i n line with Policy D 9 (C and D) of t he London Plan, t he need to 
take into account site constraints and other factors such as  legibility, 
sunlight and daylight. Heights  are indicated from the ground level to the 
top of the building and approximate number of storeys are given as an230 indication but the actual number of storeys will depend on the floor  to 
ceiling heights.

A. The site will deliver a high- quali ty mixed -use development to include:
Land use 
B. A minimum of 3, 500 new homes (C3) .
C. A minimum of 12, 000 sq m of commercial floor space of which 5,000
sq m is E(g)  as part of a new Neighbourhood Centre.
D. The provision of affordable workspace to the quantum of either: 500
sq m or 10 per cent  of the commercial floor space E(g), whichever the
greater, to be located within the N eighbourhood Centre.
231 E. The relocation and re -provision of the existing Sainsbury’s
supermarket.
F. On-site renewable energy sources.
Principles 
G. Comprehensive development of the site in accordance with the
Kensal C
analside Opportunity A rea SPD.
H. A high-d
ensity development with a high environmental s tandard in
terms o
f construction, building materials, waste management and
energy usage/retention and low levels of car  dependency and
ownership.
I. Tall
 buildings and the site wide building heights  strategy must not
exceed the parameters
 set out in in Figure 10.1. Where tall buildings
are deemed appropriate, they must not exceed 98 m from the ground
level to the top of the building or approximately 31 storeys.
J. Development to comply with the following townscape principles:
1.Development al
ong the canalside s hould be smaller scale, finer
grain and varied but c
ontinuous, with varying height creating a
continuous 
horizontal lower rise frontage, with a finer grain and
variation of t
he skyline when seen close-u p from Kensal Green
Cemetery;
2.In direct
 line with the main Kensal Green Cemetery entrance
through the gate, t
he development should create a sense of
openness and sky view directly opposite the gate;
3.Greater
 height in the development s hould be located further away
from t
he cemetery towards the railway as shown in Figure 10.1;
4.The development
 should respond to the coherent range of heights
on Ladbroke Grove and avoid overly stark enclosure of the street;
5.Tall
 buildings in the development should address the site’s
entrance and create distinctiveness;
6.The development s
hould allow for setbacks for  tree planting along
the canal 
as part of a comprehensive landscaping plan;
7.Heights of taller buildings should vary, an d the maximum height
within the site is limited to distinct points of height;
8.In views from the east, tall buildings should be clustered along the
railway an
d staggered to allow sky views in between.
K. New  or improved infrastructure, including a new pedestrian and cycle
bridge over t
he railway, safeguarded land (included access land) for a232 potential future Elizabeth Line station, a new pedestrian and cycle 
bridge over the canal, remodelling of the Ladbroke Grove junction, 
and new streets that connect the allocation area into its surrounding 
context and other public transport links . 
L. Kensal Canalside Opportunity Area is nil rated for Borough CIL so the
required social, environmental transport and other infrastructure will
be funded through s106 agreements including, where appropriate,
allocation- wide framework agreements, which can help ensure that
s106 contributions towards infrastructure are apportioned fairly and
proport ionally across the allocation area, make provision for physical
infrastructure delivery  and maintenance in lieu of financial
contributions, and provide a consistency of approach across the
allocation area, regardless of when development comes forward.
M. Attractive, usable and flexible public realm providing an appropriate
setting for mixed- use canalside development which features leisure,
education and business uses as well as housing.
N. The improvement and relocation of facilities currently provided by
Canalside House and the Boathouse Centre on- site if relocation is
required to achieve comprehensive redevelopment along the
canalside and Ladbroke Grove.
O. The retention of the area west of the gas holders for the provision of
electricity infrastructure. Part of this site may also be required for a
gas pressure reduction station, replacing the gas holders. Any
buildings must be of a high architectural standard and in keeping with
the overall redevelopment of the site.
P. The ongoing access to, and respect for, the memorial site of the
victims of the Ladbroke Grove rail disaster .
Q. A suitable setting for the designated heritage assets .
R. A public art strategy to enhance the public realm and quality of the
development and contribute to local distinctiveness and charac ter.
Infrastructure and Planning Contributions 
S. Social and community facilities (including health, education and
police) depending on the population change.
T. Affordable housing.
U. Construction and long term maintenance of (a) a new pedestrian and
cycle bridge across the railway line and (b) a new pedestrian and
cycle bridge over the canal, which improves north – south access , in
the case of the new bridge across the railway line, promote active
travel, provide necessary connections to surrounding infrast ructure
and facilitate the effective integration of the allocation site into the
wider area  – including rental obligations to safeguard and/or transfer233 land required to construct and maintain the bridges and/ or potential 
Elizabeth line station (including access), where appropriate.  
V. Public realm and public spaces and improvements to Little
Wormw ood Scrubs and Kensal Green Cemetery (subject to access
through the cemetery and a linking bridge over the canal) .
W. Improved transport infrastructure including better bus links,
enhancements to Ladbroke Grove underground station, and new
roads and improvements to the junctions with Ladbroke Grove and
east-west connections to the south.
X. Landscaping, biodiversity and amenity improvements to the Grand
Union Canal .
Y. On-site renewable energy sources to serve the new development and
form part of a wider development in the future .
Z. The overall water infrastructure need (including potable water
demand and sewerage capacity) will be informed by an Integrated
Water Management Strategy. Surface water runoff rates to be
restricted to equivalent greenfield rates .
AA. Other contributions as set out in relevant SPDs.  
BB. Kensal Opportunity Area is nil rated for Borough CIL so the required 
infrastructure will be funded through s106 agreements. S106 
contributions may be payable after the required infrastructure has 
been fully built as at the date of the relevant s106 agreement such as 
where there is an element of forward funding of infrastructure by the 
Council or other body; s106 contributions may be used in full or part 
to satisfy any funding requirements (including any repayment or 
recovery and recycling obligations) in respect of forward - funding; 
pre-occupation or pre- commencement s106 obligations may be 
considered  to ensure that the required infrastructure is in place at an 
appropriate time before development (or development of a certain 
level) comes forward.  234 Site Allocation SA2: Earl’s Court Exhibition Centre 
Site Context  
10.9 Earl’s Court lies to the west of the Borough, bordering the London 
Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, adjacent to the West London line. This site allocation relates to the part of Earl’s Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area within the Borough. The site has outline planning permission for a mixed- use development which has been

Building Heights 
10.10 The site is considered to be a suitable location for tall buildings because of the development capacity potential identified through the site's designation in the London Plan as an Opportunit y Area, and having 
regard to the site's extant permission which includes buildings that exceed the London Plan height threshold. The Council has commissioned a building heights study in order to assess the visual impact of development on this site upon the townscape in the immediate 
and wider context. This work has been used to set out a townscape response to scale and building heights as shown in Figure 10.2 below, including the areas within the site which are not suitable for tall buildings. Precise  locat ions for tall buildings will be the subject of detailed 
masterplanning work and an assessment of impact in line with Policy D9 (C and D) of the London Plan, the need to take into account site constraints and other factors such as legibility, sunlight  and daylight. 
Ground levels vary across the site, so heights have been indicated in height Above Ordnance Data (AOD), with the range of building heights approximately 3 to 20 storeys, depending on floor to ceiling heights.  237 Figure

Site Context  
10.15 Redevelopment of the Wornington Green Estate has been underway 
over a number of years. It is a multi phase development with Phase 2 nearing completion. This site allocation relates only to the portion of land which has not been developed and will form the final phase – ‘ Phase 3’. 
Prior to its re -development Wornington Green Estate was a post - war 
housing estate of 535 social rent homes constructed between 1946 and 
1985 in predominantly large- deck blocks, typical of public housing of the 
time. The Estate was  identified for regeneration because it failed to meet 
Decent Housing standards and is the first estate regeneration scheme i n 
the Borough. The Phase 3 site is broadly triangular in shape and marks 
the northern end of Portobello Road. The site is currently  occupied by 
seven residential blocks incorporating two vacant retail units, which form the northern part of the wider Estate, and Portobello Hall (previously known as ‘the Friendship Centre’) which is in community use.  
10.16 Outline planning permission and Phase 1 Reserved Matters  for 
redevelopment of the Wornington Green Estate was granted in 2010, with subsequent planning permission for amendments granted in 2014. The redevelopment is split into 3 phases: Phase 1 was completed in 2015;  sub-Phase 2a was completed in 2020;  sub-Phase 2b is scheduled 
for completion by 2024 . Phase 3 is due for completion by 2029.  247 Site Info rmation

 11.  Infrastructure and Planning 
Contributions 
Policy IP1: Infrastructure Delivery and Planning Contributions 
IP1: Infrastructure and Planning Contributions  
A. The Council will ensure that sufficient supporting infrastructure, 
is delivered to support  good growth identified in the Local Plan.  
The Council will require that there is adequate infrastructure to 
serve developments, through the use of planning contributions,  
working with infrastructure providers and stakeholders to 
identify requirements . 
 
B. Where development generates a need either because of its 
individual or cumulative impact, planning obligations and 
contributions  will be sought to secure the necessary 
infrastructure  required to make the development acceptable.  
C. In determining what planning obligations would make 
development acceptable in planning terms, account will be 
taken of the proposed development, individual characteristics of 
the site, the infrastructure needs of the site and the surrounding 
area.  
D. Proposals that form part of potenti ally wider sites will be 
assessed in terms of the capacity of the site as a whole.  
E. An open book financial viability appraisal will be required where 
relevant.   
Infrastructure Planning  
11.1 
Infrastructure planning is the process for ensuring the physical needs of 
an area can be delivered to keep pace with its population’s 
requirements. It is critical to the delivery of vision of the Local Plan.  
11.2 To support the Local Plan the Council has prepared an Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) which will be regularly monitored and reviewed. The IDP sits alongside the Local Plan providing an infrastructure assessment 
for the Borough which has been developed through working in partnership with physical, social and green infrastructure providers to establish what infrastructure provision there is in the Borough and 
identifying any gaps or capacity issues within this existing provision.   
272 
 11.3 The IDP and the IDP Schedule set out the infrastructure that is required 
for the successful implementation of the Local Plan , although 
infrastructure requirements from development will not be limited to these. Where known, the schedule details the timescales for delivery , funding 
mechanisms, and follows best practice.  
Planning Contributions  
11.4 The use of Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and planning obligations / contributions (s106) is a principal way of the Council gaining the 
necessary resources to administer and assist the delivery of vital 
infrastructure.  
11.5 The Council’s CIL Charging Schedule came into effect on 6 April 2015.  
CIL is a mandatory charge levied on the net increase in floorspace arising from development in order to fund infrastructure that is needed to support development in the area. CIL runs alongside s106 agreements which will continue to operate. Communities will be consulted on how to spend a neighbourhood portion of the levy revenues arising from the development that takes place in their area to ensure that the use of the neighbourhood portion matches the priorities expressed by the local community. The neighbourhood portion amounts to 15 per cent  of the 
CIL receipts arising from development that takes place in that area or 25 per cent  in areas with a made neighbourhood plan. The adopted 
Council’s Neighbourhood CIL Community Priorities  Document
170 sets 
out guidance for communities  to access NCIL funds . 
11.6 Planning obligations are intended to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms.  
11.7 They might be used to prescribe the nature of a development; to secure a contribution from a developer to compensate for loss or damage created by a development; or to mitigate a development’s impact.  
11.8 Planning obligations should only be used where it is not possible to address unacceptable impacts through planning conditions. They must comply with the Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (as amended)
171 and the NPPF.  
11.9 Planning obligation requirements are set out in relevant policies throughout the Local Plan and the Council’s adopted Planning

171 Regulation 122 of the CIL Regulations 2010 (as amended). Replicated in the NPPF paragraph 
57 and NPPG Planning Obligations paragraph 002   
273 
 Contributions Supplementary Planning Document172 explains in more 
detail the planning obligations that will be sought from development.  
11.10 Subject to the s106 tests, planning contribution measures may include:  
1. Environmental improvements - to buildings, the street (including 
townscape enhancements), improvements for inclusive design, utility 
provision, nature conservation and biodiversity measures, flooding 
and drainage and mitigating the effects of a development propos al. 
2. Economic initiatives - securing jobs for local residents, 
apprenticeships, work  placements, community based initiatives, 
employment training schemes, the provision of small business units 
and support for local procurement initiatives . 
3. Provision of affordab le housing - including an appropriate mix of 
residential units . 
4. Provision of community, social and health facilities  - including 
welfare, childcare,  information and advisory centres, social service 
uses and facilities, education facilities including nurser ies, health 
facilities including primary health care facilities  and specialist 
functions linked to the health service and dentists, libraries and 
associated facilities, police and fire services infrastructure, affordable premises for  voluntary and comm unity organisations and churches 
and other religious facilities . 
5. Provision of transportation facilities – including facilities for 
walking and cycling,  inclusive  public transport and highway 
improvements to cater for the impact of the development and i mpac t 
of the construction of development in relation to traffic, air  quality 
and noise on the amenity of residents, and towards Crossrail where development within the Central Activities Zone (CAZ)
173 or in other 
circumstances, would require this as a result of Lo ndon Plan 
Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG), and permit -free 
development . 
6. Conservation of buildings of architectural or historic interest  
and other conservation projects such as archaeological 
investigation. 
7. Sports, leisure, recreational and visitor f acilities . 
8. Green infrastructure improvements – to the network of multi -
functional open spaces  in the B orough including the creation of new 
public open space, improvements to existing open space, and 
securing public access to private open space. 
 
172 https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/planning- and-building -control/planning -policy/section -106  
173 The boundaries of the CAZ are shown on the Proposals Map.  
274 
 9. Cultural fa cilities  – securing the provision of arts, cultural and 
entertainment facilities,  cultural place making such as new works of 
art or performing arts space in association with development 
proposals . 
10. Play facilities – providing play provision through publicly  accessible 
play space and facilities in new residential developments .  
11. Energy efficiency and renewable energy. 
12. Utility infrastructure requirements – including water, foul drainage 
and sewage treatment, energy utilities, and digital connectiv ity 
infrastructure .  
13. Waste management and recycling to mitigate the impact of the 
development . 
14. Land charges, legal, project management, monitoring and 
implementation costs, and management and maintenance costs on completion. 
11.11 Legal agreements including s106  contributions , and CIL will be used to 
help deliver the Local Plan. New development should be supported by 
on-site delivery of  supporting infrastructure. This will include physical 
infrastructure such as the transport network, and social and community 
uses that help support good growth. We will combine developer contributions, secured through the Community Infrastructure Levy and s106 planning obligations, with Council resources and other public funding streams such as grants, to maximise delivery of the objectives 
set out in the Local Plan. 
11.12 The policies in this plan, CIL and s106 requirements have been independently viability tested. Where the development is unable to deliver all the policy requirements for reasons of viability or where enabl ing development is necessary  to bring development forward, a 
viability assessment  will be required to accompany the planning 
application. The applicant will fund the independent assessment of the viability assessment , or other technical studies requiring i ndependent 
assessment, prior  to the application being determined.  
SAVED Policy IP2: Planning Enforcement  
 
  
   
 
Term  Definition 
Affordable In terms of planning, affordable housing is housing, be it for 
(Community) Housing sale or for rent, for those, “whose needs are not met by the 
market.”  The full definition is set out within the 
Government’s  National Planning Policy FrameworkGlossary 
275 
 .   
There are many different types of affordable housing including 
social rent, affordable rent, intermediate rent and home 
ownership products such as shared ownership and First 
Home s. 
Affordable Rent This is a form of affordable housing. Homes are provided at 
a specific rent, “London Affordable Rent”. The cost of renting these homes is very similar to those at “social rent” and are published by the Mayor of London .  
Agent of Change Principle  Where the operation of an existing business or community facility could have a significant adverse effect on new development (including changes of use) in its vi cinity, the 
applicant (or ‘agent of change’) should be required to provide suitable mitigation before the development has been completed. (NPPF, paragraph 187). 
Air Quality Assessment  Assessments need to be proportionate to the nature and scale of development proposed and the potential impacts (taking into account existing air quality conditions), and because of this are likely to be locationally specific.  
Air Quality Focus Area (AQFA) Air Quality Focus Areas (AQFA) are locations that not only exceed the EU annual mean limit value for nitrogen dioxide 
(NO
2) but are also locations with high human exposure. 
AQFAs are not the only areas with poor air quality but they 
have been defined to identify areas where currently planned national, regional and local measures to reduce air pollution may not fully resolve poor air quality issues. There are currently 187 AQFAs across London. The list of Air Quality 
Focus Areas is updated from time to time as the London 
Atmospheric Inventory is reviewed and the latest list in the 
London Datastore should always be checked. AQFAs are defined based on GLA modelling forecasts that incorporate actions taken by the GLA and others as well as broader changes in emissions sources.  
Air Qu ality 
Management Area (AQMA) Air Quality Managem ent Areas (A
 QMAs) are declared by 
the London boroughs in response to modelled or measured existing exceedances of legal air quality limits. The analysis 
underpinning AQMAs is often more spatially detailed tha n  
276 
 Term  Definition 
London -wide modelling and may include the iden tification of 
additional air quality hot spots or other local issues. 
Air Quality Neutral  An Air Quality Neutral development is one that meets, or 
improves upon, the air quality neutral benchmarks published 
in guidance from the GLA. The benchmarks set out the 
maximum allowable emissions of NOx and Particulate Matter based on the size and use class of the proposed development. Separate benchmarks are set out for 
emissions arising from the development and from transport 
associated with the development. Air Quality Neutral applies 
only to the completed development and does not include impacts arising from construction, which should be separately assessed in the Air Quality Assessment. 
Air Quality Positive  The Air Quality Positive approach maximises the benefits to local air quality in and around a development site or masterplan area and minimises exposure to existing 
sources of poor air quality. It requires planners, designers, 
architects and air quality experts to show what measures have been taken during the design stages to achieve the 
best possible outcomes for air quality. This approach goes beyond compliance with both the Air Quality Neutral 
benchmarks and the minimum requirements of an air quality  
assessment and sets out the measures taken to benefit 
local air quality and reduce exposure to poor air quality.  
Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) This refers to the 10 per cent increase in biodiversity which will be required by the Environment Bill 2019-21 once it receives Royal Assent.  
Breach level  Is the depth of flooding which can occur if there was a 
breach of the Thames Defences.  
Tidal Breach Flood Levels  are the potential flood levels 
which could occur as a result of a breach of the tidal 
defences. The breach modelling data was produced by the 
EA in 2017 and carried out by Atkins. Information for the 
Borough can be accessed here174 (please choose the F lood 
risk – Breach level no bedroom accommodation  – tab).

 Term  Definition 
authorities to raise funds from owners or developers of land 
undertaking new building projects in their area. 
Construction and 
demolition waste This is waste arising from the construction, repair,

including roads. It consists mostly of brick, concrete, hardcore, subsoil and topsoil, but it can contain quantities of timber, metal, plastics and occasionally special (hazardous) waste materials.  
Counters Creek Project A sewer infrastructure project proposed by Thames Water to address sewer flooding in the Borough. It included four 
elements: a new storm relief sewer to increase the sewer 
capacity (currently under review); SUDS to reduce surface 
water run-off; antiflooding (FLIP) devices to stop the sewers surcharging into lower properties; and, local sewer improvements to increase the capacity of local sewers. Ofwat approved the funds needed to undertake the 
Counters Creek Sewer Alleviation Scheme in December 
2014. 
Critical Drainage Areas The Surface Water Management Plan of the Borough identified Critical Drainage Areas which show a complex interaction of surface and sewer water flooding.  
District Heating Network (DHN)  A network of pipes carrying hot water or steam, usually underground, that connects heat production equipment with heat customers. They can range from several metres to several kilometres in length. (London Plan 2021)  
Ecological Impact Assessments (EcIA)  Process of identifying, quantifying and evaluating the 
potential impacts of defined actions on ecosystems or their 
components, and usually performed as one element of an environmental impact assessment (EIA). (BS42020:2013 Biodiversity). 
Embodied Carbon Embodied carbon is the carbon emissions associated with materials and construction processes throughout the whole lifecycle of a building or infrastructure. 
Energiesprong A performance standard for new build and refurbishment. It is suitable for residential development. The methodology involves a focus on achieving minimum performance 
standards for building elements and fixed services and, like 
the Passivhaus methodologies, account is taken of both regulated and unregulated em issions . See more on 
energiesprong.org . 
Energy hierarchy  Shows how new buildings can meet net zero carbon by following a sequential approach.   
279 
 Term  Definition 
EnerPHit Energy performance standard that allows a slight relaxation 
in the space heating targets (20-25kWh/year depending on location), recognising that the form of the building cannot 
easily be changed in refurbishment, it also allows a slightly 
higher air permeability rate of 1 air change per hour at 50Pa. 
Environmental  Impact 
Assessment (EIA)  The aim of an Environmental Impact Assessment is to protect the environment by ensuring that a local planning authority when deciding whether to grant planning permission for a project, which is likely to have significant 
effects on the environment, does so in the full knowledge of 
the likely significant effects, and takes this into account in the decision making process.  
Exception Test A method that demonstrates and helps ensure that flood risk to people and property will be managed satisfactorily, while allowing necessary development to go ahead in situations where suitable sites at lower risk of flooding are not available. 
Exempt Sites (waste)  This is a waste operation that is exempt from needing an 
environmental permit. Each exemption has specific limits 
and conditions operators need to work within.

Recyclate  Raw material sent to, and processed in, a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility (e.g. plastics, m etals, 
glass, paper/card). 
Recycling  The reprocessing of waste either into the same product or a different one. 
Referable Development Referable development is defined as an application for 
planning permission of potential strategic importance (PSI) 
(Mayor of London Order 2008). Any application which meets one or more of the PSI Categories outlined in the Order (Categories 1-4) must be ‘referred’ to the GLA. 
Regulated Carbon Emissions  Regulated carbon emissions are operational em issions 
associated wi th building energy consumption resulting from 
controlled, fixed building services and fittings, including 
space heating and cooling, hot water, ventilation, fans, 
pumps and lighting. Such energy uses are inherent in the design of a bui lding.  
Relevant street frontage The units between successive intersecting vehicular highways.  
Residual Waste Waste remaining after materials for re-use, recycling and composting have been removed.  
285 
 Term  Definition 
Riparian Owner  Land owner adjoining a river or watercourse. Has 
responsibilities for the maintenance of the banks and associated flood defences. 
s106 agreements  See legal agreements above. 
Safeguarded Wharves A network of sites that have been safeguarded for cargo handling uses such as intraport or transhipment movements and freight-related purposes by Safeguarding Directions. A 
site remains safeguarded unless and until the relevant 
Safeguarding Direction is formally removed or amended. 
Sequential Test (flooding)  In relation to flooding, the sequential test i s a decision -
making tool designed to ensure that sites at little or no risk of flooding are developed in preference to areas at higher risk. Within each Flood Zone, new development should be directed first to sites at the lowest probability of fl ooding.  
Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC)  Locally designated areas which are recognised as being of 
particular importance to wildlife and biodiversity.  
Small Office A small office is a Class E(g) use with a floor area of less than 300 s q m (GEA). 
Social Rent  These are homes which are owned by the Council or by a registered provider of affordable housing and then let to people at a truly affordable rent. They offer homes at the lowest level of rent. 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment  (SFRA) A study to assess the risk to an area or site from flooding, now and in the future, and to assess the impact that any changes or development on the site or area will have on 
flood risk to the site and elsewhere. It may also identify, 
particularly at more local levels, how to manage those changes to ensure that flood risk is not increased. 
Studio Flat  Nationally described floorspace standards define a 1 bed 1 person home requiring a minimum gross internal floor areas and storage of 39 or 37 sq m (where a 1b1p has a shower 
room instead of a bathroom) 1 bed 2 person home is 50 sq m for 1 storey dwelling and 58 sq m for 2 storey dwelling.  
Suitable pump device See FLIP Valves.  
Surface Water Rainfall that collects on the ground. 
Surface Water Management Plan A study which outlines the predicted risk and preferred surface water management strategy for the Borough. The  
286 
 Term  Definition 
report also defines Critical Drainage Areas which show a 
complex interaction of surface and sewer water flooding.  
Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SuDS)  Using sustainable drainage techniques and managing 
surface water run-off from buildings and hardstanding areas in a way that reduces the total volume, flow and rate of surface water that runs directly into drains and sew ers. 
Tenure blind  Ensuring that different tenures of housing (social rented, private market and so forth) cannot be distinguished because they have different external appearance. 
Thames Policy Area Designated boundary for the area of the Borough influenc ed 
by the River Thames. Defined in coordination with adjoining Boroughs as part of the Thames Strategy: Kew to Chelsea.  
Thames Tideway Tunnel  A Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project which will capture the flows of storm sewage from sewer overflow 
points along the River Thames. The tunnel will run 
approximately 25 kilometres through the heart of London, and up to 75 meters beneath the River Thames, broadly following the path of the river.  
Thermal bridging Occurs where there is a direct connection between the inside and outside through one or more building elements 
which are more thermally conductive than the rest of the building envelope, resulting in heat loss outwards. 
Top of a building The top of a building would normally be measured externally 
at the height of the roof parapet of the uppermost storey, excluding minor elements such as lift overruns and plant enclosures.  
Unregulated Carbon Emissions  Unregulated carbon emissions are operational emissions not covered by Part L of the Building Regulations, including emissions resulting from plug-in loads (such as appliances, 
IT equipment), cooking, lighting, and power for communal 
spaces including lifts and power for external features within 
a development (such as car park and street li ghting). 
Urban Greening Factor This is a land-use planning tool to help determine the 
amount of greening required in new developments.  
Waste Apportionment An allocated proportion of London’s total waste (expressed in tonnes) to each London borough which (either by individual Waste Planning Authority or as a collective grouping of Waste Planning Authorities) must be addressed in their Local Plans.   
287 
 Term  Definition 
Waste Disposal 
Authority  Waste disposal authorities have a statutory responsibility to manage waste which is collected by local councils (Local Authority Collected Waste). 
Waste Hierarchy  A framework for securing a sustainable approach to waste management. Waste should be minimised wherever 
possible. If waste cannot be avoided, then it should be re-
used; after this it should be prepared for recycling, value recovered by recycling or composting or waste to energy; 
and finally, disposal.  
Waste Planning Authority  The local authority responsible for waste development planning and control. They are unitary authorities, including London Boroughs and the City of London, National Park Authorities, and county councils in two-tier areas. 
Waste Recovery (waste) The value that can be recovered from waste by recovering 
materials through recycling, composting or recovery of 
energy.  
Waste Reduction  The most desirable way of managing waste, by avoiding the production of waste in the first place.  
Waste Transfer Station A site to which waste is delivered for sorting or baling prior to transfer to another place for recycling, treatment or disposal.  
Whole Life- Cycle 
Carbon Approach To fully capture a development’s carbon impact, a whole life-cycle approach is needed to capture its unregulated 
emissions (i.e. those associated with cooking and small appliances), its embodied emissions (i.e. those associated 
with raw material extraction, manufacture and transport of building materials and construction) and emissions associated with maintenance, repair and replacement as well as dismantling, demolition and eventual material disposal). (London Plan 2021)  
Zero and net zero carbon Zero carbon, requires no net release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Net-
zero carbon refers to balancing the amount of emitted 
greenhouse gases with the equivalent emissions with no 
reliance on fossil fuels, using on-sit e renewable or offsetting 
elsewhere in the Borough as a last resort.

 The policies within the Local Plan are made of both strategic and non-strategic 
elements. Strategic policies are those policies which address the strategic policies of 
an area, including any cross-boundary issues. Non-strategic policies are concerned 
with more local issues.  
Where neighbourhood plans are being prepared, the relevant neighbourhood forum should ensure that any policies within them are in general conformity with these 
strategic policies.
  
This table sets out those policies within the Local Plan that are considered strategic 
and non-strategic. This includes both the saved and the new policies.

      Appendix 4: Monitoring 
We will monitor the implementation of New Local Plan policies to ensure that the objectives and targets within the Plan are m et. 
The table sets out the Council’s key monitoring indicators which will be used to monitor success towards meeting the objectives 
in this plan. If the trigger points are reached this does not necessarily mean the policy is failing. 
All indicators will be reviewed annually through the Authority Monitoring Report (AMR) to ascertain trends in how the policies are 
operating and if the Plan and spatial objectives are being achieved.
