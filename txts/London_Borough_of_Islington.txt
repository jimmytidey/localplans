 1 What  is the role of the Local 
Plan ? 
 The Council  is the key agent responsible for shaping Islington’s future. Everything the 
Council  does contributes to making Islington fairer, creating a place where everyone, 
whatever their background, has the same opportunity to reach their potential and enjoy 
a good quality of life . The Local Plan is integral to achieving these aims. It sets out a 
range of planning policies to steer development in the borough over the next fif teen 
years – this includes:  
 spatial policies covering specific areas in the borough;  
 strategic policies which outline the key priorities across a number of policy areas;  
 detai led criteria -based p olicies, which stem from strategic requirements and are 
the main basis on which planning decisions are made; and  
 specific site allocations which provide fine -grain detail on a number of planned and 
potential development sites across Isl ington.  
 The Local Plan  provides a clear, bold framework for planning decisions which set out 
what we expect from development. The Local Plan covers the period 2020 /21 to 
2035 /36 (“the plan period”). Islington is a borough with significant constraints, and it is 
not hyperbole to state that each and every development must make the most of every 
site and development opportunity, in order to ensure that opportunities for using 
increasingly scarce resources, including a lack of developable land, are not wasted.  
 We can only succeed by working with key  public and private sector  partners such as 
the police, health service, and local universities as well as with local communities. The 
Local Plan has been prepared in co -operation with these stakeholders and many 
other s, including adjacent boroughs in line with the Duty to Co -operate . This co -
operation does not stop once the Local Plan is adopted; it is a continuous process, 
which enables policies to remain effective  throughout the lifetime of the plan . 
 The Local Plan i s informed by an extensive evidence base, both technical and non -
technical. In preparing the document, this evidence has provided the basis for our 
approach. Policy requirements at the national and regional level also have direct 
implications on what the Council  can and can not do. Where possible , we have sought 
to reflect  the full range of opinion  – from stakeholders, evidence and policy 
requirements – but it is never possible to identify a single approach with which 
everyone will agree  and which would be f ound ‘sound’ and compliant with various 
statutory requirements set out in planning legislation .  
The planning framework  
 The Local Plan is developed within a compl ex planning framework, at the heart of 
which is primary legislation  which sets out the basic legal parameters within which the 
Local Plan should be prepared and subsequently operate. The Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act  2004  (“The PCPA”) provides the fundamental basis on 
which the plan -led system functions. It sets ou t the definition of  Local Development  
5 
 Documents, a suite of documents which must (taken as a whole) set out the authority’s 
policies (however expressed) relating to the development and use of land in their area . 
This includes documents which have Developme nt Plan status as well as  those which 
do not, such as  Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) and the Statement of 
Community Involvement  (SCI) . 
 The Development Plan  is the key set of documents which inform decisions on  planning 
applications. In Islington , the Development Plan consists of  any locally adopted 
Development Plan Documents (such as the Local Plan) and the London Plan  (the 
Spatial Development Strategy prepared by the Mayor of London ). Any ‘made’ 
neighbourhood plans – those which have been successf ul at examination and 
referendum – also form part of the Development Plan.  
 The PCPA specifies that p lanning applications must be made in accordance with the 
Development P lan unless material considerations indicate otherwise . What does and 
does not constit ute a material consideration is determined on a case -by-case basis, as 
is the weight to be given to any such considerations.  
 Secondary legislation provides further detail on the operation of primary legislation. 
The Town and Country Planning  (Local Plannin g) (England) Regulations 2012 (as 
amended) sets out the process for preparing and adopting a Local Plan. It also 
requires Local Planning Authorities  (LPAs)  to review Local Development Documents  – 
such as the Local Plan – every five years from the date of a doption. A review does not 
mean that policies will definitely need to change – it merely requires an objective 
assessment of policies to determine whether they need updating. Where the review 
concludes that updates are not necessary, the LPAs  must publish the reasons why.  
 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out the Government’ s planning  
policies for England and how the y should be applied. It provides a framework  within 
which locally -prepared plans addressing housing needs and ot her economic, social 
and environmental priorities  can be  produced . The NPPF  must be taken into account 
in preparing the development plan ; it is also a material consideration in planning 
decisions, although the weight attributed to the NPPF will depend on t he details of 
each application.  Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) provides further detail on policies 
in the NPPF.  
 The London Plan is the Spatial Development Strategy for Greater London. It is a 
strategic plan for London which sets out a policy framework co vering a variety of 
economic, social and environmental issues. It is part of the Development Plan, 
meaning it must be taken into account in the determination of planning applications. 
For plan -making, the London Plan provides the strategic, London -wide pol icy context 
for all borough Local Development Documents; all such documents including the Local 
Plan have to be ‘in general conformity’ with the London Plan.  
 This iteration of Islington’s Local Plan is made up of four Development Plan 
Documents:  
 Local Plan : Strategic and Development Management policies – the principal 
document in the Local Plan, which sets out strategic policies to identify where and 
how change will happen in Islington ; and detailed policies to manage development.  
 Site Allocations – this d ocument sets out site specific policy for a number of sites 
across the borough which will contribute to meeting development needs.  
 Bunhill and Clerkenwell Area Action Plan  (AAP)  – a plan for the south of the 
borough  where significant change is expected to occur. The plan sets out spatial  
6 
 policies covering different parts of the area with further  policies to manage 
development.  
 North London Waste Plan – a joint waste plan together with six other boroughs 
within the North Lon don Waste Authority area (Camden, Haringey, Hackney, 
Barnet, Enfield and Waltham Forest).  The Waste Plan will identify a range of 
suitable sites for the management of all North London’s  waste and will include 
policies and guidelines for determining plannin g applications for waste 
developments.  
 There are a number of SPDs  which provide further guidance on Local Plan policies. 
The Policies Map visualises the various designations identified in the Local Plan. 
Implementation of the Local Plan will be monitored t hrough the Authorities Monitoring 
Report.  
Figure 1.1 : Islington Planning Framework  
 
 Section 19 (1B -E) of the PCPA requires LPAs  to identify the strategic priorities for the 
development and use of land in the authority’s area1. Policies to address those 
priorities must be set out in the LPAs  development plan documents (taken as a whole) . 
The NPPF elaborates on the legislative requirement, making clear that Local Plans 
should identify strategic policies, clearly  distinguishing from other policies which are 
considered non -strategic.  
                                                
1 As noted in paragraph 1. 10, the London Plan forms part of Islington’s Development Plan. Where 
LPAs  are satisfied that  policies to address the area’s strategic  priorities are set out in the London 
Plan, policies to address these priorities do not need to be set out in local DPDs. For avoidance of 
doubt, the Local Plan is considered to set out the full suite of policies to  address Islington’s strategic 
priorities. Some DPD policies do refer to relevant London Plan policies but none of the strategic 
priorities of the plan is entirely reliant on the London Plan.

 Strategic policies  should set out an overall strategy for the pattern, scale and quality of 
development  including housing and employment uses. Non-strategic policies should 
be used to set out more detailed policies for specific areas, neighbourhoods or types 
of development.  For avoidance of doubt, all policies have full statutory Development 
Plan weight.  
 Table 1.1 sets out the strategic and non -strategic policies of the Strategic and 
Development Management Policies DPD.

 Islington is affected – directly and indirectly – by changes at the London level, and 
beyond. Islington  is part of Inner London ; it borders  the Inner London boroughs of the  
City of London,  Camden,  Hackney  to the south, west and east  respectively , and the 
Outer  London borough of Haringey  to the north.  It is both a gateway to the commercial 
heart of the city and to the suburbs, and the varied character of the borough reflects 
this. 
Figure 1.2 : Islington in context  
 
 Islington as a place is both small and incredibly diverse . The borough is less than  six 
square miles in size, making it one of the smallest local authorit ies in the country (by 
area). There have been significant population increases in recent years, with 
projections showing further steep increases.  
 Islington’s diversity is reflected in its people. We have a broad multi -ethnic population 
from a variety of back grounds, a variety of faith communities, a significant proportion of 
disabled people, as well as one of the most concentrated LGBT QI+ populations in the 
 
10 
 U.K. Islington is an inclusive place for all  where diversity is celebrated , and ensuring 
that this cont inues is one of the key objectives of the Local Plan.  
 The challenges facing the borough are considerable. Fundamental to almost all of 
them is the degree of contrast within an area which contains both some of the 
country ’s most deprived neighbourhoods in c lose proximity to are as of very 
considerable wealth; t he borough registers as the thirteenth  most deprived in the 
country. This contrast, and particularly the effects of poverty and lack of affordable 
housing, are crucial issues for the borough.  
 Islington is easily accessible via a number of transport modes.  Direct rail links connect 
Islington with Inner and Outer London as well as the wider South East , with Crossrail 
and (potentially) Crossrail 2 poised to open up additional capacity to alleviate pressure 
on the existing transport network .  
 Many people commute through the borough travelling between central and outer 
London.  In terms of Islington residents, over 70% work in Islington, the City of London, 
Westminster or Camden.  Islington has a low proportion of car -owning households but 
suffers from a number of heavily trafficked through -routes, particularly the A1 (Goswell 
Road, Upper Street, Holloway Road) and A503 (York Way, Caledonian Road and 
Pentonville Road/City Road).  
 Islington is a n important  employm ent centre, evidenced by the significant positive net 
inflow of employees, the fourth highest of all Inner London boroughs.  As 
manufacturing has shrunk dramatically  over recent years , office -based businesses 
including financial and business services and, m ore recently, technology and creative 
industries, have all grown rapidly , mirroring the structural shift towards a service -based 
economy seen across the UK . At present, e mployment sectors are diverse although 
most employment space and jobs are concentrated in the south of the borough.  
 The borough is a popular place to live and visit and is valued for its built environment. 
Islington ’s mix of shopping, restaurants, culture  and night -time economy, rich 
architecture and walkable environment draws visitors wishing to explore beyond the 
standard touris t attractions of central London .   
 Islington comprised a number of villages before it became a suburb of Victorian 
London and co ntinues to have its own character. The borough has significant 
Georgian and Victorian heritage, and impo rtant features which predate this heritage,  
for example the shape and space of Clerkenwell Green and Islington Green. It is also 
home to some fine examp les of contemporary architecture.  
 Major growth and change has occurred on Islington’s  doorstep. The Olympics have 
transformed St ratford to the east , with significant development to the west at King’s 
Cross. The south of the borough is located within the Ce ntral Activities Zone  (CAZ) , 
the main commercial centre of the city  where employment uses, particularly business 
floorspace is prioritised.   
 Islington , by contrast, has  little by way of major new development sites  at present , 
certainly sites of regional si gnificance . This is in part due to the character of the 
borough , shortage of developable land  and the historic pattern of development. The 
development strategy advocated in recent years, by the Mayor of London and by 
Government, was to focus new developmen t in Inner London, on brownfield sites. 
Islington has made a significant contribution to delivery of new housing and 
employment space over the past two decades, in line with this overarching 
development strategy ; our small size has not prevented the boroug h taking a bold and  
11 
 expansive approach to new development.  However, we have now reached a critical 
point; given the densely developed nature of Islington and its small size, development 
opportunities to facilitate further growth are decreasing significantl y. 
 The challenge we face is to build on the distinctiveness of Islington – the people and 
places within the borough that make it unique – while ensuring that the bo rough  grows 
in an inclusive and  sustainable way as part of one of the largest and most  populous 
cities in the world.  
 The new London Plan recognises this  challenge explicitly. It advocates a multi -faceted 
spatial approach to development, recognising that i f London is to meet the challenges 
of the future, all parts of London will need to embrace and manage change. This is not 
necessarily transformative  change  – in many places, the London Plan envisages that 
change will occur incrementally , and recognises tha t there needs to be a strong focus 
on sustainable and inclusive regeneration, with boroughs, the Mayor and other 
partners working closely with the local community to bring about the right sort of 
change and investment .  
 In terms of housing growth, the Lond on Plan seeks to meet the vast majority of 
London’s ho using need. Opportunity Areas have the potential to deliver a substantial 
amount of new homes  (as well as employment growth) and are expected to do a lot of 
the heavy lifting in terms of meeting overall  needs. However, the London Plan also 
emphasises the importance of small sites to meet housing need, with a focus on 
incremental, appropriate suburban intensification, and the introduction of a 
presumption in favour of small housing development.  
 The Islington  Local Plan is underpinned by a c lear vision :  
 Islington  has a thriving economy and its location in close proximity to central London 
means it is well placed to continue to develop successfully. This success must feed 
through into all elements of our communities. This is fundamental to creating and 
maintaining a fairer borough  and delivering sustainable development.  
 To ensure that the vision becomes reality , the Local Plan sets out seven clear 
objectives , which are the basis for the policies set out in the rest of the document , and 
which, if delivered , will create and sustain a fairer Islington.  These objectives are not 
drafted to sit idle in the Local Plan introduction; they must be actively considered from 
the very first stage of a development proposal . Each and every development in the 
borough, from small roof extensions and street furniture to major mixed use housing 
and employment  sites, should contribute to the delive ry of the Council ’s objectives. 
Any development proposal which does not proactively engage with and address these 
objectives will not be ac ceptable.  
  
To make Islington fairer and create a place  where everyone, whatever their 
background, has the same opportunity to reach their potential and enjoy a good 
quality of life.   
12 
 
 There is a pressing need to reduce inequality and the negative consequences of 
relative poverty in Islington, so that every person has the same opportunity to reach 
their potential. Islington is a very polarised place of rising inequality and high levels of 
poverty, where wealthy and deprived areas are in close proximity throughout the 
borough.  Those who are poorest are most likely to experience poor physical and 
mental health, have lower educational attainment, and be engaged in or be a victim of 
crime.  
 Maximising the delivery of genuinely affordable housing of a high quality is a key 
aspect of  the Local Plan, which will help tackle inequality  in the borough and improve 
quality of life for residents.  
 Evidence suggests a significant need for genuinely affordable housing, which means 
homes that people can live in without spending very high proport ions of their incomes 
on housing costs.  
 The Council  strives to make Islington  somewhere where everyone, regardless of skills , 
experience or background, can truly and meaningfully share in and shape the success 
of an area. To deliver this, an economy needs to be inclusive and must work for 
everyone, working from the bottom up rather than ‘trickle down’ from the top, providing 
new employment opportunities for all se ctions  of the boroughs residents.  
 The Council  is currently developing it’s overarching strategy for delivering an inclusive 
economy. An inclusive economy is not just beneficial to the borough’s disadvantaged 
residents on an individual level. By reducing social inequality, it enables more 
cohesive and resilient local communities. A diverse local economy that contains a 
broad range and mix of sectors and businesses at varying scales is more resilient than 
an economy domin ated by a few sectors. It is also better able to withstand an 
economic downturn. Economic diversity adds to the character of the borough making it 
a more attractive and interesting place to live and work. A diverse ecosystem of small 
locally owned business es can rapidly respond to consumer need while offering 
experiences that can’t be replicated through e -commerce.  
 Provision of affordable workspace and suitable space for a range of businesses, 
including Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ), is key to deliver ing an inclusive 
economy, as this is a tangible mechanism to open up the local economy to those who 
would otherwise find it difficult or impossible to access. Provision of student bursaries, 
funded by new student accommodation, also offer opportunities to tackle the root 
cause of worklessness and give young people the opportunity to develop skills and 
learning.  
 Islington is a vibrant place for people to live, work, visit or pass through. Safety and  the 
feeling /perception of safety can be a key determinant for how vibrant  and successful  a 
place is. The Council  wants people to be safe and feel secure on its streets and within 
its open spaces. Safety relates to crime and anti -social behaviour, but also other 
considerations such as use of transport infrastructure and the public realm. The 
creation and maintenance of mixed and balanced communities will be a key part of 
ensuring safety; this depend s on a detailed understanding of how new developments 
can integrate into existing strong and cohesive communities.   
13 
 
 The benefits of designing for community safety should not be underestimated, 
particularly for more vulnerable people, including children, young people, older and 
disabled residents. It is therefore expected that the design of proposals seeks  to 
achieve an appropriate spatial balance between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles 
using the space, and that measures t o bring together design and management to 
modify user behaviour for the better are introduced. D esigns should encourage more 
users onto the street to  promote natural surveillance.  
 Designing out crime is a key planning principle, which incorporates a number of design 
techniques to limit incidences of crime; this includes increases in natural surveillance 
and designing space so it is conducive to positiv e behaviour . 
 Risks  of physical harm, for example, from perceived danger in the public realm where 
pedestrians, cyclist and vehicles all operate in close proximity to one another. Without 
clear delineation of routes for different modes of transport, the ris k of accidents and 
collisions increases. The Mayor  of London  has a long -term vision  (so-called ‘Vision 
Zero’)  for no deaths or serious injuries to occur on London’s streets , via street design 
and management that accommodates human error and ensures impact levels are not 
sufficient to cause fatal or serious injury.  
 In any event, designers should take into account the experience of local community 
safety groups and other relevant expertise in weighing the risks and benefits 
associated with a proposal. It is n ot always necessary to eliminate all risks; in 
pedestrianised areas or residential locations (with less traffic) for instance, it might be 
possible to encourage children and young people to play in the street. And, where 
risks are unavoidable they can very  often be offset.  
 The Local Plan aims to deliver development that is adaptable and usable for people of 
all ages. The importance of ensuring that children and young people have access to 
the right facilities as they grow cannot be overstated. Ensuring a child friendly  
environment for children and young people ensures that they get the best start in life, 
and will enable them to  achieve their full po tential.   
 The Fair Futures Commission project explored what is needed to improve the futures 
of children, young people and their families  in Islington, with the aim  to make Islington 
a great place to grow up in. The Commission was an  independent  body  made up of 
people from a range of backgrounds and lived experiences.  
 Planning is an importan t tool to facilitate th e recommendations of the Commission to 
deliver child -friendly places , whether through protection and provision of social 
infrastructure such as sc hools, libraries and community centres; protection of a range 
of spaces of all shapes and sizes, both soft and hard landscaped, where pl ay and 
activity can occur; or by ensuring good quality housing with enough space for children 
and young people to lead h ealthy lives.  
 The quality of Islington’s  places and spaces support the borough’s diverse 
communities and its commercial, c ultural and social life. The success of any 
development depends largely on how it relates a nd contributes to its context. There 
are no sites within the borough that are so large or so detached from their 
surroundings that the context can be ignored. It mus t also be recognised that a site’s  
14 
 context is dynamic, constantly evolving with time and use and any new development 
must be sufficiently resilient to, and capable of flexing with, that change . All planning 
applications must take into account the wider physical, social, economic, cultural, 
historic and green infrastructure; identifying the opportunities and challenges each 
presents.  
 This is  not just individual buildings but the wider neighbourho od, public realm, 
transport and associated social infrastructure. An inclusive place should facilitate 
social cohesion and community stability, avoiding the need for unwanted or premature 
moves. It should also support the local economy, enabling service pr oviders to benefit 
from the patronage of the whole community.  
 The creation and maintenance of mixed and balanced communities depends on a 
detailed understanding of how new developments can integrate into existing strong 
and cohesive communities. The way in  which a site connects with and ‘stitches into’ its 
surroundings, and how it might be developed to improve those, or create new, 
connections is a vital part of the assessment of new development. Those connections 
might be for pedestrians, bikes, wildlife, visual links, way -finding, sunlight and or 
drainage; improving the site’s amenity and its contribution to the amenity of the area. 
Each should be carefully considered to deliver safe, inclusive, functional and efficient 
routes.  The delivery of more well de signed places within the public realm, which 
provide the opportunity and a reason for people to dwell, will also facilitate the 
personal connections that underpin wider social/community cohesion .   
 An inclusive place features socially inclusive neighbourho ods without barriers, which 
enables a range of users to access spaces and interact within them. For example, 
developments should increase rather than reduce permeability; residential and 
commercial developments should not be gated.  This will enhance the di gnity of 
individuals, supporting their use and enjoyment of facilities on their own terms. To that 
end design proposals that separate users and deliver an inferior experience, on the 
basis of a person’s age, disab ility, race, gender, wealth, or any other c haracteristic , will 
be resisted.  
 Places and spaces must be designed with diversity in mind, so that they are 
convenient and enjoyable for all to use . The provision of accessible, essential and 
appropriate services to support a development will allow indep endent use and 
contribute to the cohesion and sustainability of the community.  
 Attention should also be given to the quality of spaces around or between buildings; 
determining their social, environmental, historical, cultural and aesthetic value, whilst 
connecting, reflecting and enhancing the structures and spaces they link.  
 Islington’s historic environment is one of the borough’s defining characteristics, 
including a variety of heritage assets. Conservation of this historic environment will be 
help to del iver wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits. 
Opportunities to enhance the historic environment should be sought wherever 
possible.  
 Islington has  the second lowest proportion of green space (as a proportion of overall 
land), and the se cond lowest amount of open space, of any local authority in the 
country. As a small but densely populated borough, green and open space is highly 
valued but under continued pressure in light of housing, population and employment 
growth. Planning has a key role in balancing the pressures of development with the 
need to provide a high quality green infrastructure to meet the needs of Islington’s 
communities.   
15 
 
 Provision of green and open space provides multiple benefits. It is extremely important 
for residents’  health and wellbeing. It provides space for recreation and play, 
supporting the development of a child -friendly borough. It can also act as a space for 
mental relief and a place to escape; parts of the borough experience issues with 
overcrowded housing, t herefore the availability of green and open spaces – however 
small – can be an important resource for these residents. In addition, it protects and 
enhances biodiversity, lessens flood risk, improves air quality and helps with mitigating  
the impact of clim ate change  
 Development should continue to make efficient use of land and fully integrate with, and 
relate positively to, its immediate neighbours and locality.  This principle ensures that 
regard is had to the historic environment whilst enabling sensible e volution of 
character and facilitating new development.  
 Planning has a significant role to play in minimising the borough’s contribution to 
climate change and ensuring that the impacts of climate change can be effectively 
mitigated. Climate change impacts are increasingly affecting the day -to-day lives of 
people who live in, work in and visit Islington. From the ‘urban heat island effect ’ to 
extreme winter temperatures, this threatens the health and wellbeing of these people 
and also the physical fabric of the borough which makes it a place where people want 
to be. In June 2019, t he Council  declared a n environment and  climate emergenc y and 
has pledged to work towards making Islington net zero carbon by 2030.  
 The approach to tackling climate change is multi -faceted, including provision of more 
green infrastructure, ensuring buildings are designed sustainably and promoting less 
polluting  modes of transport, in particular walking , cycling  and public transport . 
 Spatial planning can positively influence the wider determinants of health by shaping a 
healthier environment  for people of all ages , abilities and backgrounds  across the 
borough , from ensuring every ch ild has the best start in life to creating healthy, 
inclusive environments for older and disabled people.  
 This includes facilitating  active healthy lifestyles and reducing inactivity  through the 
pattern of development, good urban design, good access to local services and 
facilities  (including sports facilities) ; increased urban greening and open space ; 
provision of  safe places for active play and food growing ; improved accessibility  by 
walking , cycling and public transport .  
 Tackling inequality and poverty can also have a significant impact on health and 
wellbeing. Islington has  wealth y and deprived areas located  cheek by jowl throughout 
the borough. Those who are poorest are also most likely to experience poor physical 
and mental health, lower educational attainment, and be engaged in or be a victim of 
crime.  Islington residents experience poorer physical and mental  health that results in 
early deaths from cancer and circulatory disease , caused in large part due to 
deprivation across all Islington wards coupled with unhealthy lifestyle choices and poor 
access to the right services at the right time. Deprivation is th e main risk factor for 
early death and poor health in Islington.  
 At the same time, life expectancy is increasing overall . Some people are living longer 
while experiencing long-term physical and mental health conditions , for example, there 
has been  an incr ease in the number of people living with demen tia. This requires the 
creation of a healthy  environment that contributes to the prevention of  ill-health, but  
16 
 also one supports people who do experience ill -health  to live independently , for longer,  
in their c ommunity.  Planning can help to create social, civic spaces which increases 
interaction of people from all walks of life. This can help address issues of loneliness 
and social isolation which affect certain residents, and which can have a detrimental 
impact  on health  and wellbe ing, particularly mental health . 
 Planning delivers holistic benefits and considers issues over the long -term. Proper 
planning can help to identify and mitigate issues, thereby saving money and resources 
in future , building resilience . The examples of this are numerous, whether requiring 
energy efficiency measures to address fuel poverty, which saves families £100s and 
may lessen chances of them requiring support services in future; or by ensuring that 
hot food takeaways are not opened up near schools, contributing to reduced level of 
childhood obesity which has knock on benefits for health spending amongst other 
things.  
 To be truly proactive and contribute fully to ensuring efficiency of resources  will require 
further improv ements in  those policy areas where  we are already doing well, and 
developing effective solutions for po licy areas which are currently not delivering as 
they should be. 
17 
 
 Islington aspires to the highest standards of architectural and urban design in London, 
to be at the forefront of sustainability and to preserv e and enhance the borough’s 
historic environment, its heritage assets and their settings. Good design is indivisible 
from good planning, and innovation and tradition need to be complementary for 
successful physical regeneration and the creation of high qua lity public spaces and 
places.  
A. All forms of development are required to be of  a high quality and make a positive 
contribu tion to  local character,  legibility and distinctiveness , based upon an up-to-
date understanding and evaluation of the  defining characteristics  of an area . Any 
development which does not take  the opportunities available for improving the 
character and quality of an area and the way it functions  will be refused .  
B. To ensure that  the vision and objectives of the Local P lan are realised,  all 
development in Islington must , from the very first iteration of the proposal, comply 
with four key design  principles:  
(i) Contextual – all development must make efficient use of sites/buildings, by 
respond ing to and enhancing  the existing site context  (which could extend 
beyond the site itself) ; not undermining  the quality of existing development  and 
streetscape ; and ensuring that the development capacity of site is fully realised . 
A good level of a menity must  be provided, including consideration of noise and 
the impact of disturbance, hours of operation, vibration, pollution  (such as air, 
light and noise) , fumes between and within developments, overshadowing, 
overlooking, privacy, direct sunlight an d daylight, over-dominance,  sense of 
enclosure and outlook2. 
(ii) Connected – development must  improve permeability and movement through 
areas  and the quality, clarity and sense of spaces around and between 
buildings. All opportunities to repair fragmented urban form  should be taken . 
Proposals must  improve safety and promote positive social contact, behaviours 
and community cohesion, including through creation  or en hancement of 
effective places to dwell, and through increased natural surveillance.  
Developmen t must  sustain and reinforce a variety and mix of uses in line with 
any relevant land use priorities of the Local Plan . No proposal should unduly 
prejudice the satisfactory development or operation of adjoining land and/or the 
development of the surroundin g area as a whole . 
(iii) Inclusive – development must  be adaptable, functional and resilient, and able to 
respond to the spatial, social and economic needs of the borough’s increasingly 
diverse communities and their  different and evolving demands. This includes 
sustaining and reinforcing a variety and mix of uses in line with any relevant land 
use priorities of the Local Plan . 
(iv) Sustainable – development must be durable and adaptable, and contribute to 
the creation of a vibrant, liveable, enduring city . All develop ment must consider 
                                                
2 This is not an exhaustive list and there may be other relevant amenity impacts which should be 
considered on a case -by-case basis.   
18 
 social, environmental and economic elements jointly and simultaneously, 
guiding development towards sustainable solutions . 
C. The process  of developing and designing a proposal which addresses the  four key 
design  principles  will only be effective where it is informed by a comprehensive site 
appraisal . All development proposals must  submit a site appraisal  comprising  the 
information  below , commensurate with the scale, location and potential impact of 
the proposal; major developments and  smaller developments on sites in prominent 
or sensitive locations will likely be required to address many, if not all, of the criteria. 
Information must be demonstrated/evidenced through provision of detailed clear 
and accurate drawings and relevant writt en statements3: 
(i) architectural and design quality and detailing, such as colour, type, source and 
texture of detailing and materials used. Construction detailing must be  unified, 
visually attractive, robust and maintenance fre e; poorly -detailed and 
undelive rable built forms are not appropriate;  
(ii) details of historic context, such as distinctive local built form, significance and 
character of any designated and non -designated heritage assets, scale and 
details that contribute to its character as a place ; 
(iii) an ass essment of the urban form, such as building lines, frontages, plot sizes 
and patterns, building heights, storey heights and massing;  
(iv) movement and spatial patterns, such as definition, scale, use, detailing and 
surface treatment of routes and spaces;  
(v) consid erations of the local landscape and natural features, such as topography, 
trees, boundary treatments, planting and biodiversity ; this must  be informed by 
appropriate information including, where relevant, a tree survey and analysis of 
the local ecology and  green links ; 
(vi) visual context, particularly strategic, local and other site specific views  (e.g. local 
landmarks) , skylines and silhouettes, and scale and form of townscape set 
pieces or urban compositions;  
(vii) daylight and sunlight levels, based on relevant be st practice/guidance ; 
(viii) surface water flows and opportunities to capture them;  
(ix) existi ng features and patterns of use including  housing , entertainment, 
commercial, community and play activities;  
(x) details of infrastructure provision, including existing and planned infrastructure, 
and any impacts that the proposed development will have on this  existing and/or 
planned  provision;  
(xi) the accessibility (physical, social, and economic) of the street in conte xt; 
including technical survey  information  and feedback on user experience  of the 
street ;  
(xii) safety in design, including consideration of access, materials and site 
management strategies;  
(xiii) plan(s) showing the location of utilities above and below ground , and,  
where proposals may impact on ongoing operation of utilities, evidence of 
engagement with relevant utilities providers ; 
                                                
3 In conjunction with additional information requirements set out in various Local Plan policies.   
19 
 (xiv) traffic, including pedestrian flows at different times of the day and week, 
and an analysis of what modal shift might be possible; and  
(xv) assessment of route and place qualities . 
D. All elements of proposed building designs must be demonstrably deliverable. Any 
proposals which are considered likely to employ  ‘value engineering’ approaches, 
which dilute the design quality of approved schemes and  often make schemes 
difficult  to maintain, will be resisted.  
 
 The four key de sign principles are an essential part of delivering the vision and 
objectives of the Local Plan , and are the starting point for designing a developme nt 
proposal. A ll development in the borough must seek to deliver holistic benefits in line 
with these  principles, which will ensure that each and every scheme maximises its 
contribution to the overarching aims of the Local Plan, thereby making the best use of 
land in the borough.  
 The policy ensures that the site and its context ha ve been sufficiently analysed and 
understood during the design process and that this knowledge has been used in the 
proposed design of the development. For development to be considered acceptable, it 
must be:  
 Contextual – development proposals must respond to and enhance the existing 
site context. Consideration of various potential amenity impacts is a key aspect of 
this de sign principle; this includes:  
o ensuring a minimum distance of 18 metres between windows o f habitable 
rooms , to protect privacy for residential developments and existing 
residen tial properties . This does not a pply across the public highway, as 
overlooking across a public highway does not constitute an unacceptable 
loss of privacy.  
o assessment of daylight and sunlight to ensure that there is sufficient levels 
of sunlight and daylight to penetrate into and between buildings, and 
ensure that adjoining land or properties are protected from unacceptable 
overshadowing.  Further guidance is p rovided in t he Building Research 
Establishment (BRE) p ublication ‘ Site Layout Planning for Daylight and 
Sunlight: a guide to good practice ’. 
o consideration of r ooftop plant and enclosures which can often have a 
negative impact on the roofline of both existi ng and proposed buildings. 
Plant enclosures must  therefore  not be visible from the public realm and 
should instead be  incorporated within the main body of the building.  
 
 Connected  - good places are well connected, and it is essential to look beyond the 
red line of the site boundary and consider how new development will connect with 
its surroundings and integrate with the urban context and natural environment. 
Development which unduly prejudices the satisfactory development or operation of 
adjoining land and /or the development of the surrounding area as a whole  will be 
resisted. This will be assessed on a case -by-case basis but could include impacts 
on renewa ble or low carbon energy supply, i.e. where new development caused  
detrimental  overshadowing of solar panels. Where negative impacts are identified, 
the design must  be modified where possible, to avoid adverse impacts.  
 
 Inclusive  – an inclusive development places people at the heart of the design 
process, creating places /environments  which:  
  
20 
 o are convenient an d enjoyable  for everyone to use . Development must  be 
designed with diversity in mind; addressing the specific physical, sensory, 
cognitive and social needs of people protected by current equalities 
legislation. This will ensure that barriers are designed out and flexibility built 
in. The provision of accessible, essential and appropriate services to 
support a development will also provide for and will enhance independence 
and contribute to the cohesion and sustainability of the community.  
o ensu re ‘ease of use’ and versatility in use . ‘Ease of use’  means that access 
to, and enjoyment of, an environment should require minimal strength, 
stress and effort and should be achievable in comfort; independently and/or 
with assistance delivered on the user s’ terms. “Versatility” suggests a lack 
of prescription in a design and, as a result, flexibility in use. Versatile 
solutions take into account diverse and evolving needs, whilst minimising 
the need for structural adaptation . 
o are safe, legible and logical.  Logical layouts and clear sightlines enable 
spaces and places to be understood without recourse to excessive text 
based signage. They inspire a sense of security and promote confidence, 
minimising the need for active surveillance and/or personal support.  
o have integrated the  design and management of development from the 
outset and over its lifetime  and therefore minimising the need for awkward, 
costly and unsightly alteration in the future . The success of an Inclusive 
Design will often be affected as much by its management as by its physical 
form. Shortcomings in the latter frequently place unreasonable and 
unsustainable demands on the former, and vice versa. Implications for the 
management of sp aces and places, particularly when considering diverse 
and changing needs, must  be considered and resolved at the earliest 
design stages.  
o uphold  the ‘dignity’ of all users and avoid  the separation or special 
treatment of any individual ; this includes safe and dignified emergency 
evacuation for all building users in a manner that does not limit the number 
of particular users permitted in any part of the building.  
 
 Sustainable  – the concept of sustainable development underpins the entire 
planning system. Deve lopment proposals must  ensure that social, environmental 
and economic benefits, as sought by the full suite of Local Plan policies, are 
delivered holistically.  
 Policy PLAN1  applies to all new developments including alterations and e xtensions to 
existing buildings. With regard to the information required by Part C, the scale and 
nature of a development will determine the relevance of particular elements. In order 
to deliver high quality design and demonstrate that all design policy re quirements have 
been considered from the very first stage of a proposal, applicants/developers will be 
expected to demonstrate a rigorous design process that , inter alia :  
 is multidisciplinary, bringing together functional, technical and aesthetic 
consider ations;  
 employs relevant specialist expertise;  
 engages with the planning authority from the earliest stages;  
 places people at the heart of the process;  
 brings together the design and management  of the built environment; and   
21 
  is regularly monitored and e valuated.  
 The design process does not end once an application is permitted. All elements of 
proposed building designs must be demonstrably deliverable. In the realisation of 
buildings from plans to build -out, their design quality can often be compromised b y 
poorly -considered detailing and inappropriate materials. Such ‘v alue engineering’ 
approaches , which dilute the design quality of approved schemes  and often make 
schemes difficult to maintain , will be resisted. Where relevant, g uarantees on design 
quality  will be secured through conditions and/or legal agreement.  
 Further details on design requirements in Islington are set out in supplementary 
guidance including the Islington Urban Design Guide, Streetbook  and Inclusive Design  
SPDs . Islington’s Design Revie w Panel can provide constructive feedback on certain 
design proposals4.

 2 Area Spatial Strategies  
 This section sets out a number of policies for various parts of the borough where 
growth and change is expected to occur within the plan period.  These areas are 
shown on  the key diagram  (Figure 2.1 ) below:  
Figure 2.1: Key diagram - Islington Spatial Strategy  areas  
 
 
23 
 
 Each Spatial Strategy  policy (SP1 to SP 8) sets out the key priorities and requirements 
for the respective a reas, with a detailed Spatial Strategy  map visualising these . All 
development proposals within the Spatial Strategy  areas must be actively consider 
how they will address  the Local Plan objectives, from the very first stage of the 
proposal through to any ev entual permission.  
 The parts of Islington not covered by a Spatial Strategy  area will still experience 
development and change over the plan period, but it is not expected to be at the same 
scale as the defined areas. Relevant Local Plan policies in chapters 3 to 9 will apply 
where proposals come forward in these parts of the borough.  
 Some parts of Islington, particularly those areas adjacent to the borough boundary, 
may experience change by virtue of significant development in other b oroughs. 
Islington is committed to working with other boroughs and relevant stakeholders to 
deliver such development while preventing/mitigating impacts for Islington residents 
and businesses. Of particular relevance is joint working with the London Boroug hs of 
Hackney (with regard to Dalston Town Centre, Finsbury Park Town Centre and the 
City Fringe/ Shoreditch area), Camden (with regard to King’s Cross) and Haringey (with 
regard to Finsbury Park Town Centre). 
24 
 A. The Bunhill and Clerkenwell area is made up of following six  Spatial Strategy  areas  
(shown on Figure 2.2) : 
 City Fringe Opportunity Area  
 City Road  
 Farringdon  
 Mount Pleasant and Exmouth Market  
 Central Finsbury  
 Historic Clerkenwell  
B. The Bunhill and Clerkenwell Area Action Plan (AAP) has policies for each Spatial 
Strategy  area, which set out the key strategic considerations  for these areas . These 
areas have been defined by their scope for development opportunities to meet key 
needs (in particular office use) and distinctive characteristics that must be 
maintained and enhanced . 
C. The AAP also sets out area -wide policies focused on prioritising and supporting the 
office funct ion of the area , as well as consolidating and enhancing the area’s 
cultural, retail and leisure role . 
 
 Bunhill and Clerkenwell  is the area in the borough expected to see the most significant 
levels of growth, particularly business floorspace. This growth must be  managed , to 
secure a high quality and sustainable urban environment, to promote economic growth 
and employment, and also to address the deep challenges including deprivation, 
social mobility and environmental problems . 
 The Bunhill and Clerkenwell A rea Action Plan (AAP) sets out area -specific policy for 
the majority of the Bunhill and Clerkenwell wards of Islington. The plan area lies within 
the CAZ and comprises almost all of I slington’s portion of this area ; Figure 2. 2 shows 
the location of the AAP  area in relation the rest of the borough . The AAP identifies a 
number of site allocations where new development is expected to come forward. The 
AAP operates in conjunction with th e Local Plan: Strategic and Development 
Management Policies document.  
 The a rea is  the most significant location for commercial growth  in Islington,  particularly 
office floorspace. Bunhill and Clerkenwell has a large and successful  economy and is 
home to 7 0% of Islington’s jobs , the majority of which are office -based . Local and 
regional evidence is clear that the CAZ is the location with the most demand for office 
space and this will be the priority land use within the AAP area.  
 The area also has a rich variety of cultural, entertainment and leisure uses . These 
uses are integral to  supporting the predominant office -led employment function of the 
area, but they also contribute to  a significant night -time economy and  the creation of a 
dynamic and attractive place in their own right .  
25 
 
 Bunhill and Clerkenwell is also  home to a variety of education and medical uses and 
has a significant residential population , including a number of housing estates across 
the area . The area is very well connected to London and this will be further improved 
following the opening of the E lizabeth Line .  
26 
 Figure 2.2 : Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP area boundary and Spatial Strategy  areas  
 
 
27 
 A. The King’s Cross Spatial Strategy  area is partly covered by the CAZ, while the 
remaining part is a CAZ fringe location, including the King’s Cross Priority 
Employment Location  (PEL) . Within these locations existing business uses will be 
safeguarded and proposals for the intensification, renewal and modernisation of 
existing business floorspace  is encouraged. Proposals for new business floorspace 
are required to maximise the provision of business floorspace.  
B. The Knowledge Quarter refers to the area around King’s Cross5 where many 
important institutions spanning research, higher education, scien ce, art, culture and 
media are based.  Maximisation of B1 floorspace in the King’s Cross  Spatial 
Strategy  area could support the expansion of the ‘Knowledge Quarter ’ in Islington, 
and advance the development of a commercial corridor along Pentonville Road/C ity 
Road.  
C. A broad range of business  floorspace typologies are suitable within the Spatial 
Strategy  area, including Grade A offices, hybrid space, and co -working space.   
D. The Local Shopping Areas  (LSAs)  of Kings Cross, Caledonian Road (Copenhagen 
Street) and Caledonian Road (Central) are located in the Spatial Strategy  area. Th e 
existing retail and service function of these areas will be maintained and enhanced 
in line with Policy R4. These shopping area s function together collectively to form a 
‘high street’ along Caledonian Road, which should continue to provide important 
services for local communities, particularly retail and leisure.  
E. Opportunities to repair, improve and unify existing frontages on Ca ledonian Road 
are encouraged , in particular the stretch between the junctions of Twyford Street 
and Copenhagen Street.  
F. The Council  aims to improve the pedestrian, cyclist and bus network and will seek 
to reduce traffic access on some residential roads. Im provements to public transport 
capacity are supported. General improvements to the public realm, specifically 
along York Way and Caledonian Road, will create a safer and better -quality 
environment for pedestrians and cyclists.  Measures to improve bus journ ey time 
and bus priority (especially over private vehicles) are supported.  
G. The Council  will seek to improve connectivity and permeability for pedestrians and 
cyclists, within and across the Kings Cross area and nearby neighbourhoods, 
particularly east -west access. Removing barriers to movement and integrating the 
urban fabric are key priorities for the whole area, but particularly between the area 
east of York Way and King’s Cross Central. All new development proposals, 
transport and other public realm sche mes must  contribute towards achieving these 
priorities.  
H. Regent’s Canal will continue to be an important multifunctional space , primarily as a 
wildlife corridor but also as a recreational space  for pedestrians  and cyclists . Access 
                                                
5 There is no defined boundary for the Knowledge Quarter within the Local Plan. For avoidance of 
doubt, the Knowledge Quarter would not encompass land north of the London Overground line which 
crosses York Way.   
28 
 to the canal should be imp roved, although  increased access must  not cause 
detrimental impacts, particularly for biodiversity.  
I. Proposals for residential moorings, including  those which meet an identified housing 
need for boat dwellers, will  be permitted  where : 
(i) they are located  on the south of the canal (off -side) ; 
(ii) supporting uses and facilities are in place  from the first use of the mooring ; 
(iii) public access  to and along the towpath is not impeded;  
(iv) they do not hinder navigation along the waterway ; 
(v) there is no impact on leisure provisio n; and   
(vi) there is no  detrimental impact on air quality, nature conservation /biodiversity  or 
the character of the waterway.  
J. King’s Cross has a distinct character, and the area contains a number of heritage 
assets, including the Regent’s Canal and a number of  listed buildings. The area’s 
character will be protected and enhanced, with high quality design encouraged to 
respect the local context of King’s Cross and its surroundings.  
K. Four sites in the Spatial Strategy  area have been identified as potentially suitable for  
tall buildings over 30 metres.  
 
 Kings Cross is continuing to develop as a key commercial destination and important 
transport hub. High -density development delivering office, retail and leisure space, as 
well as housing, has taken place on both sides of the Camden/Islington boundary. The 
area’s  central London location, and excellent local, national and international transport 
links, has enabled high quality regeneration which has  successfully attract ed high 
profile commercial tenants.  
 As the development of the King’s Cross Central site ad jacent to the rail way tracks 
continues into the pl an period, it will bring further change to the character of the area. 
The development is already producing a noticeable ‘halo’ effect, with office buildings 
that pre -date the development observed to be busy  and fully occupied. It is considered 
that this effect will only intensify as the King’s Cross Central development matures.  
 There is an opportunity for the King’s Cross area to help meet Islington’s significant 
projected jobs growth and support the econom ic growth of the borough over the p lan 
period, through protection of existing commercial floorspace across the area, including 
in the PELs covering York Road, Regent’s Wharf, Wharfdale Road and Regent’s 
Quarter; and through the intensification of business uses across the area. Proposals 
for new business floorspace are required to maximise the provision of business 
floorspace in these locations and proposals which are not considered to maximise 
business floorspace will not be allowed.  
 The remainder of the Spatial Strategy  area – outside of the P ELs – may also be 
appropriate for the development of business floorspace as the ‘halo effect’ from the 
King’s Cross central development continues.  
 Many important academic and cultural institutions are based within the  King’s Cross 
area, including the British Library and the Francis Crick Institute in Camden and Kings 
Place and the Institute of Physics in Islington. To promote collaboration and forge  
29 
 closer links to the community , a growing number of local organisations  have come 
together under the umbrella of the ‘Knowledge Quarter’. The Knowledge Quarter aims 
to market the commercial potential of the area as an incubator of innovation, given its 
excellent transport links and access to local universities and other insti tutions carrying 
out important research work.  
 The activities of the Knowledge Quarter could encourage and support development 
which Camden and Islington Council s could harness for employment opportunities for 
local residents. This could range from employm ent opportunities in Knowledge Quarter 
industries; placements, apprenticeships, training and skills development, to affordable 
workspace provision . Ensuring an adequate supply of business floorspace in the 
Spatial Strategy  area will support the Knowledge Q uarter. The Knowledge Quarter 
could also support the development and enhancement of a commercial corridor, in 
particular the provision of additional business space of various typologies, along 
Pentonville Road/City Road, down to Old Street and the City of London boundary.  
 Aside from being an important business location, the King’s Cross area also has a 
retail function. Three LSAs  are located within the area – King’s Cross, Caledonian 
Road (Copenhagen Street) and Caledonian Road (Central). These areas, whils t small 
in scale compared  to Islington’s Town Centre s, serve an important role for local 
residents and workers, and should be maintained and enhanced.  
 As the regeneration of King’s Cross continues, it is likely that this will impact 
surrounding areas, suc h as ‘the Cally’ – a commercial section of Caledonian Road 
between Regent’s Canal north and Pentonville Prison. The Council  believes that local 
people and businesses in this area should benefit from the regeneration of King’s 
Cross. There are also opportun ities for improving existing frontages o n Caledonian 
Road, particularly between the junction of Twyford Street and Copenhagen Street, and 
improving connectivity  and the urban fabric in this area. The Cally Plan SPD provides 
further guidance.  
 Kings Cross w ill continue to be a nationally and internationally significant transport 
hub. The expansion of the area presents several opportunities for improving the road 
network and public realm. This may include improvements to the pedestrian, cyclist 
and bus networ ks and measures to reduce traffic on some residential roads. The 
Council  also encourages general walking and cycling improvements in the area, 
including the creation of east -west cycle routes.  
 There is a long term aspiration Council  to see the former Maid en Lane station 
(immediately over the borough boundary in Camden)  re-opened , which could provide 
additional transport capacity for the area.  
 Much of the area is covered by Conservation Areas and there are several listed and 
locally listed buildings locate d here. The historic character of the area should be 
enhanced and maintained and any development must  have regard to any listed or 
locally listed buildings located nearby.  
 The Islington Tall Building s study (2018) thoroughly assessed the borough’s potentia l 
to accommodate the development of new tall buildings. Policy DH3 has been informed 
by the Islington Tall Building s study (2018) and must be read alongside this Spatial 
Strategy  policy. The Spatial Strategy  diagram ( Figure 2.3) identifies the following four 
sites where tall buildings (30 metres and above) may be appropriate in the King’s 
Cross Spatial Strategy  area:   
30 
  Railway land and substation on York Way, opposite student housing tower (site F1 
from the study).  
 Railway land be tween Overground and HS1 tracks, east of York Way (site F2 from 
study).  
 176-178 York Way, car wash site (site F4 from study).  
 Penton Rise Estate, corner of Weston Rise with Pentonville Road (site F5 from 
study).  
 Any proposal for tall buildings on these si tes must be fully consistent with DH3 and all 
other relevant policies  and Site Allocations . 
 Site F5 is not allocated within the Site Allocations DPD. The study identifies site F5 as 
suitable, in principle, for a local landmark  building of  up to 37m (12 sto reys). This 
would only be suitable as part of comprehensive redevelopment of the estate, which 
must be developed through engagement with local residents and stakeholders. There 
would be an opportunity to mark this street corner with a local landmark, to he lp 
terminate the view northwards  from Kings Cross Road. Redeveloping the site could re -
introduce a more street based development and establish a sense of place. 
Commercial floorspace should be promoted along the ground and lower floors along 
Pentonville Ro ad.

  The Vale Royal /Brewery Road Locally Significant Industrial Site  (LSIS)  will be 
retained and strengthened as the borough’s most significant industrial location. The 
principal objective in this area is to retain  industrial land  and intensify B1(c)  light 
industrial, B2 general industry and B8 storage and distribution use s. To ensure an 
adequate supply of industrial land and floorspace in Islington, proposals that would 
result in a loss of industrial land or floorspace , either through change of use or 
redevelopment, will not be permitted. In addition, encroachment of non -industrial 
uses  (especially office and residential uses)  over time, which would jeopardise long 
term sustainability , economic function and future economic growth of the LSIS  as an 
industrial area will not be allowed.  
 The provision of ‘hybrid workspace’, wh ich may incorporate a mix of the industrial -
related  uses, is encouraged.  Proposals for r efurbishment of existing buildings or 
redevelopment should provide a variety of spaces that can accommodate a range of 
industrial uses , including spaces  which are suita ble for SMEs.  
 The LSIS is a successful industrial  location which accommodates a wide range of 
operators, including some existing non -industrial uses such as offices . While these 
existing operators currently co -exist with the predominant industrial uses, additional 
non-industrial uses would undermine the industrial function of the area. Any 
proposal which introduces additional offices, regardless of whether there is exi sting 
office use on -site, and which does not result in the building being in predominantly 
industrial use , will be refused . The encroachment of office s is considered to be the 
principal threat to  the continued  industrial function and balance of uses in the  LSIS. 
The development of office use may be permissible as part of a hybrid workspace 
scheme, but it must only constitute a small proportion of the overall gross floorspace 
proposed.  
 The Council  recognises the contribution of businesses related to the music and 
entertainment industry in the area, including Tileyard Studios, and seeks to support 
this successful economic cluster through protecting existing uses. However, the 
development of new floo rspace related to the music and entertainment industry 
uses/cluster must be in line with the land use policies set out in Parts A and C of this 
policy.  
 Where development is proposed – new build, alterations to existing buildings, 
extensions and/or demolit ion and redevelopment – building heights must  not exceed 
five storeys (and in some locations should be l ess). Taller building elements may be 
acceptable where identified in relevant site allocations . All proposals which would 
increase existing heights must  fully address criteria in Policy DH3 and other relevant 
policies .  
 Development must  protect and enhance heritage assets in the area. Any proposals 
within the viewing corridor from Randell’s Road Bridge  to the clock tower on Market 
Road should be limited t o three to four commercial storeys.  
 Development on York Way or Vale Royal, in proximity to the Maiden Lane tower 
adjacent to the western boundary of the LSIS, must be clearly sub -ordinate in 
height. Given the narrow street profile of York Way and Vale Roya l, proposals  
33 
 should avoid creating a canyon effect through appropriate set back; and by stepping 
down heights to avoid adverse impacts on local character and the street scene.  
 The LSIS is currently inward facing. Where possible, development should avoid 
blank frontages and create active frontages towards open spaces, such as Market 
Road Gardens and the sport pitches on Market Road. The creation of active 
frontages may also be appropriate along York Way and Caledonian Road, where 
consistent with the land use  policies set out above.  
 Development proposals in the LSIS should , where possible,  improve  pedestrian and 
vehicle connections throughout the LSIS and have regard to proposed routes set 
out on the Spatial Strategy  diagram .  
 All development proposals in the  LSIS must (individually and cumulatively) consider 
the layout, orientation, access, servicing and delivery arrangements in order to 
minimise conflict and to avoid potential negative impacts on highways safety and 
amenity. Proposals for B8 space should con sider the potential provision of yard 
space.  
 
 The Vale Royal /Brewery Road LSIS is located on the western periphery of the 
borough on the border with the London Borough of Camden, near Kings Cross. It is 
located in close proximity to Central London and the  CAZ. The area is relatively well  
connected by road and public transport; Caledonian Road underground and 
Caledonian Road and Barnsbury overground stations are located nearby.  
 The LSIS is the borough’s largest concentration of industrial uses. It accommod ates a 
wide range of businesses, including film/TV production, catering, building, plumbing 
and heating trade suppliers, self -storage, photographic studios, props hire, car rental 
and repair, and charity/social enterprises. The LSIS is significant in terms  of scale, as 
well as in terms of its contribution to the local and Central London economies.  
 The LSIS has two distinct business clusters. The first provides services to the music 
and entertainment industries and includes Tileyard Studios which comprises around 
10,000sqm of studio, writing and office space dedicated to the music industry. The 
secon d cluster comprises a number of catering operations which are located 
throughout the LSIS.  
 The LSIS is an important, vibrant industrial location. It is well occupied and vacancy 
rates are considerably lower than the optimum 8% frictional vacancy rate. Evi dence 
suggests there is high demand and a lack of supply for such industrial space in 
Islington.  This is typical of inner London boroughs where large scale industrial areas 
are generally scarce, particularly within densely populated boroughs such as Isling ton. 
This reinforces the need to safeguard the existing functions of the LSIS.  
 Islington has lost a significant amount of industrial space in recent years – between 
2005 and 2015 approximately 125,000sqm of B2 and B8 floorspace was granted 
permission to c onvert to other uses.  This means that the Council  must strengthen its 
policies to avoid further losses to its limited industrial land stock.   
 The retention and intensification of industrial uses in the Vale Royal /Brewery Road 
LSIS is a key priority. The Council  considers industrial uses to be those which fall 
within B1(c)  light industrial, B2 general industry and B8 storage and distribution, as 
well as certain Sui Generis uses with a clear industrial function. The LSIS must  be  
34 
 protected and nurtured for a range of industrial uses, including the provision of hybrid 
workspace, which is particularly supported. The Council ’s evidence also suggests that 
the LSIS is an appropriate location for providing space for start -up companies and 
SMEs, in particular older, lower value stock which remains perfectly functional.  
 Maintaining and intensifying the current functions of the LSIS will also ensure that 
businesses can continue to benefit from being located in close proximity to one 
another. These ‘agglomeration benefit s’ can include increased productivity levels, 
having access to a pool of labour, and enabling businesses to attract and retain skilled 
labour. Other benefits include fostering collaboration and the transfer of knowledge, 
innovation and technology between b usinesses and sectors. Aside from these 
benefits, there may be potential synergies between the music and entertainment 
businesses and catering businesses within the LSIS. Evidence produced by the 
Council  also states that the area provides space that is cru cial in accommodating 
businesses who service both the wider borough and Central London economy. These 
important functions and industrial uses will be safeguarded and promoted.  
 B1(a)  office space is sought elsewhere in the borough – particularly in the CAZ  and 
other designated employment areas – due to its contribution to jobs growth and 
employment floorspace. However, in the LSIS specifically, other forms of business 
floorspace are prioritised, and proposals involving additional floorspace must  not result 
in the overall building being in more than 20% office use. The predominant land use 
must  be industrial use ( B1(c) , B2 and B8 , or Sui Generis use akin to an industrial use ). 
Office uses may be acceptable as part of a hybrid workspace scheme where it is clea r 
that it is not the predominant use. The introduction of other uses which could 
compromise the economic function and future economic growth of the LSIS (especially 
residential uses) will not be allowed, either stand -alone or as part of mixed -use or co -
location schemes.  
 Notwithstanding this clear priority for industrial uses and the resistance of B1(a)  and/or 
B1(b)  and/or general B1 floorspace and/or Sui Generis use floorspace akin to 
B1(a) /B1(b)  within the Vale Royal/Brewery Road LSIS , if such floorspace i s permitted 
within the LSIS, affordable workspace must be provided in line with policy B4 Part B.  
 Development proposals in the Vale Royal /Brewery Road LSIS must , as a minimum, 
not result in a net loss of industrial land or floorspace. Proposals involving the loss of 
industrial land or floorspace must consider the requirements set out in policy B3 and 
demonstrate there is no demand for the use of the floorspace, unit, building and/or 
land, for a use appropriate to the primary  industrial function.  
 The extent of potential additional industrial development will vary depending on the 
current use and occupancy of existing sites. Some sites in the LSIS may have 
potential for substantial, additional industrial development given they are low rise 
and/or underused. It is these sites that present the greatest opportunities for the 
delivery of typical industrial space.  
 All development proposals in the LSIS must  maximise the provision of industrial uses, 
including the delivery of hybrid workspace in the LSIS. Where new B uses are 
provided, conditions will be attached to the permission to remove any applicable 
permitted development rights and restrict changes via s ection 55(2) of the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). This will ensure that specific industrial 
use(s) are retained and that any future loss is assessed against Local Plan policies via 
a planning application. By maximising these appropriate industrial uses, the LSIS can 
be developed without harming the delicate balance of existing industrial uses  
35 
 (including lower value uses) that are vital in sustaining economic diversity in the 
borough, and in supporting the wider economy.  
 A detailed urban design and character assessment undertaken for the LSIS and its 
wider context concluded that a maximum height of around 20m (approximately five 
commercial storeys) would be appropriate in the LSIS . 20m is not automatically 
acceptable and would be dependent  on assessment against all relevant policies. Any 
increase in height will be considered prominent in the prevailing context, and would 
therefore trigger policy DH3 Part E; this will necessitate assessment against the 
criteria in policy DH3 Part F . Building s of over five storeys may have a negative impact 
upon the scale of the streets within the LSIS and may appear overbearing, due to 
narrow road widths. It is also considered that five storeys is appropriate in terms of 
responding sensitively to the area’s h istoric setting and heritage assets . Development 
of up to five storeys can accommodate a range of industrial uses , consistent with the 
Council’s priorities for the area . Building height should step down to 12 -16m ( three  to 
four commercial storeys) within t he viewing corridor to the Market Road Clock Tower, 
a designated local landmark which can be seen from Randell’s Road Bridge, as shown 
in Figure 2.4. This will ensure that the view of this landmark is preserved and will 
maintain appropriate building height  to street width ratio.  
 The LSIS’s industrial function has been maintained for a number of years – this is 
recognisable in some of the remaining historic buildings and in the layout and scale of 
the streets. Refurbishment, conversion and extension of exis ting older buildings is 
preferred to demolition and redevelopment schemes. New development should 
respond sensitively to existing historic buildings ; this could include stepping down 
building heights  to avoid domination of the street scene.  
 The LSIS is ch aracterised by narrow streets. Private forecourts and the limited height 
of industrial units currently alleviate the impact on the scale of the street. To avoid an 
overbearing scale of the street – a canyon effect – and allow light penetration, new 
develop ment should ensure that the width to height ratio of street does not exceed 
1:1.35 and optimally stays below 1:1. This can be achieved by the stepping back of 
development above a certain height on the building line or by sufficiently pulling the 
building l ine back from the street. Any development in the western edge of the LSIS, 
along York Way, will need to be clearly sub -ordinate in height as , due to the narrow 
street profile, there is a risk of creating an adverse canyon effect. This can be avoided 
throug h appropriate scaling and setting back development in relation to the 
streetscape.  
 Due to the nature of its uses, the LSIS is inward looking and frequently presents the 
back of development to surrounding open spaces, such as the Market Road Gardens 
and th e sports pitches on Market Road. Where possible new development should 
create strong active frontages toward these open spaces, so that they can provide 
overlooking and animation and enhance the perception of the area. Where possible, 
backs should become f ronts with the provision of new access routes along open 
spaces (mindful of policy requirements to maintain and enhance open space provision 
and function). The same principle applies to those building -street interfaces which are 
characterised by inactive f ronts and blank walls. Where consistent with priority land 
uses in the LSIS, new development along York Way and Caledonian Road should 
seek to create active street frontages that define, animate and overlo ok the street 
space. In this context, t he term acti ve frontages does not refer to the intr oduction of 
non-industrial uses;  rather, development is expected to explore the potential of 
introducing active frontages whilst maintaining an industrial use , for example windows 
which allow views in and out of the b uilding . It is recognised that industrial uses do not 
traditionally create active frontages so the policy should not be considered a barrier to  
36 
 development – the creation of industrial uses takes precedence over the creation of 
active frontages.  
 The LSIS i s poor in terms of transport movement and connectivity, particularly 
internally within the LSIS. York Way and Caledonian Road are the primary access 
points to the LSIS. Most of the internal roads are narrower secondary roads which can 
cause issues for traf fic movement. Whilst many sites in the LSIS incorporate parking 
spaces  or yards for larger vehicles, street widths are often inadequate to facilitate 
turning of vehicles in and out of plots – this is exacerbated where there is a high 
concentration of on -street parking. The narrowness of the internal road network also 
causes pinch points at the junctions of York Way, Brandon Road and Vale Royal. 
These adjoining streets are less than 10m wide which impedes the flow of vehicles in 
and out of the LSIS. All deve lopment in the LSIS is required to demonstrate how 
delivery and servicing can be adequately provided and potential impacts on highways 
safety and amenity can be prevented. On -street delivery and servicing will generally 
not be acceptable for uses which req uire more frequent and significant vehicle 
movements, such as B8 uses.  
 The railway line along the southern border of the LSIS is a major barrier to pedestrian 
and cycle movement to the wider area. There are no existing north -south pedestria n or 
vehicular routes between Brewery Road and Blundell /Brandon Road, or between 
Tileyard Road and Blundell Street. There is an existing pedestrian connection between 
Brewery Road and Market Road – this frames the view towards the Clock Tower and 
should b e improved where possible. To improve movement within the LSIS, the 
Council  will seek to create new north -south routes. Where appropriate, development 
proposals should consider opportunities to create new north -south pedestrian routes to 
improve permeabili ty throughout the LSIS, in line with Figure 2.4. Where provision of 
new routes would involve loss of industrial space or would mean that industrial space 
cannot be maximised, the wider strategic benefits of the greater connectivity may 
outweigh loss of spa ce or lack of maximisation on a specific scheme (although 
weighting of issues is a case -specific consideration).

  The Angel Spatial Strategy  area is partly covered by the CAZ, while the remaining 
part is a CAZ fringe location . 
 Angel Town Centre  covers the majority of the Spatial Strategy  area. It has a strong 
retail, service and leisure offer with a large number of small and independent units. 
Further retail, leisure and service uses are considered suitable across Angel Town 
Centre  to support and enhance this offer and to meet the limited need for new 
floorspace over the plan period. Retail uses should be directed to the Town Centre  
in the first instance, particularly to the Primary Shopping Area , then the Upper Street 
LSA, in line with the sequential approach . 
 The Sainsbury’s site (reference AUS6) offers an opportunity to develop a significant 
amount of retail and business uses and contribute to the strategic aims for retail and 
office uses .  
 Chapel Market will be strongly protected. Any development proposals must ensure 
that the character and funct ion of the street market is not adversely impact ed, and 
opportunities for improvement must be  sought where appropriate, particularly with 
regard to the public realm to help improve the management of the market and the 
shops, and to make this area more acce ssible for pedestrians.  
 Camden Passage is a specialist shopping area with a significant concentration of 
antique, curio and vintage stores. The unique  function of this area will be strongly 
protected.  
 Angel Town Centre  is a designated Cultural Quarter  where existing cultural uses will 
be protected and new cultural uses are promoted. All development proposals within 
the Town Centre  must enhance and protect this cultural role and ensure its 
continued effective operation.  
 Night -time economy uses must  be di rected to the Town Centre , and demonstrate  
that there is no significant adverse effect on local amenity . 
 The Upper Street LSA should be the focus for smaller retail, leisure and service 
provision consistent  with the existing character and function of the a rea   
 Consistent with the CAZ/CAZ fringe location,  business use is a priority land use in 
Angel Town Centre , and on upper floors in the rest of the Spatial Strategy  area. 
Existing B1 use will be protected and proposals for new business floorspace must  
maxi mise the provision of business floorspace, particularly in White Lion Street, 
Pentonville Road and upper floor locations across the Town Centre . The 
Sainsbury’s site is a key strategic site which could  deliver a significant amount of 
new business floorspac e. 
 A broad range of office floorspace typologies is considered suitable within the Town 
Centre , including Grade A space, ‘hybrid’ space and co -working space. All 
proposals involving new and/or re -provided business floorspace must provide 
suitable space for  SME s.  
39 
  Development in the Angel and Upper Street area must  contribute to the creation of 
a high quality environment that is accessible to all residents, employees and 
visitors, including through improvement of public transport capacity and experience. 
New development should provide good connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists, 
and good permeability within and through sites.  
 The Council  supports the development of Crossrail 2 with a station at Angel. There 
are several site allocations  in the Angel and Uppe r Street  area which are  TfL 
Crossrail 2 2015 Consultation work sit es and/or within the Crossrail 2 Safeguarding 
Limits (March 2015) .  
 The Angel Crossrail 2 station should achieve an exemplary design quality with 
specific focus on ensuring improved permeabi lity through, and in the vicinity of, the 
site. This should include the creation of a new 24 -hour level access public route 
between City Road and Islington High Street , via Torrens Street.  
 Opportunities for public realm improvements must  be prioritised as part of the 
Crossrail 2 project and associated development. Public spaces and street 
infrastructure such as pavements, cycling facilities and pedestrian crossings should 
adapt  to accommodate any increase in activity and changes to how people move 
through t he Town Centre . 
 Improvements to reduce the dominance of through traffic are sought around Angel 
station and the main junction of Islington High Street with City Road, Goswell Road 
and St . John Street. In particular, pedestrian and cycling routes should be promoted 
to improve the linkages along the City Road/Pentonville Road commercial corridor . 
Measures to improve bus journey time and bus priority (especially over private 
vehicles) are sup ported.  
 The historic character of the area should be protected and enhanced through high 
quality design. New development should respect the local context of the Angel and 
Upper Street area, particularly in relation to conservation areas and local landmarks . 
Islington Tunnel runs underneath the Spatial Strategy  area. The structural integrity 
and heritage value of the tunnel should be protected from any adverse impacts.   
 
 Angel is the most significant, distinctive and vibrant Town Centre  in Islington. The 
Centre has an important role as Islington’s  largest Town Centre  – one of Islington’s 
two Major Town Centres - and one of the most important areas for employment and 
economic growth in Islington. A significant part of Angel falls within t he CAZ. The 
Council  will respond to the challenges and opportunities associated with the future 
developments to ensure that Angel Town Centre  is a place for everyone, offering a 
unique mix of shops, services, cultural activities, and other Town Centre  uses  
alongside employment opportunities and an accessible and pedestrian -friendly 
environment.  
 Angel Town Centre  serves both local communities and also attracts people from 
further afield, due to its vibrant shopping offer featuring a range of specialist shops  and 
services. It is a key part of Islington’s and London’s night -time offer and is a sub -
regional cultural and visitor destination.  
 In 2007, Angel Town Centre  became a Business Improvement District (BID) – known 
as ‘Angel.London’ – to deliver improvements  to the trading and commercial  
40 
 environment in the centre. The BID boundary covers a large proportion of the Town 
Centre  boundary.  
 The Angel and Upper Street area has a strong comparison and convenience retail 
offer. It accommodates a number of large superm arkets alongside independent retail 
shops and range of market stalls. This offer is further strengthened by Chapel Market – 
a traditional street market – and the specialist shopping area in Camden Passage, well 
known for its antique, curio and vintage stores. Both these areas contribute 
significantly to the character, vibrancy and vitality of the area.  
 The Sainsbury ’s site on Liverpool Road is the most sig nificant development 
opportunity in the area. The site offers an opportunity for the development of a 
significant amount of retail and business floorspace, to complement and enhance the 
existing character and function of the area , and contribute towards th e identified need 
for new office floorspace in the borough . 
 Angel Town Centre  is a designated Cultural Quarter  and successful night -time 
economy destination. Angel’s entertainment and cultural offer is a major draw for 
visitors to the area, which makes a s ignificant contribution to the economic success of 
the area and helps to maintain its unique character and vibrancy. This offer includes 
theatres such as the Almeida Theatre and Sadler’s Wells and a number of theatre 
pubs and music venues – such as the Kin g’s Head Theatre and the Lexington – 
cinemas and arts centres. Maintaining and enhancing these unique assets is important 
whilst protecting the amenity of residents and other uses.  
 There are a number of pubs located in the Angel and Upper Street area, man y with 
historic and social value. They are an important part of the night -time economy of the 
area and will be protected . 
 Upper Street LSA is located to the north of the Town Centre  and extends up to 
Highbury and Islington station. It is a popular location  for eating, drinking and includes 
a number of independent retailers.  
 The provision of new business floorspace is encouraged in Angel Town Centre , 
specifically on Pentonville Road, White Lion Street and upper floor locations across 
the Town Centre . The af orementioned Sainsbury’s site in particular  offers a  significant  
opportunity for the development of new business floorspace.  
 Angel should continue to be a welcoming, inclusive, accessible and pedestrian friendly 
environment. New development in Angel and t he spaces around it should create a 
high quality environment that is accessible to all residents, employees and visitors. 
Improvements to pedestrian access within and across the centre should be prioritised, 
specifically around Pentonville Road/City Road c rossroads which hinders pedestrian 
access from St. John Street to the rest of the centre. Cycling routes which improve 
access to and through the area are encouraged.  
 Crossrail 2 is a proposed North -South rail link across London, with a station planned at 
Angel. The route is not yet funded and will not be delivered until the end of the plan 
period at the earliest. Any associated development must  be in -keeping with the 
character and function of the area and must  prioritise public realm improvements in 
order t o positively improve the experience of the centre . A number of sites within Angel 
Town Centre are safeguarded to protect land needed to build and operate Crossrail 2,  
41 
 including land for the Crossrail 2 station itself6. These sites are allocated in the Site  
Allocations DPD7. Crossrail 2 should improve pedestrian permeability in the area and 
create a 24 -hour pedestrian access between Islington High Street and Torrens Street 
through  RBS building  (site allocation AUS1) . 
 Angel Town Centre  has a h igh number of listed buildings and  is covered by eight 
Conservation Areas.  The historic character of the area should be protected and 
enhanced in line with relevant policy and guidance.

 A. Nag’s Head Town Centre  is an important retail area. Retail use s will be maintained 
and enhanced within the Town Centre , particularly  within the Primary Shopping 
Area . 
B. Increased night -time economy and leisure uses are encouraged  in the Town Centre , 
particularly  outside the Primary Shopping Area  and also as part of new 
development .  
C. Smaller scale retail provision may be acceptable in the three LSAs that fall within 
the Spatial Strategy  boundary – Cardwell Terrace, Hillmarton Terrace and part of 
Lower Holloway.  
D. Seven Sisters Road has some of the highest concentration s of betting 
shops/takeaways in the borough. F urther uses which add to this overconcentration 
will be resisted.  
E. The Hollow ay Prison site is the key local housing site which will help to meet 
identified housing need in the borough. The site will provide , inter alia, high levels of 
genuinely affordable housing, community uses incl uding a women’s building/centre 
and publicly acc essible green open space.  
F. Morrison’s  supermarket and its adjacent car park is the key opportunity site to 
maximise and enhance retail floorspace in the Town Centre  in the longer term , as 
well as delivering a significant amount of office floorspace . Other Town Centre  uses 
may be appropriate  as part of redevelopment of the site , including night -time 
economy uses such as restaurants. Conventional residential accommodation will be 
acceptable on the upper floors, subject to amenity issues being addressed  in line  
with the agent -of-change principle . Existing site permeability through to Seven 
Sisters Road and the Nag’s Head market must  be maintained and retail user 
amenity should be improved. Enhancements to the covered market are encouraged  
where they  fit with the  wider function of the area  and do not lead to adverse amenity 
impacts . Public open space should be provided to act as a focal point for the Town 
Centre .  
G. Markets  are encouraged  within the Spatial Strategy  area, such as the weekly 
market on the Grafton Primary School site.  
H. New office floorspace will be encouraged to support diversity in the local economy. 
Conversion of upper floors above retail units to office floorspace will be considered 
appropriate where there are no adverse impacts on  the ongoing operation of ground 
floor retail and safe, secure access is provided .  
I. The London Metropolitan University will continue to play an important role in 
contributing to the local economy. Increased space for learning should be the focus 
for development within the  university campus . Additional accommodation for 
students will not be allowed other than on sites allocated for student 
accommodation  in the Spatial Strategy  area.   
44 
 J. Public realm and environmental improvements throughout the Town Centre  will be 
strongly enc ouraged.  
K. The Seven Sisters Road, Isledon Road/Tollington Road gyratory system will be 
removed if feasible in the long term. A cycle route linking Camden and Tottenham 
Hale along Seven Sisters Road will be supported. A junction improvement 
incorporating a c ycle route link between Sussex Way to Hornsey Road will be 
progressed. Junction improvements to Seven Sisters Road/Holloway Road, 
Hornsey Road/Seven Sisters Road and Holloway Road/Tollington Road/Camden 
Road will be prioritised.  
L. The heritage assets of the  area will be protected and enhanced where specific 
proposals come forward. The key listed buildings are the Holloway Odeon cinema 
and 458 -462 Holloway Road. Other notable buildings include the former Jones 
Brothers tower and 67 -83 Seven Sisters Road.  
M. Five sites in the Spatial Strategy  area have been identified as potentially suitable for  
tall buildings over 30 metres.  
 
 Nag’s Head is a busy and vibrant Major Town Centre  offering a range of both 
independent and national retailers. The Town Centre  has a strong convenience (daily 
goods)  retail offer, which meets both local residents and wider needs . It includes  an 
indoor market and also offers a good range of comparison shops including Selby’s,  an 
independent department store. The centre specialises  in fresh produce with a number 
of butchers, fishmongers, grocers and bakeries. There are various specialist shops, 
particularly outside the Primary Shopping Area , which further enriches the retail 
experience. The focus of A1 retail use will be in the Primary Shopping Area .  
 Local evidence suggests that there is potential for improving the Town Centre ’s food 
and beverage offer . This  could significantly increase the attraction of both daytime and 
night -time economies for different customers and support t he wider Town Centre  retail 
function , for example taking greater advantage of people visiting the Emirates Stadium 
for football matches and other events ; Additional  restaurants will be supported , 
particularly  outside the Primary Shopping Area  and as part o f any Nag’s Head 
Shopping Centre redevelopment.  
 The Nag ’s Head Shopping Centre is at the heart  of the Town Centre  and is occupied 
principally by Morrison’s  supermarket alongside a  number of smaller retail units. The 
western part of the site fronting Seven  Sisters Road includes the Nag’s Head covered  
market , which contains a variety of retail, café and takeaway uses  and adds vibrancy 
to the Town Centre s retail and leisure offer . The shopping centre is a key development 
opportunity in the longer term, which could contribute towards enhancing  the retail 
provision in the Town Centre  and also intensifying office provision . The existing centre  
could be improved; with reconfiguration to provide a better use of space with additional 
planting, pop -up stalls and even ts. The opportunity to create a significant  public open 
space fronting Holloway Road should also be explored. Some residential uses on 
upper floors of any redevelopment may be acceptable, pending consistency with 
relevant Local Plan policies  including agen t-of-change.  
 The Holloway Prison site is the largest development site in the borough.  The site must 
deliver a significant amount of new housing, with a high proportion of genuinely 
affordable housing. Other uses, including a women’s building/centre, must also be  
45 
 provided. Further detail is set out in Site Allocation NH7 and in the Holloway Prison 
Site SPD.  
 The pedestrian link from Holloway Road  through to Morrison’s  into the market and 
onto Seven Sisters Road should be improved; it would need careful desig n to create 
an attractive and safe space for future users. The market itself should be retained with 
frontages improved on both the Seven Sisters Road and Hertslet Road.  
 The Islington Tall Building s study (2018) thoroughly assessed the borough’s potential  
to accommodate the development of new tall buildings. Policy DH3 has been informed 
by the Islington Tall Building s study (2018) and must be read alongside this Spatial 
Strategy  policy. The Spatial Strategy  diagram ( Figure 2.6) identifies the following fiv e 
sites where tall buildings (30 metres and above) may be appropriate in the Nag’s Head 
Spatial Strategy  area:  
 8-32 Seven Sisters Road and backland of Herslet Road (site C 1 from the study).   
 372-376 Holloway Road (Argos and adjoining shops) (site C2  from the study).  
 379-391 Camden Road /341-345 Holloway Road (site C3 from the study).  
 45 Hornsey Road  (site C4  from the study).  
 Metropolitan University Tower on Hallway Road  (site C5  from the study ).  
 Any proposal for tall buildings on these sites must be fully consistent with Policy DH3 
and all other relevant policies  and Site Allocations .  
 The adult amusement centre on the corner of Holloway Road and Seven Sisters Road 
in the locally listed former Nag ’s Head pub provides a prominent and less desirable 
leisure use. The unit is symbolic of the challenges faced in Nag’s Head with a 
concentration of pawnbrokers, betting shops and money lenders. The Council  
suppor ts the  re-use of the prominent former pub si te for a more suitable Town Centre  
use.  
 The nearby Emirates stadium is an important cultural and leisure attraction which 
helps support the wider Town Centre  economy. The Emirates also features the 
Arsenal hub community facility and Arsenal museum.  
 The A 1 Holloway Road is a heavily trafficked route which creates a major barrier 
dividing the Town Centre . The amount and speed of traffic create s an unsafe 
environment for pedestrians. The new signalled pedestrian crossing on Holloway Road 
and other improvemen ts to crossing has improved the pedestrian environment,  but the 
road remains a barrier. In the long term , removing the gyratory may provide the 
opportunity to revise the road layout . Three other junctions afford opportunity for 
design improvements to impro ve safety for pedestrian crossings and improved cycling 
routes. These are the junction between Seven Sisters Road and Hornsey Road, the 
junction between Seven Sisters Road and Holloway Road and the junction between 
Tollington Road and Holloway Road. More g enerally , public realm improvement s could 
include reducing street furniture clutter, co -ordination of cycle parking and further 
street planting along Seven Sisters Road. Public realm interventions, including public 
art and signage, which reinforce the dist inctiveness and unique features of Nag’s Head 
will be supported  in line with relevant policies which safeguard amenity and 
accessibility . 
 The Town Centre  has a number of architecturally and historically interesting buildings 
including a variety of styles from Victorian , through to the post-war period. 
Conservation areas run along and adjacent to Holloway Road , encompassing  the  
46 
 Grade II listed Odeon Cinema , with small incursions into the edge of the Town Centre . 
Investment in the Odeon cinema and its frontag e along Holloway Road is planned.

48 
 A. Finsbury Park is a District Town Centre  with a Primary Shopping Area  covering 
parts of Fonthill Road and parts of Stroud Green Road, Blackstock Road and Seven 
Sister s Road . A diverse range of shops within the area should be maintained, so 
that the overall retail offer can cater for the needs of different sections of the 
community.   
B. Development in the Town Centre  must  maintain the predominant commercial role of 
the area, wi th specific focus on retail and services on ground floors. These uses 
must  be directed to the Town Centre  in the first instance, then the Seven Sisters 
Road LSA.  
C. The Specialist Shopping Area at Fonthill Road is a unique agglomeration of 
specialist clothin g stores which adds significant value to the character and vitality of 
the Town Centre  and wider area. This specialist shopping role must  be strongly 
protected  and enhanced . 
D. Finsbury Park has potential to develop as a CAZ satellite location for additional 
business  uses , due to its excellent transport links to Central London and to the 
wider South East, and its relatively low rents. In order to realise this potential , 
diminution of B1, B2 and /or B8 uses will resisted and further intensification of these 
uses , particularly units suitable for SME occupation and B1(c) ‘maker space’, will be 
strongly encouraged.  
E. In principle, r esidential development will only be suitable on upper floors in the Town 
Centre . Acceptability on upper floors will be judged on a case -by-case basis, 
factoring in the need to conserve sufficient ancillary space to allow commercial uses 
to continue to operate successfully  as well as other considerations such as amenity 
impacts .  
F. Development of a street market will be supported , particularly  on Fonthill Road , 
where it can be demonstrated that such expansion will enhance the vitality and 
viability of the area.  
G. Finsbury Park has a rich offer of community uses and cultural spaces, which reflect 
its diverse and vibrant community . Development withi n Finsbury Park should seek 
to protect and enhance this community -based cultural and entertainment offer. 
H. Leisure and night -time economy uses are a  strong  feature of the area , with a 
particularly  distinct food scene. Strengthening the  role of the area as a food 
destination is supported. Additional leisure and night -time economy uses must  be 
directed to the Town Centre . Development proposals must ensure that adverse 
amenity impacts are prevented/mitigated.  
I. Music venues  are synonymous wi th the character of the area. Existing venues  will 
be strongly  protected  and d evelopment of new music venues is supported .  
J. Finsbury Park is  one of  the busiest transport interchange s in London outside Zone 
1. New tunnels will connect the Thameslink service  from Finsbury Park to London 
St. Pancras and provide increased connectivity to the wider South East of England.  
In order to absorb this increased rail capacity, the Council  will work with relevant  
49 
 stakeholders – including  Transport for London  (TfL)  – to identify further 
improvements to make the station fit for purpose; this should include fully step -free 
access . Options for enhancement/redevelopment of the station should explore 
options for intensification of development above the station.  
K. Development must contribute to the creation of a high quality environment that is 
accessible to all residents, employees and visitors. New development should 
provide good connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists  and should improve 
permeability and legibility within and across the Town Centre . In particular, access 
to retail areas such as Fonthill Road and to Finsbury Park itself should be improved.  
L. Joint working with TfL will be undertaken to improve the pedestrian environment 
along Seven Sisters Road. There will be impr oved walking and cycling routes 
through the Finsbury Park area to Highbury Corner linking with wider routes into 
central London, to encourage walking and cycling for local residents, London 
Metropolitan University students and visitors to the Emirates Stad ium.  
M. The area’s key h eritage assets  include  the Grade II* listed  former Rainbow Theatre 
and the Grade II listed Church of St . Mark with St . Anne , which contribute 
significantly to Finsbury Park’s character and townscape  and will be protected and 
enhanced.  
N. Four sites in the  Spatial Strategy  area have been identified as potentially suitable for 
tall buildings over 30 metres.  
 
 Finsbury Park is a busy, multi -cultural area with cafes and shops that reflect this 
diversity . The wider area falls within the administrative boundaries of the London 
Boroughs of Islington, Haringey and Hackney and the Council  will work jointly with 
these boroughs to deliver a co -ordinated approach  to planning for the future of the 
area. Development in th is area should contribute towards creating more inclusive local 
economy, which supports small and independent business, and increases job 
opportunities for its diverse local community wherever possible.  
 Finsbury Park is a District Town Centre  and its predomina nt commercial role must  be 
maintained. A diverse range of shops within the area is essential,  so that the overall 
retail offer can cater for the needs of different sections of the community, including the 
least well off residents in the area. The Primary Shopping Area  seeks to secure a 
vibrant and viable A1 -use retailing core. However, the overarching  commercial role  of 
the area  is changing  from traditional retailing to more leisure and experience -based 
retailing.  
 New commercial development must  be directed to Town Centre . The Seven Sisters 
Road LSA joins Nag’s Head and Finsbury Park Town Centre s; the retail offer in this 
part of the area is less concentrated than the designated Town Centre s, but 
opportunities for enhancing commercial activity sho uld be explored in line with the 
sequential approach.  
 Nag’s Head is the closest Town Centre  to Finsbury Park and is designated above 
Finsbury Park in the retail hierarchy as a Major Town Centre . Despite their  proximity 
and high inter-accessibility , eviden ce shows that they are distinct centres with  different 
characters and opportunities for future  development and functions, as well attract ing 
different catchments of shoppers. However, establishing strong commercial identities  
50 
 in both Finsbury Park and Nag’ s Head Town Centre s with commercial activity between 
them may bring mutual benefits such as additional footfall.  
 Fonthill Road is designated as a Specialist Shopping Area due to its important and 
widely recognised fashion cluster, which contributes signifi cantly to Finsbury Park’s 
character and vitality . All development  in this area must contribute or complement the  
specialist function  of Fonthill Road,  in line with Policy R 7. Fonthill Road used to be a 
successful garment manufacturing hub although the manufacturing element has fallen 
into decline over the past thirty years. The Council  will work with  traders and partners 
to reinvigorate manufacturing and workshop functions on  Fonthill Road to enhance its 
uniqueness and create a sustainable commercial environment that allows traders here 
to continue running viable businesses. This may include provision of business  
floorspace above shops.  
 Finsbury Park has significant potential to develop as a unique satellite location, outside 
the CAZ, for additional business  uses , due to its excellent transport links to Central 
London and to the wider South East, and its relatively low rents. In developing this 
potential location, the focus sho uld be on promoting and enhancing the nascent 
fashion, tech and creative ind ustries through provision of units suitable for SME 
occupation and B1(c)  space, particular  ‘maker space’ , as well as affordable workspace 
where appropriate. Ensuring adequate provi sion of such spaces in Finsbury Park will 
enable opportunities for  the establishment of a mix of dynamic, sustainable local 
businesses.   
 Residential development will generally be resisted in the Town Centre  on ground floors 
or below in order to retain the  predominant commerc ial function of the Town Centre . 
Residential uses on upper floors in th e Town Centre  may be acceptable, dependent on  
the need to conserve sufficient ancillary space to allow for commercial uses to 
continue to operate successfully.  Other  impacts, including the impact on the amenity of 
adjacent occupiers, will also be considered in line with relevant policies.  
 Finsbury Park  has a rich community cultural offer with third sector organisations such 
as Muslim Welfare House, Outl andish, the Jon es Art Building and Park Theatre. 
Development should seek to contribute to and complement the existing community 
cultural infrastructure.  
 Leisure uses such as bars, pubs and theatres are synonymous with the cultural fabric 
of an area and provide formal and informal spaces  to collaborate and share cultures. 
The Council  will support proposals for cultural and leisure uses in the Town Centre  
which reflect the culturally diverse local identities . A particular feature of the area is its 
distinct food scene, i ncluding a wealth of restaurants catering for North African and 
East African cuisine. Expanding this food offer and strengthening Finsbury Park’s role 
as a f ood destination is supported.   
 The night -time-economy has potential to be improved in Finsbury Par k. The London 
Plan identifies Finsbury Park as an area where the night -time economy is more than 
locally significant. Additional night -time economy uses must  be directed to the Town 
Centre . Development proposals must ensure that adverse amenity impacts are  
prevented and/or mitigated.  
 Music venues cater to different demographics, foster social interaction and support 
established and fledgling musicians. Finsbury Park  currently  has a limited number of 
music venues , but has a rich heritage of past venues  such as the Rainbow Theatre 
and site of the former George Robey Pub . Increased provision of  music venues  is 
supported, including through the introduction of a live music offer at existing  venues  
51 
 such as pubs that may not currently have a music offer. An increas e in music venue 
provision will help Finsbury Park enhance a positive identity that will increase the 
vibrancy and appeal for residents and visitors alike.   
 Finsbury Park station is one of the busiest transport interchange s in London outside 
Zone 1, provid ing links to central and north -east London on the Piccadilly and Victoria 
underground lines, and train services to King’s Cross/St Pancras and the City 
southwards, and to Cambridge and Stevenage northwards. Improved connectivity via 
the Thameslink service now also links Finsbury Park to the wider South East of 
England.  
 To manage the intensification  of services at  Finsbury Park station  and the associated 
increase in passengers, improvements to capacity, the introduction of step-free access 
and a larger stat ion entrance from Wells Terrace are all underway . The Council  
envisage the need for complete redevelopment of the station in the future to truly be a 
21st century station that can cope with increasing capacity demands. The Council  will 
liaise with partners including TfL and the Greater London Authority ( GLA) to identify 
further potential improvements.  
 The station and the area around it can be congested at peak times and are restricted 
by the railway bridges and road layout. Access  to existing commercial areas, such as 
Fonthill Road, can be difficult  because of this. The Council  will, through its continued 
working with stakeholders and the adjoining boroughs of Hackney and Haringey, seek 
extensive redevelopment in the area immediate ly surrounding Finsbury Park station to  
improve the station’s permeability and legibility,  and make access to these facilities 
safer and more inclusive , including for  people with disabilities.  
 The Islington Tall Building s study (2018) thoroughly assessed t he borough’s potential 
to accommodate  the development of new tall buildings. Policy DH3 has been informed 
by the Islington Tall Building s study ( 2018) and must be read alongside this Spatial 
Strategy  policy. The Spatial Strategy  diagram ( Figure 2.7 ) identi fies the following four 
sites where tall buildings (30 metres and above) may be appropriate in the Finsbury 
Park Spatial Strategy  area:  
 Finsbury Park Station (site B 1 from the study ). 
 221-233 Seven Sisters R oad, corner with Fonthill Road (site B3  from the study ). 
 Wells Terrace East, Morris Place East, Yellow Car Wash site  (site B4  from the 
study ). 
 113-119 Fonthill Road and lan d to rear (site B5  from the study ). 
 Any proposal for tall buildings on these sites must be fully consistent  with Policy DH3 
and all other relevant policies  and Site Allocations .  
52 
 Figure 2 .7: Finsbury Park Spatial Strategy  diagram  
 
53 
 A. Development in Archway must  support the commercial function of the area, 
particularly the retail function of the Town Centre . Junction Road and Holloway 
Road act as the ‘high street’ within the Town Centre  and further development of 
retail uses  here, including essential services, is encouraged. Development on the 
central site bound by Junction Road, Vorley Road, MacDonald Road, Highgate Hill 
and Navigator Square must  provide new office and retail floorspace. D evelopment 
of other uses will only be acceptable where consistent with relev ant Local Plan 
policies  and site allocations . 
B. The Council  will support Archway Town Centre’s role as a Cultural Quarter  where 
existing cultural uses will be protected. Opportunities to further develop and 
enhance the cultural offer in the Town Centre  must be investigated as part of all 
relevant development proposals.  
C. The continued operation of Archway market is supported. Expansion of the market 
(in terms of size o r frequency of its op eration) will be supported where it can be 
demonstrated that such expansion will enhance the vitality and viability of the 
Spatial Strategy  area, particularly the Town Centre ; and where there will be no 
adverse impacts on Navigator Square.  
D. Archway Tavern is a historic feature an d a focal point of the Town Centre . The 
Council  supports the continued lawful public house use and will resist any change of 
use.  
E. Night -time economy uses must  be directed to the Town Centre . Such uses will only 
be supported where adverse amenity impacts are prevented/mitigated, particularly 
in relation to uses w hich intend to serve alcohol.   
F. Existing business floorspace  will be protected and proposals that result in a net loss 
of business floorspace  in the Town Centre will be resis ted. Development proposals 
for new business floorspace, particularly SMEs and/or B1(c)  floorspace which 
supports the areas cultural offer or other local institutions such as the Whittington 
Hospital, will be encouraged.  
G. Improvements to Archway station are supported, including entrance level 
accessibility improvements and provision of active frontages . New retail units should 
be provided as part of station entrance improvements and, where appropriate, 
active frontages shou ld be provided on Junction Road and Navigator Square.  
H. The Upper Holloway and Highgate Hill LSAs complement the Town Centre , 
providing accessible local services for residents in the mainly residential areas 
surrounding the Town Centre . Smaller -scale retail  development is encouraged 
within these LSAs.  
I. Residential development is considered acceptable on sites allocated for this 
purpose . Small -scale residential use  on upper floors across the Town Centre may 
be acceptable where it does not adversely impact the commercial function of the 
centre and where  the ability of commercial uses in the area to operate effectively is 
not compromised.   
54 
 J. It is anticipated that St . Pancras  Mental Health Hospital (which is currently located in 
King’s Cross ) will be moving to part  of the site currently occupied by the ancillary 
buildings of Whittington Hospital. This will provide an important social infrastructure 
use in the Archway Spatial Strategy  Area and in the borough as a whole.  
K. The Council  will promote and support the use of Navigator Square  for public events 
where there are no adverse impacts on its key open space function .  
L. Public realm and road safety improvements along Junction Road will be 
encouraged. Development must  contribute to the creation of a high quality 
enviro nment that is accessible to all residents, employees and visitors, including 
through improvement of public transport capacity and experience. New 
development should provide good connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists, and 
good permeability through sites  (where relevant).  
M. Three sites in the  Spatial Strategy  area have been identified as potentially suitable 
for tall buildings over 30 metres.  
 
 Archway is a District Town Centre  located in the north west of the borough at the 
intersection of five roads: Holl oway Road, Highgate Hill, Junction Road, Archway Road 
and St . John’s Way. The heart of the centre is focused around Archway Underground 
Station  and Navigator Square, a new public open space  created in 2017 following the 
removal of the Archway gyratory . The centre is dominated by a modernist complex of 
three high -rise towers. Residential areas lie to the north and east.  The area benefits 
from two green spaces; Girdlestone Park and Archway Park. 
 The area includes a variety of uses of different scales includin g large social 
infrastructure uses at Whittington Hospital and Archway Campus; a significant retail 
and leisure offer within the Town Centre , complemented by LSAs; and other 
commercial uses, particularly offices and workspaces.  
 There is a growing reputation for culture in Archway, which is a designated Cultural 
Quarter . The area currently has a diverse cluster of community -led arts, culture 
organisations and music venues, providing a dynamic, inclusive cultural offer ; this 
varies  from the annual cultural events such as the Archway with Words Festival, to 
important art and drama venues such as Kogan Academy and Central Saint Martins.  
 It is vital that the Town Centre  secures cultural facilities that are suitable, attractive and 
affordable, in order to further enhance Archway’s reputation as a cultural destination  
with a diverse locally -inclusive arts scene. The Methodist Hall, adjacent to Navigator 
Square, could provide a cultural hub for the Town Centre.  Similarly, the Archway 
Tave rn could be revitalised to complement other music venues in the area.   
 Archway accommodates a number of quality independent retailers which concentrate 
along Junction Road and Holloway Road. The area’s  retail function  must be 
maintained and enhanced, utilising the opportunities for increased footfall derived from 
the recent  public realm improveme nts as part of  the gyratory removal scheme.   
 The Primary Shopping Area  will remain the focus o f A1 retail use with a range of other 
uses promoted elsewhere in the Town Centre . Archway  is identified as a night -time 
economy of more than local significance  in the London Plan ; the area  has potential for 
expansion of night -time economy uses, dependent on mitigation of any adverse 
impacts, particularly noise and disturban ce for residents and businesses.   
55 
 
 Archway Market could have an expanded role in order to diversify and extend the 
Town Centre ’s offer and a ttract new visitors to the area . In this regard, the market 
could benefit from more frequent operation, although such expansion would need to 
demonstrate that impacts on Navigator Square are preven ted or mitigated.   
 Proposals for business floorspace, particularly where it supports the areas cultural 
offer or other local institutions , should be directed to  suitable locations within the 
Spatial Strategy  area, including the designated PEL and within the Town Centre  
(directed to upper floors) . Proposals resulting in the net loss of bus iness floorspace  will 
be resisted in line with relevant Local Plan polic ies. 
 Archway Town Centre  should be a welcoming, inclusive, accessible and pedestrian 
friendly environment. Development proposals are expected to be of a high quality and 
improve the public realm in and around the centre. The gyratory removal project has 
delive red a new public space in the heart of the Town Centre, including a new two -way 
traffic system and improved pedestrian and cycling facilities.  The replacement of the 
gyratory with a new public space, Navigator Square has removed barriers to 
movement which previously severed the Town Centre , enabling far better pedestrian 
access to shops and services.   
 The quality of the environ ment around and between  the three central towers is 
generally poor , particularly Archway Mall . The Council  will encourage further 
improvements to this part of the Town Centre  and work with the landowners to carry 
out beneficial redevelopment.  
 The Islington Tall Building s study (2018) thoroughly assessed the borough’s potential 
to accommodate  the development of new tall buildings. Pol icy DH3 has been informed 
by the Islington Tall Building s study (2018) and must be read alongside this Spatial 
Strategy  policy. The Spatial Strategy  diagram ( Figure 2.8 ) identifies the following three 
sites where tall buildings (30 metres and above) may  be appropriate in the Archway  
Spatial Strategy  area:  
 Hill House ( site A 1 from the study ). 
 Vorley Road Bus Station ( site A2  from the study ). 
 Southern end of Macdonald Road, opposite Archway Leisure Centre (site A3 from 
the study).  
 Any proposal for tall bui ldings on these sites must be fully consistent with Policy DH3 
and all other relevant policies  and Site Allocations . 
 Sites A1 and A3 are  not allocated within the Site Allocations DPD.  
 The study identifies the potential for an increase in height on site A1  up to 52m (17 
storeys). Increasing the height of Hill House could help to enhance its visual qualities 
and slenderness and strengthen the cluster on the skyline. Any increase in height 
should be linked to more comprehensive development in the area, includ ing public 
realm improvements and increased permeability. Hill House should remain subservient 
in height to the Archway Tower.  
 The study identifies site A3 as suitable, in principle, for a local landmark building of up 
to 37m (12 storeys)  opposite Archway Leisure Centre to form part of the Archway 
cluster . This would only be suitable in the context of a potential renewal and significant 
enhancement to the Salisbury Walk Estate , for example when the estate comes to the 
end of its natural li fe; any proposals must be developed through engagement with local 
residents and stakeholders. Any building should landmark Archway  Centre on an  
56 
 approaching route from the west (Dartmouth Park Hill and Salisbury Walk) and from 
the north (linking with the en trance to the W hittington Hospital); and should provide  
surveillance of the adjacent open space.

 A. Highbury Corner is  a key transport node in Islington. Significant tra nsport 
improvements are being delivered  to improve the pedestrian, cyclist and road 
networks in the area, particularly around the station . The Council  will continue to 
work with TfL to make Highbury Corner safe and accessible for all users , primarily 
through the delivery of an ongoing  transformation project at Highbury Corner 
Roundabout which includes : 
(i) closing the western arm of the roundabout to create a new public space, which 
includes Highbury & Islington Station forecourt and part of the arboretum  (with 
the remainder of the arboretum to remain closed off) ; 
(ii) improving pedestrian crossings, which will allow pedestrians to move around the 
area more safely and directly, and will improv e access and permeability to the 
surrounding area, including Highbury Fields; and  
(iii) introducing a dedicated, segregated cycle lane associated with the new public 
space, to help reduce the risk of conflicts and to make cycling safer.  
B. There may be  an opportuni ty to improve /redevelop the current station, with the 
potential to deck over the existing railway lines and build above the tracks. Any 
redevelopment would need to integrate seamlessly with  the newly created public 
space, which will be safeguarded from red evelopment. Mixed -use development 
would be appropriate and active ground floor uses encouraged on those parts of the 
site fronting onto Highbury Corner and Holloway Road. Office use is also 
encouraged above the station.  Opportunities to improve accessibili ty to the station  
should be explored , either as part of redevelopment or through other proposals such 
as reopening the old Highbury Station entrance  (see site allocation HC1).  
C. The LSAs of Lower Holloway Road, St . Paul’s and Upper Street are the main retail  
centres within the Spatial Strategy  area. The existing retail and service function of 
these area  must  be maintained and enhanced.  
D. Existing business uses will be protected,  and the development of new business 
floorspace encouraged , particularly within  PELs. Space which meets the diverse 
needs of the SME economy, including  studios and co -working space, is supported.  
E. Cultural and night -time economy uses will be protected. The Garage and the Union 
Chapel are of more than local significance, and retention of these uses is a key 
priority.  
F. The historic character of the Highbury Corner and Lower Holloway area will be 
protected and enhanced, with high quality design encouraged so that it respects the 
local context. Views of the Grade I listed Union Chapel – a key heritage asset and 
designated local landmark  – will be protected.  
G. Highbury Fields – which lies just outside the Spatial Strategy  area - is the largest 
open space in the borough, and one of only two designated pieces of Metropolitan 
Open Land. The function of Highbury Fields will be strongly protected. Development 
in close proximity to Highbury Fields must preserve or enhance this uniq ue asset, 
including views to and from the open space.  
  
59 
 
 Highbury and Islington statio n is the focal point of the Highbury Corner and Lower 
Holloway  Spatial Strategy  area. The station is a busy transport hub served by London 
Underground, London Overground and National Rail lines. Key bus routes also  
operate through the area. It is in close proximity to Highbury Fields to the north and 
Upper Street to the south. The area has historically been  dominated by a busy one -
way traffic system, and there is often significant congestion along the A1, which 
connects Angel to Holloway Road and beyond.  
 It has been a long term aspiration of the Council  to improve the pedestrian, cyclist and 
road networks at Highbury Corner.  The environment around Highbury Corner has 
generally been of a poor quality. Vehicular domination of the public realm, congested 
footways and unsafe cycle routes have  led to a consistently  poor pedestrian 
experience  over a number of years . Significant work to improve this area is underway. 
Proposed improvements include removing of the current one -way system, partially 
opening the arboretum as part of a new pedestrianised public open space, and 
introducing a two -way t raffic system, as well as various pedestrian crossing and cycle 
improvements.  
 There is redevelopment potential at Highbury and Islington station. The site is 
allocated for redevelopment of existing buildings, with potential to deck over the 
existing railw ay lines and build over the tracks. The station must  be retained and any 
redevelopment must  safeguard the newly created public square and include ground 
floor retail uses onto the square , Highbury Corner  and Holloway Road. Offices uses 
should be provided above the station.  
 Aside from being a key transport hub, the area has a number of other functions. It 
accommodates the LSAs of Lower Holloway and St . Paul’s Road, and part of Upper 
Street LSA. The area also includes several  PELs. To sustain the commercial function 
of the area, loss of retail and office floorspace will be resisted, and new retail/office 
space will be encouraged.  
 The function and role of existing cultural uses must  not be diminished or put at risk by 
any proposed development . The Spatial Stra tegy area features several significant 
cultural destinations, such as the Hen and Chickens Theatre Bar, the Garage and 
Union Chapel.  
 The Garage live music venue is a significant cultural destination . Where the Garage 
forms part of a redevelopment proposal,  it must be re -provided and continuity of 
operation must be ensured, i.e. the re -provided venue must  be operational before the 
Garage cease to occupy their existing site . The Union Chapel, which is a working 
church and also a performance space which provid es a diverse programme of arts 
experiences, will also be safeguarded through this policy.  
 Highbury Corner has retained much of its historical character and is covered by a 
number of conservation areas, listed buildings and heritage assets,  including the 
Union Chapel. This historic character must  be preserved or enhanced  and local views 
towards Union Chapel must  be maintained.

 3 Thriving  Communities  
A. Islington should continue to be a place where people of different incomes, tenures 
and backgrounds can live in mixed and balanced communities which are 
economically, environmentally and socially healthy and resilient. All n ew housing 
development must  be fully integrated within, and relate positively to, its immediate 
neighbours and locality. Gated development is not suitable, as it isolates and 
compartmentalises communities.  
B. All new housing must contribute to the delivery of the Local Plan  vision and  
objectives, making the borough a fairer place through the delivery of the right type of 
housing that meets identified needs.  
C. Islington support high density housing development. Pr oposals which include 
housing must  make the most efficient use of land to ensure that the optimal amount 
of housing is delivered, while having regard to other Development Plan policies and 
the specific site context. Proposed developments which result in th e reduction of 
land supply which could reasonably be expected to be suitable for conventional 
housing, and would therefore threaten the ability to meet housing targets, will be 
refused.  
D. High quality new homes are integral to achieving the  aim of making the  most 
efficient use of land  and improving quality of life of residents. Homes should be 
designed as a place of retreat and as such must  contribute to improving the health 
and wellbeing (both physical and mental health) of residents.  New homes must  be 
desig ned to be adaptable over the ir lifetime to accommodate changing needs.  
E. Delivery of genuinely affordable housing is a key priority of the Local Plan. The 
overarching strategic target over the plan period is for 50% of all new housing to be 
genuinely afforda ble. 
F. The affordable housing tenure split on all schemes must prioritise forms of 
affordable housing which is genuinely affordable for those in need , particularly 
social rented housing . 
G. Islington will seek affordable housing contributions from small sites ( less than 10 net 
additional units) to fund the development of affordable housing in the borough, 
including Council -led housing developments.  
H. Islington is committed to meeting and exceeding the boroughs minimum housing 
delivery target as set out in the Lond on Plan.  
I. The Council  will maintain a supply of housing land to meet housing targets over the 
plan period, with a particular focus on demonstrating a five year supply of land.   
62 
 J. The size mix of new housing must  reflect local need, with priority for units suit able 
for families.  
K. Conventional residential accommodation must be designed to meet a variety of 
needs throughout its lifetime. Various forms of specialist housing may be  necessary 
to provide support to specific groups of vulnerable people and those at risk . 
L. Housing needs for older people will predominantly be met through conventional 
housing. In exceptional circumstances , specialist accommodation for vulnerable 
older people may be required.  
M. The provision of additional student accommodation will be restrict ed. Any p roposals 
for student accommodation  will be expected to provide funding for bursaries for 
students as a priority, and affordable student accommodation.  
N. Purpose Built Private Rented Sector development will be resisted.  The so -called 
‘Distinct Econo mics’ of Purpose Built Private Rented Sector development  is not in 
itself justification to circumvent policy requirements . 
O. Self-build and Custom build housing will be supported on suitable sites, where 
compliant with other relevant policies.  
P. The Council  will support the provision of new supported housing  where there is an 
identified need,  and will resist the loss of existing supported housing . 
Q. Existing good quality Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) will be protected. Large -
scale HMOs – such as co -living schemes – will generally be refused as they are not 
considered to make the best use of land and undermine efforts to deliver affordable 
housing  and other land use priorities of the Local Plan .  
R. The Council  will seek to meet an identified need for Gypsy a nd Traveller 
accommodation . This may include provision of a site within the borough following 
further site finding work, or by securing provision outside the borough in consultation 
with neighbouring boroughs  and the GLA . 
S. Islington will support the retenti on and development of  social and community 
infrastructure necessary  to support the borough’s residents, workers and visitors . 
This infrastructure must be  designed to be high quality , appropriate to specific 
needs and requirements of the use  and users ; and  located in places that are 
accessible, safe and co nvenient for people  of all ages  that use them .  
T. Existing play space will be protected and new play space will be sought as part of 
development. This should meet the needs of children and young people of all  ages 
and abilities . Provision of incidental play  space and the  creation of playable 
environments, as part of building/public realm design , adds a further important 
element of play.  
U. The health of communities is a very important  consideration as part of new  
development. Health Impact Assessments will be required in order to assess how 
new development will affect the health of local communities.  
V. New development in Islington should maximise social value, beyond what the 
Council would expect as a standard level  of social value on a scheme (resulting 
from compliance with all relevant policy requirements) .  
63 
  
 Islington’s residential population is expected to increase significantly over the plan 
period. The challenges associated with housing additional residents are  significant; not 
only do we have to contend with constraints on land availability, in the most densely 
populated and third smallest (by land area) English local authority area, we also face 
acute affordability issues.  
 The London -wide Strategic Housing Mar ket Assessment (SHMA)  2017 sets out an 
overall housing need figure for London, some 66,000 additional homes per annum. 
The Islington SHMA identifies a borough -level housing need of 23,000 dwellings over 
the period 2015 to 2035, or 1,150 dwellings per annum ; the majority of this need is for 
genuinely affordable housing.  
 In areas covered by spatial development strategies (such as London) the NPPF and 
PPG allow for the elected Mayor to distribute the total housing need figure across the 
plan area, in this cas e the strategic need figure for the entirety of Greater London. In 
London, the distribution of strategic housing need is done through the Strategic 
Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA).  
 A housing need figure is not in itself a housing target. Throu gh the SHLAA process, 
boroughs establish available housing capacity, which then informs actual local level 
housing targets. The SHLAA process has highlighted that there is dwindling capacity 
for new residential development in Islington, insufficient to mee t local housing need.  
 In order to meet our housing targets, and because of the aforementioned issues with 
new capacity for housing, it is important that existing housing is protected, and that 
land which could reasonably be expected to be suitable for new  housing is not 
developed for other uses; this includes reduction of housing units from extant 
permissions not yet built out.  
 The London SHMA figure relates to overall housing need. However, Islington consider 
that provision of genuinely affordable housing  is the single most effective measure that 
could help to truly address housing need in Islington. Islington’s local SHMA 2016 
identifies that over half of projected housing need in Islington is for affordable housing 
at or below social rents.  
 In addition,  the Islington SHMA highlights a need to provide a range of affordable 
housing products, particularly intermediate rented products, to address the current 
imbalance in the Islington housing market, whereby only a small percentage of 
households can afford m arket rent based on a sensible gross income affordability 
benchmark (30% of gross income on housing costs).  
 However, housing policies, particularly affordable housing requirements, must have 
regard to development viability. The viability study underpinning  the Local Plan shows 
that 50% of affordable housing can viably be delivered in the plan period.  
 New housing across all tenures must be of the highest quality, in accordance with the 
Local Plan objectives  and detailed design policies. Meeting housing need through the 
provision of sub -standard housing would be a pyrrhic victory and would be at odds 
with the idea of planning for sustainable development. It would create further 
substantial problems that would need to be addressed by future plans and strategies  
and would not be good planning. This Local Plan seeks to deliver new housing to meet 
local housing need, but this must  not be at the expense of housing quality.   
64 
 
 The need for new housing in the borough is significant, particularly the need for 
genuinely af fordable housing as demonstrated by local evidence. The Islington SHMA 
identifies a minimum need of 12,300 affordable dwellings between 2015 and 2035, but 
this does not factor in households spending large proportions of their income on rent 
who may also ne ed more affordable dwellings. The most telling statistic in the Islington 
SHMA is that only 15% of households can afford market rent based on spending 30% 
of their income on housing costs; the remaining 85% of households will therefore need 
some form of re nt subsidy/assistance in order to meet their housing costs.  
 However, it is important to note that the ultimate delivery of housing is something that 
is largely outside the Council ’s control, notably on private development sites, as there 
are limited power s to force build -out once planning permission is granted.  
 At the macro -economic level, the financialisation of housing and the idea of a home as 
a commodity, coupled with Government focus on demand -side economic 
interventions, has played a much greater ro le in exacerbating the ‘housing crisis’ than 
a simple lack of building enough homes. In Inner London, and Islington in particular, 
where land availability for development is scarce, demand -side measures have played 
a large role in increasing unaffordabilit y. Only when these macro issues are resolved, 
and where proper focused supply -side measures (such as freeing up Council s to build 
housing, and focusing grant funding on delivery of housing tenures which meet defined 
need not aspirations) are put in place c an a true picture of the housing market be 
ascertained. This is beyond the power of Islington Council , but it is important to 
understand these issues when planning for the future of Islington, to ensure that some 
realism is factored into planning for housi ng in particular and ensure that other 
develo pment needs are not overlooked.  
 Housing is not just a place for individuals and families to live; it can also deliver a 
specialist function (e.g. through design) to meet specific local housing needs.  
Islington’ s Housing Strategy aims to increase support and choice for vulnerable older 
people around housing options; increase levels of independence for people in need 
through improved housing opportunities and conditions and provide a better quality of 
life for som e of the boroughs most vulnerable residents.  
 Islington faces an extreme set of circumstances when it comes to need and land 
supply. Land supply in Islington is constrained , and  the borough is small and densely 
populated. Local evidence demonstrate s that th e need for new housing in the borough 
is significant, particularly the need for genuinely affordable housing. The borough 
faces an acute affordability issue which means that a simple ‘supply and demand’ 
model of housing delivery will not address the needs of our growing population. In this 
context land supply for conventional housing and genuinely affordable housing are 
considered the top priority because they are the most sustainable use of land in 
Islington , as they meet a broad range of housing needs .  
 Given the shortage of land, certain specialist forms of housing, including purpose -built 
student accommodation  and large scale HMOs, are not considered the most 
appropriate use of the land that is available in terms of maximising uses which deliver 
the obje ctives of the Local Plan , including meeting housing needs , and will generally 
be resisted.  
 Conventional residential development is by far the most sustainable form of residential 
development as it meets the broadest spectrum of housing need. Many people c an 
live in conventional residential units (even where units require  adaptation), whereas 
specialist forms of housing cater to specific groups. The future need for such specialist 
forms is untested as they are relatively new products, unlike convent ional re sidential  
65 
 units which are a  tried and tested method of meeting a broad spectrum of need over 
decades.  
 Supported housing can take many forms and helps to meet the needs of those people 
unable to live independently or those who are at risk or vulnerable. Pro vision of new 
supported housing which meets such needs will be considered favourably .  
 The adaptation of conventional housing can provide for the vast majority of housing 
needs, reducing the need to move homes and the need for specialist accommodation. 
Specialist housing for older people – such as extra care housing – will not usually be 
supported by the Council . This form of specialist housing often has excessive 
communal space which add to the cost of the provision, leading to reduced affordable 
housing and less than optimal use of land. However, specialist affordable housing for 
vulnerable older people with significant care needs may be appropriate in certain 
circumstance s.  
 The Council  is supportive of self -build and custom housebuilding in principle, but 
acknowledge that the highly urbanised context, the constrained land supply and high 
land costs in the borough, combined with a need for efficient use of sites, make 
delivery challenging.  
 Social and community infrastructure uses , such as hospitals, doctors’ surgeries, 
nurseries, schools, leisure centres  and sports facilities , libraries , community centres  
and recreational and play spaces  are vital for the creation and maint enance of strong, 
vibrant and healthy communities. Ensuring new development is supported by a 
suitable level of social and community infrastructure is important not only for the quality 
of life of residents in new developments, but also for the existing po pulation who 
should not see a reduction in the quality of their services, their health and wellbeing or 
their experience of living in Islington  through the redevelopment of existing facilities .  
 New development  will be required  to contribute to the borough ’s sense of social, 
mental and physical wellbeing by supporting social and community infrastructure 
provision. This may involve financial contributions secured through CIL or on -site 
provision at larger developments secured through planning obligations . Further 
information on infrastructure and financial contributions secured through CIL or 
planning obligations is provided in the strategic infrastructure section and the Planning 
Obligations (Section 106) SPD.   
 
A. Islington aims to meet and exceed the housing target of 7,750 units by 2028/29, 
which equates to an annualised target of 775 per annum  
B. Development proposals involving new housing – regardless of site size – must 
demonstrate that use of the building/si te is optimised. Particular consideration must  
be given to:  
(i) the contribution to meeting need for particular types of housing;  
(ii) the contribution to meeting the borough’s housing targets;   
66 
 (iii) the level of housing density;  
(iv) social and strategic infrastructure req uirements and impacts on existing and/or 
planned infrastructure; and  
(v) interaction with other policy priorities, including  the provision of new business 
floorspace to meet projected jobs growth  and sustainable  and inclusive design 
measures . 
C. The loss of exis ting self -contained housing  will be resisted unless the housing is 
replaced by at least equivalent floorspace and does not involve the net loss of more 
than one unit.  The net loss of existing affordable housing units – overall and in 
terms of social rented housing – will not be permitted . Conversion of two or more 
units into a single dwelling is considered material and would require planning 
permission.  
D. All development  proposals for conventional residential dwellings (including 
conversions and extensions) must provide a good mix of unit sizes w hich 
contributes to meeting the housing size mix priorities set out in Table 3.2. 
 
E. Concentrations of one -bedroom units – overall  and as part of constituent market 
and affordable elements of a proposal – will not be acceptable.  
 
F. Studio and bedsit units will not be permitted unless all of the following exceptional 
circumstances are demonstrated:  
(i) Studios/bedsits would constitute a ver y small proportion of the housing mix of a 
development proposal, both overall and/or in any constituent market or 
affordable elements;  
(ii) The delivery of a dditional higher priority unit sizes  and/or proposed higher 
priority units of an increased size  is not p ossible; and  
(iii) Provision of studios/bedsits would result in a high quality dwelling in accordance 
with Policy H4 and other relevant design policies.  
G. To maintain a supply of larger family homes, the conversion of residential units into 
a larger number of sel f-contained units will only be permitted where:  
(i) The total floor area of the existing dwelling is in excess of 125sqm GIA;  
(ii) The total number of new homes resulting from the conversion is optimised in line 
with the housing size mix priorities; and  
(iii) The dwellin g mix does not contain any studio/bedsit units or more than one one -
bedroom unit.  
H. All residential developments of 20 units and over  are required to enter into a Section 
106 legal agreement to ensure that all residential units will be occupied, to prevent  
wasted housing supply.  
 
 Working in conjunction with the GLA and other London boroughs through the London 
SHLAA process, Islington have derived capacity for 7,750 additional new homes by  
67 
 2028/298. This gives an annual minimum housing target of 775 new homes per 
annum. These figures are identified in the London Plan.  
 The housing target is made up of a large sites and small sites component9 (shown in 
Table 3.1 below) but the aim of the policy is achievement of the overall target, rather 
than meeting each constituent part.  
Table 3.1: London Plan housing target  
 Annual target  Total target 2019/20 to 
2028/29 (10 years)  
Small sites benchmark  484 4,840  
Large sites benchmark  291 2,910  
Total housing target  775 7,750  
  
 To meet the overall housing target, the Local Plan sets out a number of allocations on 
sites where new housing development is expected to come forward over the plan 
period. The majority of allocations will address the large sites benchmark. It is 
important that housing is delivered where allocat ed; in line with the strategic policy, 
proposed developments which result in the reduction of land supply which could 
reasonably be expected to be suitable for conventional housing (such as an allocated 
site) will be refused.  
 Almost two thirds of Islington ’s housing target is derived from small sites of less than 
0.25 hectares. The Local Plan supports delivery of housing on small sites, which is a 
continuation of broad support for such development evident in previous years. This 
support is not carte blanche ; small site housing delivery must address relevant policy 
requirements set out elsewhere in the Local Plan.  
 Progress toward meeting the borough’s housing target will be set out in the housing 
trajectory. An up -to-date housing trajectory will be published  at least annually.  
 Proposals of any size which include housing must  optimise housing delivery. The 
overarching Local Plan objectives are the starting point for developing all proposals 
involving the development of housing, to ensure that new housing provi sion 
contributes to the fundamental aims of the Local Plan. In addition, any proposals 
involving the development of housing must optimise the amount of housing delivered, 
having regard to the following issues:  
 The potential level of housing for which there  is a defined need, particularly social 
rented housing and other types of genuinely affordable housing.  
 The contribution that a particular site makes toward meeting housing targets.  
                                                
8 It is expected that the housing target will be revised prior to 2028/29, either through a review of the 
Local Plan or London Plan, but for avoidance of doubt, the annual target of 775 units will be rolled 
over after 2028/29 if no revision has taken place.  The Islington housing trajectory (produced at least 
annually) will assume an annual target of 775 for years after 2028/29.  
9 For purposes of the SHLAA and the derivation of a housing target, a small site is a site with an area 
of less than 0.25 hectares; and a large site is a site with an area of 0.25 hectares or greater. The 
London Plan policy H2 defines a small site as a development which provides between one and 25 
homes.   
68 
  The impact on existing or planned infrastructure resulting from new occupa nts. 
 The effect that a given level of housing delivery would have on other policies of the 
Local Plan, in particular mixed -use proposals involving housing where housing 
may constrain the amount of business floorspace that could come forward to meet 
other d evelopment needs such as affordable workspace.  
 The loss of conventional housing will directly affect the ability of the Council  to meet 
housing targets. Existing housing should be retained, except where housing will be re -
provided on the site with at least  equivalent floorspace and where no more than one 
unit is lost (net), although any cumulative impact of small net losses from other similar 
proposals across the borough may be taken into account, which may mean that the 
net loss of single units is unaccept able on specific proposals. For the purposes of this 
policy, the conversion of two or more dwellings into a single dwelling is considered to 
be material for the purpose of section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 
1990 (as amended), and would requ ire planning permission.  
 Where redevelopment of affordable housing is proposed, there should be no net loss 
of existing affordable housing units, both overall and in terms of existing social rented 
units. In exceptional circumstances, net loss of affordabl e housing unit s may be 
acceptable, where:  
 there is no net loss of affordable housing floo rspace, both overall and in terms of 
existing social rented floorspace;  
 high quality replacement dwellings are provided in line with policy H4 ; and    
 the replacement units are addressing a specific need in terms of unit size, to be 
agreed with the Council ’s Planning and Housing departments.  
 All development proposals for conventional residential dwellings (including 
conversions and extensions) must provi de a good mix of unit sizes which contributes 
to meeting the housing size mix priorit ies set out in T able 3.2, as follows:  
Table 3.2: Housing size mix priorities for each housing tenure  
Tenure  Studio/bedsit  1-bed 2-bed 3-bed 4-bed

 The housing size mix priorities have been derived from local evidence and 
engagement with the Council ’s housing team. The priorities reflect a snapshot in time, 
and are sensitive to issues outside the Council ’s control, including changes to the 
benefits regime. Affordable housing in particular may require a different mix to address 
short term changes in n eed/demand as a result of specific interventions (for example, 
efforts to reduce under -occupation).  
 The housing size mix of the wheelchair accessible units built to M4(3) ‘Wheelchair user 
dwellings’ standard  may be informed by data su pplied by the Council s housing 
allocations t eam. Further Council  evidence/research on affordable housing size mix 
that suggests different priorities may be a relevant to justify deviation from the 
proposed housing size mix on a case -by-case basis.  
 Units of two -bedrooms or more are considered to be family homes for the purposes of 
policy H2. One -bedroom units should not be the predominant sized unit across a 
development proposal overall, or as part of the individual market and affordable 
proportions of a scheme; however, within certain intermediate tenures where they are 
a high priority housing size mix as set out in Table 3.2 , one -bedroom units may be the 
predominant unit size ( provided  they are not the predominant  size mix for affordable 
housing ove rall, factoring in social rented provision).  
 Studio and bedsit units are not a priority housing size mix across any affordable or 
market tenures, and will not be permitted unless specific exceptional circumstances 
are demonstrated, including demonstrating  that studio/bedsit units form a very small 
proportion of the housing mix of a development proposal, both overall and/or in any 
constituent market or affordable element. This is considered to be no more than 5% of 
units, as a percentage of units overall an d as a percentage of each of the affordable 
and market elements of a proposal. Applicants will also need to provide evidence 
clearly showing why higher priority housing sizes cannot be accommodated ; this 
includes either additional higher p riority unit size s; or increased floorspace for higher 
priority units already proposed, which will be particularly important where such units 
are at the margins in terms of meeting space standards. Regarding the latter, 
additional space should not result in a unit/units be ing over -sized, as this would  not be 
considered to be optimal use of a site/land  in line with Part B of the policy.  
 Meeting Islington’s housing need is challenging given the context of the borough and 
the competing development needs that need to be planned  for. Where housing is 
provided, it is of paramount importance that the housing is occupied and contributes 
toward meeting housing need. To ensure that units are occupied, all new housing 
developments which propose 20 units or more will be required to ente r into a planning 
obligation which requires the owners of individual dwellings within the development to 
use and occupy the individual dwellings as a dwelling house (i.e. personal occupation) 
or to ensure such use and occupation (i.e. through private renta l). Further guidance is 
provided in the Prevented Wasted Housing Supply SPD.  The requirement will not be 
applied to any affordable housing units as these would be bound by other legal 
requirements which would ensure occupation.  
 Policy H2 covers Use Class C 3 and C4 housing only. Relevant policies covering other 
types of residential accommodation are provided elsewhere in the Local Plan.  
  
70 
 A. A minimum of 50% of the total net additional conventional housing built in the 
borough over the plan period must  be genuinely affordable.  Affordable housing 
tenures which are not considered to be genuinely affordable will be resisted and will 
not be counted towards the level of affordable housing provision on individual 
schemes.  
B. All sites (except for those which are currently or have been in full or partial public 
sector ownership) which are capable of delivering 10 or more conventional units 
(gross) and/or which propose 1,000sqm (GIA) residential floorspace or more must :  
(i) provide  at least 45% on -site affordable housing (by net additional unit) without 
public subsidy; and  
(ii) exhaust all potential options for maximising the delivery of on -site affordable 
housing to reach and exceed the strategic 50% target, particularly through 
securin g public subsidy.  
C. Where  a site triggers Part B, and  proposes a level of on -site affordable housing  
above 45% but less than 50% (regardless of whether public subsidy is provided or 
not), the proposal  will be subject to detailed review mechanisms throughout the 
period up to full completion of the development , including an advanced stage review 
mechanism.  Any sites which trigger Part B and provide at least 50% on-site 
affordable h ousing (by net additional unit)  will not be subject to an advanced stage 
review m echanism but will be subject to review mechanism which will be triggered if 
an agreed level of progress on implementation is not made within a certain period 
following grant of planning permission; and, in the case of large phased schemes, 
triggered prior to the implementation of later phases of the development.  
D. All sites which are capable of delivering 10 or more conventional units (gross) 
and/or which propose 1,000sqm (GIA) residential floorspace or more , and which are 
currently or ha ve been in public sec tor ownership (either part or full public 
ownership) must :  
(i) provide at least 50% on -site affordable housing (by net additional unit) without 
public subsidy; and  
(ii) exhaust all potential options for maximising the delivery of on -site affordable 
housing in excess of 50%, particularly through securing relevant public subsidy.  
E. Where  a site triggers Part D, and additional on -site affordable housing does not 
demonstrate ‘additionality ’ above 50% to the Council ’s satisfaction, the proposal  will 
be subject to detailed review mechanisms throughout the period up to full 
completion of the development , including an advanced stage review mechanism.  
F. Any proposal which does not provide the  minimum  required level of affordable 
housing set out in Pa rt B or D  will be refused.  
G. Site-specific viability information will only be accepted in exceptional cases , 
determined by  the Council . Any proposals where site -specific viability evidence is 
accepted must provide the maximum amount of affordable housing, in formed by 
detailed viability evidence consistent with the Development Viability SPD. Such  
71 
 proposals will be subject to detailed review mechanisms throughout the period up to 
full completion of the development , including an advanced stage review mechanism . 
H. Where affordable housing is provided on -site, the Council  will require  an affordable 
housing tenure split of  70% social rented housing and 30% intermediate housing . 
The majority of intermediate units should be London Living Rent, and  regard will be 
given  to the priorities set out in the Council ’s Housing Strategy and other agreed 
evidence of housing need.  
I. Sites delivering fewer than 10 residential units (gross) and/or which propose less 
than 1,000sqm (GIA) residential floorspace are required to provide a f inancial 
contribution to fund the development of affordable housing off -site. The level of 
contribution required will be £50,000 per net additional unit, except for the area 
south of Pentonville Road/City Road where the contribution required will be £60,000  
per net additional unit.  
J. For proposals which trigger  affordable housing  requirements  in Islington (either on -
site or through financial contributions), application of the Vacant Building Credit will 
not be appropriate. Where an applicant provides exceptional reasons why the 
Vacant Building Credit should be applied on a particular developme nt, they must 
meet all of the following criteria:  
(i) It is clearly demonstrated that the site would otherwise not come forward for any 
form of redevelopment at any point over the medium to long -term;  
(ii) All buildings within the site boundary must be vacant at th e time the application 
is submitted;  
(iii) There are no extant or recently expired permissions on the site, for any 
proposed use class.  
(iv) The proposal does not involve the loss of any capacity to meet other 
development needs from a site allocated for non -housing d evelopment; and  
(v) The building has not been made vacant for the sole purpose of redevelopment, 
evidenced by provision of marketing and vacancy evidence for a continuous 
period of five years (up to the point of submission of an application). Such 
evidence mus t meet the marketing and vacancy requirements set out in 
Append ix 1. 
 
 The majority of housing need in Islington is for affordable housing, particularly social 
rented accommodation  which l ocal evidence suggests is the affordable  tenure which 
best meets housing need . Islington aspire to fully meeting this need, with a particular 
aim of delivering as many genuinely affordable homes as possible from private sites 
and from the Council ’s own sites.  
 In the context of the Local Plan, genuinely affordable housi ng is primarily considered 
to be  social rented accommodation. I ntermediate  housing  which is  demonstrably 
affordable to those on low to moderate incomes, such as key workers in the borough , 
could fall within the definition of ‘genuinely affordable’ ; this particularly includes London 
Living Rent10. Shared ownership housing is, in the majority of circumstances, not 
affordable to those on low to moderate incomes  and therefore in most cases would not 
                                                
10 This also applies to any replacement product which sets rents at a low proportio n of the prevailing 
market rate, and which is therefore affordable for those on low to moderate incomes whose needs it is 
intended to meet.   
72 
 constitute ‘genuinely affordable housing’ ; however, it may be classed as an acceptable  
‘genuinely affordable’  intermediate tenure on a case -by-case basis, depending on the 
size of units and location within the borough, and where the total monthly costs 
including the rental elemen t are demonstrably affordable. In such circumstances , the 
rental element must  be secured at an affordable level through legal agreement.  
Paragraph 3.5 6 sets out specific tenures which meet the NPPF definition of affordable 
housing  that are not be considered ‘genuinely affordable housing ’ as per Islington’s 
definition.  
 Local Plan viability testing shows that 45% of affordable housing can be provided on a 
site-by-site basis, from development value alone, without constraining the viability of 
schemes. Indeed, in many cases, 50% affordable h ousing is viable without public 
subsidy.  
 In light of this, the Local Plan has a minimum strategic target for 50% of all housing 
delivered over the plan period to be affordable. Given that sites of less than 10 units 
and/or 1,000sqm are not required to deli ver on -site affordable housing, this 
necessitates a strong requirement for affordable housing from schemes above this 
threshold  to achieve 50% affordable housing. In addition, t o balance out non -delivery 
from small sites, very high levels of affordable hou sing are expected to be delivered 
through the Council ’s own housing schemes and those brought forward by Registered 
Providers. By implementing this package of measures, the Council  considers that  50% 
affordable housing, delivered across the plan period, is  a deliverable and achievable 
objective.  
 Proposals for 10 or more conventional units (gross) and/or which propose 1,000sqm 
(GIA) residential floorspace or more must provide at least 45% affordable housing on -
site, without public subsidy (such as grant fun ding). For such proposals, the Council  
will not accept affordable housing provided off -site or financial contributions in lieu, as 
this would waste an opportunity for physical affordable housing to be delivered and 
would not contribute to the aim of achiev ing mixed and balanced communities. As 
stated above, in many cases 50% affordable housing is viable without public subsidy. 
Therefore , the Council ’s policy is designed to incentivise developers to achieve 50% of 
affordable housing provision on all sites.  
 Sites which are currently or have been in public ownership must provide at least 50% 
affordable housing on -site, with out public subsidy (such as grant funding); this applies 
to sites owned or in use by a public sector organisation, or company or organisatio n in 
public ownership; or land that has been released from public ownership, having 
previously been owned or in use (at any point in the past) by a public sector 
organisation, or company or organisation in public ownership . Public sector sites are  
(or have  been)  public assets and therefore there is a reasonable expectation that such 
sites should prioritise affordable housing which helps address housing needs.  
 The Holloway Prison site is the largest potential development site in Islington. Viability 
testing  has demonstrated that this public sector site can deliver at least 50% genuinely 
affordable housing, including the entire Intermediate component as London Living 
Rent. The Council  considers this site to be the benchmark for all public sector sites in 
the borough. Further information on the site is provided in the Site Allocations 
document and the Holloway Prison Site SPD.  
 The London Plan advocates a ‘portfolio approach’ to delivering affordable housing, 
whereby public sector landowners must deliver 50% aff ordable housing in total across 
a number of sites (which can be in multiple boroughs); individual sites within the 
portfolio can deliver less than 50% so long as the overall amount is at least 50%. The  
73 
 portfolio approach is not considered acceptable for an y schemes in Islington. Each site 
must deliver affordable housing in line with the relevant part of policy H3. The Council  
will not accept lesser delivery to compensate for other sites, either elsewhere in the 
borough or outside the borough. Such an approa ch is detrimental to the achievement 
of mixed and balanced communities.  
 On all sites (both public sector and non -public sector), in addition to the respective 
minimum affordable housing requirements to be funded from development value 
alone, all potential options to provide further affordable units  (i.e. additionality)  must be 
fully investigated, including seeking public subsidy. This should include proactive 
engagement with Registered Providers at the earliest possible opportunity, ideally at 
pre-applicati on stage. Proposals must  make clear the level of affordable housing 
provision with and without subsidy as part of the application process. On non -public 
sector sites which are required to provide a minimum of 45% affordable housing from 
development value a lone, w here the level of affordable housing does not meet at least 
50% following any investigation of potential further options , the proposal will be subject 
to detailed review mechanisms throughout the period up to full completion of the 
development, including an advanced stage review mechanism.   
 PPG11 states that review mechanisms are  not a tool to protect a return to the 
developer, but to strengthen local authorities’ ability to seek compliance with relevant 
policies over the lifetime of the project . Advanced stage review mechanisms are an 
important tool to bolster affordable housing provision on each and every housing 
scheme, and thereby assist in meeting the Council ’s key priority of delivering genuinely 
affordable housing.  
 For avoidance of doubt, an y site which is not in public sector ownership which 
achieves at least 50% affordable housing on -site, without public subsidy, will not be 
subject to an advanced stage review mechanism; however, such sites should still 
exhaust all potential options for max imising the delivery of genuinely affordable 
housing in excess of 50%.  
 Any proposal which does not provide the minimum required amount of affordable 
housing – in line with relevant policy requirements – will be refused. These levels of 
affordable housing h ave been informed by detailed viability evidence which 
demonstrates that these levels are viable and will not preclude development from 
coming forward. On a limited number of sites, there may be genuine exceptional 
circumstances which necessitate provision  of site -specific viability information; the 
Council  will consider this on a case -by-case basis but the expectation is that such 
circumstances would usually only relate to a significant shift in macro -economic 
conditions. The amount paid for land  is not co nsidered to be an exceptional reason to 
justify provision of site -specific viability , in line with Government guidance12. The 
Council  will not entertain a viability assessment if it is considered that there are no 
exceptional circumstances which justify doi ng so.  
 Generally, viability information should not normally be required at application stage in 
order to inform future review mechanisms, and therefore this will generally not be 
considered appropriate exceptional circumstances. Values and costs will be as sessed 
in the future, at the point of the viability review, informed by the Council ’s Development 
Viability SPD and, where relevant, the use of indices, to assess the change in values 
and build costs since permission was granted. However, there may be some  cases –

74 
 determined by the Council  – where limited site -specific viability information is 
necessary to enable future review mechanisms to operate effectively.  Specific model s 
of housing delivery including purpose built PRS and large -scale HMOs would not 
justify provision of site -specific viability . 
 Where viability evidence is provided to justify the level of affordable housing, this must  
be in accordance with Islington’s Development Viability SPD and relevant guidance 
published by the Mayor of London. This includes (but is not limited to) requirements for 
development proposals to:  
 provide relevant viability information at the earliest pos sible stage of the planning 
process, and clearly demonstrate that the requirement to provide the maximum 
level of affordable housing has been integrated in the scheme from the outset;  
 ensure that all viability information is submitted at the validation sta ge of an 
application, and that revised information is provided as necessary to reflect 
changes to the scheme and/or wider market conditions;  
 approach the assessment of viability in a transparent manner and make all 
documentation related to the viability as sessment of a proposal publically 
available;  
 ensure that the Council ’s costs associated with assessing any viability assessment 
(including independent assessment as deemed necessary by the Council ), and 
any associated costs, are paid for in advance; and  
 provide statutory declarations to verify the accuracy of any viability information 
submitted; to confirm that the company producing the viability assessment are not 
instructed on the basis of performance related pay or other incentives according to 
outcome of the viability process; and to confirm the deliverability of any scheme 
proposed;  
 A pre -implementation review mechanism will be applied to all proposals which include 
affordable housing; this will trigger if a permission has not been substantially 
imple mented within 12 months of permission being granted (and may trigger in other 
circumstances including where development is substantially implemented then stalled). 
Mid-point review mechanisms will also be applied to large phased schemes.  
 Advanced stage re view mechanism will be applied to schemes delivering less than 
50% affordable housing, to ensure that viability is accurately assessed at the point at 
which actual values are realised. This ensures that the requirement to maximise 
affordable housing is bui lt in to the development, even development that can initially – 
at the point of application through any accepted site -specific viability – demonstrate 
that a higher proportion of affordable housing is not viable.  
 Some specialist housing , including supporte d housing provided in line with policy H9, 
may in some circumstances  (agreed with the Council)  contribute towards affordable 
housing requirements  because they meet an important need,  and can be discounted 
from the overall site -specific requirement.  
 The te nure of affordable housing must be genuinely affordable and address the needs 
identified in local evidence, which suggests that the majority of Islington’s housing 
need is for rented accommodation at or below social rents . One of the key statistics 
from th is local evidence is that almost half of Islington households cannot afford target 
rent13. A quarter of households can afford target rent based on this income/rent ratio, 
and only approximately a fifth of households can afford 80% of market rent or market 
                                                
13 Modelled on assumption that 30% of gross income of households in rented accommodation is 
spent on rent.   
75 
 rent. Therefore, maximising the delivery of social rented homes is the Council ’s 
absolute priority.  
 Part H sets out the required 70% social rented /30% intermediate tenure split for any 
proposed affordable housing.  This proposed split will help address the identified 
housing need in the borough. It is also consistent with paragraph 64 of the NPPF 
which requires major development involving the provision of housing to include at least 
10% of homes for affordable home ownership; this 10% provision can be 
accomm odated within Islington’s 70/30 tenure split , as tenure split  permits  genuinely 
affordable intermediate products which would constitute  affordable home ownership  – 
paragraph 3.38 defines genuinely affordable housing for the purposes of policy H3 .  
 There ar e a number of other forms of affordable housing  (as defined by the NPPF)  
which will not be acceptable in Islington, as they would simply be unaffordable to those 
whose needs they are intended  to meet14: 
 Discounted Market Sales (DMS) – DMS is an intermediate  home ownership 
product that must be sold at a discount of at least 20% below local market value. 
DMS should be affordable to households which meet a specified household 
income cap15. DMS should remain available at a discount for future eligible 
households.  Given the high average house prices in Islington and the required 
income multipliers that would be required even for an 80% mortgage, it is highly 
unlikely that DMS would meet defined housing needs in Islington. This would be 
the case even with substantia lly higher rates of discount, e.g. 50%+.  
 Starter Homes – Starter Homes are similar to DMS, although they have various 
statutory requirements attached, including an income cap (£90,000 in Greater 
London), price cap (£450,000 in Greater London, which include s the minimum 20% 
discount) and age restrictions (Starter Home s can only be purchased by qualifying 
first time buyers aged between 23 and 40, although limited exceptions apply). Also, 
Starter Homes have a set period  during which the home needs to be sold a t a set 
discount, although this discount is not recycled following the end of the discount 
period. Like DMS, Starter Homes are unlikely to meet defined housing needs in 
Islington.  
 Affordable Private Rent (APR) – APR is intermediate rented housing provided 
within Purpose Built Private Rented Sector development – so-called ‘Build to Rent’ 
development. Policy H11 details Islington’s approach to ‘Build to Rent’ and 
includes, inter alia, a requirement to provide genuinely affordable housing. APR at 
high percenta ges of market rent will not be acceptable as part of any ‘Build to Rent’ 
development, as they would not contribute toward meeting identified housing need 
and would validate the perception that ‘Build to Rent’ is a wasted opportunity to 
provide more priorit y affordable tenures such as social rent.  
 Proposals involving  fewer than 10 residential units (gross) and/or which propose less 
than 1,000sqm (GIA) residential floorspace  are required to provide a f inancial 
contribution to fund the development of affordabl e housing off -site. The level of 
contribution is set out in policy  H316 and is determined by the number of net additional 
                                                
14 Any other new forms of affordable housing which materialise during the plan period, which the 
Council  consider is not genuinely affordable and therefore will not meet identified needs, will also be 
deemed unacceptable.  
15 The current income cap for Interme diate Ownership is £90,000, as set out in the London Plan 
Annual Monitoring Report. Any updated income caps in future London Plan AMRs, or any initial 
income caps set  at a local level , will be relevant for the purposes of assessing intermediate ownership 
proposals.  
16 The standard level of contribution may be updated via a SPD in future, where updated evidence 
suggests a different standard amount is viable.   
76 
 units provided and the location of a proposal. For avoidance of doubt the required 
contribution applies to new build units, conversions  of existing buildings resulting in the 
creation of new units, and subdivision of existing residential properties resulting in net 
additional units. The contribution applies to residential units within the C3 and C4 Use 
Classes. Affordable housing requirem ents for non -C3/C4 housing are covered in 
policies H6 and H11 . 
 In cases where an applicant is seeking to demonstrate – through a viability 
assessment – that a full contribution is unlikely to be viable, they will be required to 
provide this assessment when  the planning application is submitted; the Council  will 
not accept viability assessments submitted during the application process. The Council  
reserves the right to have any viability assessment independently assessed, the cost 
of which must be borne by t he applicant.  
 Proposals which include on -site provision of social rented housing will not be required 
to make a financial contribution, unless the unit (s) proposed on -site are worth less 
than the full financial contribution that would be required for the scheme. In such 
cases, the Council  will require the difference in value to be provided as a top -up 
financial contribution.  
 Contributions for off -site affordable housing  for small sites – whether for the full 
amount or a lesser amount in line with the findings of agreed viability evidence – and 
the trigger point for payment of the contribution will be secured through a unilateral 
undertaking (Section 106, Town and Country  Planning Act, 1990) which site owners, 
including mortgagees, will be required to enter into before the planning permission is 
issued. The contribution will be payable on commencement of the development, 
although in exceptional cases the Council  may accept  alternative payment triggers, 
such as:  
 Payment on practical completion for very small developments (i.e. subdivision of 
an existing home to create one additional unit).  
 Payment on future sale where an additional self -contained unit is being created for 
a family member (or in similar circumstances) and there will be no immediate sale 
of the unit.  
 The Vacant Building Credit (VBC) is a material consideration in relevant planning 
determinations but in Islington, it is likely that the acute need for affordable housing will 
outweigh application of the VBC in all cases. The aim of the VBC is to incentivise 
development on brownfield sites, but this is an unnecessary incentive in Islington given 
that all development sites are brownfield, and the rate of recent and p rojected housing 
delivery is strong. Applicants looking to justify application of the VBC will need to 
demonstrate exceptional circumstances and ensure that they meet all the following 
criteria:  
 Provision of evidence that clearly demonstrates that the site  would not come 
forward for redevelopment without use of the VBC. This should include, but is not 
limited to, viability evidence.  
 Marketing and vacancy evidence to a standard set out in Appendix 1. This must  be 
for a continuous period of at least five year s up to the point of submission of an 
application. Any gaps in marketing or periods of time where marketing activity was 
less active will not be considered part of a continuous period.  
 The proposed site is not allocated for non -housing development, either fully or in 
part. VBC may exacerbate loss of such sites which will detrimentally affect the 
ability to meet other development needs. For the purposes of the policy, non - 
77 
 housing development includes mixed -use allocations for housing alongside other 
uses and  is not limited to sites allocated for 100% non -housing uses.  
 There should be no extant or recently expired permissions (i.e. expired 
permissions with lapse date within three years prior to the point of submission of 
an application). Evidence of extant an d/or recently expired permissions 
demonstrate that development is likely to come forward without additional 
incentive.  
 Where an applicant meets the criteria and VBC is applied, VBC should be applied to 
the strategic policy of 50% affordable housing.  
 It should be noted that if a scheme qualifies for VBC, it cannot also claim Community 
Infrastructure Levy (CIL) relief through the vacancy test.  
 
A. All new C3 and C4 housing developments (including conversions and changes of 
use) and specialist housing identified in policies H6 to H11  must  be designed and 
built to a high quality  for the duration of its lifetime . A high quality dwelling is one 
which meets the criteria set out in this policy and accords  with the Local  Plan 
objectives and other relevant Local Plan policies. Sufficient information, such as 
detailed dwelling plans showing internal layout, must be provided at the earliest 
possible stage of an application, to allow for proper assessment of proposals.  
B. Reside ntial development must  be functional , useable and comfortable space that 
has good amenity for occupiers of all ages. Regard must be had to the surrounding 
local context as part of the holistic consideration of inclusive design. Housing must  
be built to be accessible and adaptable to meet changing occupier circumstances 
over the lifetime of the development, and must provide 90% of dwellings to 
Category M4(2) ‘Accessible and Adaptable’ standard; and the remaining 10% of 
dwellings to Category M4(3) ‘Wheelchair  user dwellings’ standard, as set out in the 
Approved Document M of the Building Regulations. Category M4(3) standard 
dwellings must : 
(i) be provided across all tenures and unit sizes, and integrated within the 
development;  
(ii) be fitted out appropriately to enab le occupation by a range of occupiers with 
diverse and changing needs; and  
(iii) be single -storey, preferably on the ground floor. Where provided above  or below  
entrance level  there must be at least two suitable lifts available for use by each 
unit within a conv enient distance from the front door of the units.  
C. Residential development must meet or exceed the minimum space standards, and 
address other requirements for private internal space, as set out in the London Plan 
and relevant Supplementary Planning Guidance  (SPG) . Appropriate consideration 
must  also be given to:   
78 
 (i) providing sufficient space for the general and specific storage needs of residents 
(including those with disabilities) living within dense urban development, where 
options for storing possessions ar e often very limited;  
(ii) how recycling and waste arising from the occupation of the development will be 
stored, collected and managed, particularly for flatted residential development; 
and 
(iii) provision of rooms which are designed to function comfortably and efficiently for 
their intended purpose.  
D. Good circulation space must  be provided within each residential unit. Multi -storey 
dwellings must  provide space for provision of a stair lift, and a suitably identified 
space for a through -the-floor lift from the ent rance level.  
 
E. In new housing development, all habitable rooms, kitchens and bathrooms are 
required to have a minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.6 metres (between finished 
floor level and finished ceiling level). In residential conversions, including 
extensions, where the original ceiling height is maintained, a lower ceiling height 
may be acceptable where it can be demonstrated that overall a good standard of 
daylight, natural ventilation and useable floorspace  can be provided.  
 
F. Layout and design must  accord strictly with tenure blind principles to maximise 
opportunities for social interaction. Development must  be designed from the outset 
to ensure shared building access for both market and affordable units. Where 
applicants have demonstrated that this is not possible and/or where shared building 
access would demonstrably impact the level of affordable housing on site, building 
access for affordable units must:  
(i) be accessible and located on main frontages or as close as possible to main 
frontages , unless loc ation away from main frontages results in improved 
residential amenity ; 
(ii) ensure that the location of building access will not affect safety and security of 
residents or lead to negative perceptions of safety and security; and  
(iii) maintain the dignity of residen ts of affordable units and avoid locating building 
access for these units adjacent to waste/refuse areas and/or other building 
services.  
G. Residential development, particularly flatted development and proposals involving 
the conversion of residential unit(s ) into a larger number of units must consider the 
effect on the amenity of adjacent properties, and put in place measures to address 
any adverse effects raised. This consideration should include (but is not limited to):  
(i) internal layout, including the relat ionship of rooms on different floors within the 
scheme, and the position of entrances, extensions and fire escapes;  
(ii) consideration of any overlooking or overshadowing impacts;  
(iii) the impact on existing delivery and servicing provision;  and 
(iv) noise and vibration impacts  (see also Part J of this policy) .  
79 
 H. All new residential units should be dual aspect, unless provision of dual aspect is 
demonstrated to be impossible or unfavourable. Where such circumstances are 
demonstrated, all single aspect units must:  
(i) provide a good level of daylight for each habitable room, and optimise 
opportunity for direct sunlight;  
(ii) ensure that the aspect is not predominantly north -facing and does not face onto 
main roads or other significant sources of air pollution and/or noise and 
vibratio n, which would preclude opening windows;  
(iii) provide a good level of natural ventilation throughout the dwelling via 
passive/non -mechanical design measures; and  
(iv) ensure that future occupiers have a good level of privacy and do not experience 
adverse impacts fro m overlooking.  
I. The design of all residential development is required to maximise natural light into 
the room (subject to passive heating and cooling considerations). The glazing to all 
habitable rooms must  be generous and should aim to be not less than 20%  of the 
internal floor area of the room. All dwellings should provide for direct sunlight to 
enter the main habitable rooms for a reasonable period of the day.  
J. All development proposals which include residential units must fully assess noise 
and vibration  impacts on and between dwellings, in line with  policy DH5 . Proposals 
should:  
(i) ensure residential units are sited away from sources of noise and vibration, to 
prevent impacts occurring; or  
(ii) Where this is not possible, provide a detailed assessment of noise and vibration 
impacts. Where noise and/or vibration effects are identified suitable mitigation 
measures must be put in place to reduce these effects, through the proposed 
layout (including the interaction of non -residential and residential uses in mixed 
use developments), design and materials. If effects cannot be mitigated, 
planning permission will not be granted.  
K. All development proposals which include residential units must  ensure that the 
overall approach to all entrances is logical, legible and level o r gently sloping. The 
distance from parking spaces/drop -off points to the main entrance to the residential 
building must  be no more than 50m. The total distance between a parking 
space/ drop-off point and an individual dwelling entrance must  be no more than  75m.  
L. In all new residential development, the number of dwellings accessed from a single 
core must not be more than eight on each floor, although a smaller number is 
preferable. The following criteria must be addressed in relation to shared circulation 
space: 
(i) Common/shared entrances should lead to a hall large enough for people to 
manoeuvre with shopping and/or baby buggies and /or wheelchairs  with ease.  
(ii) All dwellings should be provided with step -free or lift access.  
(iii) Communal circulation corridors should ideally be 1,500mm wide, but no less 
than 1,200mm wide . Where they have an unobstructed width of less than  
80 
 1,500mm, communal corridors should have wheelchair turning spaces at 
reasonable intervals.  
(iv) Access cores must provide an access control system, with entr y phones in all 
dwellings linked to a main front door with remote electronic lock release.  
 
 High quality housing is housing which accords with the Local Plan objectives , and 
which meets the full breadth of design requirements set out in policy H4, as well as 
other Development Plan policies including those focused on sustainability and 
amenity. A home should be a place of retreat, where people can feel comfortable and 
safe. Collectively, the design of new homes can provide the foundation for mixed and 
balanced communities to develop and thrive. The Local Plan objectives  are the 
starting point for the design of new homes , particularly via compliance with policy 
PLAN1.  
 Desig n policy must be people -focused to ensure that the needs of individuals and 
families are at the heart of housing that is developed in Islington. Collectively, this 
focus on high quality housing will contribute to the development of mixed and balanced 
commu nities. Ensuring that affordable housing is integrated within development is one 
specific way that such communities can develop. In order to facilitate this, all 
development must adhere to tenure -blind principles to ensure that the affordable and 
private h ousing elements are indistinguishable from one another, which assists with 
limiting the stigma often attached to affordable housing development.  
 Access to the building should be shared, unless this is demonstrably not possible 
and/or where shared building  access would demonstrably impact the level of 
affordable housing on site. In these circumstances, separate entrances must be 
accessible, safe, secure and not sited adjacent to waste/refuse areas and/or other 
building services.  
 All applications involving n ew housing must  be accompanied by sufficient information 
to allow for full assessment against policy H4 criteria. Information must  be provided as 
early as possible in the planning application process, ideally at pre -application stage 
where relevant. Applic ants are required to provide details of proposed overall 
floorspace  and a breakdown of dwelling and room sizes, including occupancy. 
Dwelling plans are required to demonstrate how dwellings will accommodate standard -
sized furniture, access and activity spa ce needs related to the declared level of 
occupancy, including internal space where children can play; and standards for 
adaptable and/or wheelchair accessible homes. Plans should also show how separate 
storage (within suitable containers) of food waste, mixed dry recycling and any non -
recyclable waste can be accommodated within the home . Those details not evident on 
the dwelling plan are required to be detailed in the Design and Access Statement and 
relevant schedule of accommodation (for example, details  such as level entry showers 
and the route for ceiling mounted hoists).  
 Larger units of 3 bedrooms or more should normally provide a separate living room 
and kitchen/dining rooms. Where separation is not possible, a demountable partition 
should be provided  (or provision made for its installation) between kitchen/dining 
rooms and living rooms, ensuring adequate circulation and activity space within each 
discre te area.  
 Homes that are built to be adaptable to changing needs have the potential to enable 
individ uals to stay put longer, which contributes towards meeting various policy  
81 
 objectives, including the creation of mixed and balanced communities and the move 
towards a circular economy (by reducing the need for significant and costly retrofitting 
and/or rede velopment in the future). Importantly, it reduces the need for certain types 
of specialist housing, particularly older persons housing, by allowing people to 
maintain independence and minimising unwanted moves to residential care.  
 Part M of the Building Re gulations generally does not apply to dwellings resulting from 
a conversion and/or change of use. Housing delivery through conversion and/or 
change of use could be significant over the plan period, given the densely developed 
characteristics of the borough , therefore it is vital that all new dwellings created embed 
the principles of inclusive design, having regard to the overarching objectives of the 
Local Plan. Islington will seek to secure the greatest degree of ‘visitability ’ and 
‘adaptability ’ that is r easonably achievable within an existing structure.  
 Approved Document M of the Building Regulations sets out standards for ‘Accessible 
and Adaptable’ – known as Category M4(2) – and ‘Wheelchair user dwellings’ – known 
as Category M4(3). Policy H4 requires 9 0% of dwellings to be built to Category M4(2) 
‘Accessible and Adaptable’ standard; and the remaining 10% of dwellings to be built to 
Category M4(3) ‘Wheelchair user dwellings’ standard.  
 Category M4(2) dwellings are considered suitable for older people, som e disabled 
people including some wheelchair users, and also for non -disabled people, including 
families with children. Building to this standard will ensure that London’s housing stock 
becomes progressively more capable of responding to the needs of a rang e of 
households as they live independently for longer and their circumstances and levels of 
mobility change over time. It ensures that households who need to accommodate a 
disabled family member from birth, or through accident, injury or illness or old age  are 
able to make effective adaptations to their homes without incurring substantial cost , 
and therefore precluding  the need  to move property.  
 Category M4(2) and M4(3) dwellings must be fitted out appropriately to enable 
occupation by a range of occupiers with diverse and changing  needs. This includes 
consideration of how occupiers use internal space. Further guidance is provided in the 
Inclusive Design SPD, but generally development should include:  
 appropriate internal door opening weights (no more than 30 N); 
 a level entrance with threshold heights not exceeding 15mm;  
 window controls that are reachable and usable by those with mobility impairments; 
and 
 kitchens and bathrooms capable of being adapted easily – e.g. walls capable of 
taking grab rails, appropri ate drainage to facilitate step free shower installation, 
kitchen tiling and plumbing which supports the operation of flexible height work 
surfaces and sink.  
 The Council  may, in limited circumstances, accept a S106 contribution in lieu of 
Category M4(3) un its on site, where there is definitive local evidence  (produced by the 
Council)  of a supply/demand imbalance for wheelchair accessible units. This 
contribution will be used to finance the development of new and adapted wheelchair 
accessible units elsewhere  in the borough where demand is more acute. Any units 
where the Council  accepts a contribution in lieu must be designed to Category M4(2) 
standard, instead of M4(3). The process for securing this contribution, and the amount 
required, will be set out in a revised Inclusive Design SPD . 
 Where the accommodation is provided on two or more floors, an indicative position for 
a through the floor lift must  be shown on plan and a soft spot constructed on site.   
82 
 
 The provisions of Part M take no account of local context in terms of development type 
or density, travel and transport facilities, or the infrastructure (utilities and amenities) 
supporting new or converted residential development, which are important as part of 
holistic consideration of inclusive design . The following requirements will help ensure 
the delivery of inclusive environments, rather than just focusing on inclusive design 
within dwellings. Further information is also provided in the Inclusive Design SPD and 
the Streetbook SPD.  
 Wheelchair housin g units must  be single -storey, as multi -storey wheelchair units 
have significantly increased energy usage due to the need to operate a through -
the-floor lift, which also leads to increased energy costs for occupiers.  
 Wheelchair housing units must  be provided across all tenures and unit sizes, and 
integrated within the development, preferably on the ground floor. Where provided 
above ground floors they must be served by at least two suitable lifts, within the 
common parts, within a convenient dista nce.  
 The overall travel distance between transport drop -off points (e.g. bus stops, car 
parking spaces, car club bays, loading bays), the main entrance of a development, 
and the entrance of each individual dwelling should be kept to a minimum and 
demonstr ably within the reach of ambulant disabled people. There should be a 
maximum total distance of 75 metres from the drop -off point to the dwelling 
entrance.  
 Gates must  be avoided on all entrance routes to buildings. Common entrances 
should be designed in acc ordance with standards set out in Islington’s Inclusive 
Design SPD. Revolving doors are not considered acceptable for any entrances ; 
provision of pass doors adjacent to revolving doors will not make revolving doors 
acceptable, as they create a separation b etween entrances for different users, 
which is not consistent with Local Plan inclusive design objectives and policies.  
 In all residential development, provision for the storage and charging of mobility 
scooters should be provided within communal parts, in  close proximity to lifts, and 
no more than 20m from dwelling entrances. Entrances to mobility scooter stores 
must be step free. All doors must be lightweight  yet secure,  and sufficient turning 
space must be provided  
 Recycling and r efuse stores , bins , post  boxes and other communal facilities must  
be wheelchair accessible and located conveniently within the development, to 
encourage uptake of recycling.  
 London Plan policy D4 sets out minimum internal space standards (in GIA) for new 
residential development, inclusive of space for storage, as well as other specifications 
for private internal space including bedroom sizes; these standards reflect the 
Nationally Described Space Standard. All new residential development in Islington, 
including conv ersions, change s of use and relevant specialist housing identified in 
policies H 6 to H11, must meet these minimum space standards and specifications 
(except ceiling heights, which has a separate locally specific policy). The Council  will 
resist configurations which do no t have identified minimum space standards and 
specifications, as these are not considered to be conducive to high quality design and 
would not provide a good standard of amenity.  
 Units which significantly exceed the minimum space standards will not be con sidered 
to be making optimal use of a site/land, and would therefore not be consistent with 
Local Plan policy H2.  Provision of studies is also considered to be sub -optimal, and 
should not be used as a means to circumvent space standards by subsequently 
utilising as additional bedrooms.  
 Rooms within dwellings, particularly habitable rooms, must  be designed to function 
comfortably and efficiently for their intended purpose, having regard to aspect, outlook,  
83 
 noise, ventilation, privacy and light. Regard should  be had to the ability to adapt 
dwellings to meet changing needs and circumstances in the future, although 
accommodating flexibility does not outweigh the need to meet standards and design 
requirements.  
 Management of  recycling and  waste is an important str ategic issue. Effective 
segregation of recyclable materials by residents and high recycling rates are 
dependent on the provision of convenient, well designed facilities both within the home 
and in common areas.  In order to implement an effective system of waste 
management in Islington, it is essential that new development enables effective  
recycling and  waste  segregation and  collection. All residential developments 
(particularly major developments) must provide appropriate information  which clearly 
demonstr ates how recycling and  waste arising from the occupation of the development 
can be adequately  segregated,  stored, collected and managed, whilst ensuring that 
impacts on amenity are mitigated/prevented; t his sh ould include a specific Recycling 
and Waste Management Strategy where necessary. Applicants must  have regard to 
Council  guidance on Recycling and Refuse Storage Requirements , which includes 
guidance on the level of information that should be provided as pa rt of applications. 
Other relevant bes t practice guidance should be referred to where relevant.  
 Recycling and waste storage facilities should be integrated into new developments, 
both within the home and in communal locations that are accessible to all. Bo th in-
home and communal storage should allow for separate storage of recyclable 
materials. On -site treatment of waste should be investigated for larger developments, 
including consideration of adequate contingency measures in case of any mechanical 
breakdo wns.  
 With regard to ceiling heights, Islington require a minimum floor to ceiling height of at 
least 2.6 metres (between finished floor level and finished ceiling level), for at least 
75% of the GIA of each dwelling. Providing appropriate ceiling heights is an integral 
part of achieving high quality housing, as it is one of the most tangible design elements 
that enables a home to become a comfortable place of retreat. Many modern homes in 
high density housing developments have relatively low ceiling height s of 2.3 metres to 
2.4 metres to maximise the number of floors built at a given building height. The low 
level of public open space and the high -density of built form in Islington means that 
private outdoor space and internal space in the home are even mor e important to 
quality of life (including mental health) than in less densely populated areas. Higher 
ceiling heights provide a greater sense of space and help keep rooms cool in summer 
months. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation 
and may also allow for future adaptability to convert properties to adjust to occupants’ 
changing needs over time, for instance through the installation of ceiling mounted 
hoists.  
 In residential conversions (including extensions), there may  be some flexibility with the 
minimum ceiling heights requirement where the original ceiling height is being 
maintained. In such circumstances, applicants must still ensure that a good standard 
of daylight, natural ventilation and useable floorspace  can be  provided, in line with 
other design requirements.  
 Amenity is an important consideration when determining the quality of housing. The 
design of housing is intrinsically linked to amenity; poor design often means a poor 
standard of amenity for future occupi ers. Amenity can be affected by various factors, 
either individual factors or a combination of factors, including noise, levels of daylight 
and sunlight and the general level of comfort. Policy PLAN1 and t he agent -of-change 
principle set out in policy DH5 enable full consideration of various potential impacts on  
84 
 amenity, where new development is proposed in close proximity to existing residential 
units.  
 Noise and vibration impacts can make dwellings uninhabitable. It is therefore vitally 
important that noi se and vibration impacts are robustly assessed for all planning 
applications involving residential use, at the earliest possible stage of the 
development. Further information is provided in policy DH5.  
 In the first instance, proposals should be sited away  from potential sources of noise 
and vibration, although given the boroughs densely developed nature, this may not 
always be possible. In such cases, noise and vibration impacts should be assessed in 
line with policy DH5. Good acoustic design in and around  new residential development 
should be a key consideration from the earliest possible stage of development 
proposals.  
 Where impacts are identified, they should be mitigated through proposed layout and 
design of a scheme, and through use of appropriate and  effective materials (for 
example, in walls and floors) which dampen noise and vibration between and within 
dwellings, and between dwellings and public and/or communal areas. Layout in 
particular can be effective in mitigating impacts arising from mixed -use developments. 
The layout of adjacent dwellings and the location of lifts and circulation spaces is 
required to limit the transmission of sound to noise sensitive rooms within dwellings. 
Applications which cannot demonstrate effective mitigation for all p roposed residential 
units will be refused. Residential conversions in particular can commonly lead to 
adverse amenity impacts including from noise and vibration; proactive consideration of 
layouts and other issues can help mitigate or prevent these impacts . 
 Applications which cannot demonstrate effective mitigation  of noise and vibration  for 
all proposed residential units will be refused.  
 Dual aspect dwellings have multiple ‘comfort’ benefits, particularly by maximising 
levels of natural light and enabling cross ventilation (and therefore reducing necessity 
for mechanical ventilation). All residential dwellings should be dual aspect. There may 
be legitimate circumstances where dual aspect is impossible or unfavourable, but this 
must  be clearly demonstrated i n line with the policy requirements. Provision of a 
greater quantum of residential units is not considered adequate justification for 
provision of single aspect units.  
 Levels of daylight and sunlight within new residential development, particularly within 
habitable rooms, can be integral to the enjoyment and comfort of a home, and are 
therefore a key factor in what constitutes a high quality home.  
 
A. All new residential development and conversions will be required to provide private 
outdoor space, in the form of gardens (for houses and ground floor maisonettes) or 
balconies (for upper floor dwellings). Any provision must be of a good quality which 
is designed – in terms of its shape, position and location within development 
proposals – to ensure a good level of amenity with regard to daylight and sunlight, 
noise, enclosure, overlooking, privacy and security.   
85 
 B. Glazed ventilated winter gardens may be consi dered an acceptable form of private 
outdoor open space where:  
(i) gardens or balconies would lead to issues of overlooking, either for future 
occupiers of the proposed residential unit or for existing adjacent residential 
units; or  
(ii) gardens or balconies would be likely to experience noise in excess o f relevant 
standard set out in Appendix 2 . 
C. Where winter gardens are acceptable in line with Part B, they must have a drained 
floor and be thermally separated from the interior; and must be of a good quality in 
line w ith considerations set out in Part A.  
D. The minimum requirement for private outdoor space is 5sqm on upper floors and 
15sqm on ground floors , for 1-2 person dwellings. For each additional occupant, an 
extra 1sqm is required on upper floors and an extra 5sqm on ground floors.  
E. Balconies and other private external spaces must  have a depth and width of not 
less than 1.5 metres.  
F. Communal provision of private outdoor space, in lieu of private outdoor space for 
each individual residential unit, will only be acceptable for non-family units, where:  
(i) provision of individual private outdoor space is considered likely to cause 
significant  adverse impacts related to overlooking and noise, both within and 
external to the development;  
(ii) the provision of communal outdoor space would lead to a higher quality scheme 
overall;  
(iii) the level of communal space provided is commensurate with the type and si ze 
of the accommodation and the households it is intended to serve; and  
(iv) access to communal space is not restricted, particularly on basis of the tenure of 
residential units.  
G. Where roofs are utilised to provide private and/or communal outdoor space, 
proposa ls must demonstrate that:  
(i) there are no adverse impacts relating to noise, overlooking and privacy of future 
residential occupiers as well as existing residents adjacent to the site;  
(ii) the space is designed to prevent crime and to ensure that security of residents is 
not compromised; and  
(iii) use of roofs for amenity purposes is balanced with the use for green roofs and 
renewable energy equipment in line with relevant Local Plan policies , through 
careful design which prioritises and integrates the benefits for biodiversity, 
carbon reduction and amenity.  
H. All new build residential developments and, where practicable, residential 
conversions , must  provide step -free access and a level threshold from homes to 
private outdoor space.   
86 
 I. Any basement and/or ground floor un it must  have a defensible space not less than 
1.5 metres in depth in front of any window to a bedroom or habitable room.  
 
 Given the high density built form and low level of open space in Islington, private 
outdoor space is an important factor in providing  good quality housing within the 
borough. Islington one of the lowest amount s of open space of any local authority in 
the country . Many recent new buildings and converted houses do not have access to a 
garden or any other private outdoor space such as a ba lcony or terrace. This is not 
satisfactory as it does not provide space for future occupants to be outdoors in a 
private setting.  
 Policy H5 requires provision of private outdoor space proportionate to the level of 
occupation of proposed dwellings. In a densely built up borough such as Islington, 
ground floor  units  offer the greatest scope to increase provision and ensure that family 
accommodation benefits from a good level of amenity which enables secure and safe 
play by children; therefore, the Council  considers that higher standards should be 
required for ground floor dwellings, which, for avoidance of doubt, includes units fully 
or partly within basements.  
 Houses and ground floor flats maisonet tes should have private gardens. Dwellings on 
upper floors  should all have access to a private balcony, terrace, or (where considered 
acceptable) glazed ventilated winter garden. The standards for upper floor dwellings 
provide sufficient space for either a meal around a small table, clothes drying, or for a 
famil y to sit outside with visitors.  
 It is acknowledged that the provision of individual private outdoor space can be 
challenging on some sites and that accessible, well maintained and managed 
communal provision can provide a workable solution where it would no t be practical to 
provide individual areas for each unit of accommodation. However, even the best 
designed communal spaces do not provide residents with their own private outdoor 
space accessible directly from their home.  Communal spaces in lieu of private  outdoor 
space will only be considered acceptable for non-family units, in line with policy H2 (i.e. 
one-bed units), and where other policy criteria is addressed, including addressing any 
issues regarding overlooking and noise. Where it is acceptable to pr ovide outdoor 
space communally, the total space requirement must  provide a level of communal 
outdoor space commensurate with the type and size of the accommodation and the 
households it is intended to serve.  
 Access to communal space in mixed tenure blocks (i.e. featuring market and 
affordable housing) must  not be restricted on the basis of tenure, unless there are 
demonstrable issues regarding maintenance of communal space which could affect 
the overall provision of affordable housing on a scheme.  
 Roof terr aces/gardens can provide outdoor space (either private space, or communal 
where acceptable) where balconies are not achievable. Larger buildings can have the 
ability to provide both private balconies and communal roof terraces. Using roofs for 
amenity spac e can reduce runoff of rainwater by using plants and soft landscaping to 
capture and store water but there can be a potential conflict in the use of roofs 
between the need for amenity space and the need to create biodiversity -rich green 
roofs and provide s pace for renewable energy generation. High quality design should 
aim to resolve any potential conflicts between creating green roofs, providing 
renewable energy and supplying amenity space on roofs for residents.   
87 
 
 In assessing the quality of private outdoor  space provision in development proposals, 
whether individual or communal areas, the shape and position and how they have 
regard to such matters as daylight and sunlight, noise, enclosure and privacy will be 
considered.  
 Issues of overlooking and noise can be a significant concern with roof terraces and 
balconies, which can also detract from the character of surroundings; careful design 
can reduce this impact. Impact of noise from external noise sources on the quality of 
proposed private outdoor space will be a particular consideration.  
 
A. Proposals involving the  development, redevelopment and/or intensification of 
purpose -built student accommodation will only be permitted on:  
(i) sites allocated for purpose -built student accommodation ; or 
(ii) sites with existing  purpose -built existing student accommodation , subject to 
consistency with other Local Plan policies and additional impacts of 
development being acceptable.  
B. All proposals involving th e development, redevelopment and/or intensification of 
purpose -built student accommodation must ensure a high standard of amenity for 
future occupiers of the development and residents in the surrounding area and must 
meet all the following criteria:  
(i) Provi de high quality accommodation in line with policy H4, including the 
provision of good -sized rooms and communal space in line with relevant space 
standards . General needs units must  be designed to be ‘visitable’ and shared 
facilities must be accessible . A high level of amenity  must be provided, including 
limiting noise impacts and providing  good levels of daylight and sunlight,  and 
natural ventilation ; 
(ii) Ensure that 10% of bedspaces, their associated bathrooms and all common 
parts (including a unisex WC on eve ry floor) are wheelchair accessible  from the 
outset , consistent with relevant guidance and best practice. Where wheelchair 
accessible rooms are located above entrance level, at least two lifts must  be 
provided  (of which one must be  an evacuation lift ), in addition to any 
requirement for a fire -fighting lift ; 
(iii) Provide an ongoing financial contribution (as long as the site is in use as student 
accommodation) towards the provision of student bursaries for students leaving 
Council  care and/or other Islington stu dents facing hardship who are attending a 
higher or further education establishment;  
(iv) Ensure that the development is subject to an appropriate site management and 
maintenance plan;  
(v) Demonstrate, through a  binding  nomination agreement, that the accommodation 
will only be occupied by students of one or more higher education provider(s) . 
Priority must  be given to higher education providers in close proximity to the 
proposed accommodation in the first instance, then those located elsewhere 
within the borough ;  
88 
 (vi) Prevent u se of student accommodation  as general visitor accommodation – 
either short -term or long -term – due to the potential impacts on the safety, 
security and privacy of long -term residents, and the individual and cumulative 
impact on housing supply ; and  
(vii) Provide a t least 35% affordable student accommodation , unless this level of  
provision would affect  other requirements in policy H6, particularly student 
bursaries. In such cases, the level of affordable student  accommodation must  be 
the maximum viable . 
 
 Islington has consistently had the highest rates of student housing delivery in London 
over the past 10 -15 years . Due to th is substantial amount of delivery , as well the need 
to prioritise conventional housing and employment growth  in a borough with severe 
constraints on land , the development of purpose -built student accommodation is 
limited to specific locations, either allocated sites, or, in certain circumstances, 
intensification of existing student accommodation.  
 The delivery o f student accommodation contributes to overall housing delivery based 
on the amount of general housing that is (theoretically) freed up from students residing 
in other forms of accommodation. Previously permitted student accommodation was 
counted towards t he housing target on a 1:1 basis, meaning that one bedspace 
counted as one housing unit for monitoring purposes. Any student accommodation 
permitted following the adoption of the Local Plan should be monitored on a 3:1 basis 
(in line with the London Plan),  meaning every three bedspaces will equate to one unit 
of housing. This makes student accommodation a less optimal use of land than 
conventional housing, which can manage the same, if not greater delivery levels but 
with the benefit of meeting a broad er range of needs.  
 It is important that student accommodation is high quality, in line with Local Plan 
policies which look to secure high quality housing, including policy H4 ; this includes 
requirements relating to daylight and sunlight and noise. Bedrooms and separate 
communal/amenity areas must  reflect relevant space standards. Kitchen, washing and 
utility facilities should meet environmental health requirements.  
 To ensure purpose -built student accommodation follows inclusive design principles, 
general needs bedrooms must  be ‘visitable’ while shared facilities must  be accessible. 
A wheelchair accessible toilet must  be provided on every floor. Buildings must  also be 
designed and built to accommodate robust emergency evacuation procedures for all 
building users,  including those who require level access. Further guidance is provided 
in the Inclusive Design SPD.  
 Site management and maintenance is considered key to successful student 
accommodation and will be secured by legal agreement. This must cover matters such 
as provision of on -site wardens, use of communal facilities, elimination of potential 
noise nuisance, recycling facilities, the approach to security and safety for students 
and the management of anti -social behaviour. To better inform determination of 
proposals for purpose -built student accommodation, a site management  and 
maintenance plan must  be submitted at the earliest possible stage , ideally at pre -
application stage.  A condition will be imposed on all student accommodation 
permissions requiring adheren ce to the management plan.  
 All purpose built student accommodation must be accompanied by a nomination 
agreement, which will be secured by legal agreement. A nomination agreement 
ensures that accommodation will only be occupied by students of one or more h igher  
89 
 education provider(s ). Priority must  be given to higher education providers in close 
proximity to the proposed accommodation in the first instance, then those located  
elsewhere within the borough, then those outside the borough . The agreement must  
apply for as long as the student accommodation is in use.  
 Restrictions will be imposed to ensure that the whole scheme is retained as an 
individual unit of student accommodation. The use of student accommodation or any 
part of a scheme as general visitor accommodation at any time (including temporary 
use outside term time) is considered unsuitable. This could have a significant impact 
on local housing supply by removing units from the housing market for certain periods. 
There are also potential amenity issues for longer -term student occupants, particularly 
related  to noise, safety and security issues. Use of student accommodation for 
ancillary purposes – for example conference delegates, interns on university 
placements, and students on short -term education courses  – may be acceptable . 
However, this must  be demonst rably linked  to a higher education provider with a 
nomination agreement for the student accommodation in question. The ancillary use  
must  not disrupt the accommodation of the longer -term resident students , either  during 
or outside their academic year ; any suggested ancillary use of a scale which is likely to 
cause such disruption would constitute a material change and therefore  would not be 
classed as ancillary and  may require planning permission . 
 All new student accommodation, including any extension/inten sification to existing built 
or permitted schemes, is required to contribute funding for bursaries. The bursaries will 
help increase access to higher and further education and tackle worklessness by 
providing funding for bursaries for students leaving Coun cil care and other Islington 
students facing hardship who are attending a higher or further education 
establishment. The funding provided by the development will be an annual payment, 
equivalent to 2.4%17 of the total annual rental income from a development  of student 
accommodation for thirty years or as long as the site is used for student 
accommodation, whichever is the shorter period of time.  
 The London Plan requires provision of 35% affordable student accommodation. 
Islington support this in principle, but the clear priority is for the provision of student 
bursaries. All new student accommodation, including any extension/intensification to 
existing built or permitted schemes, should provide both student bursaries and 
affordable student accommodation , the latter to be provided in line with London Plan 
policy H17. However, where evidence suggests that full delivery of both  requirements  
is not financially viable, the requirement for student bursaries will take precedence. 
Given the extreme inequality in Isli ngton related to long term worklessness and other 
factors, bursaries are much more likely to have a meaningful positive impact by 
offering education opportunities to local young people.  
  
A. The need for accommodation for older people will be met primarily through delivery 
of conventional residential accommodation designed to be adaptable to changing 
needs over time. Different levels of care may be delivered in conventional 
                                                
17 This amount may be updated through a SPD, based on any updated evidence.

 accommodation  which  means there is no need for certain specialist forms of older 
persons housing, in particular market extra care housing.  
B. There is  some  local need for affordable  one and two -bed extra -care units. This 
specific type of specialist older persons accommodation m ay be acceptable on 
certain schemes, but only where the Council ’s Adult Social Care  service  consider 
that the proposed accommodation would meet a defined need.  
C. Specialist C3 and non -C3 older peoples residential accommodation such as care 
homes and extra ca re facilities will only be suitable where:  
(i) there is an evidence of  local unmet need for specialist older people 
accommodation ; 
(ii) affordable housing is provided in line with policy H3;  
(iii) it has adequately considered and addressed all design issues in Part D or Part E 
to ensure the accommodation is suitable for the intended occupiers ; 
(iv) it provides the necessary level of supervision, management and care/support , 
which is secured in a legal agreement ; 
(v) it is easily accessible to public transport, shops, services and community 
facilities appropriate to the needs of the intended occupiers; and  
(vi) It constitutes a suitable use for the site considering the surrounding 
neighbourhood, potential for development of other priority land uses and its 
contribution to mixed and balan ced communities.  
D. Extra care proposals will be usually classed as a C3 use. Such proposals must  
demonstrate that the following design issues have been considered and addressed 
to ensure the accommodation is suitable for the intended occupiers:  
(i) The proposal is for p rovision of self -contained units  (or at least en -suite private 
rooms which meet or exceed minimum space standards ) which  address es 
other requirements for private internal space;  
(ii) There is appropriate p rivacy of internal spaces in the building for re levant 
groups, namely residents and any staff accommodation/rooms;  
(iii) Appropriate bathrooms, kitchen/laundry facilities and appropriate rooms for 
activities/therapy/ community use  are provided ; 
(iv) Appropriate wheelchair accessibility  is provided  in line with policy H4;  
(v) Good quality guest and/or staff accommodation  (where appropriate)  is 
provided  in line with minimum space standards, with sufficient storage space 
and facilities for visitors and staff;  
(vi) Servicing access and a safe drop off point is within 50m of the main entrance 
in line with H4 ; and 
(vii) Provision of suitable charging points for mobility scooters  is included on -site – 
with a minimum standard of secure scooter storage and charging facilities 
equivalent to 25% of dwellings . 
E. Care homes must  demonstrate that the following design issues have been 
considered and addressed to ensure the accommodation is suitable for the intended 
occupiers:   
91 
 (i) There is appropriate privacy of internal spaces in the building for relevant 
groups, namely residents and staff ; 
(ii) 100% of all habitable ro oms are  wheelchair accessible ; 
(iii) Accommodation  is provided  in line with relevant design guidance and best 
practice standards ; 
(iv) Servicing access and a safe drop off point is provided within 50m of the main 
entrance . This must be appropriate for amb ulance/mini bus drop -off; and  
(v) Provision of accessible communal outdoor space for use by residents, staff and 
visitors of a good quality and which is designed – in terms of its shape, position 
and location within development  proposals – to ensure a good level of amenity 
with regard to daylight and sunlight, noise, enclosure, overlooking, privacy and 
security.  
F. The Council  will resist development which involves the loss of floorspace in 
specialist older peoples accommodation unless:  
(i) adequa te replacement on -site accommodation will be provided that satisfies 
Part D or Part E; or  
(ii) adequate replacement accommodation is provided elsewhere in the borough 
that satisfies Part D or Part E; or  
(iii) the applicant can robustly demonstrate that there is a sur plus over a long -term 
of this housing type in Islington; and  it can be demonstrated that the existing 
accommodation is unsatisfactory for modern standards and/or not fit for 
purpose.  
 
 Islington is expected to experience growth in its older population as part of the long 
term trend in population growth18. However, t he proportion of older people in Islington 
is currently below the London and UK average ; this is not projected to change 
substantially and it will likely remain below the London average for the f oreseeable 
future . Older people ’s needs vary with the majority expected to remain housed in 
existing housing stock, with some demand for down -sizing in response to changing 
lifestyle. Demand for various types of accommodation for vulnerable older people 
exists and new specialist accommodation may be appropriate in certain 
circumstances . Extra care accommodation  will not be supported as a priority due to its 
cost, which is often inflated due to provision of ‘luxury’ communal facilities that are not 
a necessa ry component of care.  
 Accommodation for older people will be met through conventional housing designed to 
be adaptable/wheelchair accessible, in line with policy H4. More specialist 
accommodation (with varying elements of care) may also contribute to meeti ng some 
vulnerable older peoples ’ need where it is affordable. The future accommodation 
needs for older people are considered in the SHMA which demonstrates varying levels 
of need depending on the base data.  The London Plan contains a benchmark which is 
intended to help inform a local level assessment, however it is considered that the only 
local solution is to meet most of this need through conventional housing with some 
exceptions for affordable extra care units to meet defined local need  (the quantum o f 
which will be informed by relevant up -to-date evidence produced by the Council ). 
Where affordable extra care units are deemed acceptable (only through engagement 
                                                
18 An older person in Isling ton (for the purposes of policy H7) is  defined as 75 or over.   
92 
 with the Council ’s Adult Social Care  service ), provision will be offset against affordable 
housing requirements of a scheme.  
 The London Borough of Islington Housing Strategy sets out the intention that the 
borough will increase levels of independence both for older people and various other 
groups of dependent people. For older people this include s both physical adaptations 
and improvements within the home in combination with other social measures of 
support such as care services, in order to sustain people in their own homes for as 
long as possible. More general levels of accessibility in the wide r public realm is also 
an issue and can also help enable people to remain in their homes for longer; policies 
which make streets more liveable can help to remedy this. Islington has a strong 
record in delivering accessible development.  
 The range of specia list housing designed for older people can be referred to under 
various terms including sheltered housing/accommodation, extra care 
housing/accommodation, and residential/nursing care homes. Supported housing for 
other vulnerable groups is covered under po licy H9 below. Islington will consider which 
Use Class a proposal falls into on case -by-case basis, although extra care facilities will 
generally be considered to be C3 use unless they include a significant element of care . 
Regardless of whether extra care  facilities are determined to be a C2 or C3 use (or Sui 
Generis  use which could also be justified in principle ), relevant policy requirements 
including affordable housing will apply . Development proposals must provide details 
of: 
 care aspects, including qu alifying age, entry criteria, minimum expected numbers 
of care hours per week and the proportion of residents expected to need different 
levels of care; and  
 how the facilities are to be funded and managed.  
  The Council  will consider the use of Section 106 agreements to secure:  
 the involvement of a registered Care Quality Commission care provider in the 
delivery of care;  
 the availability of 24 -hour care services for residents to receive/purchase from an 
on-site team according to their needs;  
 the receipt of a  minimum packag e of care services as a requirement  for 
occupation;  and 
 a minimum age of occupants.  
 To ensure high quality accommodation is provided the design of specialist residential 
accommodation for older people (including new build, conversions and ex tensions) 
must  demonstrate it has considered  and addressed a number of key design aspects. 
To ensure appropriate privacy for residents, elements of a building should be ranked 
on a scale of ascending privacy , with the most public spaces close to either main 
entrances or centrally located , and the private dwellings the farthest away from the 
main entrance. There should be separation between areas just for residents, staff and 
visitors with a distinction between  shared spaces. Provision of communal spaces must  
be proportionate to the scale of the accommodation and not excessive , optimising the 
accommodation for residents whilst maintaining the usability of the communal spaces.   
93 
 
 Suitable bathrooms, storage space fo r equipment and appropriate rooms for activities 
must  be provided. Providing and retaining storage space is important for mobility 
scooters, hoists and other equipment both in existing accommodation and new 
provision. In particular, extra care should provi de sufficient charging points for 
scooters, equivalent to 25% of dwellings. Likewise,  conversions involving  loss of 
activity rooms /amenity rooms would also need to be justified.  
 When determining applications for specialist forms of older people’s accommod ation, 
the Council  may take account of detailed standards and design guidance including 
(but not limited to) the following documents or any appropriate successor documents:  
 The design and build of successful extra care housing – Housing LIN19 
 Building bette r care homes for adults – Care Inspectorate20; and 
 Extra Care Housing Development planning, control and management – RTPI 
Good Practice Note 821 
 
A. Proposals including Self -build and Custom build unit(s) must : 
(i) meet an identified need for self -build or custom housebuilding as identified on 
the Islington self -build and custom housebuilding register;  
(ii) make the most efficient use of land, optimising the number of residential unit(s)  
and level of density  that would be expected given the site size, context and 
layout;  
(iii) provide high quality homes in line with policy H4;  
(iv) provide affordable housing in line with policy H3 (either on -site or off -site 
contribution depending on proposed number of net additional  homes); and  
(v) comply  with other relevant  policies including  sustainable design policies . 
 
 
 Islington has a duty to keep a register of demand for self-build and custom 
housebuilding , and have regard to that register when undertaking planning, housing, 
regeneration or land disposal functions. To be eligible for the register, individuals and 
associations must demonstrate  that they meet certain eligibility conditions. Islington’s 
self-build and custom housebuilding register is divided into two parts:

  Part 1 keeps track of local demand for self -build and custom housebuilding which 
must be met via the grant of sufficient development permissions for serviced plots 
of land . 
 Part 2 keeps track  of general demand for self -build and custom build, with no 
requirement to grant sufficient development permissions for serviced plots of land 
to meet this demand.  
 Self-build generally refers to homes built by an individual to their own  specification . 
Custom-build  generally refers to bespoke homes built by a third party  for occupation by 
specific individuals or an association of people . 
 
 LPAs  should use their registers as evidence of demand when developing their Local 
Plan and associated documents. The Isli ngton SHMA considered  the demand for self -
build and identifie d that whilst there is some interest, it is only a very limited number of 
people and a very small proportion of the overall housing need identified for the 
borough. Therefore , whilst the Council  is supportive of self -build and custom build in 
principle , it does not consider that it will make a significant contribution to meeting 
housing need in the borough. Given the highly urbanised context, with a constrained 
supply of land, high land costs and  the need to make efficient use of sites, the 
potential for people to acquire sites to build their own homes  – which is the 
fundamental goal of the legislation – is likely to be very limited.  
 
A. The Council  will support the pr ovision of new supported housing where:  
(i) it meets an identified need, including larger -than-local need;  
(ii) it is suitable for the intended occupiers in terms of the standard of facilities and 
the level of independence, and provide s the necessary level of supe rvision, 
management and care/support. Regard must  be had to Policy H4 and any best 
practice standards  that the Council  considers relevant and which are  related to 
the specific type of accommodation and the people/groups it is targeted to;  and 
(iii) there is easy  access to public transport, shops, services and community facilities 
appropriate to the needs of the intended occupiers . 
B. The Council  will resist the loss of supported housing unless:  
(i) adequate replacement accommodation  of the same quality and quantity  will be 
provided for the particular group;  
(ii) it can be demonstrated that the accommodation is no longer needed for the 
particular group or other relevant groups in need of supported housing; or  
(iii) it can be demonstrated that the accommodation is not fit for purpose for its 
current use or other relevant types of supported housing.  
  
95 
 
 The purpose of supported housing is to enable people  with specific needs  to live as 
independently as possible within their community, with a real focus on social inclusion. 
Provisi on of  a wide range of supported housing types is likely to be necessary over the 
plan period, including permanent, long term and shorter term accommodation  which 
meet s temporary need. Th is can include foyer accommodation for young people, 
refuges, and long -term accommodation for people with ongoing support needs. The 
wide range of supported housing types may also include accommodation referred to 
as hostels (which may or may not have an element of care, but are distinct from visitor 
accommodation hostels). In planning use class terms, supported housing may be 
considered Sui Generis, C2 or C3 and would usually be considered exempt from  (or 
be provided instead of)  affordable housing requirements.  
 Supported housing may be acceptable as part of a mixed -use deve lopment, although 
where a proposal involves more sensitive  types of supported housing , this may not be 
appropriate . 
 Islington will consider supported housing to be any housing scheme where housing, 
support and  (where relevant ) care services are provided (o r are capable of being 
provided) as an integrated package. Some schemes are long -term, designed for 
people who need ongoing support to live independently. Other, semi -independent 
living options are designed to help people develop the emotional and practica l skills 
needed to move into more mainstream housing and provide varying levels of support. 
Support can include help with health needs, including mental health, drug and alcohol 
use, managing benefits and debt, developing daily living skills and accessing 
education, training and employment. Supported housing provision may be necessary 
for a range of people/groups22 including:  
 people with Mental Health Problems  
 people with Learning Disabilities  
 people with a Physical or Sensory Disability  
 single Homeless with  Support Needs  
 people with Alcohol Problems  
 people with Drug Problems  
 offenders or People at risk of Offending  
 mentally Disordered Offenders  
 young People at Risk  
 young People leaving Care  
 women at Risk of Domestic Violence  
 people with HIV/AIDS  
 homeless Fam ilies with Support Needs  
 refugees  
 teenage Parents  
 rough Sleepers  
 
 Existing supported housing will be protected where need exists and the 
accommodation remains suitable, unless it is adequately replaced. Adequate 
replacement can occur on -site or off -site and will be considered in terms of both the 
quality and quantity of accommodation replaced , in line with relevant best practice 
standards and the ability/need to provide continuation of a service. Off -site 
                                                
22 The relevant policy for accommodation related to older people, which may include housing which 
could be referred to as supported housing, is policy H7.   
96 
 replacement may be acceptable but will depend on the quality of new replacement 
location and its accessibility.  
 There will be a need for proposals to demonstrate where accommodation is no longer 
needed for particular groups. This should be considered at both a local and a sub -
regional level to ensure that varying changes in provision at a wider scale are 
considered. Chang es in service delivery can render accommodation outdated and no 
longer fit for purpose. Where loss of such accommodation is proposed, this must be 
evidenced including information which shows that refurbishment is not possible. 
Accommodation must be proven to be not fit for purpose for the existing specific 
supported housing and for other relevant types of supported housing which could 
reasonably occupy the accommodation. In some cases , a replacement development 
may provide units  meeting different  supported housing needs which fall within different 
use classes.  
 Proposals involving the loss of existing supported housing must  take every opportunity 
to meet unmet need(s) for other relevant types of supported housing. There are a 
range of supported housing need(s ) which will need to be considered, with differing 
design considerations to be taken account to assess the feasibility of utilising existing 
provision. Consultation with the Council s Housing department, Adult Social Care 
department and/or Children’s Servic es department must occur as part of e videncing 
meeting unmet need.  
 
A. The Council  will support the provision of new small -scale HMOs where they:  
(i) do not  give rise to any significant adverse amenity impact(s) on the surrounding 
neighbourhood;  
(ii) do not result in the loss of existing larger family housing (3 -bed units or more); 
and 
(iii) provide a good quality of accommodation within non -self-contained units, 
consis tent with policy H4 and other HMO best practice standards.  
B. Proposals involving the loss of good quality HMOs will be resisted, unless the 
replacement use meets an acute need identified by Islington Council ’s housing 
department, particularly genuinely affo rdable housing.  
C. Proposals for large -scale HMOs will generally be refused as they limit capacity to 
deliver conventional housing, limit the ability to secure genuinely affordable housing 
tenures and are not considered to be a sustainable model of residenti al 
development in line with Local Plan objectives. On sites w here the Council  
considers that large -scale HMOs may be an  acceptable form of housing in principle , 
proposals must:  
(i) prevent  any significant adverse amenity impact(s) on the surrounding 
neighbourhood. Sufficient evidence – including a detailed management plan – 
must be provided;   
97 
 (ii) be consistent with all relevant parts of policy H2 and H4. With regard to 
minimum space standards, l iving space and communal space must be 
comfortable and functional for the needs of tenants and must include adequate 
space for storage;  
(iii) Ensure that 10% of bedspaces, their associated bathrooms and all common 
parts (including a unisex WC on every floor) are  wheelchair accessible from the 
outset, consistent with relevant guidance and best practice. Where wheelchair 
accessible rooms are located above entrance level, at least two lifts must be 
provided (of which one must be an evacuation lift), in addition to a ny 
requirement for a fire -fighting lift;  
(iv) provide on -site genuinely  affordable housing  in line with policy H3. Cash in lieu 
payments will not be acceptable in any circumstances;  and 
(v) provide appropriate and accessible communal facilities and services.  
 
 
 There are various definitions associated with the term ‘House in Multiple Occupation ’ 
(HMO). Within Islington, an HMO is defined as residential property that takes the form 
of shared houses, flats and non -self-contained units/housing let to three or more 
unrelated tenants who form two or more households and share a kitchen, bathroom or 
toilet. Households are families, including single persons and co -habiting couples. In 
terms of planning use class, there are two scales of HMO. A small -scale HMO (Use 
Class C 4) is where between 3 and 6 unrelated people share basic amenities such as a 
kitchen or bathroom. All other HMO are considered large -scale HMO and are classed 
as a sui generis use. Large scale HMO are sometimes called co -living or shared living.  
 There is a  permitted development right to allow change of use betwee n conventional 
self-contained housing in Use Class C3 and small -scale HMO in Use Class C4. If it 
becomes apparent that this permitted development right is impacting the mix and 
balance of uses in an  area, and/or is causing significant amenity impacts for local 
residents then the Council  will consider removing this permitted development.  
 In accordance with housing legislation, the Council ’s Environmental Health team 
licences some HMOs. Agreed minimum standards for room sizes and the provision of 
kitchens and bathrooms are used to determine the maximum number of occupiers and 
households for an HMO licence. These were designed as minimum standards to 
protect the health of occupants in existing property b y ensuring adequate facilities and 
space for the number of people a HMO is licensed for. In the case of new 
development, the Council  considers that the higher space standards set out in the 
policy are eminently deliverable . For planning purposes, the minim um standards will 
be a relevant consideration for all HMOs, not just HMOs which trigger the licensing 
requirements.  
 The loss of good quality HMOs will be resisted. Good quality HMOs are those that 
provide sufficient internal space, provide occupants with a  reasonable standard of 
amenity, and do not give rise to significant adverse amenity impacts to the adjacent 
and/or surrounding residential neighbourhood. The Council  will exercise a general 
presumption in favour of protecting HMOs that could be improved t o meet standards 
without conversion . The Council ’s Environmental Health team will be consulted on a 
case -by-case basis, to assist with determining what constitutes ‘good quality’.   
98 
 
 Large -scale HMOs will be refused unless they can demonstrate to the Council  that on-
site genuinely  affordable housing can be secured ; and that they are not constraining 
the delivery of conventional residential uses. Evidence  must  also be provided to 
demonstrate that there is actual demand for what is currently a niche style of 
accommodation that, while attractive to some limited parts of the population, is unlikely 
to be sustainable model of development in the long term  (especially for a range of 
household types including families) , and hence could lead to land in Islington 
effect ively being wasted if demand for such accommodation was to reduce in future.  
 Where large -scale HMOs meet initial policy requirements and are acceptable in 
principle, proposals will need to address specific criteria, including provision of on -site 
genuinel y affordable housing in line with policy H3. The large -scale HMO format would 
in such cases be the format  for the private/market element of housing; the affordable 
provision must  be conventional self -contained units. Due to the style  and operation  of 
large -scale HMO accommodation, pepper -potting of affordable provision with HMO 
units will not be appropriate. Affordable housing must  therefore be separate to the 
HMO units, including separate access. Tenure blind principles must be adhered to, 
alongside other relevant Local Plan policies including policy H4. Sites which cannot 
provide separate affordable housing ( e.g. due to constraints with site size, inabilit y to 
provide multiple cores ) will not be considered acceptable for large -scale HMO use, and 
will be re fused.  
 For avoidance of doubt, large -scale HMOs cannot be seen as affordable 
accommodation. Comparisons between the rental cost for an HMO bedspace and 
conventional housing (Use Class C3) should not be made on the basis of units, given 
that the space and l iving quality of HMOs can be drastically different. Comparisons are 
only relevant on a per square metre basis, which means that disparity of size is 
factored in. Where non -standard communal facilities are provided, these must be 
discounted from any compari sons with conventional housing costs.  
 Living space and communal space must be comfortable and functional for the needs 
of tenants and must  include adequate space for storage . What constitutes comfortable 
and functional will be determined on a case -by-case basis, but relevant Environmental 
Health standards and private internal space standards set out in the London Plan will 
be used as a reference point.  Relevant parts of policy H4 will also apply when 
assessing the standard of proposed applications. The Inclusive Design SPD and 
BS8300:2018 (Part 2) will also be important considerations, alongside other guidance 
and/or best practice which the Council  considers is relevant.  
 The a chievement of mixed and balanced communities is a key objective of the Local 
Plan; it is important for maintaining community cohesion, diversity and character. New 
housing development can have a significant impact on the achievement of mixed and 
balanced communities, and relatively high cost tenures like large -scale HMOs can 
potentially lead to residential enclaves shut off from the community at large ; co-
living/shared living is often advocated as a way of facilitating communal interaction, but 
this should apply to the wider community not just those living within the development . 
Proposal s for large -scale HMOs must contribute positively to the mix and balance of 
uses in an area and demonstrate that any adverse amenity impacts on the 
surrounding neighbourhoods and communities are prevented.  
 A detailed  management plan is essential, to preven t adverse amenity impacts on the 
surrounding area and also to ensure that the development is properly managed. A 
management plan must be submitted as early as possible, ideally at pre -application 
stage. All large -scale HMOs must be managed by a single comp any/organisation with 
minimum six -month tenancy lengths; shorter tenancies risk damaging any sense of  
99 
 community through constant turnover of residents. They also blur the lines between 
short -term let accommodation, turning large -scale HMOs in de facto host els/visitor 
accommodation which would further undermine the ability to genuinely meet housing 
need .  
 The management plan must set out how the HMO element of the development will 
interact with on -site genuinely affordable housing, in addition to details on how all 
other facets of the development will operate, from move -in and move -out 
arrangements and maintenance of communal areas, to staffing and security 
arrangements and responsibilities. The exact scope of a management plan must be 
agreed with the Council  on a case -by-case basis. Where applications for large -scale 
HMOs are permitted, adherence to the provisions set out in the management plan will 
be secured through S106 agreement.  
 Kitchens, amenity space (internal and external) and laundry facilities are c onsidered 
appropriate, essential communal facilities for large -scale HMOs. Provision of non -
standard  ‘luxury’  communal facilities  – such as swimming pools, cinemas, gyms – 
which inflate development costs will not be considered an acceptable reason for any 
policy non -compliance  with regard to any other aspect of the development, particularly 
affordable housing .  
 
A. The Council  considers that  the purpose built Private Rented Se ctor (PRS) 
development model does not  have a role in meeting identified housing need in 
Islington . Proposals for purpose built (PRS) development will not be permitted 
unless  they comply with all of the following criteria:  
(i) There will be no adve rse impacts on local amenity ; 
(ii) On-site genuinely affordable housing is provided in line with policy H3. 
Affordable Private Rent (APR) is not considered to be an acceptable affordable 
housing tenure;  
(iii) High quality housing is provided in line with policy H4. All units must  be self -
containe d and let separately ; 
(iv) The PRS units are held under a covenant for the lifetime of the building, 
generally no less than 50 years. The covenant will be strictly enforced and must  
not allow any provision for general market sale of any units (either individual ly or 
as a group of units), for the length of the covenant period;  
(v) A clawback mechanism is put in place to ensure that the maximum amount of 
affordable housing is provided on -site where the covenant is broken 
(notwithstanding criterion iv);  
(vi) Unified managem ent and unified ownership of the development is guaranteed  
throughout the covenant period;    
100 
 (vii)  Longer tenancies (three years or more) are available to all tenants. The tenancy 
process should give security to the renter, with appropriate break clauses and 
transparency on rent increases enshrined in the tenancy agreement. Upfront 
fees during the letting process must  not be charged, except for security deposits 
and upfront rent payments.  
 
 For the purposes of policy H11 , Purpose Built Private Rented Sector deve lopment 
(commonly known as ‘Build to Rent’) relates to a specific business model where non-
owner -occupied self -contained dwellings are built with the intention of  being rented out 
(rather than sold)  from the outset23. These developments often claim to have ‘distinct 
economics’ due to the fact that they are rented not sold, which in turn is used as an 
argument for a more flexible approach to policy requirements including provision of 
affordable housing.  
 The schemes are intended for institutional investors as a means to increase housing 
supply through varying the housing product mix and stimulating a faster delivery rate. 
Both the Government and Mayor have supported provision of more private rented 
homes and a more positi ve approach in enabling purpose -built PRS to contribute to 
the achievement of housing targets.  
 However,  there is little evidence to suggest that the reasons  which underpin regional 
and national policy support for purpose built private rent exist in Islington. Therefore, 
this form of housing would not be the best use of the limited land available in the 
borough,  and is inconsistent with the strategic aims of the Local Plan. There  is no 
evidence of significant medium to long -term issue s of housing d elivery  in the borough, 
nor is there evidence of issue s of poor absorption rates . Sales values are strong; with 
no shortage of investors but there is a shortage of land.  In other words, the purpose 
built PRS development model has been invented to solve pro blems which do not exist 
in Islington. In addition, the private rented market in Islington is very strong and the 
borough has a high proportion of private rented accommodation in terms of overall 
housing stock.  
 As set out in Policy H3 , APR at high percenta ges of market rent will also not be 
acceptable as part of any ‘Build to Rent’ development, as they would not contribute 
toward meeting identified housing need and would validate the perception that ‘Build to 
Rent’ is a wasted opportunity for conventional h ousing which could provide more 
priority affordable tenures such as social rent.  
 Purpose built PRS must  provide genuinely affordable housing  in line with policy H3 , 
including the required tenure mix which prioritises social rented accommodation. The 
purpos e built PRS business model is not an acceptable excuse for not meeting these 
policy requirements; for example, PRS schemes can be designed with separate cores  
to allow for delivery of social rented accommodation. Pu rpose built PRS developments 
which do not  provide the required proportion and tenure split of affordable housing will 
be refused.  
 In addition, developers must enter into a covenant to ensure that PRS schemes 
commit to provide rental accommodation for the lifetime of the building, during which 
                                                
23 Policy H 11 does not aim to restrict market housing being rented privately; it aims to prevent a 
specific business model (purpose built PRS) being used to undermine affordable housing and other 
policy requirements. To clarify, the Council  has no issue with the mark et element of a scheme being 
rented privately, and are not seeking to restrict this.   
101 
 period no sales out of the covenant will be allowed. In exceptional circumstances, 
where it is agreed that sale out of the covenant can take place, this will only be 
suitable where it involves sale of all PRS units. Such a break in the covenant will 
trigger a  clawback mechanism requiring the maximum reasonable amount of 
affordable housing, in line with the Local Plan affordable housing requirements. The 
clawback must  provide for provision on -site by identifying specific units that will be 
converted to genuinel y affordable housing , which reflects the tenure split set out in 
policy H3, particularly social rented housing. Provision of clawback through financial 
contributions is generally not acceptable.  
 Section 106 agreements and covenants should be carefully wor ded in order that the 
construction of the units would be VAT zero -rated; affordable housing units will not be 
subject to a minimum covenant period and will always be secured in perpetuity.  
 Ensuring housing quality is just as important for PRS development as for conventional 
market housing. All requirements set out in policy H4, including minimum space 
standards, will need to be complied with along with other policies in the Local Plan 
such as those requiring car -free development and cycle parking.  
 
A. To meet the identified  maximum need for 1 0 Gypsy and Traveller pitches, the  
Council will seek to provide a site(s) for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation  
through:  
(i) use of its own sites identified as part the Council’s  ongoing housebuilding 
programme; and/or  
(ii) joint work ing with the GLA and other boroughs to determine scope for 
accommodating need on a sub -regional basis ; and/or  
(iii) a potential review of Site Allocations  where need is not met through Part A(i) 
and/or (ii) . 
B. In the absence of a particular site allocation (s) to meet defined need, the following 
criteria  will apply  to any windfall sites which come forward during the plan period, 
including any sites identified under Part A(i) . Any site proposed in order to meet a n 
identified  need must:  
(i) have suitable access for the type of vehicles that could reasonably be expected 
to use the site;  
(ii) be able to  provide basic a menities, including water and sewerage;  
(iii) provide a good level of residential amenity, in line with relevant policy  
requirements set out in policy H4;  
(iv) not have any relevant pre -existing policy designations that restrict the use of the 
site, including green infrastructure  such as Metropolitan O pen Land; and   
102 
 (iv) the site is not allocated for other uses, e.g. conventional hou sing, offices.  
 
 There is no history of need  for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation in Islington, aside 
from some families in permanent accommodation who consider themselves to be 
Gypsies/Travellers and may need to return to non -fixed accommodation in the f uture.  
 The definition applied to Gypsies and Travellers makes a significant difference in terms 
of the assessment of accommodation needs. The definition set out in the 
Government’s Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) excludes certain groups of 
Gypsi es and Travellers, for example those who have ceased to travel permanently. 
However, the London Plan definition includes those who currently live in bricks and 
mortar dwelling households whose existing accommodation is unsuitable for them, by 
virtue of the ir cultural preference not to live in bricks and mortar accommodation. The 
London Plan definition also considers those who, on grounds of their own or their 
family’s or dependants’ educational or health needs or old age, have ceased to travel 
temporarily o r permanently. The effect of these different definitions has been 
considered as part of the Council’s Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Asse ssment 
(2019).  
 Previously  the council has worked with the Greater London Authority on a pan London 
study, the Londo n Boroughs’ Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation N eeds Assessment 
2008.  The council considers that the assessment of need is best done at the sub -
regional level, which would better reflect the constraints and current level of provision 
in individual boroughs.  The majority of need for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation is 
focused in Outer London.  
 The London Plan policy H16 states that boroughs should meet the identified need for 
Gypsy and Traveller accommodation , based on a figure of need identified in a needs 
assessment. The Council will seek to identify a site(s) to meet the identified  need for 
10 pitches identified in the 2019 assessment, which is based on the London Plan 
definition rather than the more restrictive PPTS definition.  The need  is for 8 pitches by 
2025 with a further two pitches required by 203 5 (based on newly forming families on 
existing sites on the assumption that the initial need by 202 5 is met and sites are 
provided).  
 In the first instance, the council will seek to identify a si te through its ongoing 
housebuilding programme.  The 2019 assessment sets out factors to consider when 
identifying sites  which are likely to pose particular challenges given the borough’s 
densely developed context, e.g. sites would not be sought between tow er blocks, 
which potentially rules out a number of council -owned sites.  
 Depending on the scale of accommodation that can be met through council site, there 
may be further sites needed to meet the full need of 1 0 pitches, which could be met 
through a focus ed review of the Site Allocations document, and/or by working sub -
regionally with other boroughs  and the GLA . The policy also sets out assessment 
criteria for any windfall applications for Gypsy and Traveller accommodation , which 
would apply to future appl ications for sites on council owned or privately owned land . 
 The 2019 assessment identifies  that the need  is entirely  from members of the Gypsy 
and Travellers community who live in permanent ‘bricks and mortar’ accommodation, 
including social housing in Islington. Therefore, this theoretical need may not translate 
to real need in practice. Some of the need identified aris es from individuals in social 
rented accommodation; therefore, the council is, on one hand, already meeting the  
103 
 needs of these individuals. The identified need in the 2019 assessment is not ‘new’ 
need; it is need for a different form of accommodation determined by the preference of 
Gypsies and Travellers living in ‘bricks and mortar’ accommodation, as stated at the 
point in time when the interviews which informed the assessment were undertaken.  
 Regardless of t hese issues, t he local needs assessment recognises that, in an Inner 
London borough such as Islington, the shortage of land and the need to optimise 
development potential; high land values; and acute need for social rented housing, 
present significant chal lenges in meeting this need.  
 The 2019 assessment  also considered the accommodation needs of Travelling 
Showpeople and boat dwellers. It concluded that there is no need for Travelling 
Showpeople plots within Islington, but found that there is a need for so me 
accommodation for boat dwellers. The Council is committed to ongoing engagement 
with the Canal and River Trust to meet this need. The Regent’s Canal crosses two 
Spatial Strategy areas – King’s Cross and Pentonville Road ( covered by Policy SP2), 
and City  Road ( covered by Policy BC4 of the Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP). Policies 
SP2 and BC4 both set out criteria to assess residential moorings.  
. 
104 
 A. The Council  will support proposals to provide new and/or extended social and 
community infrastructure facilities and their co -location with other social and 
community uses, subject to an assessment against all relevant Local Plan policies.  
B. Social and community infras tructure will be funded through the CIL and/or section 
106 planning obligations (as appropriate). In addition, new and/or extended on -site 
provision of social and community infrastructure may be required as part of the 
supporting infrastructure for signifi cant new housing and mixed -use development 
proposals, in order to mitigate the impacts of the development on local services and 
meet the needs of occupiers.  
C. Where new and/or extended social and community infrastructure is provided on -site 
it must be designed in line with criteria in part G.  
D. The Council  will not permit any loss of social and community infrastructure uses 
unless:  
(i) a replacement facility is provided on -site. Any facility must be of at least 
equivalent quality, quantity and accessibility t o that of the existing facility, and 
must be consistent with Part G. It must, in the Council ’s view, ensure that the 
needs of the local population will continue to be met to at least the same level as 
the existing use; or  
(ii) the existing use  or another social  and community infrastructure use  is not 
required on site, demonstrated through:  
a. provision of marketing and vacancy evidence to assess continued 
demand for the existing use and all other suitable social and community 
infrastructure uses that could be acco mmodated on site. Evidence must  
be provided for a period of at least 12 months, in line with Appendix 1; 
and  
b. provision of a Community Needs  Assessment detailing why the site 
cannot support social and community infrastructure uses and why the 
existing use is no longer required on -site as well as demonstrat ing that 
the needs of service users  have been considered  before making 
recommendations/submitting proposals involving replacement or 
relocation or consolidation of services; or  
(iii) The proposal involves the lo ss/reduction /relocation  of social and community 
infrastructure uses as part of a rationalisation of a recognised public sector 
body’s estates programme . The applicant will be required to provide a 
Community Needs  Assessment demonstrating  details of rationa lisation, 
including  that they have considered the needs of service users as part of any 
rationalisation strategy.  
E. Where, in the Council ’s view, there is an ongoing need for the service/facility 
currently operating from the site and it cannot be re -provided as part of the 
proposed development, its loss will not be permitted unless the applicant has 
secured provision of at least equivalent quality, quantity and accessibility  which  
105 
 meets criteria set out in part G. The Community Needs Assessment must 
demonstrate that they have considered the needs of service users before  making 
recommendations/submitting proposals involving the loss, relocation or 
consolidation of services.  
F. Development resulting in the provision of new social and community infrastructure 
that is not generally accessible to the public, such as school sports facilities, will be 
required to enter into Community Use Agreem ents to allow and promote access to 
the facility  by local communities . 
G. New social and community infrastructure and, where applicable, extensions to 
existing infrastructure must:  
(i) be located in areas convenient for the communities they serve and accessible 
by a range of sustainable transport modes, including walking, cycling and public 
transport;  
(ii) provide buildings that are inclusive, accessible, flexibl e, sustainable and which 
provide design and space standards which meet the needs of intended 
occupants;  
(iii) provide appropriate drop -off/pick -up facilities for disabled people;  
(iv) be sited to maximise shared use of the facility, particularly for sports,  
recreational and community uses; and  
(v) complement existing uses and the character of the area, and avoid adverse 
impac ts on the amenity of surrounding uses.  
H. Proposals involving new/redeveloped social and community infrastructure should 
provide free, publicly available provision of accessible toilet, baby change and 
drinking water facilities. ‘Changing Places’ toilets will  be required in appropriate 
social and community facilities.  
 
 Islington’s social and community infrastructure comprises a wide range of facilities and 
services , such as hospitals, doctors’ surgeries, childcare facilities (such as nurseries ), 
schools  (including post -16 education) , leisure centres and sports facilities, libraries, 
community centres and recreational and play spaces  (including green space such as 
playing pitches) . The Council  strongly supports the retention of this infrastructure, 
which makes a crucial contribution to the mental and physical wellbeing , learning and 
education, and sense of place and commun ity of Islington’s residents.  
 Social and community infrastructure contrib utes to sustainable communities by 
providing venues for a wide range of activities and services, including accommodation 
for Islington’s active voluntary and community sector, meetings and events, which add 
to its diversity and interest. There is a need fo r a range of facilities in the borough to 
support community needs. To maintain sustainable communities, provision of new 
social infrastructure will be expected as part of significant new development proposals. 
New social infrastructure must  be designed wit h consideration for all users from the 
outset.  
 Evidence of social and community infrastructure facilities in Islington is provided as 
part of the update to the Infrastructure Delivery Plan which has considered the 
changing infrastructure needs and requirem ents in response to the development a nd 
growth seen in Islington in recent years , and the growth projected in future, as well as  
106 
 the objectives and priorities for both the Council  and its partners. The Council  has also 
prepared updated sports facilities ev idence which supports the continued protection of 
existing sports facilities in the borough , with no surplus provision identified for the 
range of sports assessed by the study. This evidence should be used to inform 
supporting information such as the Commu nity Needs Assessment.  
 Proposals involving the loss of social and community infrastructure will be resisted and 
all reasonable efforts must  be made to preserve existing facilities in community use 
and/or re -provide facilities on -site, including active mark eting for a range of other 
suitable social infrastructure uses . There may be some instances where proposals 
involve loss/reduction/relocation of social and community infrastructure in response to 
changing community needs or services. Any proposals involvin g loss of social and 
community infrastructure must  demonstrate, through provision of a Community Needs 
Assessment, that the facility in its current form is no longer needed or able to meet 
community needs.  
 The scope and content of the Community Needs Assessment will be judged in 
proportion to the scale and significance of the change in provision being proposed. 
The scope of the Community Needs Assessment will need to be agreed with the 
Council  at the earlies t possible stage of the planning process, ideally pre -application 
stage. The following will be expected to be covered by all Community Needs 
Assessments as a minimum; additional evidence may be necessary depending on the 
change of community use proposed . Where borough -level assessments of 
need/provision have already been prepared, by the Council  or other relevant bodies , 
these assessments may also inform determinations : 
 Engagement with all relevant bodies/organisations involved in provision of 
services, whi ch may not be solely the service providers, e.g., NHS  Islington Clinical 
Commissioning Group an d the relevant NHS Health Trust, where proposal involves 
primary or secondary health care premises . 
 Evidence which demonstrates understanding of service users an d expected users 
and former users where needs have declined;  
 Explanation of the change in service, and how the service will be better provided 
elsewhere;  
 Details of why the facility no longer meets specific needs because of physical 
constraints of the site /facility or changing user requirements; and  
 Evidence of consultation with existing/former users of the social and community 
infrastructure in relation to the proposed changes.  
 Proposals involving the loss or reduction of the public sector  body’s  estate as part of a 
recognised  asset/estates rationalisation programme may be acceptable, where details 
are provided to demonstrate how rationalisation is addressing the existing and future 
community needs. A recognised public sector body’s estates programme can in clude 
those produced for:  
 hospital trusts and other health organisations ; 
 the emergency services (Metropolitan Police Service, London Fire Brigade, 
London Ambulance Service) ; 
 public sector organisations who maintain a portfolio of community premises ; and 
 higher  education institutions.  
 To ensure high quality social and community infrastructure  is provided , the design of 
facilities must  demonstrate it has addressed a number of key design aspects , including 
the need for infrastructure to be inclusive, accessib le, flexible  and sustainable .   
107 
 
 Ensuring convenient access to buildings is important to ensure that a range of people 
can readily access services.  Building/site entrances must  be clearly identifiable with 
level access. Ensuring safe vehicle drop off within 50m of the entrance is important to 
meet needs of disabled people. The internal design of buildings will be expected to 
demonstrate that they meet the needs of a range of users considering for example, 
entrance lobbies, waiting areas, circulation space, ac cess between floors and 
emergency egress and evacuation. Further guidance is contained in Inclusive Design 
SPD.  
 Social and community infrastructure must  be located in areas convenient for the 
communities they serve and accessible by a range of sustainable  transport modes ; 
such as on major thoroughfares and locations in close proximity to bus stops,  although 
there may be flexibility depending on the type of infrastructure being provided. 
Facilities must  integrate with the surrounding area  and create or enhance places 
where people using facilities feel welcome. Co -location of services by different 
providers is strongly encouraged subject to complying with all other policy 
requirements.  
 Where new community spaces are proposed as part of new development, the 
Council ’s Voluntary and Community Sector team must  be consulted, to gauge the 
necessity for such space, taking into account existing provision in the area. Provision 
of unnecessary space may result in opportunities for other development be ing lost.  
 Sport and recreation facilities must  adopt inclusive design standards to ensure that 
everyone has the opportunity to take part in sporting activity, in line with relevant best 
practice and guidance issued by Sport England and other relevant 
bodie s/organisations.  
 Where appropriate, social and community infrastructure should incorporate Changing 
Places WCs; this is a toilet for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities  
which has enough space for disabled people and their carers; and th e right equipment, 
including a height adjustable changing bench and a hoist. Depending on the scale of a 
proposal, the following infrastructure may be considered appropriate for Changing 
Places WCs:  
 sport and leisure facilities.  
 cultural centres, such as m useums, concert halls and art galleries.  
 stadia and large auditoria.  
 town halls, civic centres and main public libraries.  
 educational establishments.  
 health facilities, such as hospitals, health centres and community practices.  
 
A. The Council  will strongly resist the loss of existing play spaces across the borough  
unless  replacement play space of equivalent size and functionality is provided to 
meet the needs of the local population. Any replacement space must  be provided 
on-site or  in the immediate vicinity, and access must  be unrestricted .  
108 
 B. The Council  will protect all twelve of the borough ’s adventure playgrounds 
designated on the Policies Map  and listed in Appendix 7 . 
C. All major residential development must  make appropr iate on -site provision for free -
to-use publicly accessible play space, which is suitable for children and young 
people of all ages and abilities. Provision must  be proportionate to the anticipated 
increase in child population as a result of development proposals. All proposed 
provision of new play space within development sites must  be designed in 
partnership with Islington Council , in line with any relevant best practice standards.  
D. All developments  (including l arge-scale public realm schemes)  must  provide 
playable public space  where possible , in addition to any formal play space 
provision.  This play space should  encourage children and young people to move 
around freely and safely through streets and footpath networks that connect to more 
formal play provision, green  spaces and parks.  
 
 Play provision must  be inclusive and suitable for  children and young people of all 
abilities, employing the principles of inclusive play. Increased physical activity 
contributes to healthy growth and development in children and young people, as well 
as improved psychological wellbeing and social interaction. In order to facilitate greater 
physical activity, it is important that children and young people have safe access to 
good quality, well designed, secure and stimulating play and in formal recreation 
provision .  
 Major housing developments are expected to make appropriate provision of play 
space. In determining the amount of play space required the Council  will consider the 
type of development, amount, quality, and use of existing acce ssible  provision of play 
space, as well as the anticipated child yield of the development. The Council  will take 
into consideration the London Plan benchmark for 10sqm of play space to be provided 
per child  as a starting point, but it is recognised that in  Islington’s context , delivery at  
this level may not always  be feasible .  
 Play space can include  communal outdoor space, private outdoor space, and gardens 
suitable for play. Communal gardens and other outdoor spaces suitable for play, 
including communal a menity space, may be considered to contribute towards play 
space provision where they have distinct playable elements ; however,  developments 
must  provide publicly accessible play space where possible , rather than provision 
being entirely from private space . Where formal play space is provided it must  be free, 
accessible, and integrated into any wider network s of open space. Where possible, 
minor developments are also required to provide informal play space.  
 Such p roposals must  be accompanied by detailed plans which include a detailed 
design for play provision. Reference should be made to best practice standards and 
any relevant guidance or strategies, in particular any Islington specific play strategy. 
Proposals must  also inclu de information detailing proposed future management and 
maintenance arrangements for any pla y space secured. This plan will  be conditioned 
by the Council  as part of any permission.  
 Play and informal recreation areas must  incorporate trees and greenery whe rever 
possible and form an integral part of a child friendly built environment. This involves 
making the whole of the public realm safe, welcoming and enjoyable for children and 
young people. Streets, pavements, walkways and various forms of public open sp ace  
109 
 have the potential to be treated as incidental spaces for play. Appropriate inclusive 
play provision must  be included for different age groups on site.  
 Play provision should encourage an element of positive risk taking and incorporate 
provision for nat ural play, which may be provided in formal play space, informal play 
space, and throughout the landscaping and open spaces of developments.  
 The Council  supports the concept of playable public space. Playable space involves 
alterations to spaces outside of playgrounds which make them more usabl e for 
children’s active play. A pl ayable space is one where children and young people’s 
active play is a legitimate use of the space. Playable space can be provided in a range 
of places including on local streets and p arks, or on the public realm of private 
developments, and can allow children to safely move around ne ighbourhoods more 
independently;  this involves reducing traffic volumes and speed. Such spaces should 
present physical and sensory challenges whilst managi ng appropriate risks, meeting 
the needs of different people at the same time.  
 Playable spaces often feature engaging elements that signal and welcome use by 
children and young people, such as landscaped mounds, decks, climbing elements 
boulders, logs, pla nting, undulating landscapes, water features. These features  must  
be orchestrated in a way that is easily navigated, without the use of formal signage. 
The use of additional scented or tactile clues can enhance legibility for all users. Some 
quiet areas th at have gentle sensory experiences benefit children, enriching their play 
experience at different paces.  
 
A. The Council  will require a ll major developments, and developments where potential 
health issues are likely to arise, to  complete a screening assessment as early as 
possible in the development process, to determine  whether a full H ealth Impact 
Assessment (HIA)  is required.   
B. Where the screening assessment identifies that a full HIA is required, this must  be 
prepared  as early as possible in the development process  so that potential health 
gains can be maximise d and any negative impacts can be mitigated . HIAs, where 
required, must  be proportionate to the scale of the development.  
C. The scope of any HIA must  be agreed with the Council ’s Public Health department, 
and must  be informed by relevant Council  guidance.  
 
 Improving health and reducing inequalities are key considerations that the Council  
assesses through the planning system. Healthy lifestyles are enc ouraged through 
good urban design, good quality accessible open space, access to active travel such 
as walking , cycling  and public transport , clean air, access to good quality employment 
opportunities and access to good quality affordable housing.  
 The HIA process is an integral part of the assessment of specific planning 
applications. It ensures that relevant schemes enhance health benefits and mitigate  
110 
 any identified impacts on t he wider determinants of health, i.e. social determinants of 
health, wellbeing  and inequalities.  
 All major developments, and developments where potential health issues are likely to 
arise, must complete a screening assessment  (as a minimum)  as early as possible in 
the development process, to determine  whether a full HIA  is required ; pre-application s 
must also  have regard to the HIA requirements and submission of draft screening 
assessments is strongly encouraged at this stage. Developments where potential 
health issues are likely to arise may include hot food takeaways and betting sh ops. 
 Sensitive locations in proximity to the development must  be considered in screening 
and any subsequent HIA. Sensitive uses include (but are not limited to) schools, child 
care centres, hospitals , and older persons’ facilities.  
 The Council  have produced guidance on the HIA process. All relevant proposals must  
have regard to this guidance when screening for HIA or subsequently preparing an 
HIA. The scope of any HIA must  be agreed with the Council ’s Public Health 
department . The HIA must  be proportionate to the size of the development and must  
look at the issue of health in the round, not just focus on access to health services.  
 
A. All development in Islington is encouraged to maximise social value in order to  
deliver as many public benefits as possible.  
B. Major development proposal s must undertake  a Social Value s elf-assessment 
which  clearly sets out the specific social v alue which would be added through 
delivery of the proposal.  
 
 The concept o f social v alue relates to the delivery of positive social , economic and 
environmental  impacts , arising from the actions and operations of various 
organisations. This means that as well as taking into account the direct effects of 
interventions, the wider effects on other areas must  also be considered , particularly 
the effects on  the local economy a nd the health and wellbeing of local residents.  It is 
important  to ensure that potential benefits – including small -scale benefits which  
together  can have major cumulative benefits – are maximised from all possible 
sources.  
 To date, social value has been u tilised fairly narrowly, for example t he Public Services 
(Social Value) Act  which focus es on commissioning of services by the public sector . 
There is considerable potential to broaden the scope of social value to other areas, 
including planning.  
 In plannin g terms, m aximising social v alue involves considering the  social, 
environmental and economic costs and benefits. This ha s a clear synergy with the 
overarching aim of the planning system – to deliver sustainable development and 
underpins the L ocal Plan visi on and objectives.   
111 
 
 Planning can play a key role in ensuring that social value is maximised, by 
encouraging all development proposals to engage with the concept and consider 
whether doing things differently can lead to additional benefits; f or example,  by utilising 
local supply chains so money spent on developme nts stays in the local economy; and 
taking steps to recruit local people for construction of development and in any resulting 
employment use.  
 All development proposals, including small householder app lications, are encouraged 
to maximise social value  throughout the lifetime of the development , by considering at 
the outset whether the planned development can be approached in a different way 
which could add additional social value , for example, hiring lo cal tradesman to 
undertake construction  work . Such considerations are unlikely to lead to additional 
cost implications, especially if they are considered at the earliest possible stage of 
development ; the delivery of these considerations will therefore not  impact on scheme 
viability . Where social value benefits are identified  which go beyond what the Council  
would expect as a standard level of social value on a scheme  (resulting from 
compliance with all relevant policy requirements ), this could constitute a  material 
consideration which would add weight to a proposal (although the level of weight 
would be determined on a case -by-case basis  and may depend on the provision of  
specific information to demonstrate how any identified social value benefits will be 
delivered and sustained  over the lifetime of the development) . 
 All major developments must undertake  a Social Value self -assessment form, based 
on the template provided at Appendix 5. This must be submitted at planning 
application stage although a pplicants are encouraged to complete this form at the 
earliest possible stage of the development  (e.g. at initial design stage or pre -
application  stage ), so that the consideration of social value can meaningfully influence 
proposals.  
 Further guidance on delivering s ocial value may be developed through a SPD.

 4 Inclusive Economy  
 The Council  is currently developing its overarching strategy for delivering an inclusive 
economy. An inclusive economy  works better for local people and benefits the 
community  as a whole. It is an economy  where:  
 inequality is declining rather than increasing;  
 people are able to p articipate fully in community and economic activity, with a 
greater say  over their future ; 
 secure and well -paid work opportunities – with increasing in comes – are available 
for a wide range of people,  especially for poor and excluded communities ; 
 individuals, households, communities and businesses are secure enough to invest 
in their future  and sustain a level of wealth and wellbeing to enable a stress -free 
cost of living ; 
 there is greater diversity of businesses, with a range of smaller businesses; worker 
co-operatives  and social enterprises , rather than being dominated by a small 
number of larger firms;  
 more money generated in the local economy stay s in the local economy ; and  
 growth is balanced against consideration and mitigation of environmental impacts.  
 This inclusive economy model can deliver wider social, economic and environmental 
benefits in a more holistic manner than more conventional economic m odels, which 
heavily prioritise growth above other considerations with limited (if any) subsequent 
direct or indirect benefits for local economies (e.g. trickle -down) .  
 The Council ’s Inclusive Economy  Strategy will expand on the concept of an inclusive 
economy, and provide clarity on what an inclusive economy in Islington looks like. The 
strategy will include a number of objectives to deliver an inclusive economy in the 
borough.  
 Planning is an integral part of this delivery, particularly ma ximising opportunities for the 
growth of micro and small businesses, e.g. by providing affordable workspaces; and 
ensuring that the borough’s Town Centre s, high streets, and street markets continue to 
be successful places for local businesses to trade and thrive.  Chapter 4 of the Local 
Plan outlines a range of planning policies which will enable delivery of these key 
elements of an inclusive economy. 
113 
 A. In line with the Local Plan objectives, in particular the aim to deliver an inclusive 
economy, t he Council  will seek to cultivate a diverse and vibrant economic base 
through requiring development to provide a range of workspace types and unit 
sizes, which are affordable for a range of occupiers, including  establ ished and 
emerging enterprises, and SMEs.  
B. New business floorspace will be focused in the CAZ, Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  
area, the CAZ fringe Spatial Strategy  areas of Angel and Upper Street and Kings 
Cross  and Pentonville Road , PELs and Locally Significant Industrial Sites. 
Proposals in these areas must maximise the amount of new business floorspace; 
proposals which do not demonstrate maximisation will be considered to be an 
inefficient use of a site and will be refused.  
C. The Counci l is committed to ensuring there is an adequate supply of business 
space in line with job growth projections and will protect existing business space 
throughout the borough through implementing planning policies which seek to 
ensure, at least, no net loss of business floorspace, and through the making of 
Article 4 Directions, where appropriate.  
D. The Council  will aim to secure space that fosters the development and expansion of 
businesses, particularly space suitable for start-ups and small businesses. This 
includes the delivery of affordable workspace; and  the provision of small units 
suitable for SMEs.   
E. Islington’s Locally Significant Industrial Sites are the focus for new industrial uses, 
namely B1(c) , B2 and B8 uses. Existing industrial land and floorspac e will be 
safeguarded  and the introduction of non -industrial uses will not be permitted. The  
renewal , modernisation  and intensification  of industrial uses  will be encouraged.  
F. Development in the borough must provide jobs and training opportunities/support.   
 The Council  aims to create an economy where the benefits of economic success are 
shared across the different sections of society. An inclusive economy cannot be 
achieved through planning alone, but requires joint working between  developers , 
economic agents and the various parts  of the Council . From a planning perspective, 
achieving  an inclusive economy can be done through:  
 ensuring a sufficient supply o f business land and floorspace to facilitate future job 
growth;  
 ensuring that business spac e meets the needs of businesses ; and  
 securing jobs and training opportunities from new development.  
 Business floorspace  in this chapter is considered to be activities or uses that fall within 
the B -use class (i.e. offices, industry, or warehousing) and s ome Sui Generis uses 
which are akin to business uses, such as building merchants and depots. Employment 
floorspace is a broader term which refers to activities or uses that generate  
114 
 employment, including offices, industry, warehousing, showrooms, hotels, r etail, 
entertainment, educational, health and leisure uses (regardless of whether the end 
occupier is private, public or charity sector).   
 Islington has a strong and prosperous economy. It has grown significantly in recent 
years and is set to grow even fur ther. Evidence produced by the Council  demonstrates 
an unprecedented high need for additional office  floorspace – 400,000sqm up to 2036. 
Land supply in Islington is highly constrained; the borough is the most densely 
populated and third smallest (by land a rea) English local authority. This extremely 
limited land supply coupled with  exceptionally high need for new space to 
accommodate projected jobs growth  means that the Council  must do more to protect 
existing  business floorspace  and encourage the delivery of new business floorspace.  
 The Council  recognises that although it is unlikely that this need will be fully met, given 
the significant land constraints in the borough as well as competing needs for 
development of other uses , policies and their implementation must go as far as 
possible to meet this need . This means that the maximisation of business floorspace 
delivery is an absolute priority, in addition to housing, whereas the delivery of uses, 
including other  types of  comme rcial floorspace , can be considered as secondary. In 
achieving maximisation, a longer term view of viability must  be taken, i.e. where there 
are short terms dips in the market, this does  not necessarily negatively impact the 
delivery of business floorspace in the future.  
 The success of Islington’s economy can be attributed to a number of factors, including 
being located in the  CAZ, which accommodates 70% of the borough’s jobs , and 
several unique economic clusters which are of sub-regiona l or national significance. 
These clusters include Tech City around Old Street; the Clerkenwell Design Cluster; 
the Kings  Cross -Moorfields Eye Hospital c orridor  which links the Kings Cross life 
sciences cluster /Knowledge Quarter’ with Old Street ; and the V ale Royal /Brewer y 
Road industrial cluster. There are also  a number of smaller scale clusters of business 
uses  and industrial areas which are located across the borough.  
 Islington’s economy is made up of a wide range of businesses and organisations, the 
majority of which are micro and small enterprises . Whilst these businesses make up 
the vast majority of the borough’s enterprises, the majority of jobs come from a few 
larger businesses, as well as the borough’s universities, hospitals, and the Council  
itself.  
 By 2036, 50,500 additional jobs are expected in the borough, with the majority of this 
increase within sectors that will require office accommodation. Much of this office 
growth will be concentrated in the CAZ , Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP area  and the 
CAZ fringe Spatial Strategy  areas of Angel and Upper Street and King ’s Cross  and 
Pentonville Road . These areas are crucial in providing a pipeline of office land capable 
of meeting the projected floorspace demand. To realise this growth, a range of 
workspa ces that meet the existing and future needs of businesses must be provided. 
The loss or reduction of existing business floorspace anywhere across the borough will 
not be allowed. In line with job growth projections, the Council  will take a rigorous 
approac h to ensuring the maximisation of business floorspace in locations which are 
identified as the focus for business use. The maximisation of floorspace in this 
instance, will be where the maximum amount of business floorspace is provided, 
subject to design c onstraints or viability. The assessment of maximisation is not 
prescribed, but may include a requirement for scenario testing of alternate schemes, 
particularly where proposals involve a mix of uses including non -business uses.   
115 
 
 This approach aligns w ith the London Plan, including T able A1.1 which identifies office 
guidelines for various areas in Islington.  
 Small and micro businesses rely on smaller spaces, often in secondary locations, 
underscoring the need to ensure a sufficient supply at affordable rates . Development 
proposals for business floorspace will be expected to provide a range of units in terms 
of type and size, and major development proposals in specific locations must  provide 
an element of affordable workspace.  
 LSISs are the focus for B1(c) , B2 and B8 uses. Existing industrial land will be 
safeguarded, and its renewal and modernisation will be encouraged. Non-industrial 
uses  will not be allowed in LSISs. T he Vale Royal /Brewery Road LSIS is the  largest 
concentration of industrial uses in the borough. The area is an establ ished cluster of 
industrial uses. I n addition to the more conventional industrial uses  expected in an 
inner London industrial area, the area is also home to a  small  cluster of creative 
industries and specialist event companies /music orientated businesses. The unique 
function of this LSIS must  be protected and nurtured to allow for an intensification of 
industrial uses  – see policy SP3  for further detail. In other LSIS s, industrial land will be 
protected and the industrial funct ion of the areas  will be safeguarded , with renewal and 
modernisation of this industrial function encouraged.   
 Despite the prosperous economic environment, Islington experiences a higher than 
average rate of economic inactivity, meaning that although the nu mber of jobs is 
increasing, residents in the b orough are not necessarily able to access them. The 
Council  will seek to ensure that Islington residents benefit from new development and 
will expect jobs and training opportunities to be provided from major development for 
local residents.  
 
A. New business floorspace will be dire cted to the locations identified in (i) to (iii) below 
(and shown on Figure 4.1)  to support the specific role and function of each of the 
locations . Proposals must  maximise the provision of business floor space in line with 
the priorities  for each location . Proposals which are not considered to maximise 
business floorspace will not be permitted . Proposals involving existing business 
floorspace must prioritise the intensificatio n, renewal and modernisation of this 
business floorspace  throughout the borough an d particularly in the locations set out 
below.  
(i) CAZ and Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  area:  office uses are the clear priority 
in this area, in order to support London’s strategic business role . The primary 
economic function of the CAZ and AAP area depends o n maintaining and 
enhancing office uses . A range of workspace typologies are supported, including 
Grade A offices , serviced offices, co -working spaces, hybrid workspace and 
other types of flexible workspace and lower specification office space suitable  
SME s and business services. Residential use s are not a key priority in this 
location .  
(ii) CAZ fringe Spatial Strategy  areas – Angel and Upper Street; and King’s 
Cross and Pentonville Road : New business floorspace is a priority in these 
Spatial Strategy  areas, particularly on White Lion Street, Pentonville Road and  
116 
 upper floor locations across Angel  Town Centre . A variety of business 
floorspace  typologies  is encouraged along Pentonville Road and around Kings 
Cross /York Way , including business space which meets t he needs of SMEs.  
(iii) Priority Employment  Locations  (PELs) : Growth and intensification of 
business uses to provide for the SME sector, as well as meeting local/specialist 
needs, is the key priority within these areas . Increasing provision of space that is 
appropriate to meet the diverse needs of the SME economy  is supported . 
Residential use will not be supported  in these areas . 
B. The introduction of uses that could undermine the specific economic function of the 
locatio ns identified in Part A will be resisted  
C. In LSISs  shown on Figure 4.1 , the overriding priority land uses are industrial uses 
(B1(c) , B2, B8  and Sui Generis uses which are akin to industrial uses ). The 
retention and intensification of industrial uses and ex isting clusters of industrial 
activity in LSISs will be required  as part of any proposal within a LSIS . The provision 
of hybrid space is supported. T he development of office use may  be permissible as 
part of  a hybrid workspace scheme, but it must only constitute a small proportion of 
the overall gross floorspace proposed.  The introduction of non-industrial uses would  
undermine the primary industrial economic function  and compromise the future 
growth  of LSISs and will therefore not be permitted unless th ey are clearly ancillary 
to a proposal . Residential use is not acceptable within LSISs.  
D. Proposals for B1(a)  and B1(c)  floorspace that meets local and/or wider demand 
must  be located  on upper floors in the Primary Shopping Area  of designated Town 
Centre s, but are considered suitable on any floor elsewhere in designated Town 
Centre s and in LSAs, as long as the business use provides an active frontage.  
E. Outside of the locations mentioned in Part s A, C and D , new business floorspace is 
acceptable  where it would not detract from the character of the local area; and 
would not detrimentally impact on residential amenity. Proposals for new business 
floorspace in these locations must  be accessible to all in accordance with the 
priority for sustainable modes of transport  set out in policy T1 , and must  not 
prejudice the overall aim of reducing the need to travel.  
F. All development proposals involving business floorspace  (including affordable 
workspace provided in line with policy B4)  must have regard to the  following:  
(i) Business floorspace must allow for future flexibility for a range of occupiers, 
including future subdivision and/or amalgamation, and provide a range of unit 
types and sizes , including a significant proportion of small units, particularly for 
SMEs . Full separation of business and residential floorspace  is required where  
business floorspace forms  part of a mixed use residential development.  
(ii) Provision of a good level of amenity for occupiers of the business floorspace, 
including adequate levels o f daylight and sunlight; and access to 
communal/ancillary facilities including meeting rooms.  
(iii) The development of new business floorspace must  incorporate the highest 
inclusive design standards achievable in context, and meet the travel and 
transport needs of those for whom public transport remains inaccessible.  
(iv) Applicants must clearly demonstrate how the design of proposals individually 
and cumulatively  contribute to providing the range of spaces required to support 
the primary function /sector  of the parti cular area in which it is located.   
117 
 (v) Ancillary uses must be  clearly linked to the operation of the business floorspace.  
G. Proposals for new industrial and warehousing uses must provide:  
(i) satisfactory access and servicin g, including off -street loading, a ppropri ate 
delivery arrangements in line with policy T 5, and  adequate yard space ; and  
(ii) good quality design which provides space that is adaptable to meet the needs of 
a range of industrial uses and occupiers , including sufficient clear internal 
ceiling/eaves heigh ts and loads, and a dequate goods lifts.  
H. Where proposed, l ive-work units will be considered to be C3 residential floorspace 
and will not be considered business or employment floorspace. Such units will not 
contribute towards the maximisation requirement set  out in Part A of this policy. 
Existing live/work units are classed as business floorspace; proposals involving the 
change of use/loss of existing live/work units will be assessed against policy B3.   
 
 Delivering an increase in business floorspace is a key objective for this Local Plan. 
The number of jobs in the borough is projected to increase substantially; our evidence 
suggests that there will be an additional 50,500 jobs in the borough up to  2036. 
Continued levels of growth are forecast within the pr ofessional  and technical services 
sectors,  which generate the most demand for office space.  These job projections, 
when translated into floorspace requirements, demonstrate a need for an additional 
400,000sqm of office floorspace.  Islington’s pipeline of b usiness floorspace has 
consistently shown a net loss in recent years, and without strong policy requirements, 
it is unlikely that business floorspace will be delivered at a level that would 
accommodate the projected employment increases. This demonstrates that Islington 
has a severely constrained supply -demand balance, where demand greatly exceeds 
supply.  
 Growing competition between residential and commercial uses is  putting  pressure on 
land markets  and has led to an ongoing erosion of busin ess space in Islington, 
particularly secondary /affordable business space over the last decade. This has been 
further exacerbated by the introduction of the office to residential permitted 
development right in 2013. The intensification of business uses will  be directed to the 
CAZ, the Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  area, the CAZ fringe Spatial Strategy  areas of 
Angel and Upper Street; and King ’s Cross  and Pentonville Road  and PELs, with LSISs  
being a focus for industrial uses ; these locations are sho wn on  Figure 4.1 , with each 
PEL and LSIS listed below for information . The introduction  of non-business  uses  in 
these areas could undermine their primary economic function  and will  therefore not be  
allowed.  
118

 The PELs are as follows:  
 Balls Pond Road East  
 Seven Sisters Road  
 Holloway Road North  
 Wedmore Street  
 Finsbury Park  
 Camden Road /Parkhurst Road  
 St George's Road  
 Highbury Corner  
 New North Road  
 Balls Pond Road West  
 Hornsey Road /Marlborough Road  
 Pine Grove  
 Baron Street  
 King's Cross  
 Northampton Street  
 Aberdeen Lane  
 Northdown Street  
 Hornsey Road /Fairbridge Road  
 Old Dairy Court  
 Stroud Green Road  
 North Road  
 Margery Street /Easton Street  
 Purley Place  
 Cobble Lane  
 The LSISs are as follows:  
 Vale Royal/Brewery Road  
 Melody Lane  
 North Road  
 Offord Road  
 Pemberton Gardens  
 Station Road  
 Local and regional evidence  is clear that the CAZ is the location with the most demand 
for Grade A office space. Aside from Grade A office space, other workspace typologie s 
are supported in the CAZ. The Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP sets out an area wide 
policy to prioritise office space, with detail on the type of workspace required within 
relevant AAP Spatial Strateg y areas . Maximisation of office floorspace will be require d 
in the CAZ, given this is the area which will see the most demand for business 
floorspace. The Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  area covers most of the CAZ within 
Islington , with  a small area of the  CAZ outside the AAP area . The CAZ fringe Spatial 
Strategy  areas – Angel and Upper Street;  and King ’s Cross  and Pentonville Road – 
are also important business locations , as detailed in the respective Spatial Strategy 
policies  for these areas  (policies SP2 and SP4) . CAZ fringe locations  take pressure off 
the central London office market and  can provide lower cost space  (relative  to the 
CAZ) which is  suitable  for SMEs.  These areas , particularly along the growth corridors 
of Pentonville Road, White Lion Street and York Way,  are suitable locations where 
provision of a mi x of business spaces – including flexible SME space, secondary 
offices as well as Grade A office  space  – will be encouraged .   
120 
 
 Outside of the CAZ, there is a growing small business economy which  is clustered in 
various areas  across the b orough. These PELs  accommodate a range of spaces to 
meet the varied needs of occupiers. Business uses  must  continue to be prioritised and 
intensified  in these locations . Property market indicators show that growing numbers of 
occupiers are becoming more ‘footloose ’ and these dynamics have encouraged a 
rapid expansion of different types of business workspace including flexible workspace , 
‘hybrid’ space, light industrial, studio and production space, and co -working space. 
These types of space are particularly attractive to the s mall business economy  and will 
be encouraged  in existing PELs and Town Centres.  
 Islington has one of the lowest levels of industrial stock in comparison to the other 
central London boroughs , largely due to the significant loss of industrial land in recent  
years . The Vale Royal /Brewery Road LSIS  is the b orough’s largest concentration of 
industrial /warehousing /employment land ; policy SP3 sets out the Spatial Strategy  for 
this area . There are several other smaller LSISs which also provide important 
industrial  capacity in the borough.  
 Industrial floorspace is vitally important as an economic driver in its own right but also 
to support other economic functions, including servicing both the wider b orough and 
Central London  economies . Within LSISs in particular,  the principal objective is to 
retain and intensify B1(c)  light industrial, B2 general industry and B8 storage and 
distribution uses . The introduction of non-industrial uses which c ould compromise the 
economic function and future growth of LSISs (including offices and  residential uses) 
will not be permitted . Sui Generis industrial uses may be acceptable but care must  be 
taken to ensure that any non -industrial uses which form part of the overarching Sui 
Generis use are not of a scale that could adversely impa ct the LSIS. Similarly, non -
industrial uses may be suitable ancillary uses, but only where their operation is clearly 
ancillary, particularly in terms of scale and function.  
 Where new B uses are provided  in the borough , conditions may be attached to the 
permission to remove any applicable permitted development rights and /or restrict 
changes via section 55(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). 
For example, this may include restricting business floorspace to B1(a) or B1(c) uses 
only, within the wider B1 use class, which ordinarily would not be classed as 
development. The condition could be worded as follows:  
Operation of Section 55(2)(f) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 is precluded 
with regard to permitted B1(a)/B1(c) use [D ELETE AS APPLICABLE]. The premises 
shall only be used for  B1(a)/B1(c) use [DELETE AS APPLICABLE] and for no other 
purpose (including any other purpose within Class  B1 of the Schedule to the Town and 
Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, or in any prov ision equivalent to that 
Class in any statutory instrument revoking and re -enacting that Order with or without 
modification.  
 Town Centre s and LSAs are mixed -use in nature and have several functions, including 
retail, services and entertainment. Many of the se centres also serve as important 
business locations. The development of new business floorspace is encouraged  in 
these locations . Outside of identified locations, business floorspace is encouraged  
provided the character and vitality of the specific local ity is not undermined ; there is no 
impact on residential amenity ; and the proposal is accessible to all in accordance with 
transport policies.  
 High quality design is expected from all new development.  Local occupier demand in 
Islington indicates  a range of  types and sizes of new workspace is needed. New 
development should provide business space that is designed to ensure that  occupiers  
121 
 can continuously adapt to changing economic and market circumstances.  The design 
of new business floorspace should reflect the functions of the specific economic area. 
For example, Grade A office space is most appropriate in the CAZ and Bunhill and 
Clerkenwell AAP  area, whereas hybrid space is considered most suitable in the LSISs, 
particularly the Vale Royal /Brewery Road LSI S; flexible workspace for small 
businesses is particularly suitable in PELs  and Town Centre s outside the CAZ. These 
examples are not an exhaustive list of the types of space required, relative to location, 
and other best practice guidance and case -specific  information may be used to inform 
the type of space that is sought.  
 Ancillary uses in offices must  only be provided where they are clearly linked to the 
operation of the business floorspace . It is increasingly common for offices to have 
ancillary event spaces, bars and cafes, which may utilise roof terraces or other 
external areas. Such ancillary uses must  be fully assessed in line with policy DH5 and 
other relevant Local Plan policies. To be genuinely ancillary, an event space, café or 
bar must  be small -scale and must  only hold an on -license to serve alcohol (not an off -
license). Use of ancillary event/café/bar space must  be limited to occupiers of the 
office building and relevant visitors.  
 The development of new business floorspace must meet the needs of our increasingly 
diverse communities and adapt to their different and evolving demands. The Council  
recognises that the public transport system still remains inaccessible to many. 
Accessible p arking and drop -off bays , and inclusive cycle parking,  will be required from 
new business development, in line with  Policy T3.   
 Other inclusive design features such as step free access, accessible toilets, end -of-trip 
facilities and safe egress and evacuat ion for all must  also be incorporated into new 
business development, in line with the guidance in the Inclusive Design SPD. 
Developments must also provide adequate provision for mobility scooter storage and 
charging.  
 Proposals tha t include revolving doors will be resisted. E ntrances that feature 
revolving doors with separate pass doors are not  an acceptable solution; such a 
solution is not inclusive as they result in separate treatment by the creation of 
secondary entrances  
 The design of business floorspace  should be flexible and include the following design 
features24:  
 A Floor  to ceiling heights which allow at least 3 metres of free space, and up to 5 
metres in industrial buildings to allow for the introduction of mezzanines;  
 Strategic lay -out of entrances , entry cores, lift cores, loading facilities and fire 
escapes, to allow mixing of uses within the building; grouping of services  including  
plumbing, electrics, cabling, communications infrastructure and circulation;  
 Full separation of business and residential floorspace, where forming part of a 
mixe d use residential development . Alternative layouts may be acceptable where it 
can be demonstrated that sufficient measures are put in place and secured to 
ensure that the amenity of residents and business es is protected, particularly with 
regard to safety, privacy and security ; 
 Flexible ground floor access systems that can easily be adapted for goods delivery 
(e.g. through adaptable façade panels) ; and 
                                                
24 Other design requirements may be applicable, to be determined in line with other Local Plan 
policies and/or relevant guidance.   
122 
  Good standards of insulation to mitigate any overspill  from future alternative uses 
in the building.  
 Live/work units, due to the higher property value of residential  units, are generally 
used for residential purposes in Islington and do not generate significant  employment. 
Where proposed, live -work units will  be assessed as residential units and will not be 
considered to contribute to the overall proportion of business floorspace within 
proposals. They will also be subject to all other relevant Local Plan policies, including 
the requirement to provide affordab le housing set out in policy H3. For proposals 
involving the loss of existing live -work units, their loss will be assessed against Policy 
B3. 
 
 The Council  will protect existing business floorspace throughout the bor ough.  
 Proposals resulting in the net loss of business  floorspace within the CAZ , Bunhill 
and Clerkenwell AAP  area,  PELs , LSISs , Town Centre s, LSAs , and non -designated 
locations , either through change of use or redevelopment, will be refused unless 
there a re exceptional circumstances which demonstrate:  
(i) there is no demand for the use of the floorspace, unit, building and/or site for a 
business use appropriate to the role and function of the area. Evidence must be 
submitted demonstrating that such space has b een vacant and continuously 
marketed for a period of at least 24 months, in line with Appendix 1; and  
(ii) the loss of business floorspace – either individually or cumulatively – would not 
compromise the operation of the wider  area, and that the proposed non -
business use is compatible with existing uses  (including consideration of 
amenity impacts on uses in the vicinity) . 
 In addition to Part B which relates to all business floorspace, where existing 
business uses are industrial  in nature  – i.e. B1(c) , B2 or B8 uses, or Sui Generis 
uses which are akin to industrial  uses  – there must  be at least no net loss of 
industrial uses as part of development proposals.  Marketing requirements for 
proposals involving the net loss of industrial uses must market the floorspace for 
continued industrial use; where a proposal is outside an LSIS, marketing must be 
primarily for industrial use but could include marketing for other business uses as a 
potential option.  
 
 To meet the identified need of 400,000sqm of office  floorspace up to 2036, the Local 
Plan aims to promote new business floorspace and ensure that existing business 
floorspace is strongly protected; this dual approach is integral to policy B1, and both 
strands must operate together to achieve the overarching o bjective of meeting 
employment projections. Intensification, renewal and modernisation of existing space 
is particularly encouraged. To ensure that short term economic uncertainties do not 
impact the delivery of business floorspace in the medium term, mark eting and vacancy 
evidence will be required for  a period of  24 months. Although Islington’s economy is 
strong and is set to grow even further, there may be instances where market demand  
123 
 dips but will likely pick back up in line with medium to long term pro jections. This 
approach means that once the market regains strength, business floorspace has not 
been lost unnecessarily as the marketing period is long enough to allow for market 
fluctuations.   
 Islington has lost a significant amount of business floorspace over recent years. 
Although there were overall gains in the amount of office space permitted and 
completed through the planning application process during this period, this increase 
has been al l but eradicated by the introduction of the office to residential permitted 
development right. At the time of writing, approximately 53,000sqm of office space had 
been given prior approval to convert to residential use as a result of the permitted 
developm ent right. Given this significant reduction to Islington’s stock of office 
floorspace, and in light of the high projected need for floorspace to accommodate new 
jobs, it is essential to ensure further losses to existing business space are minimised.  
 To ens ure the ongoing protection of office floorspace in the CAZ, and in addition to this 
policy, the Council  has put in place an  Article 4 Direction to remove the office to 
residential permitted development right in the CAZ.  
 Industrial uses have seen wholesale  losses in recent  years . There  continues to be  
significant pressure to redevelop Islington’s remain ing industrial land for other uses, 
due to its often perceived lower value. However, as noted in policy B2, a good supply 
of industrial land is integral to e nsuring inclusive economic development in Islington 
and Central London . Islington’s Employment Land Study forecasts further losses of 
industrial land, some 90,000sqm up to 2036. Given the importance of industrial land, 
the Local Plan will strongly resist t he loss of all industrial uses. The London Plan, 
policy E4 identifies Islington as a borough which must  retain and intensify industrial 
floorspace capacity and follow a general principle of no net loss across designated 
LSIS. Industrial floorspace  outside designated areas  is also protected.  
 PELs  and Town Centre s are important clusters of businesses and enterprises. To 
ensure there is an adequate supply of business units and premises in these locations, 
proposals which result in a net loss of business floors pace will be strongly resisted.   
 Proposals involving the net  loss of business  floorspace in the CAZ , Bunhill and 
Clerkenwell AAP  area, LSIS s, PE Ls, Town Centre s, LSAs and non -designated 
locations, must demonstrate there is no demand for the use of the floorspace, unit, 
building and/or site , for a business use appropriate to its role and primary economic 
function. Where a net loss of business floorspace is proposed, clear and robust 
marketing and vacancy evidence for a period of 24 months  must be provide d to clearly 
demonstrate there is no demand. The evidence must  prove  that there is no reasonable 
prospe ct of the unit, building, and/ or site being used for business purposes in the 
medium term . Evidence of strategic and local assessments of demand and supp ly 
must also be provided . Appendix 1 sets out the information to be provided in relation to 
marketing and vacancy evidence . Planning applications will be refused if all the 
criterion set out in Appendix 1 are not met.   
 Existing industrial uses , including on non -designated industrial sites , will be protected 
by ensuring there is no net loss  of industrial floorspace  as part of any development 
proposals.  For avoidance of doubt, industrial uses include physical floorspace as well 
as any other space linked to th e operation of the industrial use, including external/yard 
space.  Policy B2 Part B would apply to any proposals within LSISs, and policy SP3 
would also apply to any proposals within the Vale Royal/Brewery Road LSIS.   
124 
 
 Replacing business uses with non -busines s uses (particularly residential use) could 
compromise the operation and viability of the wider area/cluster. Where a proposal for 
a non -business use satisfies the marketing criteria set out in Appendix 1, it must also 
demonstrate to the Council ’s satisfac tion that the proposal would not compromise the 
operation and viability of the wider area, and would not negatively impact the primary 
economic function of the area or the local economy.  
 Proposals for the redevelopment of existing business floorspace for the provision of 
non-business uses must demonstrate that the proposed non-business use is 
compatible with existing uses, and does not have a detrimental individual or 
cumulative impact on the role and economic function of the wider area. An individual 
impact may not seem as significant from smaller schemes, as opposed to the impact 
from larger schemes ; however, smaller losses may add to the cumulative impact. 
Some uses, such as residential use, may not be compatible with the existing 
businesses use. Thi s may be of particular importance within LSIS s, where industrial 
uses may have noise and transport related impacts. Relevant Local Plan policies, 
including the agent -of-change principle set out in policy DH5, will be used to assess 
impacts.  
 
A. Within the CAZ, Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  area, CAZ fringe Spatial Strategy  
areas (Angel and Upper Street; and Kings Cross and Pentonville Road), PELs  and 
Town Centre s, major development proposals involving 1,000sqm or more gross 
B1(a ) and/or B1(b)  and/or general B1 -use and/or a Sui Generis use  akin to 
B1(a) /B1(b) floorspace  must incorporate at least 10% affordable workspace (as a 
proportion of proposed  B1(a) and/or B1(b) and/or general B1  and/or a Sui Generis 
use akin to B1(a)/B1(b)  floorspace  GIA) to be leased to the Council  at a peppercorn 
rate for a period of at least 20 years. The Council  will subsequently lease the space 
to a Council -approved operator . 
B. A requirement for affordable workspace will also apply to any major development 
proposals involving 1,000sqm or more gross B1(a) and/or B1(b) and/or general B1  
and/or a Sui Generis use akin to B1(a) /B1(b)  floorspace within a LSIS . 
C. For proposals involving 1 0,000sqm or more gross B1(a)  and/or B1(b) and/or general 
B1 and/or a Sui Generis use akin to B1(a) /B1(b)  floorspace ; or significant office 
extensions/intensification proposals in high value areas, 10%  affordable workspace 
(as a proportion of proposed  B1(a)  and/or B1(b) and/or general B1  and/or a Sui 
Generis use  akin to B1(a) /B1(b)  floorspace  GIA) for a peppercorn period longer than 
20 years will be sought, including space in perpetuity.  
D. Where 1,000sqm or more gross B1(a) and/or B1(b) and/or general B1  and/or a Sui 
Generis use akin to B1(a)/B1(b)  floorspace  is proposed outside areas identified in 
parts A and B of this policy, the maximum amount of affordable workspace must  be 
provided, based on site -specific viability information.  
E. All proposals which pro vide affordable workspace must prepare an Affordable 
Workspace Statement to be submitted alongside the relevant planning application.   
125 
 F. Affordable workspace must  be built to at least Category A fit out, and must  provide a 
high standard of amenity for occupiers , including access to relevant servicing and 
facilities.  
G. Proposals for major commercial development  not covered by Parts A to D  – such as 
hotels and retail – may be required to provide affordable workspace a nd/or 
affordable retail space, subject to viability. Priority will be given to on -site provision.  
 
 The nature of London’s economic growth and sharp rise in population have combined 
to place particular stress on land markets. These stresses are particular ly evident in 
Islington given its location within the CAZ, in close proximity to central London. Rapidly 
rising land values is leading to growing competition for space between the residential 
and commercial property markets, which leads to increases in bus iness rents and 
makes the borough a more unaffordable place to do business. This is especially an 
issue for SMEs who are generally  more cost -conscious and sensitive to rising rents. 
Such firms are unable to benefit from locating near to other similar firms, which 
damages their prospects and also stymies the development of particular sectors.  
 The SME sector plays a key role in the borough’s economy; therefore, ensuring a 
sufficient supply of space suitable for these businesses is a key priority. A key 
objective of the Local Plan employment policies is the encouragement of the SME 
economy, through nurturing space that is appropriate to its diverse needs, including 
affordable workspace.  
 Affordable workspace is business  floorspace/ workspace which is leased  to the Council  
at a peppercorn rate for a period of at least 20 years, and managed by a Council  
approved operator  (which could be the Council  itself) . Rental values for end occupiers 
will ultimately depend on the quality of space and its location, and wil l be considered 
on a case -by-case basis through the Council ’s Affordable Workspace Commissioning 
Process;  however,  rents (including service charges) must  be significantly below the 
prevailing market  rate for the specific sector and/or location , otherwise t he workspace 
would not be affordable . The Council ’s Inclusive Economy  team will lead on the 
Affordable Workspace Commissioning Process once affordable workspace is secured. 
More information is provided  in the Council ’s Affordable Workspace Strategy.  
 For th e avoidance of doubt, floorspace which does not meet these requirements will 
not be considered to be affordable workspace for the purposes of policy B4. This 
includes stand -alone small business units, although such units may be required in 
addition to affo rdable workspace, under policy B2. Proposals for business floorspace 
(including various different typologies such as individual desk spaces and co -working 
space) at a discounted market rent let directly to an end occupier will not be 
considered to be affor dable workspace (regardless of the level of discount) if the 
space is not let through the Council ’s Affordable Workspace Commissioning Process 
(incorporating requirements for letting the head lease at peppercorn rent, with the 
space being let and managed b y a Council  approved operator ). 
 Major development proposals  for 1,000sqm  or more  (gross floorspace) of B1(a)  and/or 
B1(b) and/or general B1  and/or a Sui Generis use akin to B1(a)/B1(b)  floorspace  
within the CAZ, Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  area, CAZ fringe Spatial Strategy  areas  
of Angel and Upper Street and King’s Cross and Pentonville Road, PELs and Town 
Centre s, must  provide at least 10% of affordable workspace , as a proportion of 
proposed  B1(a)  and/or B1(b) and/or general B1  and/or a Sui Gener is use akin to 
B1(a)/B1(b)  floorspace  GIA .  
126 
 
 For proposals involving redevelopment, refurbishment (or refurbishment and 
extension), the requirement would apply to all redeveloped, refurbished and /or 
extended space,  regardless of the fact that there is exist ing floorspace . For proposals 
solely involving extension of floorspace with no change to existing floorspace, the 
requirement can be considered to apply to the new floorspace only. In the event that 
plans to refurbish existing floorspace were arbitrarily e xcluded and brought forward in 
a separate proposal (if it required planning permission), this would be subject to 
affordable workspace requirement at that time.  
 Where new business floorspace is proposed outside the locations  specified in Parts A 
and B of the policy25, and where 1,000sqm or more gross B1(a) and/or B1(b) and/or 
general B1  and/or a Sui Generis use akin to B1(a)/B1(b)  floorspace  is proposed , 
affordable workspace will be required. The quantum of affordable workspac e to be 
provided must be the maximum amount that is viable , based on site -specific viability 
information.  
 A requirement for affordable workspace will also apply to any major development 
proposals involving 1,000sqm or more gross B1(a)  and/or B1(b) and/or g eneral B1  
and/or a Sui Generis use akin to B1(a)/B1(b)  floorspace 26 within the LSIS s. Policies 
SP3 (with regard to the Vale Royal/Brewery Road LSIS specifically) and B2 are clear 
that industrial uses within B1(c), B2 and B8 use classes are the priority use s within the 
LSIS s, and that other business uses, namely B1(a) , B1(b)  and general B1 floorspace  
capable of being used for B1(a) or B1(b),  will not be permitted except as part of a 
hybrid workspace scheme  where such uses only  constitute a small proportion o f the 
overall gross floorspace proposed . Notwithstanding this , in circumstances where 
B1(a) , B1(b)  and/or general B1 is proposed , affordable workspace would be required  
from any permitted floorspace. There is no general requirement for seeking affordable 
workspace from industrial/hybrid uses  within the LSIS s as seeking affordable 
workspace from non -B1(a) /B1(b)/general B1  uses  in this area  is more likely to 
constrain viability of such uses and therefore  may preclude them coming forward, 
contrary to policy aims  for the area ; however, B1(a)  and B1(b)  floorspace  has no such 
viability concerns, and hence any proposals which would allow for the development of 
B1(a)  or B1(b)  must  provide affordable workspace. For avoidance of doubt, this 
requirement must  not undermi ne the clear policy position to resist non -industrial uses 
in the LSIS s. 
 In exceptional circumstances  (based on robust justification  including viability 
information consistent with the requirements o f the Development Viability SPD ), where 
the Council  accepts a level of affordable workspace that does not comply with  the 
policy requirements, the Council  will impose a late stage review mechanism which will 
reassess  the construction costs and commercial  values of the scheme at a future date. 
Any additional value arising over and above the projected position agreed by the 
Council  at the planning application stage would then  be utilised to extend the 
peppercorn period as far as possible.  
 Viability work undertaken by the Council  suggests that certain sites can  lease the 
space for a longer peppercorn period , including space  in perpetuity . The Council  will 
seek a peppercorn period longer than 20 years, including space in perpetuity  where  
case -by-case  viability  evidence  demonstrates this is possible.  
                                                
25 Such proposals would need to justify the suitability of the location in line with Policy B2  Part E . 
26 Sui Generis floorspace akin to B1(a) /B1(b)  is any floorspace where the predominant use is B1(a)  
and/or B1(b)  but the overarching lawful use is Sui Generi s by virtue of elements of other uses which 
would not constitute an ancillary use .  
127 
 
 Off-site contributions for affordable workspace may be sought in exceptional 
circumstances. These will be determined case -by-case but will generally be where the 
Council  is not satisfied with the proposed size or quality of the affordable workspace. 
This will be informed by engagement with  relevant stakeholders including  the Council ’s 
Inclusive Economy team. The following formula will be used to calculate off -site 
contributions27:  
Step 1 : calculate projected B1(a)  Office rental values from subject property or 
comparables ( on a per square metre per annum  basis ). 
Step 2 : Identify  10% of floorspace  in square metres  (NIA)  
Step 3:  10% of floorspace (from step 2) x rental value per square metre  (from step 1) = 
rent per annum  
Step 4 : identify B1(a)  Office yields from subject property or comparables  (All Risks Yield)  
Step 5: calculate multiplier as follows:  
(1+i)n) – 1) / (i (1+i) n) 
n = number of years at peppercorn rent (20 years)  
i = All Risks Yield ( calculated as Yield divided by 100)  
Step 6 : rent per annum x multiplier = level of Affordable Workspace Contribution required  
 
 An Affordable Workspace Statement must be provided to accompany any planning 
application involving affordable workspace.  The statement must  be developed at the 
earliest possible stage of development, ideally at pre -application stage, so it can 
meaningfully influence the affordable workspace to be delivered. Applicants must  
engage with all relevant stakeholders on the produc tion of the statement , including the 
Council . The statement  must set out key information on how affordable workspace will 
be delivered  and how its future operation will co -exist alongside other uses proposed. 
Information on  how affordable workspace require ments have informed and influenced 
the design and layout of proposals  must  also be provided.   
 The design of affordable workspace will vary , depending on the end  occupier or 
sector ; however, all affordable workspace units must be built to at least Category A Fit 
Out. There is no standard definition for Category A Fit Out, but for the purposes of this 
policy, it must include , as a minimum :  
 raised  floors and suspended ceilings;  
 internal surfac e finishes;  
 installation of mec hanical and electrical services;  
 toilets ; 
                                                
27 This formula may be updated in future through a SPD.  
128 
  blinds;  and  
 basic fire detection systems.  
 Applicants must  engage with the Council  at the earliest possible stage of development 
– ideally pre -application stage  - to ensure that the design is appropriate . Where 
additional fit -out requirements are identified, the Council  may require a higher standard 
to be provided, for example Category B Fit Out or specific aspects of Category B Fit 
Out such as floor boxes, partitioning and /or specific IT requirements . 
 The location of the affordable workspace withi n a development  is a particularly 
important consideration ; this must  not be an afterthought compri sing whatever space 
is leftover, particularly if such space was located below ground floor. Affordable 
workspace is suitable below ground floor in principle b ut detailed , proactive 
consideration must be given about how such space will operate in conjunction with 
other uses within the development; its suitability for a range of occupiers; and the level 
of amenity for occupiers, including levels of daylight and s unlight, inclusive design 
requirements and ceiling heights.  
 Applicants must  have regard to any relevant standards, guidance and/or best practice 
produced by the Council  or other relevant bodies such as the British Council  of Offices 
(BCO). Applicants must demonstrate that affordable workspace incorporates:  
 flexible internal arrangements that permit a number of different internal work areas 
to be accessed from shared spaces ; 
 good standards of internal sound insulation ; 
 access to  shared spaces and facilities, such as communal breakout space , 
meeting rooms , kitchen areas, bike storage and goods lifts ; and  
 external space reserved for loading/unloading.  
 Affordable retail unit (s) may be required in certain circumstances. Such units wo uld be 
let at a rate below the market rate, taking into account the location and the specific 
retail sector. It is expected that an affordable retail unit would usually be a small retail 
unit, which will help incentivise occupation by small and independent  retailers.  
 
A. On-site construction training opportunities for local residents are required from 
developments of 10 residential units or above ; hotels, student accommodation or 
hostels with 20 or more rooms; and non-residential developments with an uplift in 
floorspace of 500sqm GEA or greater.  
B. Jobs and training opportunities, including apprenticeships, will be required from 
developments where there is an uplift of 500sqm  GEA of employment floorspace 
(i.e. any emp loyment generating use).   
129 
 C. Financial contributions to help support initiatives which tackle  worklessness will be 
sought as set out in the Planning Obligations  (Section 106)  SPD.  
 
 Islington has a strong economy which makes a significant contribution to Londo n’s 
overall economy . The number of jobs in the borough increased by almost  30,000 
between 2005 and 2015, and the latest figures from 2013 indicate that there were 1.36 
jobs for every resident. However, significant inequality exists and Islington  has 
consistently shown an unemployment rate higher than the London average, 
demonstrating an apparent mismatch between the skills held by residents, and those 
required by employers.  
 Given the number of jobs in Islington is expected to increase by 50,500 up to the 2036, 
it is a key priority for the Council  that local residents are able to access these jobs. 
This is a cross -cutting objective which requires action from a range of Council  
departments and external agencies. Planning policies are just one way o f supporting 
residents in to work. On -site construction training opportunities will be required from 
major residential development; hotels, student accommodation or hostels with 20 or 
more rooms; and non -residential developments with an uplift in floorspac e of 500sqm 
GEA or greater . Other j obs and training opportunities, including apprenticeships , will 
be required from developments where there is an uplift of 500sqm GEA of employment 
floorspace (i.e. any employment generating use).  
 The Planning Obligations (Section 106) SPD provides further detail on the 
contributions required by policy B5.  
 Another contributor to the much wider response to worklessness in the borough is the 
Council ’s iWork service. In conjunction with local partners, iWork supports unemploye d 
Islington residents into work. The team provides a variety of services, from one -to-one 
employment support and focused support for young adults, to CV development  and 
help accessing childcare bursaries. The iWork service  will be promoted to developers 
at the earliest possible stage in the development process to ensure that local residents 
can benefit from new development.   
 The Council  will consider how planning powers, including planning obligations, can be 
utilised to support the work of the iWork servic e. This may include the introduction of a 
requirement for contributions toward childcare bursaries , as part of any future revision 
of the Planning Obligations (Section 106) SPD . The cost of childcare can be a major 
barrier which prevents parents returning to the workplace. Expanding the number of 
childcare bursaries will help to address this and therefore benefit families (in terms of 
improving quality of life and enabling additional income) while improving  the local 
workforce.   
130 
 Retail, Leisure and Services  
A. Town Centre s are a focal point for commercial, cultural and civic activity in the 
borough. There are four Town Centre s in Islington: Angel; Nags Head; Finsbury 
Park; and Archway. Each Town Centre  has its own character and serves different 
functions, which must  be maintained  and enhanced. Each Town Centre  is covered 
by a specific Spatial Strategy , set out in chapter 2. The Town Centre  boundaries are 
defined on the Policies Map and shown in Figures 4.2 to 4.5  below . 
B. The Council  will seek to ensure that all Town Centre s develop in a way that 
supports their continued vitality and viability to meet the needs of local residents, 
and provide a diverse retail and leisure  experience for residents , workers  and 
visitors alike.  
C. Primary Shopping Area s are where retail (particula rly A1 uses) are concentrated in 
Islington’s Town Centre s. The Primary Shopping Area  boundaries in each Town 
Centre  are defined on the Policies Map and shown in Figures 4.2 to 4.5 below . 
Retail uses will be subject to stronger protect ion in Primary Shoppin g Area s. 
Outside the Primary Shopping Area , a range of main Town Centre  uses are 
considered suitable, in order to promote and encourage diverse shopping and 
leisure destinations.  
D. LSAs provide more local services, particularly essential convenience retail w hich 
caters for daily shopping needs. Some LSAs also have a more diverse mix of 
commercial uses, particularly leisure uses, which can help to sustain the vibrancy of 
these areas. LSAs are identified  on the Policies Map . 
E. There are a number of other retail a nd leisure uses that provide a valuable service 
to local communities but are not within specifically designated areas. These 
dispersed uses, particularly within the A1 and A3 use classes, must  be protected.  
F. Residential uses have significant potential to ca use adverse impacts on the vitality 
and viability of designated retail areas. As such, they must  be located outside the 
Primary Shopping Area  (where proposed in a Town Centre)  and situated on upper 
floors  (where proposed elsewhere in Town Centres or in LSA s). Residential uses 
must  also fully prevent/mitigate risk of future impacts through  their design , 
consistent with relevant Local Plan policies including  the agent -of-change principle.  
G. Small shops contribute to the unique character of Islington and support local 
businesses. The Council  will protect existing small shops and promote new small 
shop provision as part of new developments.   
131 
 H. Specialist Shopping Areas, such as Fonthill Road and Camden Passage, have a 
unique function and character, and contribute to the vitality and viability of the 
borough. Retail uses in this area will be strongly protected.  
I. Retail , service and leisure uses will be resisted where, by virtue of their location 
and/or concentration, they would have negative impacts on the character, function 
and amenity of an area or would negatively impact on the health and wellbeing of 
the boroug h's residents.  
J. Within retail areas, streets will be actively managed to balance the de mands on the 
public realm from business es, particularly restaurants and cafés, and the need for 
easy pedestrian movement. Active frontages will be promoted.  
K. New retail development must incorporate the highest inclusive design standards 
achieva ble in contex t, in line with relevant guidance produced by the Council . 
Culture and the Night -Time Economy  
L. Cultural uses are an essential part of Islington’s social and economic fabric and their 
loss or diminution will be strongly resisted.  
M. Islington has a varied night -time economy which the Council  will seek to protect and 
enhance where appropriate. Concentrations of night -time economy uses exist in the 
borough including in designated Cultural Quarter s. The Council  will work with 
partners to support and manage a thrivi ng and safe night -time economy  that is well -
served by safe , convenient and sustainable night -time transport.”  
N. Angel Town Centre , Archway Town Centre  and part of the Clerkenwell and 
Farringdon area are designated Cultural Quarter s. All development proposals  within 
Cultural Quarter s must enhance the Cultural Quarter  by providing new/improved 
cultural uses and/or uses which support the cultural function within the Quarter and 
the character of the area.  
O. Pubs are part of Islington’s social fabric and they contribute positively to Islington’s 
culture, character and economy. The loss of pubs will be resisted and new pubs 
encouraged  where appropriate.  
P. The development  of new cultural and night -time economy use s must incorporate the 
highest inclusive design standards achievable in context , in line with relevant 
guidance produced by the Council . 
Visitor Accommodation  
Q. To ensure that land is safeguarded for uses which are greater strategic priorities in 
Islington, development, redevelopment and/or intensification of visitor 
accom modation will only be supported in specific locations.  
R. Visitor accommodation must be well -designed, accessible and sustainable.  
 
 Islington , on the whole,  has a  robust and thriving  retailing, leisure and service offer  
which serve s the needs of residents  and workers  and is part of what attracts  visitors to 
the borough. However, there are significant structural  challenges facing the retail  
132 
 sector , from internet sho pping to changing retailer and customer requirements and 
demands. Retail centres in Islington therefore need to adapt and futureproof for these 
changing circumstances while maintaining a level of retail needed to cater for local 
communities and workers ; the future for Town Centre s is as a ‘place to be’ rather than 
solely a ‘place to buy’. They are also places which encourage social interaction and 
play an important part in cohesive communities.  
 Major Town Centre s at Angel and Nag’s Head are at the top of the borough’s retail 
hierarchy, followed by District Town Centre s at Archway and Finsbury Park. Town 
Centre s are the key focus for new retail and leisure development.  
 LSAs sit below Town Centre s on the retail hie rarchy. These areas feature smaller 
scale, local retail uses. Dispersed retail uses  are at the bottom of the hierarchy . 
 Each of Islingto n's four Town Centre s has its own distinct character. Development 
must respect and enhance this, whilst meeting any requ irements  for new retail . 
Development proposals which  cause harm to the character, amenity, function, and/or 
vitality and viability of a Town Centre  will be resisted .  
 Each of Islington’s Town Centre s include s a Primary Shopping Area  designation. The 
Primar y Shopping Area  is located in the core of each  Town Centre  and is the focal 
point  for A1  uses. Units within the  Town Centre  outside of the Primary Shopping Area  
conversely have  greater  flexibility to change  to other suitable main Town Centre  uses 
which wil l help  increase the diversity and vibrancy of uses.   
 LSAs  and dispersed retail and leisure uses are an important part of Islington’s retail 
offer. They complement the more significant retail offer in designated Town Centre s 
and play an important role in s erving the needs of residents across the borough. They 
provide a convenient,  valuable service to their surrounding communities by meeting 
the day -to-day shopping needs of residents, workers and visitors as well as providing 
other services including some le isure uses. LSAs also play an important social role for 
the surrounding community, providing a commercial focal point and meeting point 
where people can interact and socialise. These areas contribute  to the character and 
identity of an area.  
 Development proposals will be resisted where they result in an unacceptable 
concentration of night -time economy uses, hot food takeaways, betting shops and 
other gambling facilities, financial and professional services such as payday loan 
shops or estate agents , or other similar uses. It is important to ensure a mix and 
balance of complementary day and night -time uses that creates an attractive and 
vibrant area that co -exists successfully with neighbouring residential areas and does 
not significantly compromise wellbei ng. Certain types of uses can cause detrimental 
cumulative impacts as a result of their concentration or location. The Council  will 
therefore resist applications for such uses where they would cause harm . 
 Residential uses in Town Centre s and LSAs can be de trimental to the function of a 
retail centre, especially if they occupy units on the ground floor or below. Breakages in 
retail frontages, especially in the centre of frontages can have adverse impacts on the 
vitality, viability and character of shopping a reas. Occupation of upper floors by 
residential uses are more appropriate although these must  not harm  the functioning of 
retail and leisure centres in the borough.  
 The highest possible i nclusive design standards,  including step free access, must  be 
incor porated into new retail  development, in line with the Inclusive Design SPD  and  
133 
 other relevant Council  guidance . Developments must also provide adequate provision 
for mobility scooter storage and charging.  
 Retail to residenti al prior approval applications, currently permitted under Part 3, Class 
M of the Gene ral Permitted Development Order (“the GPDO”)  will be assessed against 
relevant Local Plan policies related to prior approval categories ; such policies are 
material to the prior approval determination . The most relevant prior approval category 
related to land use is condition M.2(1)(D), which requires an assessment of whether it 
is undesirable for the building to change to residential use because of the impact of the 
change of use:  
(i) on adequate provision of  Use Class A1/A2 , but only where there is a reasonable 
prospect of the building bein g used to provide such services;  or 
(ii) where the building is located in a key shopping area, on the sustainab ility of that 
shopping area.  
 Applicable policies will be dependent  on the location of the buil ding subject to the 
application, for example policies R2 and R3 will apply to applications in the Primary 
Shopping Area  of Town Centre s, while policy R4 will apply to applications in LSAs. In 
the absence of a definition of the term ‘ key shopping area ’ set out in the GPDO, a key 
shopping area (for the purposes of any prior approval assessment) will be considered 
to be any Town Centre  or LSA designated in the Local Plan.  
 Dispersed shops are not key shopping areas, hence they will be assessed under the 
first criterion of condition M .2(1)(D). Given the densely populated nature of the 
borough , which creates significant demand for retail uses, it is considered that 
dispers ed shop buildings  will always have a reasonable prospect of bein g used to 
provide retail services.  
 The Council  seeks to protect and enhance the variety of cultural attractions in Islington 
which contribute to the economy as well as enhancing the lives of residents and 
visitors. There  is no set list of ‘cultural’ uses. The Council  will encourage existing 
businesses and premises to diversify and introduce a new or enhanced inclusive 
cultural offer. Typical cultural attractions include pubs, theatres, working men’s clubs, 
bingo halls, music venues, galleries, museums, bars, nightclubs, restaurants, 
conference centres, and community festivals. Isli ngton has a wealth of cultural 
attractions which belies its size as the second smallest borough in London; this 
includes several museum and archive sites, various music venues and cinemas, a 
strong community arts sector and a number of dance and theatre ve nues (providing 
London’s largest theatre offer outside the West End), notably the renowned Sadler’s 
Wells, King’s Head and Almeida theatres in Angel and the Park Theatre in Finsbury 
Park.  
 Islington’s Arts Strategy sets out the borough’s vision and approach  to enhancing 
artistic and cultural potential to enrich people’s lives and further the development of  a 
modern dynamic economy.  
 Islington has a 24 -hour economy, with uses operating at night playing an integral role. 
The night -time economy refers to all eco nomic activity taking place between the hours 
of 6pm and 6am28. Activities associated with the night -time economy are varied and 
include eating, drinking, entertainment, shopping but also include cleaning, hospitality, 
                                                
28 The ‘night -time economy includes the ‘evening economy’ which describes economic and leisure 
activity between the hou rs of 6pm - 12pm.   
134 
 logistics and distribution, transport and medical services which employ a large number 
of night -time workers. These varied activities all require good quality infrastructure to 
make the movement of people efficient, safe and attractive.  
 The Council  will generally support the diversification of  daytime uses to extend their 
opening hours and offer alternative daytime and night -time activities in appropriate 
locations, depending on existing concentrations and amenity impacts.   
 Cultural and night -time economy activities, must  be located in the CAZ or Town 
Centre s and will be especially encouraged in Cultural Quarter s. This allows for a 
critical mass of these uses to support a vibrant and viable clustering, in areas which 
are commercially -focused and therefore less likely to lead to adverse amenity i mpacts, 
especially for residential uses. There are also benefits in the form of containing 
adverse impacts such as noise and being able to direct resources for the management 
of the night -time economy activities. However, encouraging a critical mass does n ot 
detract from the importance of balancing needs so that a variety of existing and new 
uses can thrive.  
 Islington is a small but diverse borough with four designated Town Centre s (Angel, 
Nags Head, Archway and Finsbury Park) as well as the Bunhill and Cl erkenwell wards 
which together make up the majority of Islington’s part of the CAZ. The Council  
recognise that culture is varied and perceived differently across the borough with 
different centres having a varied level of appeal. Where  relevant , Spatial St rategy  
policies  and the Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  provide further detail on the cultural offer 
of specific centres/areas.  
 The amenity of local residents and businesses in the vicinity of licensed premises will 
be considered and protected. Islington Coun cil’s licensing policy mitigate s impacts 
such as noise, odour and litter. The Council ’s Licensing Team and licensing policy is  
separate to the Planning Department and planning policies. However, the Council ’s 
licensing team must  be consulted on any plannin g application which proposes a 
licensable activity. In most cases, except in exceptional circumstances, the Council ’s 
licensing policy expects applicants to have planning consent before making an 
application for a premises license.  
 The highest possible i nclusive design standards,  including step free access, must  be 
incorporated into new culture and night -time economy  development, in line with the 
Inclusive Design SPD  and other relevant Council  guidance . Developments must also 
provide adequate provision for mobility scooter storage and charging.  
 Islington has a strong record of delivering visitor accommodation. Well -designed visitor 
accommodation in appropriate locations can play an important supporting role in the 
Islington and London e conomy, facilitating tourism and supporting the operations of 
other businesses while also having some direct (relatively low density) employment 
benefits.  
 However, business flo orspace  is the main driver of economic growth in the borough, 
and is considered the best means to meet Islington’s significant jobs projections with a 
projected additional floorspace  need for office use of 400,000sqm by 2036. 
Considering the role of visitor accommodation as a supporting use, alongside the 
significant past delivery, th e Council  considers that locations for visitor accommodation 
(both new -build accommodation and/or redevelopment/intensification of existing visitor  
135 
 accommodation) must  be restricted to ensure that visitor accommodation does not limit 
the achievement of oth er priorities, particularly economic and housing growth.  
 
A. Within Primary Shopping Area s, the percentage of A1 uses must  be maintained at a 
minimum of 60% in Angel and Nag’s Head  Major Town Centre s; 55% in Finsbury 
Park District Town Centre ; and 50% in Archway District Town Centre . 
B. Proposals which result in the percentage of A1 uses in a Primary Shopping Area  
falling below the percentages in Part A must:  
(i) demonstrate that the premises have  been vacant for a continuous period of at 
least two years. Continuous marketing evidence to cover this period must be 
provided, to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the unit being 
used for continued A1 use, or other appropriate main Town  Centre  uses;  
(ii) prevent/mitigate any individual or cumulative impact on the vitality, viability, 
character, vibrancy and predominantly A1 retail function of the Primary 
Shopping Area ;  
(iii) provide an active frontage at ground floor level, particularly where fron ting main 
transport/pedestrian route(s); and  
(iv) ensure there is no harmful break in the continuity of retail units.  
 
 To ensure vitality and viability is maintained, the Primary Shopping Area s of Islington’s 
Town Centre s will be protected and enhanced. Primar y Shopping Area s contain the 
greatest concentration of shops (A1 retail use ); are the most accessible part of the 
Town Centre ; and  are key to protecting the character and function of Town Centre s 
and ensuring the ir continued vibrancy, vitality and viabilit y. Where proposals within 
Town Centre s fall outside the Primary Shopping Area , Policy R3 will apply .  
 To ensure a critical mass of retailing uses is maintained within Primary Shopping 
Area s, the A1 retail function must  remain the principal use; this will b e achieved by 
imposing a specific percentage requirement for A1 uses within Primary Shopping 
Area s. Proposals which would result in the overall percentage falling below this 
minimum level must provide marketing and vacancy evidence and meet other criteria 
to demonstrate that potential adverse impacts are prevented. Appendix 1 sets out the 
information to be provided in relation to marketing of vacant floorspace . 
 To determine t he existing  Primary Shopping Area s A1 percentage figure, the number 
of Use Class A1 units  with a ground floor presence  within the Primary Shopping Area  
should be  divided by the total number of units  with a ground floor presence  within the 
Primary Shopping Area . A unit with a ground floor presence would include those with 
additional space  below and /or above ground floor level. Other methods to calculate the 
percentage, for example considering only specific frontages, will not be acceptable for 
the purposes of meeting policy R2.   
136 
 
 While the loss of space below and above ground fl oor level may  not trigger policy R2 
where a ground floor use is unaffected, policy R3 Part F may apply. Where the change 
of use of ancillary space below and/or above ground floor  level would necessitate 
significant changes to the frontage to facilitate separate access,  this must  be factored 
into the frontage percentage calculations, e.g. it must  be classed as the introduction of 
a separate use into the frontage, which would affect the percentage calculations.  
 To ensure the Primary Shopping Area s sustain their vitality a nd function as the retail 
hubs of Town Centre s, it is important to avoid harmful breaks in retail frontage s. What 
constitutes as a ‘harmful break’ will be assessed on a case by case basis taking into 
account site specific circumstances , but generally refer s to the introduction of  a use 
that does not complement the Primary Shopping Area  and detracts from the continuity 
of a publicly accessible, active and engaging frontage. This includes  conversion to 
non-commercial uses in the centre of a frontage, corner u nits or larger units. Heritage 
considerations, shopfront design and the relationship to neighbouring units will also be 
considered.  
 
A. The Council  will seek to maintain and enhance the retail, service and leisure 
function of Islington’s four Town Centre s, which are designated on the Policies Map  
and shown on Figures 4.2 to 4.5 . 
B. Proposals for A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre  use floorspace  
should be located within a designated Town Centre . Proposals for these uses 
outside a designated Town Centre  will only be permitted where they meet relevant 
criteria under Part C, D or E.   
C. Proposals for A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Ce ntre use floorspace  in 
the CAZ may be acceptable where:  
(i) the scale of the development would not have an adverse individual or 
cumulative impact on the character, function, vitality and viability of Islington’s 
Town Centre s or LSAs. An impact assessment may be required to fully assess 
potential impact;  
(ii) the proposal can be accommodated without adverse impact on the amenity of 
residents and businesses; and  
(iii) the proposal does not involve the loss of existing business floorspace ; 
complements the overarching busine ss floorspace  focus within the CAZ; and 
does not detract from the policy requirement to maximise the amount of 
business floorspace  as part of new development.  
D. Proposals for up to 200sqm of A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre  use 
in LSAs are not r equired to meet the sequential test. Proposals in excess of 200sqm 
must meet the sequential test and actively investigate and consider preferable 
locations in line with the Council ’s retail hierarchy. An impact assessment may also 
be required for proposals  in excess of 200sqm, to assess the impact of larger 
proposals on the existing character and function of the LSA and relevant Town 
Centre s.  
137 
 E. Any proposal for A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre  use floorspace  in 
an edge -of-centre location outside LSAs or in an out -of-centre location must:  
(i) meet the sequential test and actively investigate and consider sequentially 
preferable locations in line with the Council ’s retail hierarchy, and provide robust 
justification for not locating in sequentially preferable locations; and  
(ii) provide a detailed impact assessment which determines whether there would be 
likely significant adverse impacts on relevant Town Centre s and/or LSAs. 
F. Any development proposed within a designated Town Centre  must : 
(i) be of an appropriate scale related to the size and role of the centre;  
(ii) ensure there are no adverse impacts on vibrancy, vitality and viability of the 
centre, including as a result of concentrations of non -A1 uses.  
(iii) provide a frontage which engages positively with lo cal character and the street 
scene . Where historic shopfronts and features are present, these must  be 
retained . 
(iv) provide a high quality design including meeting policies related to accessibility 
and sustainability;  
(v) provide a good level of amenity for reside nts and businesses and ensure that 
adverse impacts from noise, odour, fumes, anti -social behaviour and other 
potential harms are fully mitigated ; 
(vi) not involve the loss of ancillary floorspace  (e.g. storage, back -office functions) 
which could compromise the future operation of the retail unit and make the unit 
less desirable for future occupiers  
G. Residential uses are not suitable in Town Centre s at Ground Floor level or below . 
Any applications for residential uses in such locations will be strongly resisted. 
Applications involving the change of use from existing A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis 
main Town Centre  uses (on any floors) to residential use must:  
(i) demonstrate that the premises have  been vacant for a continuous period of at 
least two years. Continuous mark eting evidence to cover this period must be 
provided, to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the unit being 
used in its current use or any other main Town Centre  use which could 
reasonably be assumed to occupy the premises;  
(ii) follow the ‘agen t-of-change’ principle consistent with policy DH5. 
(iii) not involve the loss of ancillary floorspace  (e.g. storage, back -office functions) 
which could compromise the future operation of the retail unit and make the unit 
less desirable for future occupiers;  
(iv) ensure that access to the proposed residential use does not affect the operation 
of any continued A1-A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre  use 
floorspace  or impact on the streetscene and the provision of an active frontage , 
especially where the loss of  floorspace is proposed to facilitate access; and 
(v) provide high quality dwellings with a high standard of residential amenity, 
consistent with other relevant policies, including those relating to housing 
standards, design, accessibility and sustainability.  
H. Any applications for new residential uses in Town Centre  locations not involving 
change of use of existing A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre  uses  
138 
 must be located on upper floors. Proposals must address criteria set out in Part G(ii) 
to (v).

Shopping Area  of each centre :

 Islington 's Town Centre s are the primary focus for retailing in the borough. The core of 
A1 retailing in Town Centre s is focused in  Primary Shopping Area s (see policy R2) , 
with locations outside of this suitable for a range of A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main 
Town Centre  uses29. 
 Ensuring that retail and other important services and facilities (such as solicitors, post 
offices, groceries and newsagents) remain readily acces sible is essential to the vitality 
and viability of Town Centre s. Focusing these shops and services within Town Centre s 
will contribute to the inclusivity and sustainability of local communities and the local 
economy, and reduce the number and length of tr ips undertaken.  
 To promote the economic and cultural function  of Town Centres , in line with the 
National Planning Policy Framework, the Council  will apply a sequential approach to 
assessing applications for retail, services, entertainment, assembly and lei sure uses 
outside of the Town Centre s30. For the purposes of this policy, the local impact 
assessment threshold is 0sqm, meaning that any proposal in an edge -of-centre or out -
of-centre location may be required to submit an impact assessment . The level of de tail 
provided in the impact assessment must  be proportionate to the scale of the proposed 
development .  
 Offices in the B1 use class are also considered a Town Centre  use however such 
applications will be considered in relation to other relevant Local Plan policies  and their 
impact on the predominant retail and leisure function of Town Centre s.  
 Londo n's CAZ has a unique role in the retail hierarchy. The CAZ function is primarily 
linked to business floorspace , but retail uses are important supporting uses. T he CAZ 
contains clusters of retail premises, notably at Angel (partly covered by the CAZ), 
which is a designated Town Centre . There are four LSAs  within the CAZ, covered by 
policy  R4 and the Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP . Given the nature of the CAZ, retail 
uses are also dispersed in numerous other locations. Proposals for new A1 -A5, D2 
and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre  use floorspace  within the CAZ may be 
appropriate where it would not undermine the overarching business function of the 
CAZ, and would not d etrimentally affect the vitality and viability of Town Centre s and/or 
local amenity. An impact assessment may be required where the proposed scale of 
retail could have adverse impacts on nearby Town Centre s, LSAs  or other 
undesignated clusters of retail, s ervice and leisure uses.  
 Residential uses on ground floors or below are not appropriate in Town Centre s, 
primarily due to the harmful break in shopfront continuity which  affects the viability, 
vitality and vibrancy of the centre , and therefore is detrimental to the retail and 
commercial function of Town Centre s. Ground floor and basement levels can often 
also provide ancillary space for storage or backroom functions and therefore must  be 
preserved for the effective operation of re tail and commercial units. Residential 
development on the ground floor or below also raises issues of amenity for the future 
residential occupiers, as  Town Centre  uses create heavy footfall and can create 
disturbance.  The quality  of shop conversions to res idential is generally poor and 
therefore would not provide high quality housing as required by policy H4 . 
 For proposals to change the use of existing ground floor units (or below) , continuous 
marketing evidence will be required demonstrating lack of demand  for main Town 
                                                
29 B1 uses are also suitable Town Centre  uses ; however, proposals for B1 uses in Town Centre s will 
be assessed against policy B2.  
30 The sequential approach does not apply to D1 uses, for example, health clinics, museums and day 
centres. Applications for new D1 uses will be assessed against policy SC1 .  
144 
 Centre  uses. Appendi x 1 sets out the information to be provided in relation to 
marketing of vacant floorspace .  
 Residential uses may be suitable on upper floors in Town Centres, out side of Primary 
Shopping Area s, where they adhere to specifi ed criteria set out in the policy. With 
regard to facilitating access to upper floor residential units, this must not affect the 
continued operation of any A1-A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre use 
floorspace , or impact the streetscene or the provi sion of an active frontage. The loss of 
such floorspace to facilitate access would trigger Part G of policy R3, unless it was of 
such a small scale that it was considered de minimis. Other policies may also apply, 
for example policy DH7.  
 
A. All proposals must  maintain and enhance the retail and service function of the Local 
Shopping Areas  (shown in Figure 4.6) .  
B. Proposals involving the change of use fr om A1 – including ground floor, basement 
and first floor operational or ancillary space - to non -A1 commercial use must 
demonstrate that:  
(i) the premises have  been vacant for a continuous period of at least six months 
and continuous marketing evidence to cover this period has been provided 
which demonstrates that there is no reas onable prospect of the unit being 
used in its current A1 use;  
(ii) there would not be a significant adverse effect on amenity, particularly the 
surrounding residential amenity ; and  
(iii) the proposal does not cause any individual or cumulative adverse impact on 
the vitality, viability, character, vibrancy and function of the area . 
C. Residential uses in Local Shopping Areas at Ground Floor level or below will be 
strongly resisted. Applications for the change of use of A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis 
main Town Centre  use floorspace to residential use and/or a use other than those 
specified in Part B  must:  
 
(i) demonstrate that the premises have  been vacant for a continuous period of at 
least two years and continuous marketing evidence to cover this period has 
been provided, whic h demonstrates that there is no reasonable prospect of 
the unit being used in its current use and any other use which could 
reasonably be assumed to occupy the premises;  
(ii) prevent/mitigate any individual or cumulative impact on the vitality, viability, 
character, vibrancy and function of the area;  
(iii) comply with the ‘agent -of-change’ principle consistent with Policy DH 5; 
(iv) not create  a harmful break in the frontage of the Local Shopping Area;  
(v) not involve the loss of ancillary floorspace (e.g. storage, back -office functions) 
which could compromise the loss of ancillary space that is integral to the  
145 
 future operation of the retail unit and make the unit less desirable for future 
occupiers in the future  
(vi) ensure that access to the proposed residential use does not affect the 
operation of any continued A1-A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre 
use floorspace or impact on the streetscene and the provision of an active 
frontage , especially where the loss of floorspace is proposed to facilitate 
access ; and  
(vii) provide h igh quality dwellings with a high standard of residential amenity, 
consistent with other policies relating to housing standards, design, 
accessibility and sustainability.    
D. Any applications for new residential uses in a Local Shopping Area not involving 
change of use of existing A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main Town Centre  uses must 
be located on upper floors. Proposals must address criteria set out in Part C (ii), (iii), 
(v), (vi) and (vii)  of Policy R 4.   
 
 
 LSAs  are an important part of Islington’s retail offer. These areas  vary in size and the 
role they provide. There are 40 LSAs in Islington, as follows:  
1. Hillrise  
2. Whitehall Park  
3. Highgate Hill  
4. Crouch Hill  
5. Hornsey Road North  
6. Hornsey Road (Tollington)  
7. Tollington Park  
8. Seven Sisters Road  
9. Upper Holloway  
10. Campdale  
11. Cardwell Terrace  
12. Hillmarton Terrace

 The impact of proposals will therefore affect LSAs differently, with the loss of A1 uses 
in smaller LSAs being felt more acutely. The impact on the amenity of local users of a 
LSA will depend on its size, the current mix of uses , and  its proximity to other centres 
(whether that be LSAs or Town Centre s).  
 LSAs are not immune from wider changes to the retail environment, and therefore 
need to be resilient to any future changes, such as increases in online shopping. For 
LSAs to be resilient they need to be able to change use class more flexibly in 
response t o changing demands and trends in local shopping. The six -month period of 
vacancy and marketing evidence for a change of use from A1 to non -A1 commercial 
uses reflects this increased flexibility  
 Non-A1 commercial uses refer to those uses that provide an act ive frontage and 
enhance the function of Town Centre s through employment or the provision of leisure 
and retail services. Non -A1 commercial uses may include A2 -A5, B1(a) , B1(c) , D2 and 
some Sui Generis uses. However, non -A1 commercial uses can vary in thei r impact, 
therefore proposals of this nature (including what constitutes a suitable non -A1 
commercial use)  will be assessed on a case by case basis.  
 In order to protect the function of LSAs, proposals to change the use of ground floor 
units (including spac e below ground floor) from A1 -A5, D2 and/or Sui Generis main 
Town Centre  use floorspace  to residential use will be required to provide  marketing 
and vacancy evidence for a period of two years, to demonstrate that there is no 
continued demand for the existing use and any other use which could reasonably be 
assumed to occupy the premises.  
 Proposals of this nature must also not cause a harm ful break in the continuity of retail 
frontages. What constitutes as a ‘harmful break’ will be assessed on a case by case 
basis taking into account site specific circumstances , but generally refers to  the 
introduction of  a use that does not complement the LSA and detracts from the 
continuity of a publicly accessible, active and engaging frontage. This includes  
conversion to non -commercial uses in the centre of a frontage, corner units or larger 
units. Heritage considerations, shopfront design and the relati onship to neighbouring 
units will also be considered.  
 Residential uses may be suitable on upper floors in LSAs where they adhere to 
specified criteria set out in the policy. With regard to facilitating access to upper floor 
residential units, this must not  affect the continued operation of any A1-A5, D2 and/or 
Sui Generis main Town Centre use floorspace , or impact the streetscene or the 
provision of an active frontage. The loss of such floorspace to facilitate access would 
trigger Part C of policy R4, unles s it was of such a small scale that it was considered 
de minimis. Other policies may also apply, for example policy DH7.  
 
 
 
 
  
149 
 A. The Council  will support and protect A1 uses located outside designated Town 
Centre s and LSAs. Proposals involving the loss of dispersed shops – including 
ground floor, basement and first floor operational or ancillary space  - must:  
 
(i) demonstrate that the premises have  been vacant for a continuous period of at 
least one year. Continuous marketing evidence to cover this period must be 
provided, to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the unit being 
used in its current use; and  
(ii) provide evidence that there w ill be accessible provision of essential daily 
goods (typically convenience retail) within a short walking distance (within 
300m).  
B. The Council  will support and protect dispersed A3 uses located outside designated 
Town Centre s and LSAs. Proposals involving the loss of dispersed A3 units  – 
including  ground floor, basement  and first floor  operational or ancillary space - must:  
 
(i) demonstrate that the premises have  been vacant for a continuous period of at 
least six months. Continuous marketing evidence to cover this period must be 
provided, to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the unit being 
used in its current use; and  
(ii) demonstrate that the loss of the A3 unit will not have an adverse impact on the 
local community, including through the loss of social value.  
C. Proposals for the change of use of dispersed A1 or A3 units to residential use will 
only be considered acceptable where Part A and B of this policy are satisfied, where 
high quality dwellings with a high standard of residential amenity will b e provided 
consistent with other policies and standards relating to housing and design, and 
where the Change of Use would not detrimentally affect the street scene and/or the 
wider character of an area . 
 
 Local shops located outside designated Town Centre s and LSAs can provide a 
valuable service to the local community by providing for essential day -to-day needs. 
Their accessibility is particularly important for those with mobility difficulties.  
 There has been a loss of a number of local shops, particularly  to residential use, in 
recent years. Continuous marketing evidence will be required for proposals for the 
Change of Use of existing retail units, demonstrating lack of demand for retail or an 
appropriate commercial use that provides an essential service t o residents. Appendix 
1 sets out the information to be provided in relation to marketing of vacant floorspace . 
 Protection of A1 units can assist with  work to mitigate the prevalence of food deserts in 
the borough , in line with the overarching plan objectiv e on healthy environments . Food 
deserts are where local access to affordable and healthy food is lacking, which can 
contribute to ill health including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and mental health 
problems. Accessible provision of essential goods has m ultiple benefits including a 
balanced diet, active travel, reduced transport congestion, and increased social 
contact.   
150 
 
 Dispersed A3 leisure units can contribute positively towards the vibrancy and character 
of places outside of Town Centre s and LSAs, espec ially in residential areas. These 
units often provide an inclusive meeting place within a community, contributing to 
community cohesion and can significantly increase the wellbeing and social interaction 
of those with mobility issues such as the elderly. F acilitating social contact through A3 
premises benefits mental health and promotes civic activity by providing spaces that 
can be used as informal community hubs. The Council  will seek to protect such uses 
and any change of use must provide evidence that loss of the A3 unit will not have an 
adverse impact on the local community. Appendix 1 sets out the information to be 
provided in relation to marketing of vacant floorspace . 
 Proposals for the Change of Use of dispersed A1/A3 to residential use must 
demonstr ate and ensure a high standard of design and residential amenity for 
occupants  (consistent with policy H4 ), and must  not lead to unacceptable adverse 
impacts on the street scene and the character of an area.  
 
A. The Council  views the retention of small shops as a baseline and places great weight 
on the need to retain any shops which currently or potentially could be utilised by 
small retailers. In order to encourage new provision of small shop units, the Council  
will seek to  secure small shop units (generally considered to be units of around 
80sqm GIA or less) suitable for occupation by small retailers by:  
 
(i) requiring proposals for new retail development to incorporate small shop 
premises , proportionate to the scale of the proposal ; 
(ii) requiring proposals for the redevelopment of small shop units to incorporate 
adequate re -provision of small units to compensate for any loss, particularly 
for essential services;  
(iii) requiring proposals for major housing developments to incorporate s mall shop 
units where there is no accessible provision of essential daily goods available 
within a short walking distance (within 300m); and  
(iv) where appropriate, attaching conditions to permissions for small shop units, 
requiring planning permission to be so ught for the future amalgamation of 
units into larger premises; specifying a certain level of convenience goods in 
order to protect and promote essential services; and/or making planning 
consent personal to a specific individual/organisation.  
B. In order to maintain Islington’s retail character, particularly the prevalence of small 
shop units, the Council  will resist the amalgamation of individual shop units 
incorporating A Use Classes. Amalgamation of retail units may be suitable where 
development proposals demonstrate that the intensification of use would not:  
 
(i) detrimentally affect the street scene and/or character of the local area; and/or  
 cause unacceptable adverse impacts on the local environment and/or 
amenity, including impacts from altered/intensified delivery and servicing 
arrangements. 
151 
  
 Islington's many small shops help lend the borough its special character and contribute 
to the identity of its neighbourhoods. Small shops provide an important role in 
servicing the day -to-day needs of local residents, workers and visitors, and can 
provide  greater consumer choice and local employment. Certain types of small and 
independent shops perform an essential service and must  be easily accessible to all 
residents. These essential services can include butchers, bakers, greengrocers, 
grocers, fishmongers, chemists, post offices, newsagents, cobblers, hardware stores, 
dry cleaners and laundrettes. The loss of shop units suitable for such shops, 
particularly units which contribute to local character, individuality, convenience and the 
wider comme rcial success of an area, will be resisted. Applicants for significant retail 
developments will be encouraged to seek out independent retailers for small units 
wherever possible  
 For the purposes of policy R6, a small shop is generally considered to be a un it of 
around 80sqm GIA or less, usually within the A1 use class. Retention of units suitable 
for occupation by small retailers must  be the starting point when drafting development 
proposals. Any proposals which have not explored the possibility of retainin g these 
units will be resisted.  
 Proposals for new retail development in the borough must  incorporate small shop 
premises suitable for occupation by small retailers. Proposals for major residential 
developments will also be required to provide small shops w here no suitable retail 
provision is accessible within a short walking distance (300m or less). Proposals 
involving the loss of existing small shops must  re-provide small shop units. Where new 
small shop units are provided, the Council  may put in place mea sures to  control their 
occupation, and guard against future loss through use of relevant planning conditions.  
 The amalgamation of individual shop units can result in material impacts, primarily 
relating to physical changes and intensification of use. Amalg amation of shop units will 
be resisted where they materially and detrimentally affect the character of Islingto n's 
shopping areas, including the impact of amended shopfronts. Amalgamated shop units 
may also result in different patterns of delivery and serv icing; small supermarkets, for 
example, depend on very fast sales rates, which (where adequate storage is not 
available) requires  ‘just in tim e’ deliveries. This can result in more traffic movements by 
delivery vehicles, which in turn can impact on residen tial amenity and environmental 
quality, and cause adverse impacts on the local highway. Where unacceptable 
adverse impacts arise, the amalgamation of individual shop units will be resisted.  
Policy T5 will be used to assess proposed delivery and servicing a rrangements.  
 
A. The Council  will seek to maintain, and support the enhancement of, existing markets 
within the borough.  
 
B. New markets are encouraged in Town Centre s and appropriate locations in the CAZ, 
where they support and enhance the function of a specific locality  and do not 
adversely impact any predominant ‘bricks -and-mortar’ based uses.   
152 
  
C. The Council  will continue to protect and promote the role of Specialist Shopping 
Areas at Camden Passage and Fonthill Road. Proposals which result in the 
percentage of A1 uses in the Specialist Shopping Areas falling below 75% must:  
 
(i) demonstrate that the premises have been vacant for a continuous period of at 
least two years. Continuous marketing evidence to cover this period must be 
provided, to demonstrate that there is no reasonable prospect of the unit being 
used for continued A1 use or other retail or leisure use s which would 
complement the specialist shopping function;  
(ii) ensure that the proposal would not result in a break in continuity of retail 
frontage of more than one non -A1 unit in any linear stretch of three units.  
(iii) prevent/mitigate any individual or cumulativ e impact on the vitality, viability, 
character, vibrancy and predominantly A1 retail function of the Specialist 
Shopping Area; and  
(iv) provide an active frontage at ground floor level fronting main 
transport/pedestrian route(s).  
D. Regardless of the resulting per centage of A1 uses, p roposals that result in the partial 
loss of A1 floorspace  (including ancillary floorspace ) in Specialist Shopping Areas 
must demonstrate that the loss will not undermine the effective operation of the A1 
unit and/or collectively undermine the function of the Specialist Shopping Area.   
 
 
 There are three well established street markets in Islington, at Chapel Market, 
Exmouth Market and Whitecross Street, as well as the covered market at Nag’s Head 
and other regular markets in certa in locations including Camden Passage and 
Archway. Markets are very popular with shoppers and visitors because of their 
vibrancy and the range and variety of goods on offer. Markets also add to the 
character of local areas, create employment opportunities,  support regeneration and 
promote social interaction.  They can also act as a testing ground for new small 
businesses.  
 The Council  wishes to see markets continue and thrive, and will encourage a co -
ordinated approach to development and management of markets  in matters such as 
deployment of signage, pavement furniture and other market infrastructure. New 
markets must  make a positive contribution to character and support the existing 
function of the proposed location whilst complementing existing shops and ser vices. If 
markets are poorly designed and managed , they can cause harm to surrounding areas 
in terms of congestion of local roads and pavements, rubbish and refuse, storage and 
noise.  
 Specialist Shopping Areas provide a significant benefit to their local a reas, with the 
ability to draw shoppers from outside the borough due to the more bespoke nature of 
the goods on offer, as well as adding significant value to the character and vitality of 
their respective areas. Specialist Shopping Areas in Islington –the antique/curio shops 
at Camden Passage in Angel and the clothing shops at Fonthill Road in Finsbury Park 
– have a high level of units in A1 use and provide a major contribution toward a 
healthy retail offer in these centres. The retention of at least 75% A1  use in these 
areas will maintain the specialist character and function of these areas.  
 Fonthill Road has a rich history of fashion manufacturing and wholesale commerce. 
The upper floors of buildings on Fonthill Road were used as workshops and are now  
153 
 generally used either for storage or have been converted to other uses. The Council  
will seek to retain these upper floor ancillary spaces (e.g. storage space, back office) in 
all Specialist Shopping Areas to support the effective operation of the retail unit s or for 
stand -alone uses –- including SME units for creative enterprises –- which complement 
the area and do not adversely impact the ongoing operation of the area. Proposals 
that result in the partial loss of A1 floorspace  (including ancillary floorspace ) in 
Specialist Shopping Areas must demonstrate that the loss will not undermine the 
effective operation of the A1 unit and/or collectively undermine the function of the 
Specialist Shopping Area.  
 To determine the  percentage of A1 uses in Specialist Shopping Areas , the total 
number of A1 units within the Specialist Shopping Area should be divided by the total 
number of units within the Specialist Shopping Area. The Fonthill Road Specialist 
Shopping Area incorporates some units on Wells Terrace as well as those  on Fonthill 
Road. The Camden Passage Specialist Shopping Area includes units on Camden 
Passage and Pierrepoint Row.  
 
A. Proposals will be resisted where they result in an unacceptable concentration of uses, 
such as night -time economy uses, hot food takeaways, betting shops and other 
gambling facilities, payday loan shops , estate agents. Concentration of uses will be 
assessed based on the number of units within a 500m radius of the proposed 
development. Proposals must be accompanied by sufficient information to allow for 
assessment of concentration and potential impacts, including information on how 
these uses will be managed and operated.  
 
B. In addition to the general assessment of overconcentration  in Par t A: 
 
(i) proposals for hot food takeaways (Use Class A5) will be resisted within 200m 
of primary and secondary schools.  
(ii) proposals for hot food takeaways  (Use Class A5) will be resisted where :  
a. they would result in  4% or more of total units being in A5 use, in LSAs of 
26 units or more ; or 
b. they would result in two or more A5 units, i n LSAs with 25 units or less . 
 
(iii) proposals for betting shops and adult gaming centres will be resisted where:  
a. they would result in  4% or more of total units being in betting shop/adult 
gaming centre use, in LSAs of 26 units or more ; or 
b. they would result in two or more betting shop/adult gaming centre units , in 
LSAs with 25 units or less . 
 
(iv) proposals for betting shops or adult gaming c entres  in Town Centre s will not 
be permitted where there is an existing  betting shop or adult gaming centre 
within 200m  walking distance ; or where  the resulting  amount of betting shops 
and adult gaming centres would  exceed 1.5% of the total units in the Town 
Centre .  
154 
 C. Where proposals for uses serving food and drink are permitted – particularly A3 and 
A5 uses, and A1 uses such as coffee shops and sandwich bars – a condition will be 
attached to require the operator to achieve, and operate in compliance with, the 
Healthy Catering Commitment standard.  
 
D. Where proposals for betting shops, adult gaming centre, payday loan shops, high 
interest ‘rent -to-own’ retail stores, pawnbrokers and other similar uses are permitted, 
conditions may be attached (where relevant) to:  
 
(i) require the display of information about local credit unions, debt advice 
services and/or gambling addiction charities;  
(ii) require the operator to sign up to, and operate in compliance with, any 
scheme(s) which promotes community safety and/or other good practice; and  
(iii) require the display of information about any applicable interest rates, fees and 
charges.   
 
 Due to the boroug h's densely developed, mixed -use nature, a range of main Town 
Centre  uses occur in close proximity to places where people live,  work, study and 
socialise. It is important to ensure a mix and balance of complementary day and night -
time uses that creates an attractive and vibrant area that co -exists successfully with 
neighbouring residential areas and does not significantly compromi se wellbeing . 
Certain types of use can cause detrimental cumulative impacts as a result of their 
concentration. The Council  will resist applications for such uses where they would 
cause harm to the vitality and viability, character, function and amenity of  an area 
and/or negatively impact on the health and wellbeing of the boroug h's residents.  The 
impact on deprived areas in particular will be assessed.  
 In assessing the likely impacts of a proposal, regard will be had to the type of use, 
proposed hours of opening, size of premises, operation and servicing, and measures 
to mitigate odour and noise from the premises. The Council  will also consider whether 
the proposal is likely to increase or create a negative cumulative impact in the 
surrounding area (generally within a 500m radius of the site). The 500m radius is 
established as a sensible straight line distance from the location of the proposed use 
to meas ure cumulative impacts taking account of Islington’s relatively small spatial 
area and dense urban development. Proposals will be resisted that would result in 
unreasonable negative cumulative impacts that cannot be adequately mitigated. The 
Council ’s Lice nsing Policy will also be a material consideration in assessing potential 
impacts of proposals.  
 The policy has restrictions (percentage and/or quantum of units) for hot food 
takeaways  (Use Class A5) and b etting s hops  and adult gaming centres (Sui Generis).  
These restrictions are necessary due  to the adverse impacts on health and wellbeing 
and vitality and viabil ity of retail centres that these uses  can cause . These restrictions 
are part of a wider comprehensive approach to tackle the causes of ill health, i n co-
operation with other Council  departments including Public Health.  The restrictions, 
either the percentage or the quantum, may be updated in future through a SPD. 
 The level  of overweight or obese children in Islington is consistently  above both the 
national and London average. Evidence shows that nearly two thirds of  schools  in 
Islington have at least one hot food takeaway within 200m of the school  entrance. A s 
part of a comprehensive package of measures to tackle this issue, the Council  will  
155 
 resist pro posals  for hot food takeaways within 200 metres of primary and secondary 
schools.  
 All applications for A5 Hot Food Takeaway’s or Betting Shops must  provide a 
Management and Operating Strategy which includes all the standard information 
needed when the oper ator applies for a premises licence. Management and Operating 
Strategies must  also consider any other potential impacts on vitality, viability, 
character, amenity, function and health and wellbeing.   
 A5 uses are often associated with unhealthy food, but t hey are not the only type of 
premises to serve unhealthy food; A1 and A3 uses such as newsagents, coffee shops 
and cafes also often sell/serve unhealthy food. Applications for relevant  A1, A3 and A5 
uses will therefore be conditioned to achieve, and operat e in compliance with, the 
Healthy Catering Commitment standard. This will help provide  easier access to 
healthier food across the borough.   
 Islington has a relatively high number of betting shops, compared with other boroughs 
in London and across the coun try. Betting shops can have a variety of adverse 
impacts on communities including  worsening mental  health (particularly with 
incidences of problem gambling)  and exacerbating incidences of anti -social behaviour  
and crime. There is evidence of betting shops clustering in deprived areas, and this 
will be a key consideration as part of any assessment of overconcentration. Tools  and 
evidence  such as the gambling -related harm r isk index work produced by Geofutures 
may be utilised to inform this assessment.  
 Bettin g shops, payday loan shops, high interest ‘rent -to-own’ retail stores, 
pawnbrokers can have adverse impacts on health and wellbeing. The Council  requires 
that any of these premises must operate in a transparent manner and clearly display 
information relati ng to interest rates; fees; charges; and information about debt advice 
and gambling support.  
 Further information on the implementation of Policy R8 is provided in the Location and 
Concentration of Uses SPD. 
 
A. Applications for meanwhile/temporary use of individual vacant A1 -A5, D2 or Sui 
Generis uses in Town Centre  locations and in the CAZ will be appropriate  where:  
 
(i) the temporary use sought is within A use class, B1 or D2 use or is, in the 
Council ’s view, a suitable community and/or cultural use;  
(ii) the period of meanwhile/temporary permission is less than 6 months, and no 
more than one previous temporary permission have been granted since the 
last permanent occupation of the unit/building/site;  
(iii) potential adverse a menity impacts are prevented or mitigated; and  
(iv) the meanwhile/temporary use does not preclude permanent use of the site for 
appropriate main Town Centre  uses, which includes consideration of the 
amount of previous temporary permissions.   
156 
  
B. Vacant plots/ sites planned for  redevelopment must  investigate provision of 
meanwhile /temporary  uses  prior to commencement of any redevelopment work . Any 
meanwhile/temporary use of such sites will be appropriate  where:  
 
(i) the meanwhile/temporary use does not preclude permanent use of the site , 
particularly through the length of any temporary permission ; 
(ii) the proposed meanwhile/temporary use contributes to the function of the area 
where it is located or meets a specific need identified by the Council ; 
(iii) potential adverse a menity impacts are prevented or mitigated ; and  
(iv) the proposed use meets all other Local Plan policies relevant to the use.  
 
 
 Vacant premises  can detrimentally affect the vibrancy, vitality and viability of places. 
The efficient use of land is crucial to sustain a vibrant and engaging built environment 
and vacant premises can provide opportunities for businesses to establish themselves. 
This is esp ecially applicable to start -ups and businesses within the creative industries.  
 The Council  will encourage meanwhile/temporary use of A -use, D2 and Sui Generis 
main Town Centre  use units/building/sites  in the CAZ and Town Centre s, where 
potential adverse i mpacts are prevented/mitigated. Temporary use must  not preclude 
permanent occupation of units/buildings/sites, and the Council  expect marketing 
exercises for permanent occupation for an appropriate use to continue throughout the 
temporary occupation (pendi ng consistency with relevant policies).  
 Any meanwhile/ temporary use consistent with  criteria in  policy R9 will not count as 
occupancy for the purpose of continuous vacancy (as required by  other Local Plan 
policies), provided that the total cost of renting the unit  for temporary occupants  is free 
or at a very low percentage of the prevailing market rate for similar uses in the area ; 
and the units are let, as a priority, to  start-ups or small businesses . Without such rent 
reductions for temporary occupiers, t he Council  will consider that the temporary use 
breaks the continuous vacancy period required by other Local Plan policies.  
 If the Council  consider  a site/premises/unit has been made deliberately vacant to 
secure temporary permission, the application will be refused.  
 Meanwhile/t emporary uses have the potential to create adverse amenity impacts on 
the surrounding environment. Adverse amenity impacts could include noise from 
ingress and egress of the building or space, anti -social behaviour, inappropriate 
servicing and delivery, vi bration, access and safety, amongst other things. The 
temporary nature of a use is not enough, by itself, to mitigate any adverse impacts. All 
applications for temporary use must demonstrate that all potential adverse impacts are 
prevented/mitigated. Evide nce must  be submitted to the Council  as part of  an 
application that considers potential adverse amenity impacts and the measures to be 
undertaken to mitigate these impacts.    
 Meanwhile /temporary uses can help activate space in the daytime, for example, 
cultural or night -time economy uses which do not ordinarily open during the day. The 
Council  will encourage temporary/meanwhile uses in such circumstances, where 
proposals are consistent with the other requirements of Policy R9.   
157 
 
 To encourage meanwhile/ tempora ry use of vacant A use, D2 use and Sui Generis 
units, the Council  will explore the potential to implement a meanwhile/t emporary  Use 
Local Development Order (LDO) which permits temporary uses in specific locations, 
where certain conditions are met.  
 Although  Islington will have few significant ly size d vacant sites/plots awaiting 
redevelopment, developers and landowners of such sites/plots must  investigate 
options for utilising  any sites/plots for meanwhile/temporary uses , including utilising 
existing buildings within sites/plots . The range of meanwhile /temporary  uses could be 
more wide -ranging than those identified in Part A of the policy ; applications will be 
assessed on a case -by-case basis but the proposed meanwhile/temporary use must 
demonstrate ho w potential adverse amenity impacts will be addressed; and how it will 
contribute to the function of the area where the site/plot located or meet a specific 
need identified by the Council . The latter could include provision of temporary 
affordable/supporte d housing similar to projects implemented elsewhere in London, 
such as the Place/Ladywell project in the London Borough of Lewisham. Relevant 
Local Plan policies related to the temporary use would apply to the assessment of any 
meanwhile/temporary use, for  example policy H4 with regard to temporary housing. 
Temporary open space or food growing space may also be appropriate.  
 
 New cultural uses must  be located in the CAZ or Town Centre s, particularly in Cultural  
Quarter s. Such uses must : 
 
(i) complement existing uses in the surrounding area and mitigate/prevent any 
adverse impacts on the amenity and continued operation, of these uses, in line 
with the ‘agent -of-change’ principle;  
(ii) be accessible by a range of sustainab le transport modes, including walking, 
cycling and public transport; and  
(iii) provide high quality buildings that are designed to be inclusive, accessible and 
flexible.  
 Proposals involving the redevelopment and re -provision of cultural uses, or 
intensification of existing cultural uses (except for public houses), will only be 
acceptable on sites within the CAZ or Town Centre s, and must : 
 
(i) ensure that the function and role of the existing cultural use is not diminished 
or put at risk by any proposed changes, particularly where proposals involve 
development of other uses (including sensitive uses such as residential) as 
part of mixed use redevelopment;  
(ii) provide high quality buildings that are designed to be inclusive, accessible and 
flexible, and in the case of proposals for intensification, explore opportunities 
to improve design standards in existing buildings;  
(iii) be conditioned to ensure retention of the specific cultural use; and  
(iv) where there is a significant intensification of the cultural use, incorporate 
appro priate measures to limit effects of sound, vibration and other effects of  
158 
 the re -provided/intensified cultural use on existing and potential future land 
uses in the area, in line with the ‘agent -of-change’ principle.  
(v) where use is only intended to operate d uring evening/night -time hours, 
investigate potential for allowing daytime uses to activate the space, including 
on a meanwhile basis.  
 
 The loss and/or change of use of cultural facilities  in the borough  will be strongly 
resisted. Any proposals for the loss and/or change of use of such facilities must:  
 
(i) demonstrate that the premises have  been vacant for a continuous period of at 
least two years. Continuous marketing evidence to cover this period must be 
provided, to demonstrate that there is no reasonabl e prospect of the unit being 
used for continued cultural use or other suitable cultural or commercial uses 
consistent with the character and function of the area . Such evidence must 
meet the marketing and vacancy requirements set out in Appendix 1 ; 
(ii) ensure that the character of an area and/or any wider cultural function is not 
adversely impacted by the loss; and  
(iii) ensure that the proposed use is appropriate for the area, including through 
assessment against the agent -of-change policy DH5.  
 
 Proposals for new ni ght-time e conomy uses (including redevelopment/intensification 
of existing night -time economy uses) will only be acceptable within the CAZ or in 
Town Centre s. Where proposed, night -time economy uses must : 
 
(i) complement existing uses in the surrounding area and mitigate/prevent any 
adverse impacts on the amenity and continued operation, of these uses, in line 
with the ‘agent -of-change’ principle;  
(ii) demonstrate that there would not be a significant adverse effect on amenity or 
function, particularly impacts on r esidential uses;  
(iii) promote access via sustainable modes of transport and avoid reliance on 
private vehicular transport, including private hire vehicles; and  
(iv) investigate potential for allowing daytime uses to activate the space, including 
on a meanwhile basis , where the use is only intended to operate during 
evening/night -time hours.  
 
 Cultural uses are unique assets which add significant value to the social fabric and 
economy of Islington. Such uses often have distinct social and economic benefits, 
although cannot be specifically defined (in terms of planning use classes). Cultural 
facilities evident in Islington includes music and other entertainment venues, cinemas, 
artist studios and galleries, theatres, pubs, museums and the Emirates Stadium, 
working men’ s clubs, arts and crafts spaces, bingo halls, community centres, in 
addition to a number of heritage assets. Some of these are also night -time economy 
uses.  
 The impact of development in close proximity to cultural uses is arguably the biggest 
threat which these uses face; close proximity is consid ered to be any distance where 
vibration, noise – including airborne noise –- and/or the operation of a cultural use – 
such as regular ingress/egress routes – could cause amenity impacts for surrounding  
159 
 uses. The ‘ag ent-of-change’ principle set out in policy DH5 requires that the person or 
organisation responsible for change – such as a planning applicant who proposes new 
residential units near an existing cultural use – is responsible  for managing the impact 
of that change. Cultural uses are inherently sensitive to the introduction of new uses, 
given their function can generate noise and significant pedestrian movements. It is 
therefore important that new uses in close proximity to cultural uses fully prevent any 
adve rse impacts which may arise in future (such as noise complaints, which give rise 
to licensing restrictions and incur costs and administrative burdens) and give cultural 
uses maximum opportunity to continue operating and contributing to Islington’s cultural  
offer. This must  also include reasonable opportunity for cultural uses to expand their 
offer.  
 The approach to cultural uses operates in tandem with other policies aimed at 
ensuring that Islington maintains its role for shopping, business, education and cu lture, 
alongside the need to deliver housing to meet the borough’s housing target. Therefore, 
while strong protections are in place to protect the continued operation of existing 
cultural uses where new development is proposed, the reverse also applies, an d new 
or significantly intensified cultural uses must  follow the ‘agent -of-change’ principle to 
ensure that any potential adverse impacts on uses in the immediate area – particularly 
uses sensitive to noise such as residential –- are prevented or satisfacto rily mitigated. 
Where cultural uses are intensified or re -provided as part of redevelopment, conditions 
will be attached to any permission to remove any applicable permitted development 
rights and restrict changes via section 55(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 
1990 (as amended). This will ensure that specific cultural use(s) are retained and that 
any future loss is assessed against Local Plan policies via a planning application.  
 In certain circumstances, where agreed by the Council , non -physical mea sures, 
particularly a deed of easement, may be used to mitigate residual impacts which 
cannot be mitigated through physical measures alone; this is a legal agreement which 
essentially gives existing noise generating uses immunity from future complaints fro m 
occupiers of new development.  
 A Cultural Quarter  designation can reflect an aspiration to expand cultural provision in 
an area, or can cover areas where there is already a broader level of cultural activity 
which must  be retained and enhanced.  Renewal an d enhancement of heritage or 
otherwise distinct townscape can support the function and role of Cultural Quarter s. 
Residential use is particularly sensitive to noise and other potential impacts of cultural 
uses, therefore new residential uses (both conventi onal and non -self-contained) within 
Cultural Quarter s will generally only be permitted on sites allocated for residential 
development, where they accord with other  relevant Local Plan  policies. This strikes a 
balance between allowing the cultural role of t he designated quarters to develop and 
prosper while providing targeted opportunities for new residential development to meet 
the borough’s housing targets.   
 Islington has designated three Cultural Quarter s: 
 Angel Town Centre  is designated as a Cultural Qu arter to reflect its role as the 
principal cultural destination in Islington and the contribution that this confluence of 
cultural uses makes to the wider Islington and London economy.  
 Part of the area around Clerkenwell and Farringdon is designated as a Cultural 
Quarter  to protect and promote the unique concentration of cultural uses and 
heritage  assets in this area, and reflect the concentration of related creative 
industries.   
160 
  Archway Town Centre  is designated as a Cultural Quarter  to en courage the 
incre asing cultural offer in the centre, including a variety of creative enterprises and 
independent retailers.   
 A Cultural Quarter  can contribute to wider objectives around improving the quality and 
economic vitality of an area. Key to the success of a Cultur al Quarter  is the 
encouragement of a mix of supporting daytime and night -time uses, which can include 
space for arts and creative industries and meanwhile uses, to support the overall 
cultural function. However, it is important that the development of cult ural uses within 
each quarter responds to the character and function of the respective areas.  
 The loss of cultural facilities, not just in the most significant commercial parts of the 
borough but also in other smaller/dispersed locations, can have a significant 
detrimental impact on local character and the function of an area. Such loss will be 
strongly resisted.  
 Music venues in particular – including pubs which have a frequent live music offer –- 
highlight the potential dual economic and social role o f a cultural use. They are 
frequented by people from all walks of life, which fosters inclusivity; and can contribute 
significantly to the local economy both in their own right and as a destination which 
encourages supporting activities. Across London, mus ic venues are in decline due 
largely to development pressures and an increase in residential uses located in close 
proximity to existing venues. Falling within the definition of a cultural use and also part 
of the night -time economy, music venues usually D 2 or Sui Generis use will be 
afforded strong protection in future. The Council  supports development of new music 
venues where appropriate.  
 The daytime use (including meanwhile/temporary use) of cultural venues that operate 
solely or predominantly at night can greatly enhance the cultural offer and economy of 
Town Centre s and the CAZ. This can increase employment and add to the vibrancy of 
an area. A class uses and B1 uses are considered particularly suitable uses in this 
context.  
 Appropriate design is a cas e-by-case issue taking into account the context of a 
specific site/area. Particular design issues which may be relevant to the cultural and 
night -time economy venues includes noise, inclusion, safety, surveillance and crime 
prevention. The Council  will req uire all new development to satisfy inclusivity principles 
in line with the Inclusive Design in Islington SPD and the Islington Urban Design 
Guide, as well as relevant best practice and guidance . It is important for cultural 
facilities to be accessible to  all and allow disabled Islington residents and visitors to 
participate fully in  Islington’s  rich cultural offer.   
 The Council ’s strategic employment policy notes the importance of the 24 -hour 
economy, which ensures that a variety of economic activities – both activities which 
drive and support economic growth – can take place across the borough to help 
achieve the Council ’s economic ambitions. The specific night -time economy plays an 
important role in realising these ambitions. There is crossover between n ight-time 
economy uses and cultural uses but the latter holds a wider definition. For the 
purposes of this policy, night -time economy uses generally fall within the A3, A4, A5, 
D2 and sui generis use classes, although this is not considered exhaustive and could 
include other uses – for example some D1 uses such as art galleries.   
 Night -time economy uses can contribute positively to the vitality and vibrancy of Town 
Centre s and the CAZ. However, if not properly managed, such uses can result in 
adverse ameni ty impacts for local residents and businesses (both individual and  
161 
 cumulative impacts) generated from anti -social behaviour, litter, noise and disturbance.  
To achieve a balance and protect the amenity of the boroug h's predominantly 
residential areas, night -time economy uses will generally be directed towards 
Islingto n's Town Centre s or the CAZ. Proposals outside these areas are considered 
inappropriate.  
 Proposals involving night -time economy uses in the CAZ which fall within the boundary 
of the Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  will be assessed against relevant policy in the 
Bunhill and Clerkenwell AAP  as well as any oth er relevant Local Plan policies . 
 Licensing and Planning are separate functions and refusal of licensing would  not result 
in planning consent automatically being refused.  However, t he Council ’s Licensing 
Policy, which identifies areas affected by negative cumulative impacts of entertainment 
and similar uses, will be a material consideration in assessing proposals.  Planning 
determinations (including planning conditions) will have regard  to Islington’s Licensing 
Policy  in relation to  proposed hours of opening, operation and servicing, and measures 
to mitigate odour and noise from the premises. The Council ’s Environmental  Health 
and Public Health functions are also important considerations for any proposals 
involving new night -time economy uses.  
 Specific clusters of night -time economy uses contribute more significantly to the night -
time economy, particularly within the nig ht-time economy clusters identified in the 
London Plan, and therefore the introduction of sensitive uses may threaten the 
effective operation of night -time uses more acutely in these areas.  
 
 The Council  will resist the redevelopm ent, demolition and Change of Use of any 
Public House which:  
 
(i) has demonstrable community/social value;  
(ii) contributes to the cultural fabric of the borough, including consideration of any 
historic/heritage features; and/or  
(iii) contribute s to the economy of the borough, particularly the night -time 
economy.  
 Applications for the Change of Use, redevelopment and/or demolition of a Public 
House which meets any of the criterion in Part A must demonstrate that:  
 
(i) the Public House has been vacant f or a continuous period of at least two 
years. Continuous marketing evidence to cover this period must be provided, 
to demonstrate that there is no realistic prospect of the unit being used as a 
Public House in the foreseeable future;  
(ii) the proposed alternati ve use will not detrimentally affect the character, vitality 
and viability of the area; or the amenity or future operation of land uses in the 
immediate area (including ongoing operation of the Public House where a 
partial change of use is proposed, e.g. o n upper floors);  
(iii) appropriate, documented measures have been undertaken to improve the 
viable operation of the public house, which have proven unsuccessful;   
162 
 (iv) the condition of the pub is conducive to occupation; and  
(v) significant features of historic or chara cter value are retained.  
 Visitor accommodation which is proposed on any non -operational upper floors of a 
Public House, and which is clearly subservient to the Public House fun ction, may be 
appropriate where:  
 
(i) any adverse impacts on the operation of the Pu blic House, particularly relating 
to issues of security, are prevented through design;  
(ii) the visitor accommodation does not lead to any intensive additional delivery 
and servicing requirements;  
(iii) visitor accommodation achieves the highest possible inclusive de sign 
standards;  
(iv) proposals comply with design requirements set out policy R12 Part D; and  
(v) visitor accommodation is designed, leased and operated as a hotel for 
temporary occupation. Where necessary, conditions will be used to ensure 
that visitor accommodat ion is not permanently occupied.  
 
 Islington's Public Houses form an integral part of the urban fabric and many are closely 
associated with the life and identity of local communities; a pub can be the focal point 
of a neighbourhood or street and can play an important social and economic role, 
either in a specific locality or across a wider area.  
 Islington has retained a substantial number of Public Houses, which are valued by 
local residents and visitors to the borough, but there is increasing pressure to convert 
pubs to other uses. The Council  will resist proposals that result in the removal of a 
Public House or a Change of Use away from the A4 Use Class, particularly where this 
would result in loss of heritage and/or social/community value, and/or would c onstitute 
the loss of a pub which contributes to the night -time economy.  
 When assessing a pubs community value, the Council  has no set criteria it will use to 
make this assessment but this could include consideration of factors such as 
comments made on the  proposed application, petitions and /or asset of community 
value designations.  
 Public houses can contribute positively to the vitality of Town Centre s, LSAs and 
communities in Islington. They can also contribute to the night -time economy and 
serve the leis ure demands of residents and visitors alike. The contribution to the night -
time economy will be thoroughly assessed for applications seeking a change of use 
from an A4 use.  
 Continuous marketing and vacancy evidence will be required, demonstrating lack of 
demand for the Public House. Appendix 1 sets out the information to be provided in 
relation to marketing of vacant floorspace . The marketing and vacancy requirement 
applies to full and partial change of use, including proposals which propose change of 
use i n conjunction with a retained  pub use. Such proposals must  market the pub in its 
entirety.  
 Applications for the Change of Use, redevelopment and/or demolition of a Public 
House which meets any of the criterion in Part A must demonstrate appropriate, 
docume nted measures have been undertaken to improve the viable operation of the  
163 
 public house. These measures could include the proactive diversification of the pub’s 
offer through the introduction of a food offer, the serving of non -alcoholic beverages; 
sports s creenings; events such as pub quizzes, live music, comedy, community 
events; and /or the use of the pub as a hub for parcel collection , amongst other things.  
 The condition of a public house must  not preclude occupation. If a public house is in 
poor conditio n, it will not be an attractive proposition for prospective tenants, which 
undermines the marketing requirement set out in policy R11.  
 Proposals for the change of use (either full or partial change of use), redevelopment 
and/or demolition of a Public House  must prevent/mitigate adverse impacts on local 
amenity or future operation of land uses in the immediate area, in line with policy D H5. 
 The change of use of non -operational upper floors of Public Houses – i.e. upper floors 
which are not being utilised by the Public House as bar space, dining rooms, kitchens 
or other such use – to visitor accommodation may be appropriate where, inter alia, it is 
does not affect the continued operation of the Public House and is clearly subservient 
to the Public House functi on, – i.e. it does not detract from the primary public house 
use in terms of scale, access arrangements and/or signage.  
 Any change of use from A4 must  maintain an active frontage which engages positively 
with the street scene. Public Houses often provide a n active frontage which engages 
with a wide demographic in the daytime and night -time, therefore a loss of an active 
frontage may be detrimental to the character of an area.  
 Where a public house proposes to use any non -operational upper floors for visitor  
accommodation, proposals must ensure bedrooms are wheelchair accessible in line 
with Policy R12 (unless this provision is demonstrated to be impractical due to design 
limitations). Further guidance can be found in the Inclusive Design in Islington SPD.  
 
 Proposals involving the development, redevelopment and/or intensification of visitor 
accommodation will only be permitted on:  
 
(i) sites allocated for visitor accommodation; or  
(ii) sites with existing visitor accommodation in Town Centre s and the CAZ  
 Proposals under Part A(ii) involving the redevelopment/intensification of existing 
visitor accommodation will only be permitted where:  
 
(i) delivery of  other priority uses, particularly business floorspace , is not possible , 
in line wit h relevant policies and priorities; and  
(ii) the proposal is consistent with other Local Plan policies, particularly relating to 
design, sustainability and transport.  
 Visitor accommodation which is proposed on any non -operational upper floors of a 
Public House,  and which is clearly subservient to the Public House function, may be 
appropriate as set out in Policy R11. Such visitor accommodation must meet criteria 
set out in Policy R11 Part C.  
  
164 
  All proposals involving visitor accommodation – development, redevelopment and/or 
intensification – must fully address the following criteria:  
 
(i) Any adverse impacts on nearby residential amenity, including cumulative 
impacts, must be prevented or appropriately mitigated;  
(ii) Appropriate arrangements must be put in place for pick up /drop off, service 
delivery vehicles and coaches, appropriate to the size of the visitor 
accommodation;  
(iii) Where visitor accommodation is provided as part of a mixed -use 
development, full separation of uses must  be provided where possible;  
(iv) A good standard of amenity and safety  is provided , with an acceptable level of 
noise, vibration , daylight and sunlight. Proposals must be inclusive, providing 
at least 10% of all rooms to wheelchair accessible standards (fully fitted from 
occupation) ; and  
(v) Ancillary facilities which are open for public use and create employment 
opportunities for local residents –- such as restaurants, gyms and conference 
facilities –- must  be provided where appropriate . 
 The Council  will afford preference to visitor accommodatio n that is designed, leased 
and operated as a hotel for temporary occupation. Where necessary, conditions will 
be used to ensure that visitor accommodation is not permanently occupied . 
 
 Any proposal for the change of use of existing conventional or non -self-contained 
residential accommodation to visitor accommodation (both temporary and permanent 
change of use) will be refused.  
 
 
 Visitor accommodation refers to any building or place that provides temporary or short 
term accommodation on a commercial basis. This includes hotels, hostels, bed and 
breakfasts, some apart -hotels and any other visitor accommodation model that meets 
this definition.  
 Development, redevelopment and/or intensification of visitor accommodation will be 
suitable on sites specifically allocated for visitor accommodation in the Local Plan. The 
NPPF regards visitor accommodation as a main Town Centre  use. While Is lington will 
not permit new -build visitor accommodation in Town Centre  locations, 
redevelopment/intensification of existing visitor accommodation in Town Centre s and 
the CAZ may be acceptable.  
 On current mixed use sites, the intensification of visitor acc ommodation may be 
acceptable in line with the policy requirements  but policies that promote the 
maximisation of other priority uses  will be given precedence in terms of asse ssing the 
proposed mix of uses.  
 A key priority of the Local Plan is the maximisatio n of business floorspace and 
development of new housing, particular affordable housing. Therefore, 
redevelopment/intensification of existing visitor accommodation must fully consider 
opportunities for development of other uses which are considered a greate r priority.  
 Co-location of visitor accommodation and other uses may be suitable where security 
issues are prevented via full separation of uses. Applications for new visitor 
accommodation must  set out how security measures and other potential adverse  
165 
 impac ts – including after -hours ingress and egress by guests –- would be mitigated via 
submission of a detailed management strategy.  
 Visitor accommodation is considered an acceptable use on upper floors of Public 
Houses in Islington, as it can support the contin ued operation of the Public House and 
hence ensure the retention of an important community facility. Such proposals must 
meet criteria in policy R11.  
 Well-designed, accessible, sustainable visitor accommodation is likely to remain 
attractive to a range of visitors for the long -term, whereas poorly designed 
accommodation is likely to become redundant more quickly, potentially manifesting in 
additional demand for visitor accommodation in the future. At least 10% of new hotel 
bedrooms must be wheelchair access ible, which includes additional rooms created 
through redevelopment and/or intensification of existing visitor accommodation. 
Wheelchair accessibility refers to , inter alia:  
 sufficient wheelchair turning space;  
 wheelchair accessible bathrooms; and 
 suffici ently wide doorways and doors that do not restrict a person’s ability to 
access rooms with ease.  
 The 10% wheelchair accessible rooms will be required to be fitted from the outset  of 
the development , including all spatial provisions, fixtures and fittings.  Further 
information on requirements can be found in the Inclusive Design in Islington SPD.  
 Visitor accommodation and ancillary facilities must  also be designed to be ‘visitable’. 
This refers to the provision for people  of all physical abilities to access  the visitor 
accommodation through step free access with appropriate lobby dimensions and a 
wheelchair accessible lift. The Inclusive Design in Islington SPD sets out the specifi c 
standards for visitability.  
 Visitor accommodation is very energy intensive d ue to the amenities and facilities that 
are commonly provided; it also has significant levels of water consumption. It is 
therefore essential that any development, redevelopment and/or intensification of 
visitor accommodation incorporates all relevant sust ainable design measures, in line 
with relevant sustainable design  policies in chapter 7. 
 All proposals must demonstrate that all visitor accommodation rooms will provide an 
adequate standard of amenity to occupants, particularly in terms of circulation , outlook, 
ventilation (in accordance with the sequential cooling hierarchy set out in policy S6) 
and noise insulation. Design of visitor accommodation must  also provide appropriate  
levels of daylight for occupants.  
 Proposals involving redevelopment and intens ification of existing visitor 
accommodation rooms must  look to enhance the quality of existing rooms in line with 
the design, accessibility and sustainability requirements set out in the Local Plan.   
 Apart -hotels often display characteristics associated w ith permanent, self -contained 
housing. Some are more akin to hotels in the type of services they provide, but may 
result in different impacts. Apart -hotels/serviced apartments may therefore fall within 
the C1 or C3 Use Classes, depending on their character istics, such as (amongst 
others):   
166 
  minimum /maximum lease lengths ; 
 presence of on -site staff /management ; 
 presence of reception, bar or restaurant ; 
 provision of cleaning and administrative services ; and  
 ownership of units /ability to sell on open market  
 Where apart -hotels are considered to fall within the C3 Use Class, proposals will be 
assessed via relevant housing policies in the Local Plan including the requirement to 
provide affordable housing. Conditions will be used to ensure units are subject to 
minimum lease lengths. For proposals within the C1 Use Class, the Council  will take 
steps to ensure that units would not be used or occupied by permanent households, 
including students, on the basis that this would be contrary to the sustainable 
development of Islington and would put pressure on local services and infrastructure. 
Conditions will therefore be used to ensure units are subject to maximum lease 
lengths (typically 90 days)  to preclude permanent occupation of C1 units . 
 The Deregulation Act 2015 rel axed restrictions on the use of residential premises as 
short -term visitor accommodation, meaning that properties being used as short -term 
visitor accommodation will require planning permission only where lettings are in 
excess of 90 nights in any calendar  year or lettings are offered by somebody who isn’t 
the Council  Tax payer at the property. This has led to a significant increase in the use 
of residential accommodation as short -term lettings, facilitated by commercial short -
term lettings websites such as  Airbnb and One Fine Stay. There is particular concern 
that widespread use of residential accommodation as short -term lets is causing 
amenity impacts for nearby residents and leading to security and privacy issues, 
especially where short -term lets are with in blocks of flats where several properties are 
accessible by the same entrance. The short -term letting phenomenon is also 
undermining efforts to meet local housing need by limiting the use of residences for 
permanent occupation; it is a loss of housing su pply.  
 There is also pressure to utilise non -self-contained accommodation, particularly 
student accommodation, as short term lets over the summer period, which could also 
undermine action to meet housing need , as well as causing security, safety and 
privac y issues . 
 This issue is primarily an enforcement matter, but any applications to convert existing 
residential accommodation – both self -contained and non -self-contained dwellings – to 
visitor accommodation will be refused. For avoidance of doubt, this incl udes 
applications for permanent and temporary change of use.

 5 Green infrastructure  
A. Green infrastructure is an integral part of what makes the borough sustainable, 
healthy, welcoming and attractive. It is extremely important in terms of addressing 
the Local Plan  vision and  objectives. Development proposals must  preserve and 
enhance existing green infrastructure, and, where relevant, provide new green 
infrastructure.  Opportunities to connect new/enhanced gre en infrastructure to 
existing green infrastructure must  be thoroughly investigated.  
B. Developers must  consider green infrastructure at an early stage of the design 
process as part of an integrated design approach and incorporate the provision of 
green infras tructure into the design rather than as an ‘add on’ at the end of the 
design process.  
C. Development  proposals must  assess the value and benefits of e xisting green 
infrastructure on -site and adjacent to sites;  and identify interventions that could 
improve gr een infrastructure value and benefits .  
D. Sites with a low existing green infrastructure  value represent particular opportunities 
to increase green infrastructure functions. The Council  will not consider existing site 
circumstances as the baseline for new pr ovision.  
E. Major developments are required to conduct an Urban Greening Factor (UGF) 
assessment in accordance with the methodology in the London Plan. Schemes 
must  achieve an UGF  score of 0.4 for developments that are predominately 
residential, and a target score of 0.3 for predominately commercial development.  
F. Development must  contribute to the implementation of green infrastructure 
strategies including the All London Green Grid.  
 
 Green infrastructure refers to the network of green spaces, street trees, gre en roofs, 
and other assets such as natural drainage features . For the purposes o f the Local 
Plan, the term ‘green infrastructure’ is inclusive of ‘blue infrastructure’ which refers to 
water -related infrastructure/assets such as rivers, canals and ponds . A strategic 
approach to green infrastructure ensures  these assets are planned, designed, and 
managed in an integrated way to meet multiple objectives , including : 
 promoting mental and physical health and wellbeing ; 
 encourag ing social interaction, bringing tog ether people from across the 
community;   
168 
  adapting to the impacts of climate change , including helping to reduce flood risk ; 
 improving air and water quality ; 
 encouraging walking and cycling ; 
 conserving and enhancing biodiversity and ecological resilience ; and  
 promoting more traditional functions of green space such as play, sport, and 
recreation.  
 Green Infrastructure is a form of natural capital , which provides direct and indirect  
benefits to people. These benefits include clear air and water, cooling to le ssen the 
impacts of climate change, provision of a better environment for walking and cycling, 
promoting healthier living , and providing habitat s for biodiversity and ecological 
resilience. D evelopment  of the green infrastructure network is particularly im portant in 
Islington. Islington has the highest population density of any local authority  area in 
England. Large areas of the borough are deficient in public open space with limited 
opportunities to create significant new open spaces. In addition, the popu lation of 
Islington is projected to grow, putting further pressure on this limited resource.  
 The Council  supports the concept of natural capital accounting whereby the value of 
green infrastructure is assessed including economic benefits that are not generally 
included in financial accounting balance sheets. Through this process the true value of 
green infra structure to people living, working, and visiting Islington can be identified.  
 Green infrastructure interventions include:  
 creation of parks and gardens, sport pitches and facilities, and allotments and 
community gardens ; 
 creation of habitats withi n open s paces and on buildings, such as green roofs, 
vertical greening and planting on terraces ; 
 planting trees and natural landscaping on streets, waterways, and railway lines ; 
 protecting w atercourses and waterbodies;  
 provision of wildlife habitat features, such as bird and bat boxes ; 
 incorporating insect attracting plants in landscap e schemes ; 
 designation of local green spaces through the neighbourhood plan process;  
 protecting and enhancing sites with geodiversity value31; 
 sustainab le Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) such as incorporating green roofs, 
tree pits and rain gardens ; and 
making existing green spaces accessible to the public.  
 The London Plan includes  an interim London wide UGF  model to assist boroughs and 
developers in determ ining the appropriate provision of urban greening for new 
developments. Islington Council  will use the London wide model in the determination 
of planning applications, but may in time develop a  local model through further 
supplementary guidance .  
                                                
31 The London Plan and supporting guidance provides further information on geodiversi ty. There are 
no designated  Locally Important Geological Sites (LIGS) in the Local Plan, although Finsbury Gravel 
(near Sadler’s Wells) may have particular geodiversity value as noted in the London Foundations 
SPG (March 2012).   
169 
 
 The Counc il will expect developers to design urban greening into developments from 
the earliest possible stage and take every opportunity to incorporate urban greening 
interventions into their development . This includes a requirement for green roofs 
and/or vertical  greening set out in policy G5.  Appropriate information which provides 
sufficient detail on the type(s) of green infrastructure proposed – including the UGF 
score it would achieve - and justification for the  specified green infrastructure  provision 
must be  provided.  
 The Mayor of London has published the All London Green Grid SPG to sup port the 
implementation of the green i nfrastructure policies of the London Plan. A series of 
Area Frameworks expand on this by setting out objectives and strategic opportuniti es. 
The Council  expects schemes to implement these green infrastructure strategies 
where they apply.  
A. Development is not permitted on any public open space and significant private open 
spaces . 
B. Development within the immediate vicinity of public open space must not impact 
negatively on the amenity, ecological value and functionality of the space. All 
impacts must be prevented/mitigated through the design of the scheme.  
C. The Council  will protect open space on housing est ates. Where development is 
proposed on open spaces on housing estates, on-site re-provision  of the same 
quantum of space  of an improved quality is encouraged . Full loss of open space  on 
housing estates  will be resisted. Proposals which will lead to a net l oss but which 
will re -provide a quantum of on -site open space which is both functional and 
useable may be acceptable where:  
(i) the lesser amount of space is of a higher  quality;  
(ii) multi -functional  use of the space is encouraged, for example use as  play 
space  and/or climate change mitigation (as appropriate);  
(iii) permeability and connectivity within and between spaces is improved, 
ensuring that the space remains substantially undeveloped and open, and 
that accessibility to the general public is improved;  
(iv) rationalisat ion of estate car parking has been fully explored, in order to offset 
the loss of open space as far as possible and in accordance with the 
Council ’s car -free policy . Where the existing estate car parking has not been 
rationalised as part of the proposal, r obust justification must be provided  to 
explain why ; and  
(v) improvements to alternative open space provision in the immediate area are 
investigated, to offset the loss of open space as part of the proposal.  
D. Development of private open spaces will not be permi tted where, individually or 
cumulatively:  
(i) the site makes a valuable contribution to the character and appearance of 
the surrounding area, including its open aspect;   
170 
 (ii) the site is of biodiversity value, including consideration of ecological 
connectivity in th e wider area;  
(iii) the site is of social or community value, for example, areas that provide 
access to green space and nature;  
(iv) the site makes, or has the potential to make, a contribution to mitigating the 
impacts of climate change, including urban cooling and reducing flood risk; 
or 
(v) the development would have a harmful impact on the amenity of future or 
neighbouring occupiers through its future development.  
 
 
 Islington benefits from a range of open spaces including parks and gardens, natural 
green spaces and corridors, allotments and community gardens, urban hard 
landscaped areas like civic spaces and public realm, cemeteries and churchyards, 
open space on housing estates, playgrounds, and canal spaces.  Islington is also home 
to two spaces identified as Metropolitan Open Land  - Highbury Fields and Parkland 
Walk. Areas of open water like the Regent’s Canal and City Road Basin are 
considered public open space because of the amenity, sport and recreation value and 
the wildlife habitat value.  
 However , Islingt on is the most densely populated local authority in the country with 
one of the lowest amounts of greenspace per person , resulting in intensive use of 
open spaces and areas of open space deficiency.  Open spaces in Islington are under 
pressure and it is ess ential to protect and expand provision of open space particularly 
given the projected population growth.  
 The Council  will protect all open spaces, including private open spaces not designated 
on the Policies Map where such spaces are  ident ified during the plan period, for 
example  during the assessment of a planning application. Designated public open 
spaces are identified on the Policies Map  and listed in Appendix 7 . For reference, 
Figure 5.1  also shows the location of these spaces: 
171 
 Figure 5.1: Local Plan Public Open Space Designations  
 
172 
 
 Islington has many large housing estates  spread across the borough which are home 
to around 400  open  space s. These spaces ar e not formally designated as open space , 
however they constitute a significant resource and are highly valued by the 
community. As well as being multi -functional spaces which have many of the same 
attributes as designated open space, these spaces act as a focal point for play, 
socialising and ge neral relief from the mental pressures associated with higher density 
living within housing estates.   
 These spaces must  be protected, although some net loss of space as part of 
redevelopment may be acceptable where specific criteria are addressed.   
 Private open space is an integral part of the boroughs green infrastructure. It can 
include small private open spaces such as gardens and also larger private open 
spaces such as Charterhouse Square, the Honourable  Artillery Company Grounds and 
a number of churchyards in the borough. Existing green roofs are considered to be 
private open spaces for the purposes of this policy. These undesignated open spaces 
are essential to the character and appearance of the borough and can also help 
improve  amenity, air qu ality, drainage, cooling, biodiversity , ecological connectivity , 
and access to nature, as well as health and wellbeing (although a private open space 
may not perform all these functions) . Their protection is particularly important in 
Islington due to the h igh density of development and open space deficiency . 
 Gardens, including front gardens, are at particular risk in the borough and have been 
under increasing pressure from development over recent years. While development in 
one garden may have only a small impact , the cumulative effects of reduced garden 
space (at a local and regional level) is significant , for example by collectively reducing 
the amount of permeable surfaces to deal with increasing risks of surface water 
flooding ; by reducing biodiversity a nd ecological connectivity ; and by impacting on the 
overall open and green character of the borough.  
 In relation to the development of private open spaces, a proposal will be assessed 
based on the character and value of the private open space and its rela tionship to the 
site surroundings. Development proposals must  maintain the open aspect of the site 
and retain the existing functionality of the site in terms of factors including amenity 
value, biodiversity value and mitigation of climate change impacts. Development 
proposals for impermeable paving will be re sisted  on small surfaces such as front 
gardens and driveways  (see Policy S9) . Soft landscaping features should be ret ained 
and enhanced where possible, and permeable surfaces should be used where hard 
landscaping is required . 
 The Council  will protect existing allotments and other community gardening projects.  
 
A. Developments in excess of 2 00 net additional residential units or 10,000sqm  net 
additional gross external floors pace, or where a specific need has been identified by 
the Council , are required to provide on -site publicly accessible public open space. 
The level of provision  must  be proportionate to the size of the proposal  and the 
number of intended occupiers/users.  Public open space must  be provided in  
173 
 addition to private amenity space and landscaping and must  provide unrestricted  
public access , in perpetuity . 
B. Public open space should normally be green public open space, such as a public 
park. Areas of new or improve d hard landscaped public open space, such as civic 
space, may be considered appropriate instead of green public open space in certain 
areas (such as Town Centre s), and will be assessed on a case -by-case basis. In 
such cases it must be demonstrated that the  provision of green public open space is 
not possible or appropriate. Hard landscaped space must maximise greening 
features such as planting and permeable paving.  
C. New or improved public open space provision must:  
 
(i) create/improve links with other green infrastructure and permeability with the 
wider area;  
(ii) maximise biodiversity benefits and access to nature , by incorporating areas 
of biodiversity that complement surrounding habitats and support the 
Council 's Biodiversity Action Plan;  
(iii) maximise sustainabilit y benefits, including urban cooling and sustainable 
drainage, including the use of permeable surfaces;  
(iv) be designed to be safe and accommodate and encourage physical activity 
for all, promoting walking, cycling and social interaction; and  
(v) be overlooked, des igned and managed to meet diverse and changing needs.  
D. The temporary use of sites (such as those awaiting development) for public open 
space, sport and recreation , or nature conservation must  be considered. This 
includes very small sites such as pocket park s and the use of parking spaces as 
parklets . 
 
 Due to the low levels of existing open space, the dense urban nature of the borough, 
and projected population growth, the pressure on existing open space is very high , 
which creates a clear need for new open space, particularly public open space . To 
meet this demand,  the Council  will ensure that new developments contribute towards 
new and improved public open space. Large development sites – such as the 
Holloway Prison site - offer an opportunity to deliver a significant amount of high 
quality public open space. Access to such space must  be unrestricted, meaning that 
spaces are readily available to the public at all times  (especially  during daylight hours ) 
regardless of ownership or management.  
 Access to g reen space has a positive influence on physical and mental health . Green 
space in a local area can also lead an increase in life expectancy . Green space is 
particularly beneficial when it is easily accessible and  can be  encounter ed as part of 
daily life.  The aesthetic value of green space , viewed  from a window for example , can 
also be  beneficial  to mental health . Developments proposals are encouraged to 
consider opportunities for the provision of on -site community gardening, including food 
growing and allotmen ts. 
 Open space , including space  within housing developments , must  be overlooked; and 
designed and managed to meet diverse and changing needs for play, recreation and 
leisure for all ages , and a productive ecology. These open spaces must  maximise 
green infr astructure benefits and should normally be green. Hard landscaped areas  
174 
 will only be considered where it has been demonstrated that green space is not 
possible or appropriate. Hard landscape must  incorporate permeable paving.These 
spaces must  still maximis e green infrastructure benefits, and include through routes in 
new developments.  
 The Council  will seek on -site open space from large developments, to meet the 
increased demand for open space that these developments will create and to help 
address the existing shortfall of provision in Islington. The level of provision  must  be 
proportionate to the size of the proposal  and the number of intended occupiers/users. 
Evidence suggests that a standard of open space of 5.21sqm per resident and 2.6sqm 
per employee sh ould be provided. This standard must  be used to inform the level of 
public open space provision.  
 Public open spaces within the functional vicinity of a Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) should  be planted with species that are beneficial to wildlife and 
complement the species composition in the SINC. Planting must  include native 
species and local provenance species  where appropriate , and n on-native plants  with 
biodiversity value  may be suitable in some locations.  
 Temporary use of sites for open space is encouraged. It is not uncommon that sites in 
London are left vacant as opportunities for their development are explored. Site 
owners are strongly encouraged to make these spaces available to the local 
community for meantime open space use, such as raised beds or ‘skip gardens’ which 
can provide space for food growing.  
 
A. All developments must protect, enhance and contribute to the landscape, 
biodiversity value and gr owing conditions of the development site and surrounding 
area, including protecting and enhancing connectivity between habitats.  
B. Islington’s Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs) are areas 
designated for their importance for wildlife, biodive rsity and access to nature. SINC 
boundaries are shown on the Policies Map. Planning permission will not be granted 
for any schemes which adversely affect designated SINCs of Metropolitan or 
Borough Grade 1 Importance. S INCs of Borough Grade 2  and Local Imp ortance, 
and any other site of significant biodiversity value, will also be strongly protected.  
C. Development proposals involving  the creation of new buildings, redevelopment of 
existing buildings or large extensions  must submit a  Landscape Design Strategy (as 
part of the Sustainable Design and Construction Statement) which maximises  green 
infrastructure , biodiversity and sustainable drainage . This must  consider landscape 
design holistically from the outset of the design process  and demonstrate the 
following:  
(i) An integrated approach to hard and soft landscaping design , prioritising  soft 
landscaping and urban greening, including areas of unconstrained planting;   
175 
 (ii) Consideration of existing and proposed trees, hedges, shrubs and other 
vegetation of landscape or envi ronmental significance, and their impact on 
biodiversity, sustainable drainage, air quality and urban cooling;  
(iii) Achieving a f unctional, attractive and inclusive design;  
(iv) Maximising b iodiversity benefits and ecological connectivity, including 
through the protection and enhancement of existing biodiversity, and the 
incorporation of new areas of biodiversity and opportunities for wildlife, 
including green roofs and vertical greening . Development proposals must  
aim to secure a net gain in biodiversity value, with a clear priority for on -site 
measures ; 
(v) Incorporation of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) into the 
landscape design as part of an integrated approach which maximises 
biodiversity and water use e fficiency alongside other benefits including, 
where appropriate and practical, amenity and recreation;  
(vi) Incorporation of suitable wildlife habitats, including micro -habitats;  
(vii) Consideration of the potential impact on biodiversity of lighting, noise or 
shadin g, and adoption a lighting scheme design that minimises impacts on 
biodiversity;  
(viii) Provision of a  robust planting design that can sustain itself without intensive 
maintenance and/or intervention;  
(ix) Incorporation of a ppropriate maintenance arrangements that wil l be put in 
place from the outset of the development , including a requirement for a 
specific management plan secured by planning condition where necessary; 
and 
(x) Integration of food growing opportunities, where feasible and practical.  
 
D. All developments must protect and enhance site biodiversity, including wildlife 
habitats , trees  and measures to reduce deficiencies in access to nature. 
Developments involving refurbishment and/or extension of existing buildings must 
be designed and implemented to reduce impact  on existing species and their 
habitats.  
E. Biodiversity benefits  and ecological connectivity must be maximised through 
planting design , ecological landscaping,  and the incorporation of areas of 
biodiversity that complement surrounding habitats and support t he Council 's 
Biodiversity Action Plan. Species chosen for planting must maximise biodiversity 
benefit, be beneficial to wildlife and complement the existing habitat . Habitat 
features must  be incorporated on -site to support existing species of wildlife and 
provide opportunities for new wildlife.  
F. All developments, including refurbishment works, must carry out ecological surveys 
and assessments wherever the proposed  development is likely to have a n impact  
on protected species ; habitats or priority species identified in the borough’s 
Biodiversity Action Plan; and/or is either within or in close proximity to a SINC (s).  
G. All developments are required to minimise impacts on existing trees, hedges , 
shrubs and  other significant vege tation , and provide sufficient space for the crowns 
and root systems of existing and proposed trees and their future growth. 
Developments within proximity of existing trees are required to provide protection 
from any damage during development . The Council  will normally refuse permission 
or consent for the remova l of protected trees , i.e. trees  subject to a Tree Protection  
176 
 Order (TPO)  and trees within a conservation area ; and for proposals that would 
have a detrimental impact on the health of protected trees . 
H. Any loss of or damage to trees or other significant planting, or adverse effects on 
their growing conditions or survival, will only be permitted where it is demonstrably 
unavoidable in order to meet other relevant Local Plan policy requirements (as 
agree d with the Council ). In such circumstances, suitable high quality re -provision of 
equal value must  be provided on -site. Where on -site re -provision is demonstrably  
not possible (as agreed with the Council ), a financial contribution of the  full cost of 
appropriate re -provision will be required.  
 
 
 Biodiversity describes the abundance and variety of life on earth; including animals, 
birds, trees, plants, insects and fungi. Biodiversity is concerned with the interactions 
within and between species and the communities, habitats and ecosystems in which 
they occur.  
 The protection and enhancement of biodiversity in densely developed urban areas, 
such as Islington, is very important, particularly in the context of biodiversity losses due 
to development pressure, climate change and deficiencies in access to  nature within 
the borough. Changes to the built environment can have a significant effect on 
biodiversity, including protected species, and the ability of people to experience and 
enjoy nature.   
 Biodiversity and access to nature have a positive influence on physical and mental 
health, as well as social and community wellbeing , by providing opportunities for 
relaxation, exercise, social interaction, outdoor recreation and education. Providing 
opportunities for people to get involved in looking after natural  green spaces also helps 
to protect and enhance biodiversity for the future.  Connectivity between habitats is an 
important part of biodiversity value and refers to wildlife corridors, such as those 
provided by railway sidings, connected rear gardens, and t he Regent's Canal and New 
River.  
 Parts  of Islington are deficient in access to nature, meaning individuals living further 
than 1km walking distance from a designated SINC . The designation of SINCs takes 
into account a number of factors, including size, use , access, habitat and species 
representation, richness and rarity, as well as the ability to be recreated . Sites of 
Metropolitan Importance contain the best examples of London’s habitats, including 
particularly rare species, while sites of Borough Grade 1 Importance are of particular 
significance at the borough level , with some having a high social value for local 
communities; Metropolitan and Borough Grade 1 sites therefore have the strongest 
protection. Sites of Borough Grade 2 and Local Importance are of  ecological value, 
and also of value to local communities, and are therefore afforded strong protection.  
 Assessment of planning applications must  consider improvements to SINCs since 
adoption of this policy  (where informed by updated surveys) , particularl y where the 
biodiversity value of sites of Borough Grade 2 and Local Importance has improved to a 
degree which makes them akin to Metropolitan and Borough Grade 1 sites. Likewise, 
sites which are currently undesignated but which improve to a degree which m akes 
them akin to a designated SINC in terms of biodiversity value, must  be considered on 
a par with formally designated SINCs for the purposes of any planning assessment.  
 Designated SINCs are identified on the Policies Map  and listed in Ap pendix 7 . For 
reference, Figure 5.2 also shows the location of  these spaces: 
177 
 Figure 5 .2: Sites of Importance to Nature Conservation (SINC) Designations  
 
 
178 
 
 Proposals which will adversely affect  sites of significant biodiversity value  – including 
SINCs - will only be considered in exceptional circumstances where high quality re -
provision is provided , including provision of at least equal habitat area and value . 
Other relevant Local Plan policies on green infrastructure and design of op en space  
must be met in full . Preservation of existing biodiversity, including wildlife  habitats , is 
strongly preferred over re -provision as any redevelopment of an existing space will 
necessitate its total loss and replacement with a space that has to be established with 
plants and wildlife  over time; this  carries the risk that the replacement space will be 
less successful than that which it replaces.  
 Islington’s wildlife depends not only on green spaces, but also on the artificial fabric of 
the city. Buil dings can provide roosting sites for bats and nesting opportunities for 
birds . These and other species have seen large population declines, and are 
dependent on built areas for their survival. Walls can provide habitats for many species 
of plant s, includin g ferns and mosses, and also provide spaces for invertebrates. All 
wildlife habitats must be designed in accordance with the Council 's Biodiversity Action 
Plan, and in many cases will include micro habitat creation. Developments involving 
refurbishment and /or extension of existing buildings may impact species using the 
existing buildings, therefore measures to ensure retention and enhancement of such 
species will be required. Developments involving new and existing buildings must  
utilise opportunities to at tract new species to a site , including the incorporation of 
artificial nest boxes/bricks within developments to provide nesting and roosting 
opportunities for birds, including species under threat such as swifts, house martins, 
swallows and house sparrows,  and where appropriate, bats.  
 Ecological surveys must identify potential development impacts likely to harm the 
ecology of the site and recommend mitigation and enhancement measures.  Where a 
survey is required, this must  occur early in the design process of a proposal and be 
undertaken by an appropriately qualified ecologist. Further details of the triggers and 
requirements for ecological surveys and assessments is set out in the Environmental 
Design SPD. The requirement for ecological surveys and assessments to be submitted 
in this policy also applies to refurbishment works which may impact species using the 
existing building, such as swifts or bats.  The scale and detail of the survey will be 
dependent on the likely impac ts on biodiversity.  
 The achievement of ecological credits under the relevant BREEAM scheme will assist 
non-residential developments to meet the requirements of this policy.  
 Landscape design is integral to the design and functioning of the whole development  
and the wider area and is not something that can be considered after a building has 
been designed or built. Landscape and buildings need to be considered together from 
the start of the design process, and therefore a Landscape Design Strategy (as part of 
the Sustainable Design and Construction Statement)  must be submitted as part of the 
planning application, including for outline planning applications. The Sustainable 
Design and Construction Statement  (SDCS) must  include an assessm ent of existing 
biodivers ity on -site (supplemented by more detailed surveys where required), followed 
by investigation of the potential to enhance biodiversity value and soft landscaping 
within the development site, as an integral part of the design of a development.  
Islington’s S treetbook and Inclusive Landscape Design SPDs set  out practical 
objectives, design considerations and minimum standards to help ensure barriers to 
the use of public spaces are designed out and flexibility is built into any landscape 
design proposal.  
 Develo pment proposals involving the creation of new buildings, redevelopment of 
existing buildings or large extensions are required to submit a Landscape Design  
179 
 Strategy  as part of the SDCS . Large extensions will generally be those of 100 sqm and 
over, but could be smaller dependent on the site context. The level of detail provided 
in the SDCS  must  be proportionate to the scale of proposed development and allow 
the Council  to fully assess the proposals against relevant planning policies. Further 
details regarding the Landscape Design Strateg y are outlined in the Environmental 
Design SPD.  
 The incorporation of SUDS based bodies of water, such as rain gardens and ponds, 
must  seek to maximise biodiversity benefits. SUDS based water features may also 
provide amenity and recreation benefits ; however , it must be demonstrated that these 
functions will not undermine the overall biodiversity value of the site, and that 
biodiversity benefits can be provided elsewhere on the site. SUDS must  also be used 
in the landscape to maximise water efficiency where practical, through the 
incorporation of water butts for the irrigation of soft landscaping and rainwater 
recycling systems. Biodivers ity and amenity benefits of SUDS solutions can be 
maximised by using water in the environment and incorporating attractive and safe 
SUDS features, such as small ponds and rain  gardens, which make use of clean water 
at the surface to enhance landscape desig n, create a sense of place and create 
ecological habitats. Designing -in rainwater re -use opportunities reduces demand for 
fresh mains water for external use. Policy S9 provides more detail on SUDS. Further 
guidance  is also set out in the Environmental Desi gn SPD.    
 Develop ment proposals must  consider  potenti al indirect effects on -site biodiversity and 
local wildlife, such as noise, shading or lighting. This is particularly important for sites 
that are adjacent to or near SINCs, other sites of biodiversity v alue and green 
corridors. The SDCS  must  demonstrate that lighting schemes have been designed to 
minimise impacts on biodiversity. Lighting can have negative impacts on roosting bats, 
and bats that are feeding or commuting to feeding areas. Birds can also b e affected by 
lighting, as well as some types of amphibians.  
 Trees, hedges, shrubs and other significant vegetation are of particular value in 
Islington due to the borough's dense urban nature  and limited amount of green space. 
Vegetation not only provides  visual  and amenity  enhancement to the built 
environment, but also provides habitats for birds and invertebrates. Trees help to 
reduce impacts on air quality and the  contribution to climate change by capturing and 
storing carbon dioxide through ‘carbon seq uestration’. Trees and other types of 
vegetation are a vital part of adapting to climate change through the provision of urban 
cooling, which is important due to projected future temperature increases as a result of 
climate change and the ‘ urban heat islan d effect’ which cause temperatures in dense 
urban areas to be warmer than the surrounding areas. Green spaces and trees also 
have a positive impact on reducing flood risk, which is important in the context of the 
projected increase in intense rain showers due to climate change.  
 Developments are required to minimise any impacts on trees, hedges, shrubs and 
other significant vegetation, including through the provision of sufficient space for the 
crowns and root systems of existing and proposed trees and thei r future growth. This 
will include assessment of appropriate rooting volumes and the use of modular rooting 
systems where appropriate. Effective planting design of trees, shrubs and other 
significant vegetation, including appropriate choice of species, the  manner of their 
planting and subsequent maintenance, is required in order to ensure high nature 
conservation value, long life and maximum impact; this includes a reas of 
unconstrained planting where planting is not constrained by any structures beneath it,  
and which is directly connected to the soil profile/sub strata below .   
180 
 
 Underground servicing can affect existing trees and/or can limit where new trees are 
located. Proposals involving  existing and /or proposed underground servicing must  
ensure that the re quirements for protecting existing  trees  and proposing new trees are 
fully considered . Developments are required to provide adequate and appropriate 
building foundations, which are a prerequisite for retaining trees and allowing for 
supplementary planting.  The proposed foundation depths of new structures will 
therefore not be an acceptable reason for curtailing planting . Where soil volumes are 
provided they must  be sufficient for the trees to attain their canopy potential . Tree 
planting on the roof of new b uildings is also encouraged, where feasible.  
 Planting must  be beneficial to wildlife and complement the existing habitat  and/or be 
suited to the local environment where there is no existing habitat . Native species and 
local provenance species must  be plant ed, where appropriate, and non-native plants 
may be suitable in some locations providing they have biodiversity value, for example 
plants for pollinators.  Planting must be robust in order to withstand variation in climatic 
conditions, and sustain itself du ring climate fluctuations. Planting that is reliant on long 
term watering  (after initial plant establishment, i.e. the first two years) , particularly 
during long dry periods , is not considered robust or sustainable.  
 The impact of developments on trees will  be assessed in accordance with the 
Council 's Tree Policy (and other relevant Council guidance related to trees) , and all 
other statutory provisions and relevant material considerations.  
 Development proposals which are likely to affect trees within the application site or on 
land adjacent to the site (including street trees) are required to follow the process 
outlined in BS5837:2012 and include an up -to-date Arboricultural Im pact Assessment,  
which must  include a Tree Constraints Plan and Tree Survey. If the impacts identified 
require tree protection or identify special working methods within the root protection 
area of retained trees, an Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan 
(to BS5837 :2012) will also be required.  
 In exceptional circumstances, where loss of , or damage to , trees or other significant 
planting on a development site is unavoidable, mitigation through prompt replacement 
of equal value is expected on -site in the first instanc e, as outlined in Part H, as close to 
the initial tree loss as feasible. The replacement planting must  re-provide at least equal 
canopy cover and/or equal environmental amenity and townscape, biodiversity and 
urban cooling benefit.  All tree planting must  comply with the requirements of 
BS8545:2014 - Trees: from Nursery to Independence in the Landscape.  
 Full canopy cover replacement is required, and if this is not possible, canopy cover 
replacement in 10 years’  growth projection may be acceptable. This will be partially 
dependant on what is considered to be reasonable for the development in question. 
The Council 's Tree Service is carrying out research, with others in the arboricultural 
profession, into the tree valuation systems, growth patterns and success o f canopy 
cover re -provision to develop an improved system to calculate canopy cover 
requirements.  
 Where there are constraints to planting and re -planting cannot occur on -site, or only 
partial canopy cover can be re -provided, the development will be requir ed to provide 
evidence to justify why it is not feasible. Once this is established to the Council ’s 
satisfaction, it may then be accepted that off -site compensation is appropriate, or that 
a financial contribution of the full cost of appropriate re -provisi on is required. The 
Council  will always prioritise planting over a financial contribution, unless there are 
exceptional circumstances in relation to compliance with other policy requirements.   
181 
 
 Replacement planting must  be in accordance  with the following hi erarchy . Evidence 
must be provided to justify methods lower in the hierarchy : 
1. Trees replaced on -site. 
2. Trees planted directly adjacent to the site on land owned by the developer . 
3. If the developer cannot replace the required canopy cover/trees and there is a  
deficit of canopy cover/trees , then a financial contribution  will be sec ured via S106 
or S278 agreement  for planting trees on public land directly adjacent to the site  
(e.g. parks, open space, highways) . The level of contribution could  includ e the 
creation of the tree pits;  the cost of  the tree itself; the cost of tree planting ; and 
watering and maintenance for up to three years.  
4. If there are no sites available directly adjacent to the site,  then the financial 
contribution  will be used to plant tree s on public land within the sam e ward as the 
initial tree loss.  
5. Where planting is not feasible within the same ward as the initial tree loss within 
the timeframes allotted, then trees will be planted on public land elsewhere in the 
Borough.  
 Recognised valu ation systems such as  i-Tree Eco or CAVAT must  be used  to inform  
suitabl e replacement planting  based on the value of the benefits of the trees removed.  
 Pruning of retained trees and shrubs on proposed development sites may be required 
to facilitate the ere ction of scaffolding and protective hoardings. Where the Council  
deems proposed pruning to be satisfactory, this must  be carried out in accordance 
with BS3998:2010. Compliance with the requirements for the pruning works will be 
secured through planning con dition prior to the commencement of any construction or 
site preparation works.  
 
 
A. Developments  proposals must  use all available roof space to incorporate 
biodiversity -based extensive green roofs, subject to other planning considerations. 
Developments involving the extension of existing buildings  must  seek to retrofit 
extensive green roofs on existing roof areas where feasible, in addition to providing 
green roofs on the extension.  
B. Green roofs must  be considered at the earliest possible stage of designing a 
proposal to ensure their effective operation.  They must  be designed to :  
(i) maximise benefits for biodiversity, sustainable drainage and cooling;  
(ii) promote ecological diversity including planting based on wildflowers and a 
maximum of 25% sedum planting;  
(iii) have a varied substrate depth of average 80 -150mm, unless it can be 
demonstrated that this is not reasonably possible ; and  
(iv) be easily monitored, allowing for an ongoing effective process to inspect and 
monitor the quality of the green roof.  
  
182 
 C. Major development proposals must  accommodate surface water storage , where 
sustainable drainage requirements are applicable  in accordance with Policy S9 , by 
incorporating blue roof stormwater attenuation, unless it can be demonstrated that 
this is not possible.  
 
D. Developments proposing the installation of roof level solar panels are required to 
incorporate the panels over a green roof area to form a ‘bio -solar roof’, where the 
overarching biodiversity and drainage functions of the green roof will not be 
adversely affected.  
 
E. Biodiversity -based extensive green roofs  are the Council’s clear priority in terms of 
green roof provision . The installation of intensive or semi -intensive green roofs  to 
provide amenity space will only be acceptable  where it is clearly demonstrated that 
this is required to meet other policy req uirements , and where the primary 
biodiversity, sustainable drainage  and cooling functions of the green roof will not be 
adversely affected. Dedicated areas of biodiversity -based planting  must be 
maximised  on intensive or semi -intensive green roofs  and amen ity space must not 
cover the majority of roof space . 
 
F. Major developments are encouraged to consider tree planting and food growing 
opportunities as part of intensive and semi -intensive green roofs where feasible, 
and where the additional weight requirement s can be supported.  
 
G. New-build developments, and all major applications (including those involving 
refurbishments) must  maximise the greening of vertical surfaces as far as 
reasonably possible. Vertical greening must  be designed to:  
(i) maximise benefits for biodiversity, sustainable drainage and cooling;  
(ii) avoid excessive water demand and employ a watering system that does not 
rely on mains water supply  or a pumped irrigation supply ; 
(iii) promote ecological diversity through planting a range of appropriate species 
and incorporating micro habitats to support Islington’s Biodiversity Action 
Plan, including nesting boxes for birds or bats where possible;  
(iv) provide growing conditions suitable for the selected plant species, and 
require minimal maintenance;  and 
(v) incorporate planting rooted in soil from both ground level and roof level 
planters where practical . 
 
H. The design  and management  of green walls must include consideration of building 
structure and character, including architectural and historic features, in order to 
ensure such features are preserved and damage is avoided. A management plan 
may be required and conditioned to guarantee that any measures are carried out.  
 
 Urban greening - through gr een roofs and vertical greening - is particularly important 
on constrained sites where there is limited space for other forms of green space . 
Green roofs and green walls are a form of natural capital and provide an opportunity 
for enhancing  biodiversity and creating different types of new ha bitats in the  built 
environment, supporting a wide range of species.  These features  form an important 
part of green infrastructure and play a useful role in connecting existing areas of 
habitat and supporting rare and protected species, as well as providin g a broad range  
183 
 of other  sustainability benefits.  They will also help to achieve the UGF requirements 
set out in the London Plan and policy G1. Designers are encouraged to consult a 
suitably qualified ecologist for advice on the planting and growing conditions of green 
roofs and vertical greening . This will also assist developments in achieving credits 
related to ecology in the relevant BREEAM sch emes, where applicable . Effective 
monitoring arrangements must  be discussed and secured as part of assessment of 
applications.  
 Green roofs are vegetated layers that sit on top of the conventional roof surfaces of a 
building. Green roofs cannot be considere d as a direct replacement for green space 
lost to development as they will tend to have more limited biodiversity potential due to 
their raised location and limited depth of growing medium ; however,  they do have 
multiple benefits. They improve biodiversity  by supporting a wide range of plant life 
and providing alternative ecological habitats for insects, bats and birds. Green roofs 
also contribute to minimising flood risk by reducing surface water runoff ; improve air 
quality ; improve thermal efficiency and cooling of buildings through the insulation they 
provide ; and provide urban cooling to mitigate the ‘ urban heat island effect’.   
 ‘Extensive’ green roofs are able to establish a self -sustaining plant community, and are 
suitable for installation on the major ity of building types because they have low 
management requirements and do not usually require artificial irrigation. Extensive 
green roofs designed for biodiversity must  include a varied substrate depth and be 
planted and seeded with a wide range of wildf lowers. These features will provide good 
habitat for wildlife including native invertebrate species, nesting and foraging for a 
number of bird species, and pollinators such as bees. Extensive green roofs must not 
be publicly accessible, except for necessar y maintenance, in order to ensure the 
biodiversity of the roof can thrive. Development proposals must  prioritise  biodiversity -
based extensive green roofs in favour of intensive  and semi -intensive green roofs, 
unless it can be demonstrated that an intensive  or semi -intensive green roof is 
necessary to meet other policy requirements , including those  relating to the provision 
of private open space. Clear and convincing evidence must be provided to 
demonstrate that provision of alternative on -site amenity space  is not possible in order 
to justify why an extensive roof cannot be installed.  
  ‘Intensive’ and ‘semi -intensive’ green roofs provide different degrees of accessible 
amenity space such as rooftop gardens and food growing areas and require higher 
levels of design and maintenance. These types of roofs must be installed on a 
stronger structure in order to support the additional weight requirements of deeper 
soils or substrate and features such as paths. As a result, they can also support a 
greater diversity of  planting and richer ecology including shrubs and tree planting, in 
addition to wildflowers found on extensive green roofs. Intensive green roofs can 
provide very effective sustainable drainage as they can support the weight 
requirements of blue roof stora ge, which can also be used to irrigate the planting and 
trees.  
 The incorporation of biodiversity -based extensive green roofs on all available roof 
space must  be provided as part of all new -build developments, major refurbishments, 
and extensions larger tha n 100sqm. All other developments must  investigate the 
potential for incorporating a green roof. Where it is demonstrated that the incorporation 
of a green roof is not feasible or practical, it must be demonstrated that other forms of 
greening have been inv estigated and maximised as part of the development, in order 
to maximise soft landscaping and biodiversity in line with strategic priority to enhance 
green infrastructure. All development proposals are encouraged to incorporate green 
roof elements and plan ting on terraces and balconies, subject to other planning 
considerations.   
184 
 
 Due to the densely developed nature of the borough, there may be competing 
demands on the proposed use of roof spaces, including the provision of rainwater 
attenuation, renewable en ergy generation  through solar panels, and amenity space . 
High quality design must  aim to resolve any potential conflicts between creating green 
roofs, providing renewable energy and supplying amenity space on roofs. Du al uses 
on roofs will be encouraged wh ere they will not have a negative impact on the primary 
function s of the green roof to provide biodiversity, sustainable drainage and cooling  
benefits.  
 The installation of ‘ bio-solar ’ roofs will be encouraged which incorporate  solar panels 
over the green roof area . Combining solar panels with green roofs bring s together the 
benefits of an extensive green roof with the energy -generating  capability of solar PV 
arrays and  can enhance the biodiversity of the green roof by providing shading and 
wetter  areas as rainwater  runoff from the  panels shed s water onto the green roof . In 
addition, the green roofs can also help to regulate the temperature of solar panels, 
improving their efficiency.  
 Green/blue roofs can contribute to the requirement for all developments to  ensure that 
surface water run -off is managed as close to its source as possible and to reduce 
runoff rates, in accordance with  Policy  S9. 
 A blue roof is an attenuation tank at roof or podium level which can provide stormwater 
attenuation to minimise surfa ce water flood risk, avoiding the need for expensive 
excavated or basement attenuation tanks. The combination of a blue and green roof 
can be used to provide rainwater harvesting which allows the attenuated water to be 
used to irrigate the green roof as pa rt of an integrated approach to water management 
on a site. Blue roofs can make up the drainage and support layer on both extensive 
and intensive green roofs. Where a blue roof is demonstrated not to be possible, 
attenuation must  be provided through additi onal drainage layers in the green roof. 
Developments that incorporate a blue roof must be designed to cope with the 
additional weight , which also provides an opportunity to integrate tree planting 
alongside the blue roof where feasible.  
 Vertical greening is particularly important where site constraints limit other urban 
greening possibilities and biodiversity enhancements.  For example, g reen walls  can 
provide the possibility of growing plants in locations that would not normally support 
vegetation.  
 Green walls provide similar benefits as green roofs in terms of biodiversity, air quality, 
thermal efficiency and cooling, and they can have flood risk alleviation benefits where 
they are irrigated via rainwater runoff , which helps reduc e surface water run -off. In 
addition, green walls have a visible greening effect which provides an attractive design 
feature and important visual amenity provision especially in built -up areas with a lack 
of green space, allowing people to experience biodiversity.  
 Depending on t he particular plant species used, green walls can provide nesting 
habitat s for birds, berries for birds in winter, flowers for pollinators, and important 
habitats for insects. Green walls can also provide amenity and energy conservation 
benefits and help t o protect walls from rain and sun damage. Species chosen for 
planting , and suitable growing conditions , must  be informed by Islington’s Biodiversity 
Action Plan.  
 The incorporation of green walls must  include plants that are planted in the ground and 
climb directly up wall surfaces , and trellis to provide vegetation cover, such as ivy.  
185 
 Green walls can also include planting in roof level planters which hangs down the 
building, where practical, which  can be incorporated as part of a green roof.  
 Impacts on the building structure and associated maintenance requirements are 
important considerations when determining the effectiveness of a green wall. Green 
wall design must include consideration of maintenance requirements in order to 
ensure that plants receive suff icient water and nutrients from the ground. In order to be 
a sustainable greening feature, the watering system for the green wall must  use 
natural watering and must not rely on mains water supply  as its predominant water 
source . Rainwater must  be harvested  for the irrigation of vertical greening, where 
possible, however the irrigation system must not require pumping ; it is preferable to 
use natural watering from abo ve through roof top attenuation . Rooting greening in the 
ground (or at roof level) will ensur e that water demand is minimised . However , it will 
not be possible to store rainwater for the irrigation of vertical greening on a year -round 
basis, therefore vertical greening may require some mains water supply in times of low 
rainfall and drought.  
 Vertical greening is considered to be suitable as part of new -build and major 
developments across Islington, including in conservation areas and on listed buildings 
(subject to appropriate permissions). Proposals involving vertical greening must  be 
assessed in  line with relevant design and heritage policies; the benefits of vertical 
greening (where fully compliant with Policy G5) are likely to attract significant weight in 
such assessments. In order to ensure that architectural and historic features are 
preserv ed and damage to buildings is avoided, special consideration must  be given to 
the weight of the green wall and the impact it may have on the structural fabric and 
material of the building.   
186 
 6 Sustainable Design  
A. The Council  will seek to ensure the borough develops in a way that maximises 
positive effects on the environment and improves quality of life, whilst minimising or 
avoiding negative impacts. Ensuring  sustainable design will reduce fuel poverty, and 
improve long term energy security  for Islington residents and businesses; minimise 
the contribution of development in Islington to climate change and ensure that 
developments are designed to mitigate the effects of climate change , in line with  the 
three strategic objectives of the Committee on Climate Change to reduce energy 
demand, decarbonise heat  and decarbonise electricity.  
 
B. The Council  will promote zero carbon development, with the aim that all buildings in 
Islington will be net zero carbo n by 2050 . To ensure that Islington is on the right 
trajectory to achieve this target , sustainable design must be considered holistically 
from the start of the design process and all development proposals are required to 
demonstrate how they will comply wi th all relevant sustainable design standards and 
policies during design, construction and operation of the development.  
 
C. All development proposals must maximise energy efficiency and minimise on -site 
greenhouse gas  emissions in accordance with the followin g energy hierarchy:   
 
 be lean: use less energy and manage demand during operation. Energy demand 
(both annual and peak) must  be minimised as far as possible through 
consideration of building fabric energy efficiency as an integral part of the design, 
with a focus on building form and passive design in addition to specification.  
 be clean: supply energy efficiently and cleanly, and utilise local energy resources 
(such as heat networks and secondary heat).  
 be green: maximise opportunities for renewable energy by producing, storing and 
using renewable energy on -site.  
 be seen: monitor, verify and report on energy performance.  
 
D. The Council  will work with partners and local communities to improve the energy 
efficiency of the existing building stock and wider public realm, with a particular focus 
on increasing energy efficiency of homes and businesses. Islington’s carbon offset 
fund will be used to implement projects to reduce carbon emissions f rom the existing 
building stock.  
 
E. The Council  will promote the extension of existing heat networks and the delivery of 
new heat network infrastructure . Heat networks have the potential to contribute 
significantly to  climate change mitigation through  the decarbonisation of heat, 
minimis ing fuel poverty, and maximis ing energy resilience.   
187 
  
 ‘Carbon ’ is used in this chapter  as a shorthand term for all greenhouse gases. 
London’s carbon accounting is measured in carbon dioxide equivalent, which includes 
the conversion of other greenhouse gases into their equivalent carbon dioxide 
emissions.   
 Reducing the environmental impact of development whilst supporting growth is 
particularly challenging in dense urban locations with high levels of growth, such as 
Islington. However, growth and change can also provide opportunities to support the 
development  of more sustainable buildings and neighbourhoods that are designed to 
minimise their contribution to, and mitigate the effects of, climate change, while also 
improving quality of life.  
 The Committee on Climate Change has three strategic objectives as part  of the overall 
aim to minimise emissions and reduce the impact of development on climate change:  
 Reducing energy demand;  
 Decarbonising heat;  and 
 Decarbonising electricity.  
 Requiring developments to maximise energy efficiency and minimise greenhouse gas  
emissions in accordance with the energy hierarchy will contribute to achieving these 
overall objectives, and will ensure that Islington is on the right trajectory to achieve its 
target for all buildings in Islington to be net zero carbon by 2050. This will r equire 
reduction of all greenhouse gases, of which carbon dioxide is the most prominent. 
Seeking to achieve these objectives  will not only reduce the contribution of 
development to climate change, but will also contribute to reducing fuel poverty and  
enhan cing energy resilience.  
 The Council has declared a n environment  and climate emergency and will strive to 
achieve net zero carbon by 2030, ahead of the formal 2050  target set out in Policy S1. 
The Sustainable Design polic ies set out in the Local Plan will be kept under review and 
the Council may provide further supplementary guidance , ahead of any future Local 
Plan review,  to facilitate delivery of the target earlier  than 2050.  Ultimately, planning is 
only part of meeting the net zero carbon target ; our sus tainable design policies are 
very ambitious but the ability to meet the target largely  depend s on many other 
measures outside the planning system, including  changes to national legislation .  
F. All development proposals are required to adopt an integrated approach to water 
management which considers flood risk,  sustainable drainage, water efficiency, water 
quality and biodiversity. All development proposals will be expected to reduce water 
demand and meet best practice water efficiency targets.  
 
G. The Council  will promote a circular economy approach  to design and construction to 
keep products and materials in use for as long as possible and to minimise 
construction waste. A central part of this is ensuring developments are designed to  be 
flexible and adaptable  to changing requirements  and circumstances over  their lifetime.  
 
H. All new development must be designed, constructed and operated to limit contribution 
to air pollution and to improve air quality as far as possible, as well as reducing 
exposure to poor air quality, especially among vulnerable people.   
188 
 
 While each stage of the h ierarchy is important, priority is for developments to reduce 
energy demand through energy efficiency  measures in the first instance because this 
is the most efficient and cost effective way to reduce emissions, while also reducing 
fuel poverty.  Reducing  emissions as far as possible through energy efficient design 
means there will be less emissions to be reduced at the later stages of the energy 
hierarchy . Proposals which  attempt to achieve the policy targets solely /largely  through 
renewable energy , such as PV panels , instead of first ensuring that energy demand is 
minimised as far as possible  through consideration from the start of the design 
process , will be resisted, and will not constitute the best use of land . The energy 
hierarchy therefore prevents poor building design being compensated for  by hig h on-
site renewable generation. Furthermore, prioritising energy efficienc t design ensures 
that the associated carbon reductions are guaranteed  because they are an intrinsic 
part of building design , while renewable energy, such as solar PV panels , could then 
be removed or fail at a later date , leaving a poorly performing building . 
 The decarbonisation of heat is recognised as  the biggest challenge facing UK energy 
policy today , and is one of the three key strategic objectives of the Committee on 
Climate Change  The UK has made good progress on decarbonising the National Grid ; 
however, very limited progress has been made on decarbonising heating, which still 
relies largely on comb ustion of gas, coal, oil and biomass to generate heat. Heating 
and hot water for UK buildings make up around 40% of energy consumption and 20% 
of greenhouse gas emissions. Natural gas remains by far the most common form of 
heating in UK homes, therefore a key goal of the decarbonisation of heat is reducing 
reliance on natural gas.   
 The use of low or zero carbon energy in new developments, including low -carbon heat 
networks and secondary sources, will be required to enable the decarbonisation of 
heat and el ectricity, and will strengthen Islington’s energy resilience by enabling 
developments to benefit from local low -carbon energy sources. The extension of 
existing heat networks and the delivery of new heat network infrastructure is a key 
priority for the dec arbonisation of heat, and will also help to minimise fuel poverty by 
reducing energy bills for local residents, including the most vulnerable residents. A 
strategic masterplan vision for potential heat networks in Islington has been developed 
as part of a multi -phase project, which included borough wide energy mapping, carried 
out by Buro Happold. Islington’s strategic vision for heat networks is to develop the 
initial clusters and form interlinks within the borough and to adjacent boroughs32.  
 Islington’s e xisting heat networks have developed around gas engine combined heat 
and power (CHP) systems. However, the carbon savings from gas engine CHP are 
now declining as a result of National Grid electricity decarbonis ation , and there is 
increasing evidence of ad verse air quality impacts  related to th eir use . Despite this, 
Islington’s gas CHP powered heat networks are still considered to be an effective and 
low-carbon means of supplying heat when compared to other heat sources, 
particularly as heat networks offer opportunities to transition to zero  carbon heat 
sources faster than individual building approaches. In order to minimise negative 
impacts on air quality, CHP technologies used to develop heat networks will only be 
acceptable where they do not emit signific ant levels of Nitrogen Oxides ( NO x).  
 The expansion of Islington’s heat networks is a priority for the Council . Proven low -
carbon and low -emission CHP technology using natural gas will continue to be used, 
where appropriate, to develop new networks in Isli ngton, with planned future transition 
to cost -effective secondary sources, including low -grade waste heat. The Council  is 
committed to transition  to the use of secondary sources to power heat networks in the 
                                                
32The development of proposed  future networks is not guaranteed and they are subject to change.   
189 
 long term ; however practical limitations  relatin g to the use of these sources (such as 
government direction, available technology and funding requirements) mean that low -
carbon natural gas CHP is the most appropriate heat source to develop the borough’s 
heat networks in the interim. T he transition to he at networks powered by secondary 
sources will  ultimately be driven by  central government and the evolution of carbon 
reduction targets through updates to the Building Regulations . 
 The energy mapping undertaken by Buro Happold suggests that there are a numb er of 
sources of low grade heat in the Borough, including London Underground ventilation, 
data centres and substations. Identifying and capturing such sources of low carbon 
heat will be key to moving beyond natural gas CHP in the future when heating system s 
will be required to specify a lower annual carbon content of heat, and natural gas CHP 
will no longer be a low carbon option.  
 The Local Plan policies will ensure that Islington is on the right track to turn the Paris 
Agreement’s aspiration to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C into action. It will take a 
substantial period of time for developments in Islington to meet the 2050 net zero 
carbon target due to the extent of the changes required. The development industry will 
need time to make the necessary changes to incorporate more efficient construction 
methods/approaches and low carbon heating systems, as well as ensuring the target 
does not undermine the viability of development or restrict required development 
growth.  
 Minimising the effects of climate change on people and the environment is a 
fundamental consideration in sustainable design. Increasing temperatures bring 
increased risk of overheating , both  within buildings and , at a more macro scale , 
through the ‘urban heat island effect ’. Increases in t he frequency and intensity of 
heavy rainfall bring increased risk of surface water flooding. Climate change is a 
particular concern in the context of ongoing development and intensification of the built 
environment. In response, developments must be design ed and constructed in ways 
that mitigate the effects of climate change. Design must  address overheating and the  
‘urban heat island  effect’  through measures such as the orientation of buildings and 
use of solar shading to minimise solar gain; the use of nat ural ventilation; and the 
incorporation of green infrastructure to provide urban cooling. Flood risk must  be 
managed and mitigated through the incorporation of SUDS and utilising flood proof 
design.  
 An integrated approach to water management will encourage  water to be considered 
holistically across a site, and in the context of links with wider -than-site level plans. A 
reduction in mains water demand will be achieved through requiring compliance with 
water efficiency targets such as BREEAM and the national targets set in Building 
Regulations.  
 A circular economy approach is one where materials are retained in use at their 
highest value for as long as possible , and are then re -used or recycled, leaving a 
minimum of residual waste. This approach aims to minimis e the wider environmental 
impacts of materials and construction processes . Buildings must  be designed to be 
adaptable, flexible and able to respond to change in order to extend a building’s useful 
life, ensur ing resource efficiency and avoid ing unnecessary  demolition. Buildings must 
be made from sustainably -sourced, low impact components and materials that can be 
re-used or recycled, and building design must enable deconstruction in order to ensure 
the maximum value of building components can be recovered a t the end of the 
building’s life.  
  
190 
  
A. All development proposals are required to submit a Sustainable Design and 
Construction Statement  which  must demonstrate that the proposal meets all 
relevant sustainable design  policies . The Sustainable Design and Construction 
Statement  must show how  sustainable design  has been considered holistically from 
the start of the design process and is integrated throughout the construction and 
operation of the development.  
 
B. The S ustainable Design and Construction Statement submitted by all major 
developments, minor new build developments, and larger minor extensions must 
include the following details:  
(i) Energy Strategy - demonstrate how the net zero carbon target will be met 
within the framework of the energy hierarchy and justify the heat source 
selection in accordance with the heating hierarchy. For detailed 
requirements see Policy S4: Minimising greenhouse gas emissions; and 
Policy S5: Energy Infrastructure.  
(ii) Adaptive Design Strate gy – demonstrate how the application addresses 
circular economy principles, including the impact and efficiency of 
construction materials, and how the development has been designed to 
adapt to change. For detailed requirements see Policy S10: Circular 
Econ omy and Adaptive Design.  
(iii) Landscape Design Strategy – demonstrate an integrated approach to hard 
and soft landscape design which maximises urban greening, soft 
landscaping, biodiversity and sustainable drainage, including the 
incorporation of SUDS into the landscape design. For detailed requirements 
see Policy G4: Biodiversity, landscape design and trees.  
(iv) Integrated Water Management and Sustainable Drainage – demonstrate an 
integrated approach to water management which considers sustainable 
drainage, water e fficiency, water quality and biodiversity holistically. Major 
developments must submit a Surface Water Drainage Pro -forma to ensure 
surface water drainage proposals meet the drainage requirements. For 
detailed requirements see Policy S9: Integrated Water M anagement and 
Sustainable Drainage.  
(v) Operational sustainability – demonstrate how the development will be 
designed to facilitate ongoing effective and sustainable use, management 
and maintenance. For detailed requirements see Policy S4 Minimising 
greenhouse  gas emissions and Policy S6: Managing Heat Risk.  
(vi) Air Quality - demonstrate how the development will be designed, constructed 
and operated to limit its contribution to air pollution, improve local air quality, 
and reduce exposure to poor air quality, espec ially for vulnerable people. For 
detailed requirements see Policy S7: Improving air quality.  
 
C. The Sustainable Design and Construction Statement submitted by smaller minor 
extensions and minor changes of use must  demonstrate that all relevant sustainable 
design requirements have been considered. The level of information provided in the 
statement must  be proportionate to the se requirements.   
191 
  
D. Developments are required to support monitoring of the implementation of the 
Sustainable Design and Construction Statement , including through the Green 
Performance Plan  (where relevant)  and other submitted sustainable design details, 
by:  
(vii) allowing Council  officers access to the development;  
(viii) submitting information to the Council  when requested; and  
(ix) where necessary, t hrough payment of a reasonable monitoring fee set by 
the Council.  
 
 
 All developments must submit a SDCS , including developments involving the  creation 
of new buildings;  refurbishment and  redevelopment of existing buildings; changes of 
use; and extensions  (including basements, roof extensions, and loft conversions). 
Developments involving extensions to existing buildings must  consider the sustainable 
design implications in relation to the building as a whole, in addition to the extension. 
‘Larger minor exte nsions’ referred to in Part B of this policy include minor extensions of 
100sqm or more . 
 Guidance and minimum information requirements for each section of the SDCS, 
depending on the application type , are set out in the Environmental Design SPD . The 
level o f detail provided must  be proportionate to the scale of proposed development 
and allow the Council  to fully assess the proposals against relevant planning policies. 
Early engagement with the Council  through pre -application advice is encouraged, to 
discuss and agree the scope of the SDCS and the required level of detail.  
 Smaller m inor extensions (less than 100 sqm) and minor changes of use may not need 
to provide the detailed information set out in Part C of this policy. Such smaller -scale 
applications must  provide an SDCS with information proportionate to the scale of 
sustainable design requirements required by Local Plan policies. These types of 
development are likely to have less significant sustainable design implications, 
especially as they are required t o meet minimum energy efficiency requirements under 
the Building Regulations.  
 All developments must  be designed and managed to promote ongoing operational 
sustainability , demonstrated as part of the SDCS . A development will only perform to 
its full potent ial in use if it is effectively operated and maintained, and is flexible 
enough to meet changing user demands over time. A building and its systems must  be 
designed to facilitate effective use, management (including performance monitoring), 
maintenance, an d adaptation to changing requirements over a long lifetime. 
Operational sustainability must  also be achieved through raising awareness of 
environmental issues including the  provision of appropriate information, training and 
support to building/site operato rs, maintenance personnel and building users in 
general on how to use, maintain and adapt the building effectively and how to monitor, 
evaluate and optimise performance in use. Ensuring the operation of the development 
is adaptable to changing user needs w ill also help to support sustainable lifestyles.  
  
192 
 A. Major and minor residential developments involving refurbishment or extensions are 
required to achieve a final (post -refurbishment) certified rating of Excellent under 
BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment 2014 (or equivalent scheme) and must  make 
reasonable endea vours to achieve an Outstanding rating.  
 
B. Major and minor new -build residential developments must achieve a four -star rating 
(as a minimum) under the BRE Home Quality Mark scheme.  
 
C. All non -residential and mixed -use developments proposing 500sqm  or more  net 
additional floorspace are required to achieve a final (post -construction stage) 
certified rating of Excellent as part of a fully fitted assessment within BREEAM New 
Construction 2018 (or equivalent scheme), and  must  make reasonable endeavours 
to achieve a n Outstanding rating. A ‘verification stage’ certification at post 
occupancy stage must  also be achieved, unless it can be demonstrated that this is 
not feasible.  
 
D. Major non -residential and mixed -use refurbishment developments are required to 
achieve a fin al (post -construction) certified rating of Excellent under BREEAM UK 
Non-Domestic Refurbishment and Fit -out (or equivalent scheme) and must  make 
reasonable endeavours to achieve an Outstanding rating. The scope of works of the 
development must include a fu ll fit-out, unless it can be demonstrated that this is not 
feasible.  
 
E. All developments assessed under BREEAM New Construction 2018 (as required by 
Part C) and Non -Domestic Refurbishment and Fit -out schemes (as required by Part 
D) are required to score the following minimum ‘credits’, in addition to the minimum 
acceptable requirements for a BREEAM excellent rating:  
(i) At least 50% of credits on Environmental impacts from construction products 
(Mat 01);  
(ii) At least 1 credit on Responsible sourcing of materials (Mat  03), in addition 
Criterion E(i);  
(iii) At least 50% of credits on Construction waste management (Wst 01);  
(iv) All credits on Water consumption (Wat 01), or a minimum of 3 credits where 
rainwater and/or greywater recycling is demonstrated not to be feasible;  
(v) The second credit on energy monitoring (Ene 02 – Sub-metering of high 
energy load and tenancy areas), where feasible ; 
(vi) Reasonable endeavours must  be made to achieve two credits under the Ene 
01 exemplary level criteria, in order to demonstrate zero carbon 
devel opment; and  
(vii) BREEAM New Construction only - all 4 credits for Energy modelling and 
reporting as part of Reduction of energy use and carbon emissions (Ene 01).  
 
F. All developments assessed under BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment 2014 (as 
required by Part A) are re quired to score the following credits, in addition to the 
minimum acceptable requirements for a BREEAM excellent rating:   
193 
 (i) At least 50% of credits on Environmental impact of materials (Mat 01);  
(ii) At least 50% of credits on Responsible sourcing of materials (Ma t 02); and  
(iii) All credits on Refurbishment site waste management (Was 2).  
 
G. All minor non -residential new build developments and minor non -residential 
extensions of between 100sqm and 500sqm  are required to demonstrate how all 
credits for Water consumption (Wa t 01) would  be achieved under the relevant 
BREEAM scheme. A minimum of 3 credits must be achieved where rainwater 
and/or greywater recycling is demonstrated not to be feasible, in order to achieve 
water credits equivalent to an Excellent standard.  
 
 All developments must  achieve the highest feasible level of the relevant sustainable 
design standard in order to ensure high standards of sustainable design and contribute  
to the Council ’s overarching sustainability objectives. The Council  will assess 
deve lopment proposals by using the Building Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Methodology (BREEAM)33. BREEAM is a sustainability assessment and 
certification scheme for the built environment and provides a widely recognised and 
well understood fra mework for the promotion of sustainable design. It allows for the 
assessment and rating of the environmental life cycle impacts arising from different 
types of developments, including energy, pollution, water, materials, health and 
wellbeing, and waste. Co mpliance with BREEAM will help to mitigate the life cycle 
impacts of new and existing buildings on the environment and allow developers to 
demonstrate to the Council  that development is truly sustainable.  
 Residential proposals were formerly required to ach ieve certification under the Code 
for Sustainable Homes (CSH) assessment method, which has now been withdrawn. 
Residential developments may still carry out a voluntary assessment using the CSH in 
order to ensure high sustainable design standards. Where  new national sustainable 
housing standards are introduced in the future which would lead to better, more 
effective implementation of sustainable design objectives, Islington’s policies will be 
interpreted in relation to these standards and further guidance may be provided in a 
revision of the Environmental Design SPD. In order to ensure resi dential development  
continue s to meet high sustainable design standards , this policy requires the 
achievement of alternative standards to the CSH . 
 BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment 2014 (covered by Part A of this policy) applies to 
alterations to existing dwellings, including domestic conversions, change of use 
projects and extensions; it allows both the extension and the existing dwelling to be 
included as part of the assessment  as necessary . A post -refurbishment stage 
assessment or review is required in order to confirm the final 'as refurbished' 
performance of the building; this must  be certified after practical completion of the 
refurbishment works.  
 The BREEAM Domes tic Refurbishment scheme does not apply to new -build 
developments. The Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES) will be applied to new -

 build residential developments in order to reduce carbon emissions through fabric 
energy efficiency, as set out in Policy  S4: Minimising greenhouse gas emissions.  
 Achieving a rating under t he BRE Home Quality Mark (covered by Part B of this policy) 
is one way of demonstrating the standard of a new residential dwelling . The Home 
Quality Mark has been designed to ensure the c onstruction of high quality sustainable 
homes that will meet the long -term needs of occupants, including measures for carbon 
emissions, sustainable materials, air quality and natural daylight . This scheme allows 
the sustainability credentials of new homes to be compared more easily, and, where 
adhered to alongside FEES requirements, will help developers to demonstrate 
compliance with the relevant policies.  
 Table 6.1 identifies the different sustainable design requirements for residential 
developments.

 The BREEAM New Construction 2018 scheme (covered by Part C of this policy) can 
be used to assess the environmental life cycle impacts of new non -residential 
buildings at the design and construction stages. ‘New construction’ is defined as 
development that results in a new standalone structure, or a new -build extension to an 
existing structure. A threshold of 500sqm has been applied to ensure that larger minor 
developments achieve this requirement.  
 A fully fitted assessment will ensure that the fit out of t he development meets the 
sustainable design policy requirements, including those relating to energy efficiency, 
water efficiency, and sustainable materials. Fully fitted developments assessed under 
BREEAM New Construction 2018 must  achieve a ‘verification stage’ certification at 
post occupancy stage, unless it can be demonstrated that this is not feasible. The New 
Build Verification Stage incentivises project teams to close the gap between the design 
intent and actual in -use performance of buildings, and ca n be used to inform the GPP  
as part of the requirements set out in Policy S4.  
 Where it can be demonstrated to the Council ’s satisfaction that the end occupier of the 
development has exceptional requirements which necessitate a shell only or shell and 
core fit out, a BREEAM New Construction 2018 shell only or shell and core 
assessment must  be undertaken; and the BREEAM Non -domestic Refurbishment and 
                                                
34 FEES requirements are set out in policy S4.   
195 
 Fit-out scheme must  be used to assess the subsequent fit -out of the building, to 
upgrade the project to a BRE EAM New Construction fully fitted rating and certification.  
This enables speculative shell only and shell and core projects to achieve fully fitted 
status once the occupiers are known, even though the construction works and 
finishing stages will be carried  out separately. In these cases, the requirement to fully 
fitted status will be secured via legal agreement or planning condition, as appropriate.   
 The BREEAM UK Non -Domestic Refurbishment and Fit -out scheme (covered by Part 
D of this policy) assesses the environmental life cycle impacts of existing non -domestic 
buildings at the refurbishment and fit -out stages. The scope of works being assessed 
must include a full fit -out unless it can be demonstrated to the Council ’s satisfaction 
that the end occupier of the development has particular requirements which 
necessitate a shell only or shell and core building.  As with schemes covered by Part C 
(and detailed in paragraph 6.2 7 above) the subsequent fit -out of the building must  
upgrade the project to a BREEAM  New Construction fully fitted rating and certification; 
this will be secure d via legal agreement or planning condition, as appropriate.

 Achieving the specified credits in Parts E and F of this policy will ensure high 
standards of sustainable design are adopted and will enable delivery of other Local 
Plan sustainability objectives. Developments assessed under BREEAM New 
Construction 2018 an d BREEAM UK Non -Domestic Refurbishment and Fit -out must 
take a robust approach to minimising the environmental impacts of material use. 
Compliance with criterion 1 under Responsible sourcing of materials (Mat 03) is a 
minimum requirement as part of these B REEAM assessments. Criterion 1 specifies 
that all timber and timber -based products used on the project are legally harvested 
and traded timber as per the UK government's Timber Procurement Policy (TPP).  
 All major developments assessed under BREEAM must  make reasonable endeavours 
to achieve an Outstanding rating in accordance with this policy. In order to 
demonstrate that reasonable endeavours have been made, applicants must provide 
detail s of which additional BREEAM credits have been targeted as part of the SDCS . 
Particular efforts must  be made to achieve an Outstanding rating in relation to energy 
performance and modelling. If the Outstanding rating is deemed not to be feasible,  
196 
 details must be provided to justify this ; schemes which do not adequately de monstrate 
this may be refused. Should the relevant BREEAM scheme be replaced or amended 
during the lifetime of the plan the equivalent replacement requirements will be applied 
by the Council . 
 While minor developments are not required to achieve a formal BR EEAM certification, 
Part G requires minor non -residential developments to demonstrate how BREEAM 
credits in relation to water consumption would be achieved in order to maximise the 
efficient use of water. Further details of water efficiency standards are s et out in Policy 
S9. 
 
A. All development proposals are required to demonstrate how greenhouse gas 
emissions will be reduced in accordance with the energy hierarchy (set out in Policy 
S1) as part of the SDCS . Major developments, minor new build developments, and 
larger minor extensions must provide a more detailed energy assessment as part of 
the SDCS . 
 
B. Until the end of 2021, major residential developments and minor new -build 
residential developments of one u nit or more are required to comply with the  interim’ 
Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES), as defined by the Zero Carbon Hub. 
‘Full’ FEES will apply from the start of  2022  onwards . 
 
C. All major developments and minor new -build residential developments of  one unit or 
more must  be net zero  carbon. These developments must demonstrate , as part of 
the SDCS , how the net zero  carbon target will be met within the framework of the 
energy hierarchy.  
 
D. The following on -site reductions in carbon emissions are required  in accordance 
with the energy hierarchy:  
(i) Major developments must  achieve a minimum on -site reduction in total 
(regulated and unregulated) emissions of at least 27 per cent beyond Part L 
of the Building Regulations.  
(ii) Major developments able to connect to an  existing heat network must  
achieve a minimum on -site reduction in total (regulated and unregulated) 
emissions of at least 39 per cent beyond Part L of the Building Regulations.  
(iii) Minor new -build residential developments of one unit or more must  achieve 
a minimum on -site reduction in regulated emissions of at least 19% beyond 
Part L of the Building Regulations, unless it can be demonstrated that such 
provision is not feasible.  
E. In addition to meeting the minimum on -site reduction targets in Part D, all major 
development proposals must  calculate whole life -cycle carbon emissions through a 
nationally recognised whole life-cycle carbon assessment and demonstrate actions 
taken to reduce life -cycle carbon emissions.  
 
F. All developments are required to reduce energy demand through energy efficiency 
measures in the first instance, in accordance with the energy hierarchy. Major

 developments are required to achieve the following reductions in demand as part of 
achieving the overall reduction targets in Part D of this policy:   
(i) Major non -residential development must  achieve at least 15 per cent out of 
the overall reduction target through energy efficiency measures in order to 
reduce energy demand.  
(ii) Major residential development  must  achieve at least 10 per cent out of the 
overall reduction target through energy efficiency measures in order to 
reduce energy demand.  
G. Where it is clearly demonstrated that the zero  carbon target cannot be fully 
achieved on -site, any shortfall must  be provided through a cash in lieu contribution 
to Islington’s carbon offset fund. All major developments and minor new build 
developments of one unit or more will be required to pay the full cost of offsetting 
the remaining regulated emissions, unless it ca n be demonstrated that this is not 
viable, in which case the maximum viable payment for offsetting will be required 
based on a viability assessment. Such payments will be secured through a legal 
agreement.  
 
H. Proposals for householder extensions must  contrib ute to reducing emissions from 
the whole building as far as possible. The SDCS  must demonstrate that cost -
effective energy efficiency measures have been applied to the existing property, 
where practical, in addition to requirements applicable to the extens ion itself.  
 
I. Major developments must submit a Green Performance Plan (GPP) detailing the 
actual measurable outputs for the occupied building in relation to energy 
consumption and carbon emissions, based on the commitments in the SDCS . 
 
J. The SDCS  - and where appropriate, GPP  - for all major developments must  include 
the following information in order to maximise fabric energy efficiency, reduce the 
performance gap and provide more accurate information to design teams:  
(i) An assessment of predicted fu ture energy use based on PHPP for 
residential and low energy non -domestic buildings; and CIBSE TM54 for 
non-domestic buildings (or any equivalent methodology), rather than Part L 
only assessments. Predicted energy use must  be declared in kWh/m2/yr and 
kWh/ yr and this will become one of the GPP indicator targets in the future.  
(ii) Confirm the actual performance values achieved in comparison to the 
original energy targets stated in the SDCS , and to submit the associated 
evidence including site photographs of insu lation installation and the 
construction manager’s declaration. This information must  be submitted to 
the Council  prior to occupancy as part of the final GPP.  
(iii) Carry out an air tightness test and thermographic survey. The test reports, 
along with details of  any remediation measures, must  be provided to the 
Council  prior to occupancy as part of the final GPP.  
 
 This policy seeks to minimise Islington’s contribution to climate change, reduce fuel 
poverty and improve long term energy resilience.  
 The energy hie rarchy must  inform the design, construction and operation of new 
buildings. Major developments, minor new build developments, and larger minor 
extensions  (i.e. over 100sqm)  must provide a more detailed energy assessmen t  
198 
 through an Energy Strategy  (as part of the SDCS ) which must  contain the information 
set out in London Plan Policy SI2 : Minimising greenhouse gas emissions , including 
measures to reduce carbon emissions beyond Part L of the Building Regulations. This 
policy refers to the Building Re gulations 2013. If these are updated, the new 
regulations will be used to inform the policy threshold . 
 This must  be achieved by minimising energy demand through fabric energy efficiency 
measures as far as possible in the first instance, before seeking to a ddress how low 
carbon energy will be supplied and renewable technologies incorporated. An important 
aspect of managing demand will be to reduce peak energy loadings.  
 The fabric energy efficiency of a building is not only the result of the thickness of 
insulation but also of the area of external envelope and its complexity, particularly in 
terms of thermal bridges, increased heat loss areas and window proportions. As 
building form has a direct influence on energy efficiency, energy demand must  be 
minimised by improving fabric energy efficiency with a focus on building form as well 
as specification.  
 Part B of this policy requires all relevant residential developments to comply with the 
FEES, which is available as part of the Government’s Standard Assessment 
Procedure (SAP), used to assess and compare the energy and environmental 
performance of dwellings . The FEES has been developed by the Zero Carbon Hub to 
ensure that zero carbon homes prioritise a holistic approach to energy efficiency that 
assesses both spe cification and form components under one metric.  While Building 
Regulations Part L helps to assess and value better specifications, it does not allow 
assessment of efforts to design and build more efficient building forms. In contrast, the 
FEES offers grea ter flexibility in the ways energy efficiency can be achieved, providing 
a more effective tool for valuing and quantifying efforts made to design a more energy 
efficient building form, alongside increases in energy efficient specifications. The FEES 
will e ncourage future best practice by ensuring the design of more energy efficient 
residential buildings that do not rely too heavily on on -site low carbon energy sources 
and off -site carbon offsetting to reduce emission s.  
 The FEES targets are the proposed max imum space heating and cooling energy 
demand for zero carbon homes that would normally be needed to maintain 
comfortable internal temperatures. The Zero Carbon Hub has recommended that 
kWh/m2/yr  is used to measure this , and that the targets are based on tw o types of 
residential development and two FEES levels. Up to the end of 2021, this policy 
requires compliance with the ‘i nterim’ FEES levels set out in T able 6.3  below. From the 
start of 2022 onwards, the FEES requirement will be increased to ‘full’ FEES.  
Table 6.3: FEES requirements  
Type of residential 
development  Interim FEES  
(2020 -2021 ) Full FEES  
(from 2022)  
Mid-terrace houses and 
blocks of flats  < 43 kWh/m2/yr  < 39 kWh/m2/yr  
Semi -detached, end of 
terrace and detached 
houses  < 52 kWh/m2/yr  < 46 kWh/m2/yr   
199 
  
 Energy  modelling carried out as part of the London Borough of Islington Energy 
Evidence Base concluded that compliance with the ‘interim’ FEES, and future 
transition to ‘full’ FEES, will discourage poorly efficient buildings (i.e. those proposi ng 
an inefficient form alongside inefficient specifications) while still allowing a wide range 
of residential development  typologies to be developed. The FEES have the potential to 
assist scheme viability because designers will be able to achieve greater e nergy 
efficiency by improving building form, in addition to specification, which is likely to be 
cost neutral or potentially cost positive. Compliance with the FEES levels 
recommended by the Zero Carbon Hub not only supports carbon reduction, but also 
long term energy security and the reduction of fuel poverty for future residents.  The 
FEES does not apply to residential developments involving refurbishment and 
extension ; however, these developments are encouraged to maximise energy 
efficiency through a focu s on building form  (e.g. for a proposed new extension)  in 
addition to specification, in accordance with the FEES.  
 In addition to compliance with the FEES, all developments are encouraged to adopt 
recognised and successful fabric first approaches  such as Pa ssivhaus  and AECB 
Building Standard (previously known as Silver Standard) , which go beyond the policy 
levels, in order to promote best practice fabric energy efficiency . Further detail is set 
out in the Environmental Design SPD.  
 In accordance with the ener gy hierarchy, after reducing emissions as far as possible 
through fabric energy efficiency, all developments must  seek to supply energy 
efficiently and cleanly  (with reference to Policy S5), followed by  incorporating 
renewable energy. The Council  supports the development of renewable energy 
technologies, subject to meeting wider policy requirements in relation to design, green 
roofs, amenity and air quality.  
 All developments are required to maximise opportunities for on -site electricity and heat 
production from solar technologies (photovoltaic and thermal), and other renewable 
technologies wh ich the Council  considers are  appropriate. The use of innovative 
building materials and smart technologies must  also be maximised. This approach will 
reduce ca rbon emissions, as well as promoting energy resilience and alleviating fuel 
poverty by reducing energy costs to occupants.   
 Solar photovoltaic  technology provides a reliable source of clean renewable electricity 
which is  generated at or near the point of u se and is increasingly cost competitive with 
grid electricity. All developments are encouraged to utilise roof spaces more effectively 
for the installation of photovoltaic panels (PVs) , where feasible and practical, in order 
to ensure that applicants go be yond the minimum number of panels required to 
achieve the necessary carbon reduction target , taking into account other policy 
requirements relating to roof spaces, particularly the provision of green roofs . Further 
on-site opportunities for PVs must  also b e considered, alongside other types of 
renewable energy where appropriate, such as wind power and hydro -power.  
 Compliance with the FEES must  be used as the primary mechanism for major 
residential developments to achieve the on -site emissions reduction targ et in Part D. 
While minor new -build residential developments are not required to meet a specific 
energy  efficiency target as part of this policy, compliance with the FEES will ensure 
that emissions are reduced through energy efficiency measures as far as p ossible, 
beyond Building Regulation requirements. All other minor developments are not 
required to achieve specific carbon reduction targets or energy efficiency targets 
beyond Building Regulation requirements. Achieving energy credits as part of a  
200 
 BREEAM rating will assist major non -residential developments in meeting the energy 
efficiency target.  
 While minor developments are unlikely to have significant sustainable design 
implications on their own, the cumulative impact on energy consumption and carbon 
emissions is significant. Minor developments, including new -build developments, 
changes of use, c onversions of properties to residential units, and extensions to 
existing buildings can result in increased carbon emissions due to heating and lighting 
demands caused by increased occupancy and, in the case of new builds and 
extensions, increased surface area. The Building Regulations help to ensure, to some 
degree, that carbon emissions from minor developments are minimised by setting 
minimum energy efficiency requirements for new -build and existing developments, 
including material changes of use and exte nsions. However, the current Building 
Regulations do not require consequential improvements to an existing dwelling when it 
is extended.  
 Part H of this policy requires , where practical,  householders to apply energy efficiency 
enhancements to the existing building, in addition to the extension itself, as this 
represents a cost -effective opportunity to minimise carbon emissions and reduce 
energy bills. The design and construction of extensions to existing dwellings must  
prioritise fabric  energy efficiency me asures with a focus on form in addition to 
specification, based on same principle as the FEES. Further information on 
appropriate energy ef ficiency measures is  set out in the Environmental Design SPD.  
 All developments  including minor developments  are encou raged to use innovative 
energy saving measures to minimise carbon emissions , where these do not conflict  
with other policy requirements . This includes measures that can be taken into account 
in SAP calculations, such as the use of waste water heat recovery  systems, and will 
therefore have an impact on the proposed carbon reductions for a development. 
Developers must  weigh -up the effectiveness, appropriateness and costs of a particular 
system in comparison to other available technologies, and then decide how  best to 
meet the overall carbon reduction target.  
 Major developments are required to achieve the minimum on -site reduction targets 
specified in Part D by reducing the  total operational emissions from the site. 
Operational emissions are those associated wi th energy consumption as part of the 
operation of a development, including emissions from plant or equipment. The  total 
operational emissions include regulated emissions (i.e. those covered by the Building 
Regulations) and unregulated emissions  (i.e. those  not covered by the Building 
Regulations, such as emissions  associated wit h cooking and small appliances).   
 The required minimum on -site reduction targets in Part D will increase over time in 
future updates to the Local Plan, as will the required minimum r eductions in energy 
demand, in order to ensure that Islington is on the right trajectory to meet the 2050 net 
zero carbon target. The gradual changes in targets will take account of the reducing 
costs of more efficient construction methods and the availabi lity of low and zero 
carbon heat.  
 Operational carbon emissions will make up a declining proportion of a development’s 
whole life carbon emissions as operational carbon targets become more stringent. In 
order t o fully capture a development’s carbon impact,  a whole life -cycle approach must  
be adopted which captures not only a building’s operational emissions from energy 
consumption (regulated and unregulated), but also  captures its embodied emissions 
(i.e. those associated with raw material extraction, manufa cture and transport of 
building materials, and construction) and emissions associated with maintenance  and  
201 
 eventual material disposal . Carbon reductions resulting from actions taken to reduce  
overall life -cycle emissions  from development are additional red uctions and will not be 
considered as part of achieving the minimum on -site carbon reduction targets in Part 
D, as these relate solely to the operational emissions from a building’s energy 
consumption.  
 Major developments and minor new -build residential dev elopments of one unit or more 
are expected to achieve net zero  carbon targets on -site, rather than relying on offset 
fund payments to make up any shortfall in emissions. Where the net zero  carbon 
target cannot be fully achieved on -site, all projected resid ual carbon emissions will be 
offset through a financial contribution as follows:  
 For minor new -build residential developments , all remaining regulated emissions 
will be offset based on a flat fee of £1000 per new flat and £1500 per new house35.  
 For all maj or developments , all remaining regulated emissions will be offset based 
on the nationally recognised non -traded price of £95/tonne  for a period of 30 years . 
This price has been tested as part of the viability assessment for the London Plan 
and may be updat ed through the Environmental Design SPD should the evidence 
base change.  
 The remaining carbon emissions to be offset must  be clearly stated in the SDCS . The 
Council  will assess each development individually to verify any projected residual 
carbon dioxide e missions and calculate the financial contribution to offset these 
emissions. The contributions towards offsetting projected residual carbon emissions 
will be secured by a legal agreement and are not addressed by the Council 's CIL 
charge.  The carbon offsetting contribution  cannot be funded through CIL under the CIL  
Regulations 2010 (as amended) because it  is not considered to be infrastructure, as 
defin ed under the Planning Act 2008.  
 The Council ’s Affordable Energy Board is responsible for decisions regarding the 
allocation of carbon offset payments  and this will be assessed on case by case basis. 
Offset fund payments will be ring -fenced to implement measures and projects that 
reduce carbon emission from the existing building stock in the borough, suc h as 
energy efficiency improvements to social and private housing.  The spending of carbon 
offset payments and the monitoring of carbon savings delivered will be managed by 
the Council . Further details on the implementation of the offset policy are set out in the 
Environmental Design SPD . 
 Major developments are required to submit a GPP  detailing the actual measurable 
outputs for the occupied building  in relation to energy consumption and carbon 
emissions , based on the commitments in the SDCS . A draft GPP must be provided 
with the planning application, and , where the end occupier is known , the plan must  be 
developed jointly with them. A full GPP with updated targets adjusted to reflect new 
information on occupancy, and full details of monitoring arrangements, must  be 
submitted within six months of occupation. This will ensure that development is able to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change, consistent with the requirements of the NPPF. 
The GPP must  set out arrangements for monitoring and reporting on the progre ss of 
the plan over the first two years of occupancy, and arrangements for the handover of 
the plan, where the occupier is different to the developer.  Further guidance is provided 
in the Environmental Design SPD.  
 A key aim of the GPP is to address the ‘per formance gap’, i.e. the (usually significant) 
disparity between the predicted/modelled energy performance of buildings at design 
                                                
35 These fees may be updated in the future through a SPD.   
202 
 stage and their actual operational performance. Surveys of completed buildings reveal 
a substantial gap between design expectat ions and delivered performance, especially 
energy performance. Addressing the degradation of performance between the 
planning stage and detailed design/construction stage will help to make Islington’s 
carbon reduction policies more effective and will have a direct impact on delivering 
better performing buildings, and ultimately achieving the Council ’s strategic aim of 
minimising the contribution of development in Islington to climate change . 
 Seeking to more accurately predict the future energy performance o f a building by 
using metrics such as Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) or Chartered Institute 
of Building Service Engineers (CIBSE) TM54 will enable designers to consider factors 
that impact a building’s actual operational performance at an earlier st age in the 
planning process. This will also enable a more accurate determination of the 
anticipated energy consumption and carbon emissions that can be used to verify the 
performance of the constructed building in operation, which is not possible with 
Building Regulation Part L percentage reductions. Planning and design carbon metrics 
based exclusively on Building Regulation Part L percentage improvements cannot be 
measured once a building is in operation and this makes efforts to reduce the 
performance gap  very challenging. Metrics such as PHPP or CIBSE TM54 will ensure 
that design and construction choices are well informed, and therefore drive the design 
of better residential and non -residential buildings.  
 The predicted energy use of development must  be declared in kWh/m2/yr and kWh/yr 
to address the issue of heat demand. This metric is appropriate to measure energy 
demand because it is independent of fuel type and as it has a number of benefits 
including design flexibility, consideration of building form,  and being a known ‘currency’ 
for energy efficiency. The calculation of predicted energy use must  be undertaken pre -
planning, and updated during design and construction as part of the SDCS . The 
calculation can then be verified during operation and must  be reported through the 
GPP. Once the use of PHPP or CIBSE TM54 to calculate predicted energy use has 
been established, designers must  use these methodologies to assess actual energy 
demand which will enable the future adoption of fabric first approaches base d on 
performance metrics, such as Passivhaus and AECB Building Standard . Preventing 
poor quality construction will also help to reduce the performance gap.  
 The Council  is committed to working with key stakeholders, such as the Mayor of 
London, in order to  promote good practice and information sharing in relation to 
energy performance.  
 
A. All major developments are required to have a communal low-temperature heating 
system.  Heating systems must  have a maximum annual carbon content of heat of 
less than 280 gCO ₂/kWh, calculated using the carbon emissions factor for grid 
electricity from the most recently available Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES ). 
The heat source for the communal heating sys tem must be selected in accordance 
with the following heating hierarchy:  
1. connect to local existing or planned heat networks (subject to parts F and G 
below)   
203 
 2. use zero-emission or  local secondary heat sources (in conjunction with heat 
pump , if required).  
3. use low -emission CHP (only where there is a case for CHP to enable the 
delivery of an area -wide heat network).  
4. use ultra -low NO x gas boilers.  
 
B. CHP and ultra -low NO x gas boiler communal or heat network  systems (numbers 3 
and 4 in the heating hierarchy set ou t in Part A) must  be designed to ensure that 
they meet the requirements of Policy S7 . 
 
C. Minor new -build residential developments with an individual heating system are 
required to use ultra -low NO x gas boilers as the system heat source. The use of 
individual  air source heat pumps  (ASHPs)  as the heat source for minor new -build 
residential developments is not acceptable unless the development is located in an 
area which is n ot connected to the gas network;  or where the development will 
achieve minimal heat demands through Passivhaus standards or similar. The use of 
individual ASHPs  may be appropriate for some minor new -build non -residential 
developments.  Larger minor new -build developments should have a comm unal 
heating system where feasible and should be designed to connect to a current or 
planned heat network where Part F of this policy is applicable. Where network 
connection is not possible, a communal gas -boiler or ASHP system may be 
appropriate.  
 
D. As part  of the SDCS, a ll major  developments must demonstrate that they have 
assessed the feasibility of heat network connection (including SHN) or other 
appropriate heat sources, in accordance with the heating hierarchy, in order to 
ensure low and zero carbon hea ting options are prioritised.  Larger minor 
developments that are able to connect to a heat network under Part F must  assess 
the feasibility of connection as part of the SDCS . 
 
E. All major residential developments and larger minor new -build residential 
developments are required to provide an estimate of the anticipated heat unit supply 
price (£/kWh), annual standing charge and estimated annual maintenance costs of 
their proposed he ating system within the SDCS . Major applications must  provide 
estimates of the life cycle costs of the proposed heating system using CIBSE 
quoted plant lifetimes.  
 
F. Major developments located within 500 metres of an existing heat network, and 
larger minor n ew-build developments located within 50 metres, must be designed to 
connect to that network at the time of construction, including provision of the means 
to connect to that network and a reasonable financial contribution to the connection 
charge, unless a feasibility assessment demonstrates that connection is not 
reasonably possible. An existing heat network includes a planned network that will 
be in existence by the anticipated time of practical completion.  
 
G. Major developments located within 500 metres of a planned future heat network, 
which is considered by the Council  likely to be operational within 3 years of a grant 
of planning permission  must be designed to be able to connect to that network in 
the future. Developers are required to commit to connectio n and contribute to the 
cost of connection via a legal agreement, unless a feasibility assessment 
demonstrates that connection is not reasonably possible . 
 
H. Where connection to an existing or future heat network is not possible, major 
developments must  deve lop and/or connect to a low or zero carbon Shared Heating  
204 
 Network (SHN) linking neighbouring developments and/or existing buildings, unless 
it can be demonstrated that this is not reasonably possible.  
 
I. Where connection to an existing or future heat network  is deemed possible under 
parts F and G above, major developments are required to provide a preferred 
energy strategy and an  alternative energy strategy  (as part of the SDCS ). The  
preferred energy strategy should  be enacted based on connection to a h eat 
network . In cases where it is not reasonably possible to connect to a heat network 
the alternative energy s trategy should  be enacted and the heat source will be 
selected in accordance with the heating hierarchy. Minor developments that are 
able to connect to  a heat network are required to provide details of the connection 
as part of the SDCS . 
 
J. The Council  will support the development of heat networks and energy centres in 
principle, subject to meeting wider policy requirements, including on design and air 
quality. 
 
K. The SDCS  should set out a strategy for how the development will be future -proofed 
to achieve zero carbon emissions on -site by 2050. Where the development is able 
to connect to a heat network, the SDCS  must demonstrate how the heat network 
will be future -proofed to achieve zero carbon and the timeline for achieving this.  
 
 The selection  of heat sources for major development in line with the heating hierarchy 
will ensure that developments prioritise low and zero carbon heating options in order to 
contribute to the decarbonisation of heat, and therefore, the reduction of carbon 
emissions. The use of low and zero carbon heating options, particularly heat networks 
and secondary heat sources will also help to reduce fuel poverty and increase energy 
resilience. Examples of secondary heat sources include recovering waste heat from 
London Underground ventilation shafts, recovering ene rgy from the cooling 
requirements of datacentres, and using canal water for heating. Waterways such as 
canals can be  an important local energy resource that can be used for both heating 
and cooling . 
 The use  of existing or planned heat networks must  be prio ritised. Developments must 
connect to a heat network if they are located within the specified distance of an 
existing or future network in accordance with Parts F and G. Larger minor new -build 
developments are defined as developments involving five units o r more, or 500sqm of 
floorspace or more.  Such developments must  have a communal heating system where 
feasible.  
 Where connection to a heat network is not possible (due to distance or feasibility), all 
developments must  consider alternative low and zero car bon heat options in 
accor dance with policy S5 .  
 The use of ASHPs may be suitable where it can be demonstrated that other heat 
network connection s or other appropriate heating systems are not suitable. ASHPs 
perform better where heat can be delivered using lower flow/retur n temperatures, and 
as a result  are less suitable in residential buildings which tend to have high heat 
demands or high hot water demands. There are also operational, control and fuel 
poverty issues linked to the use of individual air sourc e heat pump systems, which 
mean  that their use is often not suitable in residential developments. Where the use of 
an ASHP system is considered to be appropriate for use in a residential development, 
the council will prefer a communal system to an individu al system. The use of  
205 
 individual or communal ASHPs may be acceptable in major and minor non -residential 
developments, depending on the heat loads involved.   
 Where the use o f ASHPs  is considered appropriate, a high specification of energy 
efficiency will be  expected to ensure the system operates efficiently and to reduce 
peak electricity demand. Where feasible, it must be demonstrated that a ASHP system 
provides one external point of connection enabling heat and hot water supply from a 
future heat network sy stem. The appropriateness of individual and communal ASHPs 
will be considered by the council on a case -by-case basis. The use of ASHPs will 
continue to be reviewed as Building Regulation carbon factors are updated, and as 
domestic fossil fuel heating syste m are gradually phased out. Islington's Environmental 
Design SPD contains further information on the use of ASHPs.  
 Development proposals incorporating variable refrigerant flow (VRF) heat pump 
systems will be treated in the same way as any other ASHP -based  systems, and must 
also ensure they comply with the overheating and co oling requirements in Policy S6 . 
VRF systems use a refrigerant as the cooling and heating medium and are generally 
specified to provide both cooling and heating.  
 Proposals for the use of  low-emission CHP systems to support area -wide heat 
networks will continue to be considered on a case by case basis and will only be 
acceptable where there is a strategic case for low -emission CHP systems to support 
the delivery of area -wide heat networks.  Low-emission CHP in this policy refers to 
those technologies which inherently emit very low levels of NO x. 
 A key consideration when selecting heat sources that use natural gas is their impact 
on air quality due to the resulting NO x emissions, with Nitroge n Dioxide (NO 2) in 
particular having a major impact on air pollution. This policy adopts an integrated 
approach to energy supply to ensure that the selection of heat sources will result in 
low or zero emissions of both carbon dioxide and NO x. In order to a void further 
deterioration of existing poor air quality , all development  proposals using CHP in 
Islington must provide evidence to demonstrate that emissions related to energy 
generation will be equivalent or lower than those of an ultra -low NO x gas boiler . CHP 
and ultra -low NO x gas boiler communal or heat network systems  must  be designed to 
ensure that they have no significant impact on local air quality.  
 In order to contribute to the decarbonisation of heat, applicants will be required to 
specify heating  systems with a maximum annual carbon content of heat of 280 
gCO₂/kWh. This will eliminate the installation of high carbon heating systems such as 
poorly efficient gas boiler systems and heat networks using  natural gas fired CHP 
systems that do not have es tablished plans for low carbon heat in the short to medium 
term. It will also promote the use of lower carbon heating systems such as efficient low 
NO x individual and communal gas boilers.  
 The maximum annual carbon content may be reduced further in future  supplementary 
guidance, to encourage even lower carbon heating technologies to be adopted. 
Reducing the cap in the future may not affect electrical heating systems due to the 
projected reductions in the carbon content of electricity; however, the cap is a n 
important tool to drive ongoing carbon reductions in other heating technologies, such 
as low carbon heat network  systems , consistent with  Islington’s strategic vision for 
heat networks.  
 Heat generation and distribution systems are generally specified to  enable buildings to 
achieve a reduction in carbon emissions in line with planning requirements, and the 
carbon factor of heat from several key technologies is calculated based on the carbon  
206 
 content of electricity . Unfortunately, due to the evolving carbon  content of electricity, 
Part L of the Building Regulations currently uses outdated carbon factors for electricity. 
The results of any calculations based on these outdated carbon factors are misleading 
and the carbon reductions identified at planning stage  are not accurate assessments 
of future carbon emissions/reductions from the chosen heating systems. This could 
lead to the wrong conclusions being drawn when comparing heating systems, resulting 
in the selection of a heating system with a higher carbon co ntent over one with a lower 
carbon content, and preventing the borough from meeting future carbon reduction 
targets.  
 In order to enable better informed decisions to be made when selecting heating 
systems, applicants are required to calculate the carbon con tent of heat using the 
carbon emissions factor for grid electricity from the most recently available DUKES 
which is published each year by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial 
Strategy , in addition to Building Regulation Part L calculations. The use of more 
accurate emissions factors to calculate the carbon content of heat will contribute to the 
decarbonisation of heat and help the borough to meet future carbon reduction targets.  
 In order to minimise fuel poverty linked to energy prices, the c onsequences of energy 
supply decisions at the planning stage must be assessed not only in terms of carbon 
efficiency, but also in terms of the likely energy supply prices. This is particularly 
important in the context of promoting low carbon heating system s because some 
systems, such as direct electric heating, can be low carbon while also leading to high 
energy bills. Part E of this policy seeks to resolve this by requiring all residential 
developments to estimate the anticipated heat unit supply price (£/ kWh), annual 
standing charge and estimated  annual maintenance costs of their proposed heating 
system; and requiring major applications to provide estimates of the life cycle costs of 
the proposed heating system using CIBSE quoted plant lifetimes.  
 Specific design standards to enable connection and future connection to heat 
networks are set out in the Environmental Design SPD. Heat networks and communal 
heating systems  must be designed, constructed and operated to a high standard in 
accordance with CIBSE CP1:  Heat Networks: Code of Practice (or any relevant 
successor document), which sets minimum and best practice standards. The design 
and construction of developments that are required to connect to an existing or 
planned heat network in accordance with this p olicy must also comply with this Code 
of Practice, and this must  be demonstrated as part of the SDCS . Compliance with this 
Code of Practice will promote best practice standards for heat networks across the 
supply chain.  
 All developments required to connect to an existing or planned heat network in 
accordance with this policy are required to ensure that the future heat network 
operator will be registered with the Heat Trust Scheme (or any other equivalent/future 
customer p rotection scheme). The Heat Trust Scheme is operated by a not -for-profit 
company that was established in 2015 and is sponsored by the Association for 
Decentralised Energy. The scheme offers protection for heat network customers and 
ensures that their right s are protected, which links to the Council ’s objective of 
addressing fuel poverty.  
 The Council  will assess whether a development can reasonably connect to an existing 
heat network or can be designed to connect to a planned heat network based on a 
feasibil ity assessment, which must be submitted ( as part of the SDCS ) at the earliest 
possible stage of the planning process, ideally at pre -application stage. The feasibility 
assessment will assess the technical feasibility of a development’s heat demand being 
supplied in part or whol ly through connection to a heat network, and the financial  
207 
 reasonableness of the proposed connection charges. The Council , or relevant Energy 
Service Company, will provide relevant information to inform the feasibility 
assessment, inc luding an assessment of the approximate cost of connection. 
Feasibility assessments must  consider a range of factors, including:  
 the size and use class of the development, and the associated heat load and 
energy demands;  
 the capability of the network to supply part o r all of the heat demand;  
 the location of the development and the distance to network pipes;  
 physical barriers e.g. roads and railways;  
 other developments in the vicinity that may also be required to connect to the 
network; and  
 an assessment o f the financial implications of connection, using a Whole Life 
Costing methodology.  
 Where connection of a development to an existing or future planned heat network is 
required in accordance with parts F and G of this policy, and is deemed to be feasible, 
developers are required to commit to connection prior to occupation via a Section 106 
agreement for major developments, and a Unilateral Undertaking for minor 
developments. The legal agreement will include provision for a reasonable financial 
contribution t o the Council  to enable connection and the submission of an updated 
energy strategy prior to implementation. Major developments located within 500 
metres of a planned future heat network are required to be designed to be able to 
connect to that network in the future, in accordance with Part G of this  policy. Within 
the legal agreement, a cut -off point will be defined which will be the latest point at 
which a decision can be made in relation to connection to a planned network. If at this 
time it is not possi ble to agree connection to a network due to the network being 
incomplete, the alternative energy strategy will be enacted.  
 Each  of Islington’s planned future heat networks is included on Islington’s CIL 
Regulation 123 Infrastructure List (CIL 123 List) as  infrastructure that may be funded 
by CIL. The CIL funding is intended to increase the size of the overall network to bring 
more sites within a reasonable connection distance. The financial contribution towards 
connection of a site to a heat network secure d via a legal agreement is not covered by 
CIL and is a separate cost. The CIL 123 List excludes works that will be funded 
through Section 106 obligations in accordance with the tests set out in Regulation 122 
of the CIL Regulations 2010 (as amended).  
 Wher e connection to an existing or planned heat network is not possible, 
developments with a communal heating system must  fully explore any opportunities to 
support the establishment of new heat networks through developing and/or connecting 
to a Shared Heat Ne twork (SHN) between neighbouring existing buildings or new 
developments using a low or zero carbon heat source. Such shared networks will 
contribute to the development of borough -wide heat networks. Whether development 
of, or connection to , a SHN is reason ably possible will be assessed by the Council , 
based on a feasibility assessment which will consider a number of factors, including:  
 the size and nature of the heat load within the development and neighbouring 
communally heated sites;  
 the distance between the sites;  
 any physical barriers e.g. roads and railways;  
 the practicality of connection, including willingness of existing building owners, 
timing of schemes and any other legal or management issues; and   
208 
  the carbon reduction likely  from such a connection, including the feasibility of use 
of low or zero carbon technologies.  
 Where a SHN is created, the anticipated carbon reductions must  be assessed and 
agreed by the Council .  
 In addition to prioritising low and zero carbon heating opt ions, development proposals 
are required to identify opportunities to maximise renewable energy production on -site 
in accordance with the energy hierarchy set out in Policy S1. The local generation of 
zero carbon electricity and heat though renewable energ y will supplement grid 
decarbonisation at the national and international level  and further contribute to the 
decarbonisation of heat. This includes the use of energy from waste schemes that are 
connected to a heat network, as w ell as PVs , solar thermal pan els and ASHPs . 
Innovative low  and zero  carbon technologies will also be supported.  It should be noted 
that any renewable energy and carbon reductions from the use of ASHPs are partly 
offset by the electricity used to run the ASHP.  
 
A. Development proposals must  minimise internal heat gain and the impacts of the 
‘urban heat island  effect’  through design, layout, orientation and materials.  
 
B. All developments (excluding smaller minor extensions) must demonstrate, as pa rt of 
the SDCS , how the proposed design will reduce the potential for overheating and 
reliance on air conditioning systems, and maximise the incorporation of passive 
design measures in accordance with the following cooling hierarchy:  
1. minimise internal heat generation through energy efficient design  
2. reduce the amount of heat entering a building through orientation, shading, 
albedo, fenestration, insulation and the provision of green roofs and walls  
3. manage the heat within the building through exposed inte rnal thermal mass and 
high ceilings  
4. provide passive ventilation, such as cross ventilation.  
5. provide low energy mechanical ventilation  
C. Use of technologies from lower levels of the hierarchy will not be supported unless 
evidence is provided to demonstrate th at technologies from higher levels of the 
hierarchy cannot deliver sufficient heat control.  
 
D. Major developments are required to include details of internal temperature 
modelling under projected increased future summer temperatures, to demonstrate 
that the  risk of overheating has been addressed as part of the SDCS . 
 
E. Smaller minor extensions  (those smaller than 100sqm)  are encouraged to reduce 
the potential for overheating through the design of the extension, with particular 
reference to levels 1, 2 and 3 on  the cooling hierarchy. The use of active cooling  
209 
 measures will not be accepted,  unless it can be demonstrated that other methods 
higher up the hierarchy cannot be used to deliver sufficient heat control . 
 
 Managing heat is an important concern in Islingto n in the context of an increasing 
population and higher summer temperatures caused by climate change. The ‘urban 
heat island effect ’ means that temperatures will be intensified in dense urban areas 
such as Islington. It is caused by extensive built up area s absorbing and retaining heat 
during the day and night leading to temperatures in some parts of London being 
several degrees warmer than the surrounding area. High temperatures can cause or 
worsen serious health conditions, particularly among children and  the elderly. Ensuring 
buildings are designed and constructed to be comfortable in higher temperatures, 
without resorting to energy intensive air conditioning, is therefore crucial.  
 The cooling hierarchy seeks to manage heat risk in new developments and requires 
developments to incorporate measures which will ensure adaptation to rising summer 
temperatures, while minimising energy intensive cooling. The first step of the hierarchy 
is to minimise internal heat generation through energy efficient design. There are a 
number of low -energy -intensive and passive measures that can mitigate overheating 
risk, including solar shading, building orientation and solar -controlled glazing, as well 
as ensuring energy efficient lighting and appliances which will not only reduce energy 
demand but also reduce heat generation.  
 Soft landscaping and urban greening including green roofs and trees can provide 
some mitigation of the heat island effect through evapotranspiration. 
Evapotranspiration is the process by which water is transferred from the earth to the 
atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and other surfaces, and by transpiration from 
plants, which provides a cooling effect. Green roofs and green w alls can also manage 
heat gain in buildings by shading roof and wall surfaces.  
 Some a spects of energy efficient building design can lead to increases in overheating 
risk, including high proportions of glazing, increases in the building air tightness, and 
reduction of thermal bridges. Such energy efficiency measures mean that there may 
be cases where low energy mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (level 5 in the 
cooling hierarchy) is more energy efficient and better for air quality than natural 
ventila tion, and therefore may be suitable for use within a development. Robust 
justification for use of low energy mechanical ventilation must be provided as part of 
the SDCS , with clear reasons why higher levels of the cooling hierarchy are not 
appropriate.  
 Increased use of active cooling systems, such as air conditioning systems, is generally 
not desirable as these have significant energy requirements and, under conventional 
operation, expel hot air, thereby adding to the ‘urban heat island effect ’. However,  in 
exceptional circumstances, active cooling systems may be suitable, where, overall, it 
would be more energy efficient and better for air quality t han natural ventilation, due to 
potential aspects of energy efficient design noted in paragraph 6. 83 above;  and where 
low energy mechanical ventilation is demonstrably unfeasible. Where active cooling 
systems are provided, they must  be designed to re -use the waste  heat they produce 
and future heat networks are expected to be supplied with heat from waste heat 
sources such as building cooling systems.  
 Where it is demonstrated that mechanical ventilation or active cooling are required, 
these must  be used as part of a mixed mode cooling system to supplement passive 
cooling and other measures higher up the cooling hierarchy. Full -building mechanical  
210 
 ventilation and active cooling systems must  only be considered as a last resort. The 
use of mechanical ventilation or active cooling will only be acceptable where best 
practice energy efficiency standards have been achie ved, or in the case of residential 
developments, where the required FEES has been achieved .  
 Modelling of major developments under predicted future temperatures is required as 
part of the SDCS  to ensure buildings  are fully adapted to the changing climate. 
Requirements for thermal modelling are set out in the Environmental Design SPD. 
Major developments are required to include details of measurable outputs for the 
occupied building in relation overheating risk as part of the GPP, based on the 
commitments in the SDCS .  
 All major developments (including refurbishments) must  demonstrate that overheating 
has been effectively addressed by meeting the standards in the latest CIBSE guidance 
on assessing and mitigating overh eating risk in new developments . CIBSE TM 5 9 
must  be used for domestic developments and CIBSE TM 52 must  be used for non -
domestic developments. CIBSE TM 49 guidance and datasets must  also be used to 
ensure that all new development is designed for the climate it will experience over its 
design life.  The GLA’s Energy Planning Guidance provides further information on how 
these guidance documents and datasets should be used.  In addition, internal 
temperature modelling must  use weather files based on the latest climate change 
projections in order to asse ss the development  against  projected  future summer 
temperatures . Further details are set out in the Environmental Design SPD.  
 
A. All development  proposals  must mitigate  or prevent adverse  impact s on air quality , 
and investigate and implement all reasonable opportunities to improve air quality. 
Development proposals will be refused where they would : 
(i) cause significant harm to air quality, cumulatively or individually;  
(ii) lead to further deterioration of existing poor air q uality, create any new areas 
that exceed air quality limits, or delay the date at which compliance will be 
achieved in areas that are currently in exceedance of legal limits;  
(iii) reduce any air quality benefits that result from active measures/activities which  
seek to improve air quality; or  
(iv) create unacceptable risk of high levels of exposure to poor air quality.  
B. Major developments, minor new build developments, and larger minor extensions 
must be at least Air Quality Neutral through provision of on -site measur es. Such 
developments  are required to submit an Air Quality Assessment (AQA) as part of the 
SDCS ; the level of detail of the AQA must  be proportionate to the scale of proposed 
development , but must include details of how Air Quality Neutral will be achieve d. A 
preliminary AQA must  be carried out before designing the development , to inform the 
design process.   
 
C. Minor de velopments not covered by Part B  are encouraged to be at least Air Quality 
Neutral  through on -site measures , where feasible.  
  
211 
 D. Developments in  excess of 200 net additional residential units or 10,000sqm net 
additional gross external floorspace must be Air Quality Positive  and implement 
measures on -site to actively reduce air pollution as far as possible . 
 
E. Measures to  address air quality  implemented in line with relevant requirements in 
Parts A  to D must  be implemented through on-site design solutions , to prevent or 
minimise increased exposure to existing air pollution and make provision to address 
local air quality  issues . Particular car e must  be taken with developments that are in Air 
Quality Focus Areas  (AQFAs)  or that are likely to be used by large numbers of people 
particularly vulnerable to poor air quality, such as children or older people. Where 
adequate mitigation is not provided,  planning permission may be refused.  
 
F. Where it can be demonstrated that on -site measures are impractical or inappropriate, 
off-site measures to improve local air quality may be acceptable, provided that at least 
equivalent air quality benefits can be demon strated.  
 
 Air pollution  is one of the most significant challenges facing Islington. Air pollutants 
have a significant impact on health, quality of life and life expectancy, and the risk of 
exposure to air pollution is often worse in deprived area s, as these areas are often 
located near to busy roads and have  a lack of green space. Poor air quality contributes 
to numerous diseases and conditions, particularly among more vulnerable people such 
as children, older people and those with existing health c onditions. Air pollution also 
has associated impacts on the economy through medical costs and lost productivity. In 
addition, air pollution impacts the environment through its negative effects on the 
quality of water, soil and ecosystem health, which can b e very damaging for 
biodiversity and wildlife.  
 Islington’s Air Quality Strategy  outlines the proposed actions in Islington to reduce air 
pollution and lower exposure to the main pollutants between 201 9 and 202 3. New 
developments must  be designed, construc ted and operated to limit their contribution to 
air pollution and improve local air quality as far as possible , and reduce the extent to 
which the public are exposed to poor air quality, including vulnerable people . Major 
developments, minor new build deve lopments, and larger minor extensions must be at 
least Air Quality Neutral ; this means that new development  must not contribute to air 
pollution , or, if this is not possible, that any air polluting emissions are mitigated on -
site. This will ensure  that development does not worsen  the air quality  in the area in 
which it is located.  
 An Air Quality Positive  approach  is required for all development  in excess of 200 net 
additional residential units or 10,000sqm net additional gross external floorspace . Air 
Quality Positive means that the development must  actively contribute to removing 
pollution through the use of on -site design measures to benefit the air quality of the 
surrounding area. Further information on the Air Quality Positive approach is set out in 
the London Plan. The Council  may provide further guidance on air quality, including 
potential revised thresholds for Air Quality Neutral and Positive, through a SPD. 
 It may not always be possible in practice for developments to  minimise impacts 
sufficientl y using on -site measures alone. Where a development can provide evidence 
to demonstrate that on -site measures are impractical or inappropriate, for example due 
to a particularly constrained site or the limited scope of the development works, off-site 
measu res to improve local air quality may be acceptable. It must be demonstrated that 
off-site measures will provide at least equivalent air quality benefits to those required  
212 
 on-site. In cases where off -site measures cannot be provided to a sufficient standard , 
a financial off -setting contribution secured through S106 may also be acceptable.  
 The whole of Islington is covered by an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA), where 
national air quality objectives in relation to NO 2, PM10 and PM2.5  are not likely to be 
achieved. In addition, the GLA has identified specific AQFAs to assist boroughs with 
targeting air pollution hotspots as part of action planning. AQFAs are locations of high 
human exposure where national air quality objectives are exceeded and where 
curren tly planned measures to reduce air pollution may not fully resolve poor air quality 
issues. Several AQFA s are located in Islington, as identified in the London Plan (or in 
other published updated documentation).  Developments proposed in areas that no 
longe r exceed air quality limits due to improvements to air quality must  not harm air 
quality and cause the area to return to poor air quality levels.  
 Major developments, minor new build developments, and larger minor extensions are 
required to submit an AQA an d preliminary AQA  as part of the SDCS . The aim of the 
preliminary AQA is to assess:  
 the most significant sources of pollution in the area ; 
 constraints imposed on the site by poor air quality ; 
 appropriate land uses for the site based on the air quality that  potential occupants 
will be exposed to. Uses considered to be particularly sensitive to air quality issues 
include resid ential, education, hospitals and care homes for older people. 
Locations considered likely to have particularly significant air quality issues include 
sites close to roads (particularly those on lower floors on the TfL Road Network 
and Borough Principal Roa d Network) and those affected by certain industrial 
processes ; and  
 appropriate design measures that could be implemented to ensure that  
development reduces ex posure and improves air quality, including building design 
and site layout, and urban greening to provide pollution absorbing benefits, 
particularly tree and hedge planting.  
 As the design evolves further assessments  must  also be carr ied out in order to ensure 
that impacts from emissions are prevented or minimised as far as possible, and to fully 
quantify the expected effect of any proposed mitigation measures, including the 
cumulative effect where other nearby developments are also un derway or likely to 
come forward.  
 When assessing a development’s impact on local air quality , the Council  will consider 
pollution, smells and fumes from construction and operation, including fixed plant, 
such as boiler and emergency generators, and any associated transport. Impact 
assessments  must  always include all relevant pollutants. Industrial, waste and other 
working sites may need to include on -site vehicles and mobile machinery as well as 
fixed machinery and transport sources.  
 The two pollutants causing most concern in London and Islington a re NO 2 and 
Particulate Matter (PM). While traffic emissions are largely responsible for these 
pollutants, predominantly through exhaust emissions, and brake and tyre wear and 
dust, e missions associated with the  construction and operation of developments in  
Islington also have a significant impact on air quality.  
 Despite significant improvements  in air quality , parts of Islington have consistently 
exceeded EU limits for NO 2 for many years, mainly along the A1 Holloway Road from  
213 
 Highbury to Archway; Angel To wn Centre; Seven Sisters Road at Finsbury Park; Old 
Street and surrounding areas in the south of the borough; and the King’s 
Cross/Caledonian Road area. While Islington is not breaching current EU limits for PM 
levels, it is in breach of the World Health O rganisation (WHO) limits, which are lower.  
 Emissions associated with the  operation of developments are mainly caused by  the 
use of natural gas in the form of gas boilers and gas engine  CHP as the main heat 
source for space and water heating, which results  in NO x emissions, with NO 2 in 
particular having a major impact on air pollution. Improvements to air quality can be 
achieved through the adoption of an integrated approach to energy supply which 
maximises both air quality and climate change benefits  and e nsures heating systems 
do not have a significant impact on local air quality. This will be achieved through the 
selection of heat sources that result in low or zero emissions of both carbon dioxide 
and NO x, in accordance with the heating hierarchy set out in Policy S5.  In relation to 
air quality, low or zero emission heating and energy refers to the level of NO x 
emissions produced by a heating or energy system. Low -emission systems are those 
which inherently emit very low levels of NO x.  
 The operation of ne w developments can lead to an increase in transport related 
emissions. Islington’s car -free policy seeks to reduce  these pollutants and  improve  air 
quality  by ensuring  that no new parking spaces or permits will be allowed as part of 
new development. Policy  T3 provides further detail on the operation of the car -free 
policy.  
 Air pollution resulting from the construction process, including Non -Road Mobile 
Machinery, also contribute to poor air quality in the borough. Policy T5 has specific 
requirements relating to construction practices. Other guidance, such as the GLA 
control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition best practice guidance, 
may also be applicable.  
 
A. A site specific Flood Risk Assessment (FR A) will be required for:  
(i) proposals on sites of 1 hectare or greater;  
(ii) new development proposing more than 100sqm increase in floorspace in a 
critical drainage area;  
(iii) proposals involving a change of use in development type to a more vulnerable 
class;  
(iv) ‘Highly Vulnerable’ development located in an area of High or Medium surface 
water flood risk; and /or 
(v) ‘More Vulnerable’ development located in an area of High surface water flood 
risk. 
B. The site -specific FRA must assess in detail the risk of flooding to and from a proposed 
development , from all sources  but focusing particularly on surface water flooding, 
taking climate change projections into account. Where a development is located 
within a Critical Drainage Area (CDA) or Local Flood Risk Zone (LFRZ), or where the  
214 
 site includes a ‘High’ surface water flood risk area , the site -specific FRA must give 
particular consideration to extent and impacts of flood risk .  
 
C. Groundwater flooding must  be investigated in detail as part of the site -specific FRA 
where  development  is located in an area identified as having potential for 
groundwater flooding.  
 
D. As part of the site -specific FRA , development  proposals  must:   
(i) carry out a Sequential Test in order to ensure that the vulnerability 
classification of the proposed development is  appropriate to the  level of  flood 
risk; and  
(ii) demonstrate a sequential approach to development layout within the 
development site , in order to ensure that the most vulnerable elements or land 
uses within a development are located in the lowest risk parts of  the site.  
E. The site -specific FRA must demonstrate how flood risk will be managed and mitigated 
to ensure the development is safe from flooding and the impacts of climate change for 
its lifetime. This must  include assessment of appropriate flood proof desi gn and 
construction methods, and SUDS.  
 
F. ‘Highly Vulnerable’ development, including basement dwellings, proposed in ‘High’ 
surface water flood risk areas, and/or where there is potential for groundwater 
flooding of property situated below ground level or po tential for groundwater flooding 
to occur at surface , are required to incorporate appropriate flood proof construction 
methods in order to mitigate the risk of flooding. Essential infrastructure associated 
with proposed developments in ‘High’ surface water  flood risk areas must  be located 
above ground floor level, where possible.  
 
 As a Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA), Islington Council  has lead responsibility for 
monitoring and managing local flood risk in the borough  through the planning system , 
including surface water  drainage , groundwater and ordinary watercourses , taking into 
account new development in land use plans and strategies36. A key responsibility of 
the Council  as a LLFA is to seek opportunities to reduce the risk of flooding from the 
sewer network through consultation with Thames Water ; and to determine key areas 
for maintenance and flood alleviation schemes.    
 Islington’s flood risk management policies have been informed by the Level 1 Strategic 
Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA), which revi ews all sources of flooding in the borough. 
Islington is located entirely in Flood Zone 1 which means there is a low risk of fluvial 
(river) flooding37; however there is risk of flooding to development from other sources 
in Islington, including from groundw ater, sewers, artificial sources, and surface water.  
 Islington is at particular risk from surface water flooding due to the densely developed 
nature of the borough and a large extent of impermeable surfaces. Surface water flood 
risk in Islington is predic ted to rise as climate change increases the frequency and

borough increases the volume of surface and waste water draining to the combined 
sewer.  
 Islington’s SFRA provides detailed information regarding the areas at risk from surface 
water flooding across the borough based on the Environment Agency’s  ‘Risk of 
Flooding from Surface Water (RoFSW) ’ mapping;  data from Islington’s Surface Water 
Management Plan (SWMP) ; and detailed borough -wide surface water modelling 
undertaken by CVU in 2017.  Figure 6.1 below shows the surface water flood risk in 
Islington based on data from Islington’s SWMP and  the EA’s RoFSW.  
 While t he Environment Agency’s RoFSW data and the detaile d borough -wide surface 
water modelling datasets are the most recent and up -to-date surface water modelling 
that has been undertaken at the time of writing, t he Environment Agency’s Flood 
Warning Information Service38 and interactive flood risk maps must  also be checked 
for any updates to the data and used to inform the site -specific FRA.

 Part A of the policy draws on the NPPF requirements in relation to when a site -specific 
FRA is required for developments located in Flood Zone 1. The NPPF requires a site -
specific FRA to be submitted for development located in an area with critical drainage 
problems, as define d by the Environment Agency. While there are currently no 
Environment Agency defined CDAs in Islington, Part A requires a site -specific FRA to 
be submitted for developments located in a CDA as defined by Islington’s SWMP ; this 
approach is  recommended by Is lington’s SFRA.  
 The SWMP defines a CDA as ”a discrete geographic area (usually a hydrological 
catchment) where multiple and interlinked sources of flood risk (surface water, 
groundwater, sewer, main river and/or tidal) cause flooding in one or more LFRZ  
during severe weather thereby affecting people, property or local infrastructure ”. A 
LFRZ is identified  in the SWMP as “ discrete areas of flooding that do not exceed the 
national criteria for a ‘Flood Risk Area’ but still affect houses, businesses or 
infrastructure. A LFRZ is  defined as  the actual spatial extent of predicted flooding in a 
single location.”  
 Figure 6.1  demonstrates that more than half of the Borough is located within one of 
Islington’s three CDAs . Islington’s SWMP identified eight LFRZ which  are all locat ed 
within one of the three CDAs. A specific development within a CDA is not necessarily 
at higher risk from surface water flooding compared to a development outside of a 
CDA. However, the location of a development within a CDA indicates that it is within a 
catchment area which contributes to flooding in a LFRZ .  
 The flood risk vulnerability classifications  for different development uses referred to in 
Part A of this policy are defined in the national PPG  and repeated in Table 6.4 below. 
Where a new development is classified as ‘More Vulnerable’ or ‘Highly  Vulnerable’, or 
where a change of use will result in an increase in the vulnerability classification, the 
FRA must  demonstrate how the flood risks to the development will be managed so that 
it remains safe through its lifetime, including provision of safe access and egress.

 The identification of ‘High’, ‘Medium ’ and ‘Low’ surface water flood risk  is based on 
data from the Environment Agency’s RoFSW d ataset . This  provides an indication of 
the broad areas likely to be at risk of surface water flooding (i.e. areas where surface 
water would be expected to flow or pond), as opp osed to the susceptibility of individual 
properties t o surface water flooding. The RoFSW  provides bandings of Low (within the 
flood extent during a 1 in 1000 year rainfall event), Medium (within the flood extent 
during a 1 in 100 year rainfall event) and H igh (within the flood extent during a 1 in 30 
year rainfall event) surface water flood risk. The areas at risk of flooding from surface 
water based on the RoFSW data are displayed in Figure 6.1 . The RoFSW modelling 
demonstrates that areas at ‘High’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Low’ risk of surface water flooding 
largely follow human -made features such as roads and rail lines, particularly in high 
risk areas. Surface water flooding is also identified around properties in low risk areas, 
particularly in areas of low topogr aphy around Canonbury and Clerkenwell Road, as 
well as the Upper Holloway area between Tollington Road and the Emirates Stadium, 
and on Holloway Road.   
 The site-specific FRA  must  establish whether a proposed development is likely to be 
affected by current or future flooding from any source and whether it will increase flood 
risk elsewhere. The assessment  must  be proportionate to the degree of flood risk and 
must  also be appropriat e to the scale, nature and location of the development. When 
assessing FRAs, the Council  will consider the potential contribution of a development 
to flood risk off -site and the cumulative impact of new development on flood risk.  
 While there is a low risk  of fluvial (river) flooding in the borough, all site -specific FRAs 
must investigate the risk of surface water flooding in detail, and where relevant, 
groundwater, sewers, and artificial sources must  also be assessed, utilising the 
mapping presented in Isl ington’s SFRA.  The SWMP CDAs  and LFRZ , and the 
Environment Agency’s RoFSW dataset shown in Figure 6.1 must  be used as a starting 
point for the site -specific FRA to indicate areas with a potential for surface water flood 
risk in the Borough.  
 The assessment of surface water flood risk to a development as part of the site-
specific FRA must  take climate change projections into account . In Islington, climate  
220 
 change is likely to predominantly increase flood risk from surface water.  The 
Environment Agency guidance  “Flood risk a ssessments:  climate change a llowances ” 
describes when and how to use climate change allowances in flood risk 
assessments41. The guidance updates previous climate change allowances to support 
the NPPF. Previously a n allowance for a  30% increase  in peak rainfall intensity from 
climate change was applied, however based on the new guidelines a 40% increase is 
applied.   
 The site -specific FRA must  investigate groundwater flooding in detail using mapping 
from Islington’s SFRA. Figure 6.2 identifies areas of the borough that have ‘potential 
for groundwater flooding of property  situated below ground level’ or ‘potential for 
groundwater flooding to occur at surface’, based on data from the British Geological 
Survey  and presented in the SF RA.

 The NPPF requires all plans to apply a sequential, risk -based approach to the location 
of development, taking into account the current and future impacts of climate change 
so as to avoid, where possible, flood risk to people and property. The sequential 
approach must  be used in areas known to be at risk now or in the future from any form 
of flooding. The aim of the sequential test is to steer new development away from 
areas at risk of flooding to areas with the lowest risk of flooding, and to ensure that 
areas at little or no risk of flooding from any source are developed in preference to 
areas at higher risk. As a result, the application of the sequential test will help to 
ensure that development can be delivered safely and sustainably, avoiding proposals 
that are inappropriate on flood risk grounds.  
 The sequential test must  be applied as part of the site -specific FRA using the 
procedure for demonstrating the Sequential Test for Planning Applications set out in 
PPG42. This procedure includes identifying ‘reasonab ly available’ alternative sites.  In 
Islington, the main concern is surface water flood risk and this must be taken into 
account when deciding on the appropriateness of a site location . The Sequential Test 
must  refer to Islington’s SFRA mapping and  EA flooding data to assess the flood risk 
on the site and to compare it to alternative  sites if appropriate.  The Council  will also 
determine  whether the development vulnerability is appropriate to the  level of  flood risk  
on the site.  
 The constrained natur e of the borough and development pressure mean that it is 
unlikely that there will be alter native locations where developments could be located. 
As a result, vulnerable development types will likely be permissible in areas of medium 
or high surface water f lood risk (based on the Environment Agency’s RoFSW 
mapping) on the condition that they ach ieve the drainage requirements set out in 
Policy S9 ; incorporate sufficient flood resilient/res istant measures where required ; and 
apply the sequential approach to de velopment layout. This means that in the majority 
of cases the Exception Test will not be required as it can be demonstrated that any 
potential flood risk will be outweighed by other sustainability factors ; and the fact that 
the development will be safe du ring its lifetime, considering climate change, through 
the use of mitigation and adaptation measures.  
 In addition to the application of the sequential test at the individual development level, 
the sequential test has been applied as part of the Sustainabil ity Appraisal  (SA) of 
sites which have been allocated in the Local Plan . The requirement to apply  the 
Sequential Test to proposed developments can be considered adequately 
demonstrated if the Sequential Test has already been carried out for the same 
develo pment type  on the specific site  as part of the SA;  or the development 
vulnerability is appropriate to the flood risk, as determined by the Council . If either of 
these two criteria has not been met , then it i s necessary to undertake a Sequential 
Test for the site.  
 A sequential approach must  be applied within development sites  in order  to locate the 
most vulnerable elements of a devel opment in the lowest risk areas  of a site;  for 
example , residential developments should be restricted to  areas at a lower probability 
of flooding , whereas parking, open space or proposed landscaped areas can be 
placed on lower ground with a higher probability of flooding.  Decision s regarding the 
layout and design of a site must  consider flood risk  at an earl y stage to provide an 
opportunity to reduce flood risk within the development  site. This is particularly 
important in  large r development proposals  as they will  include a variety of land uses 
and potentially varying vulnerability to flooding.

223 
 
 If developmen t pressure creates a need to develop more vulnerable land uses  in 
higher flood risk areas  on the site , appropriate mitigation measures must  be 
incorporated that are proportionate to the flood risk and would not increase the risk of 
flooding to surrounding areas. In particular, the sequential approach to site layout will 
help to ensure that vulnerable development types located in areas of ‘Medium ’ or 
’High’ surface water flooding will be safe for their lifetime.  Further detail on the 
sequential approach to l ocating development within a site is set out in the PPG . 
 Detailed investigation into the sustainable management and mitigation of flood risk will 
be expected as part of the site -specific FRA . Design teams  are encouraged to engage  
with the Council  at the earliest opportunity  to establish appropriate management and 
mitigation techniques. Developments located in areas identified as being at particular 
risk of surface water flooding ( as denoted by RoFSW High Risk Areas and LFRZs), 
must  provide additio nal detail on mitigation measures, including SUDS.  
 The PPG sets out the ways in which new development can be made flood resistant 
and resilient through designing buildings to avoid flooding in the first instance, for 
example by raising finished floor level s and access levels, and introducing thresholds 
to buildings. Careful consideration must  also be given to the development layout as a 
way to avoid the impacts of flooding, particularly in relation to vulnerable uses. In 
addition to design, the potential im pacts of flooding to property and people can be 
mitigated using a range of flood proof construction measures including use of suitable 
materials and construction techniques for floors, walls, doors and windows and fittings.  
 When a proposal involves the re -development of existing buildings comprising more 
than one property, the use of flood proof construction methods must  focus on 
individual properties to ensure risk is mitigated effectively for all properties involved. 
Appropriate mitigation measures must  be incorporated that are proportionate to the 
flood risk and would not increase the risk of flooding to surrounding areas . Further 
guidance on flood proof design and construction is also provided in the Environmental 
Design SPD.  
 The site -specific FRA must  ensure that surface water generated by the site is 
managed in a sustainable manner and does not increase the flood risk to existing 
buildings or infrastructure in the neighbouring area. This will be particularly important in 
relation to development located in a CDA . Potential overland flow paths must  be 
considered to ensure that buildings do not obstruct flows and all opportunities must  be 
taken during development to reduce existing surface water runoff rates, in accordance 
with Policy S9.  
 The d etailed borough -wide surface water modelling for Islington undertaken in 2017  
and presented in Islington’s SFRA must  be used alongside the Environment Agency’s 
RoFSW data to provide a more detailed assessment of surface water flood risk in the 
borough , to info rm the planning of appropriate mitigation measures for proposed 
developments. The detailed Borough wide surface water modelling shows that surface 
water flooding predominantly follows roads and heavily urbanised areas including 
Hornsey Road, Holloway Road and Courtauld Road. Surface water ponding is present 
in areas of low topography around Wray Crescent, Gillespie Road and to the south of 
Downcross Street.   
 The detailed surface water modelling includes an output with 40% allowance for 
climat e change , in ac cordance with the Environment Agency Guidance on flood risk 
assessments: climate change a llowances . This means that a 40% increase in peak 
rainfall intensity for the 1 in 100 year storm event is applied . The SFRA provide s an 
indication of the implications of climate change on surface water flood risk  in Islington .  
224 
 
 Where basements are proposed , the risk of surface water and/or groundwater flooding 
must  be considered in detail . Appropriate mitigation measures must  be investi gated, 
including raised thresholds and inclusion of storage for surface water in such 
developments.  
 Assessments for developments within flood risk areas must  make reference to local 
flood warning and emergency procedures, and emergency planning strategies  must  be 
put in place in order to direct people to safety during times of flooding.  
 
A. All development proposals must  adopt an integrated approach to water management 
which considers sustainable drainage, water efficiency, water quality and biodiversity 
holistically across a site and in the context of links with wider -than-site level plans. 
Water management must  be consi dered as early as possible in the design process . 
 
B. All development proposals must ensure that surface water run -off is managed as 
close to its source as possible in line with the London Plan drainage hierarchy  
(repeated below) , with priority given to green  features  over grey features:  
1. rainwater use as a resource (for example rainwater harvesting, blue roofs) . 
2. rainwater infiltration to ground at or close to source . 
3. rainwater attenuation in green infrastructure features for gradual release (for 
example green roofs, rain gardens) . 
4. rainwater discharge direct to a watercourse (unless not appropriate) . 
5. controlled rainwater discharge to a surface water sewer or drain . 
6. controlled rainwater discharge to a combined sewer.  
C. Development proposals f or impermeable paving will be re sisted , including on small 
surfaces such as front gardens and driveways , unless they can demonstrate that the 
level of run -off will not exacerbate flood risk in the area, either  direct and cumulative 
risk. 
 
D. Drainage must  be designed and implemented in ways that promote multiple benefits 
including increased water use efficiency, improve d water quality, and enhance d 
biodiversity, urban greening, amenity and recreation.  
 
E. All developments are required to demonstrate that appr opriate SUDS have been 
implemented in accordance with the drainage hierarchy to ensure that surface water 
runoff rates and volumes entering open space are predictable and water at the 
surface is clean and safe. All developments must identify how the initia l run off from a 
site following a rainfall event will be dealt with ; and demonstrate that an appropriate 
maintenance plan will be put place  providing details of how the SUDS will be 
maintained after implementation to ensur e their continued effectiveness . 
  
225 
 F. Major developments creating new floorspace, and major changes of use that will 
result in an intensification of water use , must be designed to achieve the following 
standards:  
(i) Surface water flows from the site must be reduced to a greenfield run -off rate 
(8 litres/second/hectare for Islington), where feasible. Where it is demonstrated 
that achieving a greenfield run -off rate is not feasible due to the site 
conditions, runoff rates must  be minimised to as close to the greenfield rate as 
possible.  
(ii) The volume of run-off that must be stored on -site must  be calculated based on 
the nationally agreed return period value of a 1 in 100 -year storm event plus a 
40% allowance for climate change for the worst storm duration. Where the 
site-specific FRA indicates that an additional volume of run -off must be stored 
above and beyond the amount calculated based on the method above, this 
must be provided on site.  
G. Major developments involving works to an existing building are encouraged to reduce 
run-off rates for the site as a  whole, rather than focusing solely on new buildings.  
 
H. All major developments must submit a Surface Water Drainage Pro -forma to ensure 
surface water drainage proposals meet policy  requirements.  
 
I. All minor new build developments of one unit or more are requ ired to reduce existing 
run-off levels as far as possible. Where this is demonstrated not to be possible, 
existing run -off levels must be maintained as a minimum.  
 
J. SUDS must  be designed and implemented as a central part of the SDCS , using an 
integrated approach which maximises biodiversity and water use efficiency alongside 
other benefits  including, where appropriate and practical,  amenity and recreation. All 
developments must  maximise areas of soft landscaping and other permeable 
surfaces to support this, in accordance with Policy G4 .  
 
K. All developments must demonstrate that they have minimised the use of mains water 
and have been designed to be water efficient , through the SDCS . Water use must be 
minimised as part of all development s by reducing water demand in the first instance 
through the installation of water efficient fittings and appliances, and the use of water 
saving measures. Developments must  use smart metering, and retrofitting of water 
efficiency measures is encouraged wh ere feasible.   
 
L. Where feasible, d evelopments loc ated adjacent to a waterway, such as a canal, must 
utilise the waterway  to supply non -potable water for on -site needs, including 
landscape irrigation.  
 
M. Residential development must minimise water consumption in accordance with the 
Optional Requirement of the Building Regulations, achieving mains water 
consumption of 105 litres or less per head per day (excluding allowance of up to five 
litres for external  water consumption). Non -residential developments, including 
refurbishments, must minimise water consumption by achieving all credits on Water 
consumption (Wat 01)  under the relevant BREEAM scheme, in accordance with the 
requirements of Parts E and G of Po licy S3 . 
 
N. Major developments and /or developments  with high/intense water usage - including 
hotels, hostels, and student housing  - are required to incorporate a rainwater and 
greywater recycling system. Minor developments must  incorporate rainwater 
recyclin g, where feasible and practical.   
226 
  
O. The development of land affected by contamination must not create unacceptable 
risks to human health and the wider environment, including local water resources . 
Assessment and adequate treatment of any contaminated land m ust be carried out 
before a ny development commence s on site .  
 
P. All developments are required to protect water quality and demonstrate that there will 
be no negative impacts on the quality of local water resources as a result of the 
development.  All developments must  assess and mitigate any pote ntial impact on 
groundwater; only appropriate land uses should be located within groundwater Source 
Protection Zones  (SPZs) .  
 
Q. All development proposals located adjacent to the New River or Regent’s Canal a re 
required to protect and improve the benefits provided by the water environment  to 
help to ensure that these waterways can  reach and maintain good ecological status,  
in accordance with the recommendations of the Thames River Basin Management 
Plan (TRBMP) . 
 
 Islington is at risk from surface water flooding due to the densely developed nature of 
the borough and a large extent of impermeable surfaces. All developments must  adopt 
an integrated approach to water management and ensure that surface water is 
mana ged sustainably and effectively. LLFA s are a statutory consultee in relation to the 
use of SUDS in planning applications for major developments. As an LLFA, the 
Council  must ensure that SUDS are incorporated into all major development proposals 
where appro priate, and that they adhere to necessary national and local SUDS 
standards. This includes providing technical advice on surface water drainage on 
major developments where required , and ensuring that appropriate maintenance 
arrangements are put in place . Rainwater must  be managed as close to the top of the 
drainage hierarchy as possible. For many sites, it may be appropriate to use m ore than 
one form of drainage , for example , a proportion of rainwater can be managed by more 
sustainable methods, with residual rainwater managed lower down the hierarchy.  
  Priority must  be given to source control methods which prevent surface water from 
leaving the site . Source control of surface water is critical in an urban environment 
such as Islington with its larger areas of impermeable surfaces, and must  be 
incorporated on all schemes to reduce the rate and volume of surface water run -off. 
Infiltration techniques, su ch as porous surfaces , will only be possible in non -clay 
areas. Green drainage features that are part of the natural environment  must be 
prioritised over grey features which involve hard surfaces, engineered solutions and 
conventional drainage systems.  Impermeable paving will be resisted in order  to limit a 
negative  cumulative effect on surface water flood risk.  
 Where it is demonstrated that volumes cannot be managed at  or close to  source, 
runoff must  be controlled through attenuation for gradual release  to an adjacent 
waterway (where appropriate and subject to the appropriate permissions) ; or to 
surface water sewers or drains . Drainage by gravity must  be prioritised over pumped 
systems. Attenuation above ground is preferable to attenuation below ground or i n a 
basement because pumping is normally required to empty a below ground attenuation 
tank which requires energy use and has risks of mechanical failure. Attenuation above 
ground can also be utilised to maximise additional biodiversity or amenity benefits.   
 The use of rainwater as a resource is particularly beneficial as part of an integrated 
approach to water management  with drainage and water efficiency benefits . A blue  
227 
 roof is an attenuation tank at roof or podium level which can provide rainwater 
attenuation and minimise surface water flood risk. Rainwater is collected within the 
roof structure before being discharged at a defined controlled rate via a restrictive flow 
outlet. Blue roofs are particularly beneficial on constrained sites where there is no 
space to incorporate SUDS measures as part of soft landscaping, or where 
construction is being carried out within flood sensitive and additional runoff storage is 
require d. Blue roofs can be installed as part of the drainage and support layer for a 
green roof.  
 The use of a blue roof will only be acceptable where it can be clearly demonstrated 
that the suitability of options higher up the hierarchy have been investigated f ully and 
incorporated where possible. In cases where a blue roof is an appropriate option, it is 
particularly important that the design implications are considered as early as possible 
in the design process. As the installation of a blue roof has weight lo ad implications , a 
structural engineer must be engaged with from the early stages of the design process.  
 Green roofs are effective drainage  measures as they provide interception storage and 
will typically intercept the first 5mm or more of rainfall depend ing on the depth and type 
of substrate. Green roofs also provide treatment of the pollutants carried in the initial 
run-off from the site following a rainfall event and have additional biodiversity benefits. 
The combination of a blue and green roof allows the attenuated water to be used to 
irrigate the green roof. Further information is provided in Policy G 5. 
 SUDS  must  be implemented as part of all development proposals in accordance with 
the drainage hierarchy, unless it can be demonstrated that this is no t possible. SUDS 
help to manage flood risk by reducing the quantity of water runoff from a development 
entering drains and pooling on hard surfaces, especially at peak periods. As SUDS 
reduce the need for expensive conventional drainage systems, they can a lso provide 
cost savings. In order to be effective, SUDS require an appropriate level of 
maintenance after implementation, which must  be accounted for in the early planning 
and development stages through a maintenance plan.   
 Particular types of SUDS can h elp to improve the quality of water runoff by filtering out 
pollutants and providing physical, chemical or biological treatment of water to remove 
contaminants. Surface water can pick up pollutants as it runs across a site, which in 
turn enters the combine d storm water and sewer system. Where land is contaminated , 
the design of drainage and SUDS techniques must  take this into account, for example 
by avoiding measures that involve infiltrating water into the subsoil.  
 The initial run off from a site followin g a rainfall event is also known as the ‘first flush’ 
(normally the first 5mm or more) and can carry accumulated silt and pollutants. Green 
roofs can effectively treat the pollutants carried in the first flush, and other measures 
such as swales and bio -retention areas can provide additional cleaning of runoff to 
improve water quality.  
 Major developments creating new floorspace, and major changes of use that will result 
in an intensification of water use , are required to achieve a greenfield surface water 
runoff rate where possible. These types of developments will increase the volume of 
internal wastewater draining to drains and sewers , which in combination with  surface 
water  runoff, will contribute to flood risk on and around the site. Major developments 
proposing an increase in impermeable areas will also lead to additional surface water 
runoff that must be reduced.  
 The greenfield runoff rate in Islington, referred to in Part F of this policy, has been set 
by the Environment Agency at 8 li tres/second/hectare  (or equivalent for sites under  
228 
 one hectare). On sites where it can be demonstrated that this is not possible, a higher 
rate of run -off, as set out in the policy, may be agreed  with the Council . The volume of  
run-off that must be stored on-site must  be calculated based on the nationally agreed 
return period value of a 1 in 100 years storm event , plus an allowance of 40% for an 
increase in rainfall intensity f rom climate change  - in accordance with Environment 
Agency guidance 43 - to ensure  the volume of run off from the site can be stored on the 
site in the future. In Islington, climate change is likely to predominantly increase flood 
risk from surface water . 
 The London Sustainable Drainage Proforma is required by all LLFAs to accompany 
Sustainable Drainage strategies submitted with planning applications and forms part of 
planning application validation requirements. In Islington, the proforma will be required 
for major developments as part of the SDCS  and will assist developers and designer s 
in meeting the sustainable drainage requirements included in this policy44. The 
proforma sets a clear standard for the information that must  be provided in a 
Sustainable Drainage strategy for all development in London and is intended to ensure 
that key in formation is provided with the initial planning application . This reduces  the 
need to request additional information throughout the assessment process and 
prevent s delays in approval.  The initiative is supported by the GLA and the London 
Drainage Engineers’ Group  to encourage greater consistency in both the applications 
and the LLFA  information requests. The proforma is available from the GLA website45. 
  Achieving surface water run -off targets under the relevant BREEAM scheme will also 
contribute to  meeting the policy requirements.  
 Minor new build schemes will be expected to show that they have utilised all available 
techniques to avoid increasing run -off and to reduce it as far as possible . This could 
include maximising areas of green  roofs (and blue roofs  where appropriate) , 
particularly on new buildings ; maximising areas of soft landscaping ; ensuring all hard 
surfaces are permeable or drain into permeable features ; and making use of other 
SUDS techniques , such as raingardens,  as appropriate.  
 The design and implementation of SUDS should be demonstrated as part of the 
SDCS . The protection and enhanc ement  of areas of biodiversity value must  be 
considered when determining the suitability of SUDS. This will promote an integrated 
approach that incorpora tes SUDS into the landscape design in order to maximise 
biodiversity and water use efficiency, alongside the amenity and recreation benefits of 
SUDS. Opportunities for the use of SUDS for educational and interactive purposes 
must  also be explored where fea sible. Further details on Landscape Design Strategies 
are set out in Polic ies G4 and S2. Further guidance on SUDS is set out in the 
Environmental Design SPD. The adoption of appropriate SUDS measures must  be 
informed by relevant best practice and standards , particularly the Construction Industry 
Research and Information Association ( CIRIA ) SUDS Manual . 
 The combination of climate change bringing periods of drought, expanding population 
and increased water usage means that water demand in the future will outstrip supply 
unless mains water demand is reduced. All developments are required to minimise the 
use of mains water as part of an integrated approach to water management. The 
Optional Requirement of the Building Regulations included in Part K of this policy

 requires that water use in new dwellings is limited to 110 litres per person per day. As 
this incl udes 5 litres for external water use, the target for internal use is 105 litres per 
person per day. The requirement for non -residential developments to minimise water 
consumption in accordance with BREEAM is set out in Policy S3. In order to achieve 
BREEAM  requirements  in relation to water consumption, water use demand must be 
reduced first, with rain and greywater recycling being necessary to achieve a higher 
number of credits.  
 Examples of water efficient fittings and appliances include lower flow taps red uced -
capacity baths, and water -efficient showerheads, all of which can help reduce energy 
consumption as well as water consumption. Further details on water efficient fittings 
and appliances is provided in the Environmental Design SPD. The use of measures 
such as water efficient fittings, smart metering, and water saving and recycling 
measures will help to achieve lower water consumption rates and ensure that buildings 
are designed for future water requirements and pressures.  Rainwater and greywater 
recycli ng systems capture rainwater or greywater and then treat the water for re -use 
on-site. They are particularly appropriate for use in major developments  and/or 
developments with high or intense water use , because these developments have high 
water demand, wh ich makes the use of such systems feasible. The suitability and 
feasibility  of different systems will depend on an assessment of water demand, 
potential harvested supply (including consideration of available roof space) , and any 
other cost/benefit issues . 
 Land cannot always be assu med to be free from pollution as n o accurate historic 
records exist for waste disposal or for industrial processes. Developers of land which 
may be polluted  (based on the historic use or other relevant information such as  the 
Islington Contaminated Land Inspection Strategy  2010 or any future update)  will be 
required to undertake remedial work to the satisfaction of the Council . Full details of 
the proposed decontamination will be required as part of any planning application 
before it is considered.  
 Contaminated land raises risks for pollution of groundwater and must  therefore be 
remediated in line with recommended standards46. All developments must  assess and 
mitigate any potential impact on groundwater  throughout planning, construction, 
operation, and decommissioning phases of a development or operation. The area of 
influence of activities must  also be assessed, taking account of all current and future 
groundwater uses and dependent ecosystems.  The aim is to avoid potentially polluting 
activities being located in the most sensitive locations for groundwater. A sensitive 
location with respect to groundwater will depend on the haz ard posed by the 
development and importance of the groundwater location.   
 SPZs  are areas of influence around groundwater sources used for public drinking and 
are defined around large and public potable groundwater abstraction sites. The 
purpose of SPZs is to provide additional protection to safeguard drinking water quality 
through constraining the proximity of an activity that may impact upon a drinking water 
abstraction. Potentially polluting developments include petrol stations, and industrial or 
commerci al developments that rely on the use of chemicals, such as dry clean ers and 
car repair workshops.  
 There are three groundwater SPZs  within Islington. One SPZ covers much of the 
southern half of the borough and is classed as a Zone II - Outer Protection Zone 
(defined as 400 day travel time to the source). There are two smaller SPZs within this

to the source). Further information (including an interactive map of SPZs ) is published 
by the Environment Agency47. In addition, there are groundwater sources within the 
London Boroughs of Hackney and Haringey whose SPZs  fall partly within Islington.  
 Further guidance on the protection of groundwater and locating appropriate land uses 
in SPZs can be found in the Environment Agency’s Groundwater Protection Guides48. 
A. All developments must adopt a circular economy approach  to building design and 
construction in order to keep products and materials  in use for as long as possible 
and to minimise construction waste.    
 
B. Buildings must  be made from components and materials that can be re -used or 
recycled . Building design must enable deconstruction to ensure the maximum value of 
building components can be recovered and re -used at the end of the building’s life. 
Where demolition and remed iation works are necessary, materials must  be re -used 
and/or recycled.  
 
C. A minimum 10% of the total value of materials used in the construction of both major 
and minor developments must  derive from recycled and re -used content in the 
products and materials  selected.  
 
D. All developments must be designed to be flexible and adaptable  to changing 
requirements and circumstances over their lifetime; including changes to the physical 
environment, market demands and land use.  
 
E. All major  developments (including refur bishment and redevelopment of existing 
buildings), minor new build developments, and larger minor extensions  are required to 
provide an Adaptive Design Strategy as part of the SDCS . This must  demonstrate 
how a circular economy approach has been adopted as part of the building design 
and construction , and how the building will adapt to change over its lifetime . The 
Strategy must include evidence to demonstrate that the development will be designed 
and constructed to:  
(i) last as long as possible and suit its ant icipated lifespan – the strategy must 
specify the intended overall design life of all buildings in the development;  
(ii) avoid construction waste and the unnecessary demolition of structures;  
(iii) be built in layers to allow elements of buildings to be replaced overtime, 
supporting a modular design;  
(iv) be adaptable – the plan form, layout and structure enables the building to be 
adapted to respond to change and/or adapted for various uses throughout its 
life; 
(v) enable ease of deconstruction - building materials, components and products 
can be disassembled and re -used at the end of their useful life; and

 (vi) maximise the re -use and/or recycling of all materials arising from demolition 
and remediation works.   
F. All development must minimise the environmental impact of mat erials through the use 
of sustainably -sourced, low impact and recycled materials, using local supplies where 
feasible.  
 
G. All developments are required to take all possible measures to minimise the impact of 
construction on the environment and  comply with Is lington's Co de of Practice for 
Construction Sites . 
 
H. A circular economy is one where materials are retained in use at their highest value for 
as long as possible and are then re -used or recycled, leaving a minimum of residual 
waste. A circular economy approach will save resources,  improve resource efficiency 
and help to reduce carbon emissions. The adoption  of circular economy principles will 
also help to reduce waste production as part of the aim for developments to produce  
net zero -waste.  The s uccessful i mplementation of  a circular economy  approach 
requires the establishment of strategy and policies beyond the local level, from the 
Mayor of London and Central Government. The North London Waste Plan sets out 
further details in relation to London’s approach to waste. Designing and constructing 
buildings that can be adapted and deconstructed, and which are made from materials 
and components that can be re -used or recycled, will contribute to making a more 
regenerative and sustainable built environment.  
  Buildi ng design must  be viewed holistically, with a building being considered as the 
sum of its component parts, and in the context of  the building design life and the likely 
future needs of users . A central consideration when designing and constructing a new 
building, or when extending the life of an existing building, must  be how the building 
can be kept in use for as long as possible to ensure resource efficiency . There are 
various factors which  can contribute to a building becoming obsolete, including build 
quality, physical deterioration, technology changes, market forces, and regulation.  
Building design must  consider how the building can respond to change within its life 
and be adapted to suit  a variety of uses , users,  and configurations , to prevent (or delay 
as far as possible) the onset of obsolescence . Design f eatures  that enable adaptation  
must  be incorporated within the building.  
 In order to support a circular economy approach, all developments must be  designed 
to be adaptable and able to respond to change. The extent to which a building must be 
adaptable to changes in land use and market demands will vary depending on the land 
use type. Residential developments are unlikely to requi re a change of use in the 
future and are designed for a longer life span . In contrast, non -residential 
developments are likely to have a shorter life -span, and therefore it is especially  
important that non -residential developments are designed to be adapta ble and flexible. 
In addition, different types of non -residential development will have varying 
requirements in terms of adaptability and this will also vary depending on the 
operations and operators within a development. For example, office developments  
must be designed to be particularly adaptable because the tenant/operator is likely to 
change more often. All development types must  be designed to be adapted  to 
changes in the physical environment. In particular, building form, layout and structure 
must  be designed to address  overheating and flood risk, particularly in the context of 
climate change, where feasible and practical. The design of adaptable building forms, 
and adaptations to the form of existing buildings, must maximise fabric energy 
efficiency in accordance with Policy S4 .  
232 
 
 The densely developed nature of boroughs such as Islington, with few vacant or empty 
sites, means that any  new construction is usually preceded by the demolition of 
existing building infrastructure. However, mechanical demolit ion fails to respect the 
values of building components as reusable materials and therefore it is vital that 
consideration is given to deconstruction as a method of taking down a building in order 
to ensure the maximum value of building components and enabl e materials to be 
recovered at the end of the building’s life.  Design for deconstruction may take longer 
than demolition and require more labour, however the materials recovered through the 
deconstruction process have a high and instant value that can be r ealised . Demolition 
also has energy impacts in terms of embodied energy of different materials and also 
the energy used to demolish a building ; air quality is also negatively affected by 
demolition . Achieving BREEAM credits in relation to materials will as sist non -
residential developments in reducing the environmental impact of the materials used 
and promote efficiency in the consumption of construction products. BREEAM 
requirements are set out in Policy S3 . 
 The SDCS  must  outline  how the building design  has been developed to be adaptable, 
and it must  detail the commitments that will take the design through to construction. 
Applications should  include details of adaptive design  proportionate to the scale of the 
development.  Applicants must  consider the use  of building life cycle assessments  
using Building Information Modelling  (BIM)  to ensure resource efficiency (from 
production and procurement to construction and disposal) , alongside practical and 
aesthetic value , as a means of demonstrating consideration of all elements of 
sustainable design.  
 The sustainable procurement of materials, including the use of recycled, low impact 
and sustainably -sourced materials can be achieved by maximising materials ratings on 
the BRE Green Guide. Targeting relevant BREEAM c redits in relation to materials will 
assist non -residential development to achieve these requirements.  
 All developments must  comply with Islington's Code of Practice for Construction Site s 
in order to minimise t he possible negative effects of construction,  such as air pollution, 
noise and vibratio n, traffic congestion, dust and contamination of land and water and 
disturbance of local ecology.  Policy T5 provides further information.  
  
233 
 7 Public Realm and Transport  
   
 Increases in Islington’s resident and working population suggests that demand for 
transport  - both with in and throu gh Islington - will continue to be a significant issue for 
the Local Plan to address in terms of the location of development and its integration 
with cycling, walking and public transport infrastructure. Consideration  of transport and 
land use  together, at  the earliest possible stage of a development proposal,  could 
contribute to a reduction in  travel distances  and thus a reduction in  traffic congestion 
and pollution.  The cumulative effect of new development may not on its own make a 
significant difference to overall levels of movement over the plan period, but when 
combined with movements associated with existing development there could be a 
significant impact, which must be assessed fully. Improving integration of transport and 
land use also encourages efficient use of space which is more conducive to modes of  
transport such as walking , cycling  and public transport .  
 To allow for proper consideration of  the transport impacts of a development proposal, 
applicants must submit  either a Transport Assessment and Full Travel Plan, or a 
Transport Statement and Local Level Travel Plan, in line with the thresholds set out in A. A coherent and inclusive  public realm, in conjunction with effective transport, are key 
element s of ensuring delivery of the Local Plan objectives. All development proposals 
must  take into account  the link between land use, transport accessibility and 
connectivity , and promot ing journeys by physically active means, like walking or 
cycling  (known as active travel) . Applicants must provide appropriate information to 
allow proper assessment of transport impacts and show how  these impacts can be 
addressed, as set out in Appendix 3 .  
B. The design of developments, including building design and internal layout, site layout, 
public realm and the provision of transport infrastructure, must  prioritise practical, safe 
and convenient a ccess and use by sustainable transport modes, namely w alking , 
cycling  and p ublic transport . Private vehicle use will be restricted in Islington as far as 
possible, as it is not sustainable and is a key cause of emissions and congestion.  
C. Freight, logistics and delivery vehicles may be acceptable forms of vehicular transport 
to enable the functioning of development where appropriate , according to the 
principles and requirements set out in this policy.  
D. All new development will be car -free, which will contribute to the strategic  aim for a 
modal shift to sustainable transport modes. Private motor vehicles, including electric 
vehicles, motorcycles and  taxis, will not be accommodated as part of new 
development in the borough and are not a priori ty form of transport .  
 
E. Transport developments are encouraged to adopt a design -led approach to recognise 
the role of streets as places .  
234 
 Appendix 3. Travel plans must reflect the Council ’s priority sustainable transport 
modes  and support  active travel. The submitted information is required to be 
sufficiently detailed and accurate to enable the Council  to fully assess the 
development proposal. This may include traffic modelling to demonstrate that 
development proposals will not have an impact (individually or cumulatively) on the 
flow of traffic. A road safety audit/assessment may also be necessary on specific 
schemes. The Travel Plan /Local Level Travel Plan must  inform other documentation 
subm itted as part of a planning application, including Design and Access Statements, 
as part of a holistic approach to ensure that inclusive or specific transport options are 
available to meet the needs of all users, including disabled people.  
 Islington is ext remely well connected in terms of  public transport.  Many areas of 
Islington have a PTAL rating of 6a or 6b (the highest  possible rating) meaning that the 
vast majority of the borough has superb  public transport connectivity and frequency o f 
service . However, PTAL ratings  do not take account of the accessibility of public 
transport options, which means that the needs of certain transport users, particularly 
those with mobility, sensory or cognitive impairments, may not be factored in. It is 
vitally imp ortant that specific measures are put in place to enable that these users 
have easy access to the transport network.  
 All proposals  must promote the development of active and inclusive environments that 
provide safe opportunities for everyone, specifically the most vulnerable users,  to be 
physically active through sustainable modes of travel . The needs of people walking to, 
around and from developments are the most important influence on scheme and 
public realm design, as every user of a building or the publ ic realm use footways as 
the first and last part of their trip, regardless of whether another mode has been used 
for the larger part. Cycling has significant public health benefits , both strategic – for 
example,  by not exacerbating already poor air quality  – and individual – for example, 
by promoting healthy physical activity. Increased cycling  can also ease the strain on 
the rest of the transport network  through reduced road and rail congestion ; this 
includes increased provision of cycle hire  infrastructur e (in addition to, not in lieu of , 
cycle parking) . By taking a strategic approach to promoting cycling, Islington aim to 
improve circumstan ces for existing cyclists and incentivise new cyclists. Bus services 
also provide important accessible transport. In all cases, this necessitates provision of 
safe, convenient infrastructure.  
 Well-functioning public transport is essential to the sustainable development of the 
borough. The growing population, and projected economic growth across Islington and 
London puts great pressures on public transport infrastructure, some of which is 
already extremely congested.  
 The strategic objective of the car free policy is that Islington will be able to maintain a 
pro-active approach to development in order to meet housing need and facilitate jobs 
growth without an unacceptable worsening of air pollution, road congestion, noise and 
road safety. The policy aims to decouple development from traffic generation, 
changing the mode of spatial development from car -based to walking, cycl ing and 
public transport oriented development. Parking within the curtilage of residential 
properties has negative impacts on biodiversity, flood risk, visual amenity, healthy 
lifestyles, air quality, traffic congestion and highways safety. Such applicatio ns will 
normally be refused; however, the needs of disabled people will be taken into account 
and exceptions may be made where appropriate.  
 The rise of app -based, on -demand mobility  has been rapid, and dramatic. However, 
on-demand mobility apps are not  considered to be  a substitute for public transport, as 
they can never move the same volume of passengers around a city nearly as  
235 
 efficiently or effectively. Furthermore, quality and continuity of service, universal 
availability and equality of access cann ot be guaranteed by privately -provided, 
unregulated services. The contribution of car -based on -demand mobility apps also 
increases  the number of motor vehicles on London’s roa ds. 
 While it is important to provide movement along a street, considering other f unctions is 
essential to create a sense of place and achieve a fulfilling environment which people 
enjoy to inhabit, walk, meet and cycle. A design -led approach is key to achieving new 
standards of excellence and recognising the fundamental and various rol es of streets. 
It can also help in reducing the dominance of the vehicle and ensure slower vehicle 
speed and safer driver behaviours. Changing the road width, junction design and 
appropriate use of surface material are some examples of these design tools. A 
design -led approach can also help in meeting the ten indicators of the  Mayor of 
London’s  Healthy Street s approach which aims to improve health and encourage 
active travel modes.  
 The Council  will work with different stakeholders including TfL, London Und erground, 
bus operators, developers  and Crossrail 2, to deliver mutually beneficial schemes. 
With regard to TfL, the Council  will work in partnership to deliver the aspirations on 
healthy streets/liveable neighbourhoods set out in the Mayor’s Transport Str ategy . The 
Council  will also work closely with TfL to deliver borough -level improvements to public 
transport, the public realm and cycling infrastructure.  
 Crossrail 2 is a new proposed railway linking the national rail network in Surrey and 
Hertfordshire v ia an underground tunnel through London and Islington, with a station 
being planned in Angel. It is not yet funded but could be operational in the early 2030s , 
pending funding and  relevant  permissions. The Safeguarding Direction requires the 
London Borough  of Islington  to consult TfL on planning applications it receives that fall 
within the boundaries shown on the safeguarding plans within the borough before 
granting planning permission. The Site Allocations DPD  identifies sites that are 
safeguarded for the  purpose of Crossrail 2.  
 
A. Development proposals must demonstrate that negative impacts on the safe and 
efficient operation of sustainable transport infrastructure  – e.g. the public realm, cycle 
lanes, bus routes/stops - are mitigated/prevented . 
B. All pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and facilities are required to be designed in 
accordance with relevant guidance and/or  best practice standard s. 
C. The use of  shared s pace to jointly meet the needs of motorised traffic, walking and 
cycling will be resisted  where it involves a single surface. Shared spaces may  be 
acceptable where  it has been demonstrated that they deliver logical, legible, inclusive  
and safe environments  that respond to their context .  
Walking  
D. All new developments in the borough must be designed to incentivise walking by:   
236 
 (i) delivering high quality public realm improvements that are secure, safe, 
legible, inclusive and create permeable environments;  
(ii) resisting proposals that have a negative effect on public realm;  
(iii) ensuring that pedestrian crossings are convenient and avoiding (where 
appropriate ) complex  and/or long pedestrian crossing  and unnecessary 
pedestrian guardrails ; and 
(iv) ensuring safe,  convenient and continuous routes for pedestrians that follow 
desire lines and form networks . 
Cycling  
E. All new developments in the borough must be designed to incentivise cycling by:  
(i) ensuring safe, convenient and continuous routes for cyclists that follow 
desire lines and form networks ; 
(ii) demonstrating that there are no road safety conflicts between pedestrians, 
cyclists and vehicles entering, parking and/or servicing the development. 
Cyclist entrances to buildings, cycle stores and parking must be safe and 
convenient for  all and cycle lanes must  be demarcated from other pedestrian 
and road traffic ; 
(iii) providing cycle parking  and associated circulation space for ease of use of 
cycle parking, in accordance with Appendix 4; and 
(iv) providing inclusive and accessible end -of-trip facilities for cyclists, at a level 
proportionate to the size of the development and the required level of cycle 
parking.  
Public Transport  
F. The Council  will work in partnership with TfL, the bus  and rail  operators,  developers 
and other relevant agencies /stakeholders  in order to:  
(i) implement measures to give buses priority over other private motor vehicles 
(including continuous bus priority measures along whole route corridors);  
(ii) create and enhance the public realm around bus and rail stations to improve 
pedestrian /public transport user  and cycling experience;  
(iii) ensure network infrastructure and service improvements increase access 
(including step free access), capacity and public transport interchange 
improvements to local bus, rail and tube stations;  
(iv) devel op the network of services to meet the travel needs of local residents 
and businesses; and  
(v) ensure that bus stops and bus stopping areas are well located and 
designed, accessible and comfortable for all .  
Minimising the impact of non -sustainable transport m odes  
G. Developments which involve the ongoing use of private vehicles are likely to cause 
adverse impacts on the sustainable transport network and undermine the car -free 
policy aims to reduce congestion and vehicle emissions. Planning applications for 
developments involving the ongoing use of a private vehicle(s) – regardless of 
whether parking is provided in line with policy T3 - will only be approved where:   
237 
 (i) clear and compelling evidence is provided to demonstrate that use of a 
vehicle(s) is essential for the use to function effectively (e.g. Use Class B8 
storage and distribution uses);  
(ii) the applicant can demonstrate that the transport impacts of the development 
have been satisfactorily mitigated, including consideration of potential for 
obstruction of t he public realm and sustainable transport infrastructure;  
(iii) it can be demonstrated that the use of private vehicles has been minimised ; 
and  
(iv) opportunities for using more sustainable alternative modes of transport are 
maximised as part of the design of a pro posal . 
 
 The Local Plan promotes sustainable transport choices in order to mitigate the impact 
of developments on the environment , improve air quality,  reduce health impacts, 
respond to congestion affecting ro ads and public transport, and promote healthier  
lifestyles. W alking is a  priority mode of transport ; development proposals must  be 
designed from the outset to facilitate walking to and from the development , in line with 
the Council ’s Inclusive Landscape  Design  and Streetbook SPD s. 
  Shared space (single space) is a design approach which aims to declutter the  public 
realm  through the removal of  features such as kerbs, road surface markings, 
designated crossing place s and traffic signs . While they can lead to sustainable 
transport benefits, through the reduction of vehicle trips and increases in pedestrian 
and cycle usage, they can involve the use of single surfaces, which  have inherent 
safety issues . Single surfaces are particularly detrimental  to vulnerable pedestrians 
such as visually , hearing and  cognitively  impaired people , who can find shared space  
schemes  dangerous and difficult to navigate.  Therefore, the use of single surface 
shared space , which involve s the removal of kerbs , will be resisted . Shared space 
must deliver logical, legible, inclu sive and safe environments, informed by a contextual 
appraisal. Kerbs must  be a minimum height of 60mm.  
 Pedestrian crossings must  be designed to be convenient, accessible and inclusive for 
people to use , and must  have regard to desire lines . Stag gered, lon g and complex 
crossing are considered unsuitable . This also includes avoiding the use of guard 
railing wherever appropriate. Road junctions  must  be designed to cater for the ease of 
crossing  by all users .  
 As a borough on the edge of central London with a relatively flat topography, there is 
scope to improve cycle ridership levels  in Islington. This could include r oad safety 
improvements such as vehicle/cycle segregation and the promotion of quiet and 
cleaner routes for walking and cycling. The Council  will ensure that new development 
contributes effectively to enabling the borough’s cycling potential to be met, in a way 
that meets the needs of all residents and visitors. The Streetbook SPD provides further 
guidance.  
 The Council  supports cycling infrastruct ure improvements that adhere to guiding 
principles and achieve the good design outcomes set out in the London Cycling 
Design Standards.  TfL’s Strategic Cycling Analysis 2017 identified Kentish Town to 
Wood Green via Archway going up Junction Road, and Camd en Town to Tottenham 
Hale via Nag’s Head on Seven Sisters Road as two of their top priority cycling 
connection routes with the greatest potential to serve people who currently cycle, and 
to enable more people to cycle in the borough. In January 2018 , the M ayor of London 
announced the development of the Camden to Tottenham Hale  cycle route . Islington  
238 
 will continue to collaborate with TfL to design and deliver this new route , and to  
progress the Kentish Town to Wood Green  route. N ew developments must  not 
preclude the delivery of cycle infrastructure improvements, particularly along corridors 
identified as part of TfL’s Strategic Cycle Network or which have the potential to feed 
this network.  
 All transport schemes and infrastructure must  provide holistic benefi ts and provide 
safe, accessible and step -free transport solutions for all sustainable modes , including 
interchange between these modes . They must  incentivise use by a range of users and 
remove barriers  to use  as far as possible . 
 The lack of secure and acce ssible cycle parking is commonly recognised as one of the 
main barriers to cycling. Cycle parking – including accessible cycle parking spaces for 
mobility bicycles and tricycles, for cyclists with disabilities, as well bicycles for parents 
with children - must  be provided as part of development proposals, including , but not 
limited to, uses within the A1 (shops), A2 (financial and professional services), A3 
(restaurants and cafés), B1 (offices), D1 (non -residential institutions) and D2 
(assembly and leisure ) Use Classes. Cycle p arking provision  (including accessible 
parking and visitor parking)  must be provided in line with Appendix 4 .  
 Accessible c ycle parking must meet the needs of ambulant disabled cyclists as well as 
people using non -standard cycles,  such as tricycles and cargo bikes. Cycle parking 
suitable for families must  also be provided for family sized homes. This may include 
parking that can accommodate trailers/cargo bikes for children.  Any area provided  for 
cycle parking must be in addition to  minimum residential space standards (including 
storage and amenity space) and minimum design requirements for employment 
floorspace.  
 End-of-trip facilities are essential in order to promote cycling as a legitimate mode of 
transport, especially for travel to workplaces.  Facilities must be  accessible, with 
provision of showers, lockers and clothes drying facilities sufficient to meet the peak 
needs of the development, based on the occupancy of the development and the 
amount of cycle parking proposed . 
 Dockles s bike schemes have potential benefits in terms of increasing cycle patronage, 
but they often lead to significant street clutter and obstruction of pedestrian routes. 
Without greater oversight and control of dockless bike storage, such schemes will not 
be supported.  
 
A. All new development will be car free.  
Residential Parking (including C3 and non -C3 residential use)  
B. Vehicle parking or waiting will not be permitted  for new homes, except for essential 
drop-off and accessible parking. This includes a pplications for vehicle parking within  
a site, the planning unit and/or within the curtilage of existing residential properties , 
including  any undercroft or basement parki ng. Unless exceptional circumstances  
239 
 can be demonstrated, no parking permits will be issued to occupiers of these new 
homes.  
Non-Residential Parking  
C. Parking will only be allowed for non -residential developments where this is essential 
for operational requi rements and therefore integral to the nature of the business or 
service (e.g. Use Class B8 storage and distribution uses). In such cases, parking 
will only be permitted where an essential need has been demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Council  and wh ere the provision of parking would not conflict with 
other Council  policies. Normal staff parking will not be considered essential and will 
not be pe rmitted.   
D. Essential drop -off or essential operational parking  considered acceptable in line with 
Parts B or C must : 
(i) be off-street and located to be accessible and convenient in relation to the 
development;  
(ii) not impede pedestrian and cycle movements;  
(iii) provide an accessible route from the parking space to the development; and  
(iv) provide electric vehicle charging poi nts. 
 
E. Where on -street drop -off or other essential parking is proposed , details must be 
submitted to demonstrate the need for on -street provision and to show that 
arrangements will be safe and will not cause a traffic obstruction or nuisance.  
Electric vehic le charging points must  be provided  where parking is justified; 
charging  points must be located within the parking space or carriageway  and must  
not obstruct pavements or cause other adverse public realm impacts.  
F. Planning applications for uses that require  coach parking ancillary to another use 
will not be permitted where the coach parking would give rise to adverse impacts on 
road safety and congestion. Coach parking must  be provided on -site, unless the 
applicant can identify an alternative location which satisfies the Council  in terms of 
road safety and congestion and other relevant planning matters.  Such locations 
must  not be  directly outside the main entrance of developments and must  not be at 
the expense of space provided to facilitate  other sustainable  modes of transport 
including buses.  
Accessible parking  
G. Accessible  parking spaces  must be provided based on 10% of the total residential 
units/bedspaces proposed (for residential proposals); or one accessible parking 
space  per 33 employees (for employment  development) . For other use s, the 
number of accessible space s must  be proportionate to the number of building users. 
Spaces will only be made available for Blue Badge holders  who live or work in the 
development linked to the parking space . The Council  will require accessible 
parking spaces  to be located on -street  and identified on plan. T he cost of provision  
of parking spaces  will be secured by a Section 106 legal agreement to enable the 
Council  to install the accessible parking spaces  as and when dema nd materialises  
from Blue Badge occupiers/employees. Spaces will generally not be required to be 
physically provided where this demand has not materialised .  
240 
  
 Motorised road transport generates congestion, pollution, noise and can compromise 
road safety for users of sustainable mode of transport. In Islington, these issues are 
further intensified due to the high population density and its central location in Lon don. 
The only effective way of preventing adverse impacts associated with motorised road 
transport is to remove cars from the road while increasing the volume and 
attractiveness of other sustainable modes. The projected advancement of electric 
and/or auton omous vehicles is not a solution to these issues, as they still take up 
physical space on the road and therefore can lead to a number of  the same adverse 
impacts as physically operated vehicles.  
 Islington’s car-free development policy applies  borough -wide and aims to reduce the 
dominance of cars in the borough while also achieving a reduction in vehicle 
pollutants, particularly NO 2PM10 and PM2.5. Car -free development means that no 
parking provision will be allowed on -site and occupiers will not have the ab ility to 
obtain parking permits, except for required accessible parking. The car free policy will 
apply to any residential development within C3 or non -C3 Use Classes (and land 
within the curtilage of such development). For avoidance of doubt, it applies t o any 
residential use created through new build, change of use, conversion and/or 
subdivision of existing residential properties . Where appropriate, parking provision for 
essential drop -off and operational parking (for non -residential uses)  may be permitte d. 
Other motor vehicles such as vans, lorries and motorcycles are covered by the term 
'car free'.  
 Some residents moving into car -free homes might face exceptional circumstances, in 
particular , existing residents in social rented housing who have  a parking permit, who 
move to different accommodation or return to a site after the development has been Car Clubs  
H. The Council  will support the provision of car clubs, including the provision of 
accessibl e car club parking space s and/or contributions towards the provision of car 
clubs in the vicinity of the development, where appropriate . Car club vehicles must  
be ‘clean’, i.e. it must  be powered by alternative fuels to minimise harmful impacts 
on the environment.  
Car Parks  
I. Proposals for, or including, new public car parks (and other motor vehicle public 
parking, including for coaches) will be refused. Redevelopment of existing car parks 
is strongly encouraged. Proposals for the redevelopment of existing car parks  
(public or private)  for a different use will  be subject to the car -free restriction within 
this policy . The artificial separation of sites to remove existing on -site parking areas  
(public or private)  from the boundary of an application for the purposes of retaining 
car parking spaces will not be considered acceptable. All parking related to the 
existing use and/or building which is the subject o f the application must  be included 
as part of the application site.  
Electric vehicles  
J. Electric vehicles are not exempt from the car -free policy. However, t he Council  will 
require the provision of on -street charging points for vehicles where any parking is 
provided.   
241 
 completed (such as with estate redevelopment). In such circumstances, occupiers  may 
be allowed the right to keep a parking permit.  
 Accessible transport initiati ves may include the provision of  accessible parking, and a 
range of inclusive alternatives. Accessible parking must be provided on -street . For 
residential development, on -street accessible parking spaces must be provided based 
on 10% of the total residential units/bedspaces proposed . For employment uses, one 
on-street parking space  must be provided for every 33 employees. For other use s, the 
number of accessible bays must  be proportionate to the number of building users.  
 Only Blue Badge occupiers/employees will be eligible to use accessible parking 
spaces. Spaces will  only be activated when demand materialises, either when a 
dwelling is occupied by a Blue Badge holder  or a Blue Badge holder  is employed. 
Provision must be in accordance with best practice standards, as set out in the 
Council 's Planning Obligations  (Section 106)  and Inclusive Design SPD s, and 
BS8300:2009.  
 The Council  will support and encourage temporary use of existing under -utilised 
parking space s for other uses, such as parklets or cycle storage.  Alternative uses must  
be easily de mountable . 
 In conjunction with the Council ’s Highways team, t he developer must  identify  suitable 
locations for accessible bays  (which  must  be within 75m of the entrance(s) of the 
proposed development ) and pay for the conversion of suitable bays. The amount 
payable will be determined based on a standard cost of conversion. Where it is not 
possible to deliver designated spaces on street, for example due  to insufficient space  
or issues with amending Traffic Management Orders , a financial contribution should  be 
made towards investment in other accessible or sustainable transport initiatives  where 
appropriate, for example contributions to fund a Taxicard scheme for transport users 
with mobility and/or sight impairments . Further information is set out in the Planning 
Obligations (Section 106) SPD.  
 Car clubs provide an alternative to car owners hip that helps to reduce traffic and 
parking congestion, reduce air pollution and climate change impacts from transport, 
allows more equitable and efficient use of public space and increase s travel options for 
all social groups, particularly helpful for fa milies. Car clubs support the Council 's car 
free policy and help to mitigate the transport impacts of a development compared with 
private car ownership.  
 The redevelopment of existing car parks for alternative uses will be subject to the car 
free policy. T he number of car parking spaces existing on -site will not be accepted as 
a justification to provide car parking in contravention to the car -free policy, or to 
provide delivery, servicing, drop -off and accessible parking above requirements 
identified in the  submitted Transport Assessment and agreed by the Council . The 
artificial separation of sites to remove existing on -site parking areas from the boundary 
of an application for the purposes of retaining car parking spaces will not be 
considered acceptable. A ll parking related to the existing use and/or building which is 
the subject of the application must  be included as part of the application site.  
 Electric vehicles are not a priority mode of transport; they are preferable to  
petrol/diesel vehicles but still  rank significantly below walking, cycling and public 
transport. Parking for electric vehicle s is subject to car -free policy. Where use of motor 
vehicles is unavoidable, such as for deliveries, the Council  encourages use of electric 
vehicles. The electrici ty grid is not yet decarbonised although a transition to renewable 
energy is under way, so the carbon footprint of electric vehicles is reducing. More  
242 
 importantly however, the scarcity of road space mean the effects of congestion cannot 
be mitigated which justifies the Council ’s clear priority for walking, cycling and public 
transport as priority modes of travel . 
 The Council  is facilitating the provision of electric vehicle charging points, as well as 
helping car club operators to achieve a diesel free flee t and enabling the electrification 
of the borough wide car club network.  Where parking is provided, for example, 
accessible parking,  car clubs and parking for  essential operational needs, electric 
vehicle charging points must  be provided, to help facilitat e move away from petrol and 
diesel powered vehicles. Charging points must  be provided  within the parking space 
itself to minimise street clutter and avoid impacts on the pedestrian environment ; there 
may be exceptions where charging points are incorporated  into existing street furniture 
– e.g. lampposts – and adverse impacts on the public realm can be fully prevented.  
The Streetbook SPD will be used to assess the impacts of new electric vehicle 
charging points on the pedestrian environment.   
 
A. All development proposals must  engage positively with the public realm  and must  
ensure that the public realm:  
(i) is permeable , legible  and designed  with regard to  pedestrian and cycle 
desire lines ; 
(ii) provides for the safety  and convenience of all users, including those with 
mobility, sensory and or cognitive impairments;  
(iii) increases natural surveillance, including through the provision of adequate 
lighting;  
(iv) contributes to the quality and quantity of green infrastructure; and  
(v) promotes positive behaviours and social activities  and encourages  a diverse 
range of  users to make use of space and facilities available.  
B. Any remodelling of the public realm  and/or streets , through a stand -alone proposal 
or as part of a wider development proposal, must  be based on a contextual 
appraisal and the findings of a Route:P lace analysis. All proposals  must be 
designed in accordance with the Streetbook SPD  and must  maximise opportun ities 
to deliver other policy objectives.  
C. Street surface material (s) must:  
(i) be durable  and non-slip in all weather conditions ;  
(ii) be permeable  to avoid exacerbating flood risk;  
(iii) be contextual  and reflect and enhance the character of particular areas; and 
(iv) enhance the quality of the surrounding architecture.  
D. Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS) must provide a detailed  management plan 
which  sets out how the space will be used and managed. Management plans must  
detail how the space can be utilised  by a range o f user s; and how the space  
243 
 contribute s to mixed and balanced communities. POPS must operate 
indistinguishably from public space.  Adherence to management plans will be 
secured through legal agreement.  
E. Free, publicly available provision of unisex accessible toilet, baby change and 
drinking water facilities should be provided within easy reach of any new or 
enhanced public realm where users are encouraged to dwell.  
F. Design  of the public realm must take into account Hostile Vehicle Mitigation 
measures, ensuring that the correct level of protection is provided without imposing 
unnecessary restrictions on people using the public realm  in the area.  
 
 The success of any development within the public realm depends largely on how it 
relates to and fits within its wider context. Development proposals  must provide a 
contextual  appraisal, proportionate to the scale of the development.  The appraisal 
must  inform the design of the site, and will provide a critical reference point throughout 
the design process and ensure public realm elements are fully integrated to all 
proposals at the earliest possible stage. Proposals which do not engage proactively 
with the p ublic realm and explore opportunities for improvements/better links will be 
resisted.  
 To analyse the character, qualities and potential of public realm, a Route:Place 
analysis must  be conducted as part of the contextual appraisal. This analysis provides 
references to classify streets according to their place and movement qualities. A useful 
starting point is to consider where the public realm or street in question is currently 
located on Route:Place spectrum and where they should more appropriately sit. Mor e 
guidance on the Route:Place analysis is provided  in the Streetbook SPD.  
 Assessments of the public realm must be made in an inclusive manner. Tools such as 
the ‘Pedestri an Environment Review System’ (PERS) are  a walking audit tool and can 
be very useful in assessing the quality of the public realm associat ed with a 
development. However, the methodology relies heavily on the auditor’s professional 
judgement. Therefore, any such study is backed up by objective re ference to 
recognised standards , as agreed with the Council  on a case -by-case basis.  
 The privatisation and commercialisation of public space will be resisted. POPS  are 
publicly accessible spaces which are provided and maintained by private landowners . 
Even  though the spaces have public qualities, such as free entry and 24-hour access, 
there are often constraints to their use , including some with restricted access 
arrangements.  
 Where POPS form part of a development proposal, a detailed management plan must 
be provided which sets out how the space will be used and managed. POPS must  
operate as de facto public space open to all groups; it must  not exclude specific 
groups of users. The terms and conditions of their management and activities allowed 
will be defin ed case by case through the submission of the management plan  which  
will be secured through legal agreement.  
 Hostile /defensive  architecture involves various forms of design intended to deter 
certain groups from using a space.  Proposals that include hostile /defensive 
architecture are not consistent with the Council ’s fairness agenda and  will be resisted. 
Public realm developments, including spaces outside public buildings , must  
incorporate Hostile Vehicle Mitigation measures at an early stage of the design 
process, instead of being retro -fitted. Applicants must  engage with the Council  and  
244 
 Metropolitan  Police  at the earliest possible stage of the proposal, for guidance  on 
counterterrorism measures for public projects, including open spaces. A risk 
assessment must be submitted as part of a planning application , which  must  include  
an assessment of the risk of structural damage from an attack; identification of 
measures to minimise any risk; and how the perimeter is treated, including glazing.  
Such measures must  be considered in light of all other policy requirements, including 
inclusive design requirements.  
 Free, publicly available provision of unisex accessible toilet, baby change and drinking 
water facilities should be provided within easy reach of any new or enhanced public 
realm. Publicly accessible, standalone toilets and baby change facilities are preferred, 
and these should be independently managed and policed , including details of 
maintenance (including any commitment for ongoing funding of maintenance) . 
However, where such facilities are not practical (for example if other public realm 
functions and/or the amount of available space leave no scope for new facilities), 
access to toilets and baby change facilities may be provided as part of a Community 
Toile t Scheme. Such alternative provision will only be acceptable where there are firm 
guarantees that provision will be available in perpetuity, without restrictions (such as 
that provided in the City of London, Camden or Richmond).  
 With regard to drinking wa ter facilities, successful schemes such as Refill London 
could be utilised in lieu of specific provision of new drinking water fountains. Any 
alternative provision will need to be fully accessible without restrictions and in 
perpetuity.  
 Streets, whatever s cale, character, status and /or state of repair , can be defined in 
terms of their qualities as a place in which to dwell and a route by which to travel. 
Streets must  form convenient, legible, continuous and adequately lit routes for 
pedestrian s and cyclists , follow desire lines and form networks.  
 A co-ordinated and multi -functional approach to street furniture leads to better street 
design, for instance by combining  signage and lighting ; or better locat ing street 
furniture to fulfil its intended use  and improve the legibility and quality of the 
streetscape and increase the quantity of pedestrian spaces.  Poor design creates 
obstruction, clutter, unwelcoming and unsafe environments.  
 Street d esign can also improve pedestrian safety by reducing traffic speed and 
encouraging safer driving, for example by changing  the road width, junction design 
and appropriate use of surface material . 
 Introducing more trees and greenery creates more attractive streets and public 
spaces, increases biodiversity and helps to mitigate the impacts of  climate change and  
air pollution.  This includes planted  kerb extensions, pavement  planters, landscaped 
central reservations , vegetated swales, permeable paving, and street trees. Provision  
of green infrastructure must  be balanced against the Local Plan inclusive design 
policies .  
 Further guidance on street design is provided in the  Inclusive Landscape Design SPD , 
Streetbook SPD and the  Inclusive Design in Islington SPD.  
  
245 
 A. Delivery and Servicing Plans will be required for developments that may impact on the 
operation of the public highway, private roads, the public realm and/or the amenity of 
residents and businesses, by virtue of likely vehicle movements. These plans must  
demonstrate how any potential impacts will be mitigated.  Delivery and Servicing Plans  
will be required to assess the ongoing freight impact of the development and minimise 
and mitigate the impacts of this on the transport system. Use of low -emission vehicl es 
and efficient and sustainable delivery systems which minimise motorised vehicle trips is 
encouraged.  
B. Proposed delivery and servicing arrangements must:  
(i) be provided off street wherever feasible, particularly for commercial developments 
over 200 sqm GEA ; 
(ii) make optimal use of development sites;  
(iii) demonstrate that servicing and delivery vehicles can enter and exit the site in 
forward gear;  
(iv) submit sufficient information detailing the delivery and servicing needs of 
developments, including demonstration  that all likely adverse impacts have been 
thoroughly assessed and mitigated/prevented. This includes impact on the 
amenity of local residents and businesses, for example, vehicle noise impacts 
from idling and reversing warning mechanisms  and impacts due to the size  of 
delivery vehicles ; 
(v) provide delivery and servicing bays whose use is strictly controlled, clearly signed 
and only used for the specific agreed purpose;  
(vi) ensure that there are no adverse impacts on existing/proposed refuse and 
recycling facilities ; 
(vii) Ensur e that the cumulative impact on sustainable transport modes  is identified 
and suitably mitigated/prevented; this must  include consideration of  delivery and 
servicing requirements of existing, planned and potential development  in the area , 
particularly in Town Centre s, designated employment areas and the CAZ ; and 
(viii) Investigate potential for delivery and servicing by non -motorised sustainable 
modes, such as cargo cycle s and ‘clean’ vehicles . 
C. For major developments, details of refuse and recycling collection must be submitted, 
indicating locations for collection vehicles to wait and locations of refuse and recycling 
bin st ores.  
D. Development proposals in the vicinity of, or located on key routes connecting to,  Locally 
Significant Industrial Site s must demonstrat e that they have considered any impacts on 
logistics and transport movements that are integral to the continued industrial function 
of these areas.   
246 
  
 Full detai ls of delivery and servicing requirements must be provided to enable full 
consideration of potential impacts.  The assessment should be  informed by  the 
transport assessment submitted with  an application , including consideration of : 
 delivery hours;  
 delivery frequency;  
 service bay location;  
 service bay operation (i ncluding swept path analysis), and  
 size of servicing vehicles . 
 
 For commercial developments over 200sqm GEA,  on-street servicing will only be 
allowed where it has been demonstrated that it would not be p ossible to provide 
servicing on -site due to site constraints  and/or impacts on the quality of scheme, and  
where impacts on  highway safety , capacity or congestion  can be prevented or 
mitigated . The servicing and loading arrangements of an existing or previous use will 
not be taken into account  with regard  to justifying continued on -site servicing . Where 
delivery and servicing arrangements include private vehicles, preference must  be 
given to light goods vehicles under 3.5 tonnes. Vehicles weighing more than 3.5 
tonnes are more likely to cause adverse impac ts for the local road network and public 
realm.  
 The Council  will encourage local businesses to avoid peak hours for delivery and 
servicing, for instance through local voluntary agreements, such as servicing and 
delivery bonds.  
 Servicing on bus lanes will not be supported and rear access arrangements will be 
expected  where front -access would interfere with the operation of bus lanes . The 
Council  will, where appropriate, control aspects of servicing by condition and /or 
planning obligation . 
 The Council  expect s all development to compl y with the best practice for construction, 
delivery and servicing, including the Islington Code of Practice for Construction Sites. 
Development must  adhere to relevant best practice standards and safety requirements E. Where on street servicing is provided, details must be submitted to demonstrate the 
need for on street provision and that off street provision is not practical, and to show 
arrangements will be safe and will not cause traffic obstruction or nuisance. This may 
require specific t raffic modelling . 
F. Major residential developments must demonstrate that adequate provision can be made 
for delivery vehicles servicing residents. Delivery storage facilities must  be provided 
such as secure unattended or concierge managed delivery facilities.  
G. Development  proposals – particularly major developments or any other site which may 
cause disruption during its construction - must  adhere to best practice construction 
techniques to limit impacts on air quality and reduce nois e and vibrations from 
construction  and the transportation of construction waste . Information must  be provided 
to identify and mitigate impacts, including a Construction Logistics Plan.   
247 
 such as the Fleet Oper ator Recognition Scheme and the Construction Logistics and 
Community Safety programme . 
 A Construction Logistics Plan (CLP) must  be provided to enable impacts to be properly 
assessed. For applications with significant transport impacts , a two -stage CLP 
(comprising an Outline and Detailed CLP) will be required, in line with TfL guidance . 
The Outline CLP must  be provided as part of the planning application  and the Detailed 
CLP must  be secured by condition and discharged prior to commencement.  
 The Council expect developments to adopt best practice construction techniques to 
reduce noise and vibrations from construction, and encourage the transportation of 
construction waste and rubble out of London via rail  or, where appropriate, waterborne 
freight,  instead of lorry. This includes TfL’s Code of Construction Practice.  
 Development proposals must  demonstrate how emissions from the demolition and 
construction of buildings will be reduced following the Council ’s Code of Construction 
Practice, and how they will comply with the Non -Road Mobile Machinery Low Emission 
Zone where applicable . 
  
248 
 8 Design and Heritage  
A. Islington support s innovative approaches to development as a means to increasing 
development capacity to meet  identified  needs, while simultaneously addressing  
any adverse heritage impacts and protecting and enhancing the unique character of 
the borough. In this context, an  innovative approach is one that contribute s to the 
delivery of the Local Plan objectives, including making the borough a n inclusive and 
resilient  place by ensuring the design of buildings meets  contemporary standards,  
the needs of all users and mitigates against the impacts of climate change . 
 
B. Islington is a diverse place of many different areas which give the borough its 
character. Development can be accommodated throughout the borough , but the 
scale of development is dependent on a number of considerations, including  design  
and heritage . The Council  intends to  develop design codes  for some parts of the 
borough to provide clear design guidance for development in those areas.  
 
C. All views – the Mayor’s strategic  views , local  views  and views  of local landmarks – 
must be protected and enhanced.  
 
D. The Council  will conserve or enhance Islington’s heritage assets  – both designated 
and non -designated - and their settings  in a manner appropriate t o their 
significance , including listed buildings, conservation areas, scheduled monuments,  
Archaeological Priority A reas, historic green spaces, locally listed buildings and 
locally significant shopfronts . 
 
E. Site potential for development  and site density l evels  must be fully optimised, in 
order to  make the best use of the scarce land resource in the borough. High density 
does not automatically mean buildings need to be tall. The design of development 
must  create a human scale and massing.  
 
F. Tall buildings can help make best use of land by optimising  the amount of 
development on a site, but they can also have significant adverse impacts due to 
their scale , massing  and various associated impacts. Tall building locations must be 
carefully  managed  and restricted to specific  sites where  their impacts can be 
managed through appropriate design.  
 
G. Basement development can contribute to accommodating needs, for instance 
growing families, but they can also have significant adverse impacts. Any 
development  involving basements will be strictly controlled.  
 
H. The agent -of-change principle ensures that the individual/organisation proposing 
change is responsible for ensuring that existing uses in the area are not adversely 
impacted , including through noise and vi bration impacts . This principle will apply to  
249 
 all development proposals in the borough, and can include consideration of a wide 
range of planning issues, including compatibility of land uses and design.  
 
 Islington has a diverse  character which is made up of  a rich mix of buildings , streets, 
spaces  and areas which all contribute to a strong sense of place. The way in which 
these elements interact and relate to each other and the wider urban environment 
adds to the borough’s local  distinctiveness.  
 The historic environment is generally defined as all aspects of the environment 
resulting from the interaction between people and places through time, including all 
surviving physical remains of past human activity . Islington’s historic environment is 
highly valued and is a key element of the borough’s character, distinctiveness , and 
success. There are numerous  designated and non -designated  heritage assets that 
contribute to Islington’s historic environment ; around ha lf of Islington is designated as 
a conservation area and it is also home to approximately 4,500 statutorily listed 
buildings alongside numerous other heritage assets.  
 Islington has significant development  needs , particularly for new housing and business 
floorspace , and also must maximise opportunities to mitigate the impacts of climate 
change  and ensure that development is inclusive and accessible to all . Islington’s 
character may need to  evolve in order to accommodate these needs, and ultimately 
deliver th e Local Plan objectives holistically . As part of any evolving character, 
protection of the historic environment must  be reconciled with the environmental, 
social and economic needs and aspirations of people who live and work in the 
borough , although the co nservation and enhancement of the historic environment can 
itself be a tool for meeting these aspirations . 
 The borough’s  built heritage is a resource which can help shape new development in 
the borough and the careful consideration and integration of herit age assets into new 
development schemes provides an opportunity for conservation and development to 
work together to transform the built environment.  Heritage assets play a key role in 
enriching the fabric of the borough’s townscape, and new development must seek to 
enhance them through high quality urban design and architecture which also creates 
safer and more inclusive places . Further guidance is provided in t he Islington Urban 
Design Guide  SPD. 
 In order to successfully deliver new  development  which fosters innovation and 
enhances the historic environment, development proposals must , inter alia :  
 be high quality and contextual, reflecting  the valued aspects of local character , 
while allowing considered, appropriate increases in density and heig ht (in line with 
policy DH2);  
 reinforce, and where possible positively contribute to,  Islington's local character 
and distinctiveness. Applicants must  work positively and proactively with all 
relevant stakeholders to understand the potential scope for maxi mising the 
potential positive contribution , including benefits from an improved public realm ; 
and 
 preserve or enhance the borough's heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their 
significance.   
250 
 
 This approach to the historic environment  does not mean simp ly mimi cking of what is 
already there; instead, it requires genuine engagement with , and a quality response to,  
the local context. Contemporary architecture and non -traditional materials can, in 
principle, make a positive contribution, although this will b e assessed on a case -by-
case basis. New development can also create new views and juxtapositions which add 
to the variety and texture of the setting  of heritage assets .  
 The four design principles of Policy PLAN1 will enable  an innovative approach to 
devel opment in Islington whilst conserving and enha ncing the historic environment. 
Innovative development can help to achieve a positive contribution and make the best 
use of land in the borough. Innovation goes beyond mere  aesthetics; it is 
fundamentally about  how we can accommodate new development – particularly 
delivery of affordable housing and other priorities - through intensification, achieving 
versatility and injecting life into an area.   
 Creating buildings of a human scale and massing, which accommodate  high density 
development, is one way this could be achieved. It is expected that the  majority of 
future growth  will be accommodated in high-density development  which has  fully 
explored  all opportunities to optimise  the development potential of sites49. For 
example, a  re-interpreted, modern take on mansion blocks which marries high density 
development of a  human scale with provision of high quality design  standards is an 
innovative approach which could optimise development capacity while simultaneously 
enhan cing the built environment.  
 Innovation could also inclu de new architectural styles and techniques such as modular 
construction, which could have  benefits in terms of design and construction costs and 
deliverability of sites.  
 Innovative development and design must  also use physical form to provide solutions to 
issues which arise through the process of developing proposals, rather than relying  on 
future management arrangements  of specific buildings ; shortcomings in the latter 
frequently places unreaso nable and unsustainable demands on the former . An 
example of this  includes emergency evacuation arrangements; all developments must 
be compartmentalised (installing fire breaks not only between floors but within floors so 
that all users can escape horizont ally to a place of another part of the building), and/or 
include provision of evacuation lifts (in addition to any requirement for fire -fighting lifts) 
that would provide a safe and secure evacuation route for mobility impaired individuals 
in an emergency.  
 The Council  has commissioned a borough -wide characterisation study to provide an 
up-to-date and thorough understanding of the local character in various areas across 
the borough, taking into account a number of considerations including relevant 
heritage d esignations. The results of this work will be used to  develop supplementary 
guidance on optimising development capacity across the borough, to support various 
policies and allocations set out in the Local Plan.  This may include reference to 
specific suita ble development  typologies  for certain areas or types of site . 
 Applicants for major schemes are encouraged  to engage in pre -application 
discussions to inform the design of development proposals, and subsequently  use 
Islington’s Design Review Panel to provi de constructive feedback on design proposals.  
 
                                                
49 Buildings which are 30 metres or more in height will trigger policy DH3 Part B.   
251 
 A. Planning  and listed building consent  applications must include a Heritage Statement 
which demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of any heritage assets  
affected by the proposals, including any contribution to significance made by their 
setting ; and assesses the  potential impact on significance arising from the 
proposals . Heritage Statements must  be informed by specialist heritage advice  and 
must  include sufficient in formation to allow full assessment of development 
proposals . 
Conservation areas  
B. Development within conservation areas  and their settings – including alterations to 
existing buildings and new development - must conserve  and enhance  the 
significance of the area, and must  be of a high quality contextual design . Proposals 
that harm the significance of a conservation area must provide clear and convincing 
justification for the harm ; where proposals will cause substantial harm to the 
significance of a conservati on area, they  will be strongly resisted.  
C. Buildings, spaces,  street patterns,  views  and vistas, uses and trees  which contribute 
to the significance of a conservation area must  be retained . The significance of a 
conservation area can be harmed over time by t he cumulative impact arising from 
the loss of these elements which may  individually make a limited positive 
contribution, but cumulatively have a greater positive contribution.  
Listed buildings  
D. Proposals that harm the significance of a listed building ( through inappropriate 
repair, alteration, extension, demolition and/or development within its setting ) must 
provide clear and convincing justification for the harm . Substantial harm to, or loss 
of, a listed building will be strongly resisted.   
Historic gre en spaces  
E. Islington’s h istoric green spaces  are important heritage assets and are listed in 
Appendix 7. Proposals  which affect the significance  of historic green spaces must 
ensure:  
(i) the conservation or enhancement of the spaces themselves, their setting and 
any important features;  
(ii) that the enjoyment, layout, design, character, appearance or setting of spaces, 
and key views out from the landscape, is maintained or enhanced; and  
(iii) that any planned or potential future restoration is not prejudiced.  The Council  
encourages the restoration and management of historic green spaces to 
enhance their value.  
F. Proposals that harm the significance of a historic green space must provide clear 
and convincing justification for the harm. Where proposals will cause substantial 
harm to the ir significance, they will be strongly resisted.  
  
252 
 Archaeology  
G. Islington’s Archaeological Priority Areas and scheduled monuments are identified on 
the Policies Map. Proposals which have the potential to affect archaeological 
remains and/or heritage assets of archaeological interest, particularly those within 
Archaeological  Priority Areas and/or in proximity to scheduled monuments, are 
required to include an Archaeolog ical Assessment  and, where necessary Field 
Evaluation . 
H. Important a rchaeological remains must  be retained in situ. Substantial harm to, or 
loss of, nationally important archaeological remains will be strongly resisted. Where 
this cannot be achieved measures  must be taken to mitigate the impact of proposals 
through archaeological fieldwork to investigate and record remains in advance of 
works, and subsequent analysis, publication and dissemination of the findings.  
Where appropriate, public benefits should be sought by revealing and/or interpreting 
archaeological discoveries.  
Non-designated heritage assets  
I. Non-designated heritage assets, including locally listed buildings and shopfronts, 
must  be identified early in the design process for any development proposa l which 
may impact on their significance. The Council  will encourage the retention, repair 
and re -use of non -designated heritage assets. Proposals that unjustifiably harm the 
significance of a non -designated heritage asset or their setting will generally n ot be 
permitted.  
Views  
J. There are a number of strategic  views,  local views and views of local landmarks 
within and across Islington. These give important views  toward  St. Paul’s Cathedral , 
while some offer a unique panoramic view of Islington and other parts of London or 
a view of St. Paul’s or a local landmark as part of the broader townscape 
(particularly street level views). All views – strategic, local and local landmarks – 
must be pro tected and enhan ced. Proposals involving the redevelopment of 
buildings that currently adversely impact a protected view must take all reasonable 
steps to enhance the view and remove any existing infringement on the view. 
Development proposals must provide  appropriate supporting material – including 3D 
modelling - to verify the visual impact of proposed development on protected views.  
Heritage at risk  
K. Where development proposals involve ‘at risk’ heritage assets, opportunities must  
be sought to address the negative factors which contribute to the ‘at risk’ status.  
L. Where there is evidence of deliberate neglect of, or damage to, a heritage asset, the 
deteriorated state of the heritage asset will not be taken into account in any 
decision.  
 
 Islington’s heritage assets add to the borough’s character and distinctiveness. Listed  
buildings, conservation areas , scheduled monuments , local landmarks  and 
Archaeological Priority Areas are all designated heritage assets. However, the term 
heritage asse t includes any valued component of the historic environment ; it is not 
limited to specific buildings and structures, and can include spaces, views and other  
253 
 assets  which are positively identified as  having a degree of significance meriting 
consideration in  planning decisions.

 The significance of a heritage asset is defined as the value of a heritage asset to this 
and future generations because of its heritage interest. The interest may be 
archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a 
heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting.  
 The setting of a heritage asset is defined as the surroundings in which a heritage asset 
is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its 
surroundings evolve. Elemen ts of a setting may make a positive or negative 
contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that 
significance or may be neutral.  
 All heritage assets have a setting, irrespective of the form in which the y survive and 
whether they are designated or undesignated. The extent and importance of a setting 
is often expressed by reference to visual considerations. Although views of or from an 
asset will play an important part, the way in which we experience an asset in its set ting 
is also influenced by other environmental factors such as noise, dust and vibration 
from other land uses in the vicinity, and by our understanding of the historic 
relationship between places51. 
 The Council  will not permit substantial harm to (or total loss of significance of) a 
designated heritage asset unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm or  
total loss is necessary to fully address all  other relevant Local Plan policy requirements 
including, inter alia, affordable housing, affordable  workspace, inclusive design and 
sustainability standards ; or where the following criteria is met in full:  
 The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site;  
 No viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium te rm through 
appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation;  
 Conservation by grant -funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public 
ownership is demonstrably not possible; and  
 the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the  site back into use.  
 Where the loss of a heritage asset is permitted , in whole or in part,  the Council  will 
take all reasonable steps to ensure that the new development will proceed after the 
loss has occurred.  
 Creative re -use and adaptation of heritage assets can contribute positively to its 
significance; however, in some cases, inappropriate re -use can significantly detract 
from the special interest of a heritage asset. In all cases, r epair and re -use must  
enha nce the quality of the building/asset, for example through inclusion of inclusive 
design and sustainability standards; and/or where it would help meet identified 
development needs in the borough. Regard must  be had to relevant best practice and 
guidance in cluding Historic England’s Easy Access to Historic Buildings52. 
                                                
51 Historic England’s “The Setting of Heritage Assets: Historic E nvironment Good Practice Advice in 
Planning 3 (2nd edition)” sets out advice on understanding setting and how it might contribute to the 
significance of heritage assets. The suggested staged approach to taking decisions on setting can 
also be used to asses s the contribution of views to the significance of heritage assets. The note is

 The significance of conservation areas can be derived from various features including 
buildings, spaces, street patterns, views,  vistas, uses, trees,  and landscapes.  The 
Council  has prepared co nservation area statements and design guidelines for all of the 
borough’s conservation areas. Where relevant, this guidance will be updated to reflect 
changes to the areas over time , which may be informed by further characterisation 
work, and link with fut ure design codes/guidance . The Council  has also set out 
guidance on the appropriate repair, alteration, or extension to listed buildings in the 
Islington Urban Design Guide SPD. The Council  maintains  a list of locally significant 
buildings and shopfronts w hich make a positive contribution to Islington's local 
character and distinctiveness.  
 Islington’s listed buildings form a vital part of the borough’s local character and 
distinctiveness. The special interest of a listed building may vary and will be assess ed 
by an expert officer on a case -by-case basis . However, the following  aspects  are likely 
to have the potential to contribute to the significance of a listed building:  
 External elevations including architectural detailing, roof forms, windows and 
doors ; 
 External spaces and structures such as gardens, lightwells and boundary 
treatments ; 
 Plan form including internal spaces  and their hierarchy , partitions, ceilings, floors, 
staircases and chimney breasts ; and 
 Interior decoration including architectural detailing, chimneypieces, floor surfaces, 
joinery and plasterwork.  
 Historic fabric is an important part of a listed building’s significance. Retention of as 
much historic fabric as possible must  be the starting point of any proposals, together 
with the use  of appropriate materials and methods of repair.  When repair, alteration or 
extension works are justified, they must relate sensitively to the original buildings and 
will normally require craftsmanship and professional skill of a high standard.  
 Materials u sed for repairs, alterations  or extensions must  be compatible with those 
already used on the building . The use of non -traditional materials may be acceptable 
where they respond sensitively to the significance of building and will not undermine 
structural i ntegrity or performance of the building.  
 Frequently, later historic additions to listed buildings are of significance in their own 
right as part of the building's history. Generally, later fabric of significance must  not be 
removed in order to restore a bu ilding to an earlier form. The Council  will encourage 
the accurate reinstatement of lost original architectural detailing where it can be 
demonstrated that it will enhance the significance of a listed building. In such cases 
the Council  will require applic ants to provide adequate information confirming the 
historic authenticity of the work proposed.  
 Significance is derived from more than simply historic fabric and appearance: it may 
include the original purpose of the building, and the location, function an d hierarchy of 
rooms, floor levels and circulation routes. Issues to consider include  the impact on 
spatial quality, light levels and the relationship between spaces, both internal and 
external. Significance can be harmed by extension underground, loss of garden space 
or the infilling of a lightwell.  
 The integrity and authenticity of a listed building can be substantially harmed over time 
by the cumulative impact of works which may individually cause minor harm. Works  
257 
 that undermine the architectural integr ity and authenticity of a listed building, such as 
ad hoc or piecemeal alteration, must  therefore be avoided . 
 Historic England maintain a Heritage at Risk Register53, based on advice provided by 
LPAs . An ‘at risk’ heritage asset is one at risk of being lost  as a result of neglect, decay 
or inappropriate development.  Development proposals involving ‘at risk’ heritage 
assets must  identify opportunities for the asset(s) to contribute to regeneration and 
place -making, and set out strategies for their repair and re-use. Applicants must  
engage with the Council  and other relevant bodies at an early stage to inform 
identification of such opportunities.  
 The Council  will use its statutory powers to ensure that listed buildings at risk from 
neglect or decay are appropri ately maintained and repaired.  
 The Council  maintains a list of locally listed buildings and shopfronts which make a 
positive contribution to Islington's local character and distinctiveness. The Council  will 
resist the removal of buildings, structures and s hopfronts of architectural or historic 
interest listed on the Register of Locally Listed Buildings and Locally Significant 
Shopfronts, and will treat them as non -designated heritage assets in the decision 
making process.  
 The Council  will protec t the significance of  historic green spaces  listed in Appendix 7. 
These  spaces  are derived from  the following sources54: 
 Spaces listed on Historic England’ s Register of Parks and Gardens;  
 Square s protected by the Londo n Squares Preservation Act 1931; and  
 Areas listed on the London Parks and Gardens  Trust ’s Inventory of Historic Green 
Spaces.  
 The following Archaeological Priority Areas are identified  on the Policies Map : 
 St Mary de Fonte Nunnery (Tier 1)  
 Priory of The Knights Hospitallers of St . John of Jeru salem (Tier 1)  
 The Charterhouse Carthusian Monastery (Tier 1)  
 Moorfields (Tier 2)  
 Islington Village (Tier 2)  
 Tollington settlement and Manor House (Tier 2)  
 Newington Green hamlet (Tier 2)  
 Kingsland medieval hamlet (Tier 2)  
 Barnsbury moated manor (Tier 2)  
 Moated Manor House for Barnsbury Manor (Tier 2)  
 Highbury Grange and Manor House (Tier 2)  
 Canonbury Manor House (Tier 2)  
 St Anthony’s Leper Hospital (Tier 2)  
                                                
53 Available from : https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/heritage -at-risk/  
54 The policy will apply to any additional spaces added to these sources.   
258 
  New River and New River Head Reservoirs (Tier 2)  
 Sadler’s Wells and New Wells Spas (Tier 2)  
 Post-medieval burial grounds (Tier 2)  
 Regents Canal, Basins and Wharves (Tier 2)  
 Civil War Defences (Tier 2)  
 St John’s Street (Tier 2)  
 Tier 1 priority areas are known or believed , on present evidence , to contain non -
designated heritage assets of archaeological in terest of equivalent significance to 
scheduled monuments . Tier 2  priority areas are areas where there is  specific evidence 
indicating the presence or likely presence of heritage assets of archaeological interest . 
 There are two scheduled monuments in the bo rough – St. John’s Gate and the 
Nunnery of St. Mary de Fonte.  These are identified on the Policies Map.  
 All planning applications likely to affect important archaeological remains are required 
to include an Archaeological Assessment  and may require trial e xcavations to 
establish the significance and vulnerability of surviving remains . 
 Important a rchaeological remains must  be retained in situ  wherever reasonably 
practical, for example by careful design of foundations or avoiding damaging new 
basement excavat ions. Where preservation in situ  cannot be achieved measures must 
be taken to mitigate the impact of proposals through archaeological fieldwork to 
investigate and record remains in advance of works, and subsequent analysis, 
publication and dissemination of  the findings.  Public benefits can be provided through 
revealing, conserving and interpreting significant remains or through public open days, 
displays, talks or educational activities.  
 Protected views policies are intended to operate over the long term, to preserve and 
enhance important public views now and for generations to come. The long term 
nature of the policies enables the policy to seek to enhance these public views where 
they have been adversely impacted by buildings. Over time when redevelopment  of a 
building that has an adverse impact on a view (e.g.  if blocks part of the view) occurs, 
the policy aim is for the new development to enhance the view and not to continue to 
adversely impact on the view. Islington is home to a number of protected view s and 
landmarks including strategic views protected by the London Plan and  a number of 
locally protected views . These are shown on the Policies Map  and on Figure 8.2 
below:   
259 
 Figure 8. 2: Strategic and local views  
 
 
260 
 
 The London Plan strategic views relevant to development in Islington  are: 
 Alexandra Palace to Central London  
 Parliament Hill to Central London  
 Kenwood to Central London  
 Blackheath Point to Central London55 
 The London View Management Framework SPG provides furth er guidance on the 
management of these strategic views.  
 Local views are of equal quality to the London Plan strategic views and the Council  will 
give equal protection to both types of views . The local views protected under policy 
DH2 are:  
 LV1: View from Farringdon Lane /Farringdon Road /Clerkenwell Road to St. Paul's 
Cathedral  
 LV2: View from St. John Street to St. Paul's Cathedral  
 LV3: View from the Angel to St. Paul's Cathedral  
 LV4: View from Archway Road to St. Paul's Cathedral  
 LV5: View from Archway Brid ge to St. Paul's Cathedral  
 LV6: View from Amwell Street to St. Paul's Cathedral  
 LV7: View from Dartmouth Park Hill to St. Paul's Cathedral  
 LV8: View from Pentonville Road to St. Pancras Chambers and Station  
 The Local Views are shown on the Policies Map. Further  information on protected local 
views, including co -ordinates , is set out in Appendix 6 , and the Council may produce 
further supplementary guidance where necessary. Applicants must provide 
appropriate supporting material to verify the visual impact of the proposed 
development on the relevant protected views .  
 Islington benefits from having many fine buildings, some of which are local landmarks 
providing a focus of interesting views and skylines. These buildings are key elements 
within Islington's tow nscape and help create its local distinctiveness. A number of 
these landmarks are listed below, although this is not necessarily a comprehensive list 
and further landmarks  could be identified during the decision -making process  and/or 
through further guidan ce. Each landmark may feature within a number of important 
views from different locations. The impact of development on these various views 
needs to be considered when development is proposed in the vicinity of a landmark.  
                                                
55 Only a small section of the background assessment area  of this view enters the London Borough of 
Islington near the boundary of the City of London and the London Borough of Camden in the vicinity 
of Farringdon Station.

 A. Buildings of more than 30 metres, or those that are more than twice the contextual 
reference height of surrounding context (whichever is the lesser) will be considered 
to be tall buildings.  
B. Buildings of more than 30 metres are only acceptable  in-principle : 
(i) on sites allocated in the Local Plan where the allocation makes specific 
reference to suitability for heights of 30 metres or more; and/or  
(ii) within specific sites identified in a Spatial Str ategy  area.  
C. Each relevant allocation and/or Spatial Strategy  area policy identifies the maximum 
permissible heights  (in metres)  suitable on the respective sites/locations. Any 
buildings p roposed on these sites  which exceed the identified maximum heights w ill 
be refused. Proposals for buildings of more than 30 metres are only acceptable 
where they fully satisfy the criteria identified in Part F. 
D. Proposals for buildings which are more than twice the contextual reference height of 
surrounding buildings, but l ess than 30 metres, must fully satis fy criteria identified in 
Part F .  
E. Buildings that do not meet  the criteria  in Part A  but which are still considered 
prominent in their surrounding  context must respond appropriately to local 
contextual building heights, the character of the area and other relevant polic ies, 
and may be subject to Part F  of this policy.  
F. All proposals for tall buildings must mitigate the individual and cumulative visual, 
functional and environmental impacts on the surrounding and wider context , and 
fully satisfy all the following criteria:  
Visual Impact  
(i) Protect the legibility and identity of the area by creating a positive landmark 
within the townscape and creating a strong sense of place;  
(ii) Protect and enhance strategic and local views, and views to local landmarks;  
(iii) Conserve and  seek to  enhance  the significance of designated and non -
designated heritage assets and their settings, relative to their respective 
significance;  
(iv) Be proportionate and compatible to their surroundings and the chara cter of the 
area;  
(v) Promote exceptional design, through high quality design details and material, 
positively contribute to the skyline and to the immediate locality, and having 
regard to any site-specific design principles set out in the relevant site 
alloca tions and/or Spatial Strategy  area policy , and other relevant design 
policies   
263 
 (vi) Provide an appropriate transition from the taller section of a building to the lower 
volume relating to the streetscape and surrounding context and ensuring a 
human scale street level experience;  
Functional Impact  
(vii) Not prejudice the ongoing functionality , amenity  or operation of sites in the local 
area; and/or the development potential of sites in the local area, taking into 
account the individual impact of the proposal and cumulat ive impacts of existing 
and permitted development in the area (all development not just tall buildings);  
(viii) Ensure that impacts on the  levels of daylight and sunlight – both into and 
between proposed buildings and for adjoining land or properties - are fully 
assessed and found to be acceptable; and that unacceptable overshadowing is 
prevented ; 
(ix) Demonstrate how the building will operate and function to provide good levels of 
amenity for all building users, through provision of a detailed building 
management plan  which details how the proposed building will operate in 
various circumstances, including emergency procedures. Plans must  include 
information on peak time ingress and egress and the interaction with local and 
strategic infrastructure; delivery and servici ng; vertical transportation; waste 
arrangements; emergency escape routes and other relevant building services ; 
Environmental impact  
(x) Promote exceptional sustainable design standards;  
(xi) Demonstrate that development does not adversely impact, either individuall y or 
cumulatively, on the microclimate of the surrounding area, including the proposal 
site and any public space in close proximity to the site. This may require 
submission of detailed assessments and/or modelling work; and  
(xii) Demonstrate that development do es not have any adverse individual or 
cumulative impacts on biodiversity, including watercourses and water bodies 
and their hydrology . 
 
 Islington has relatively little available land for development – given the size and built -
up nature of the borough - but faces intense pressure for development, particularly for 
residential and office uses. There are significant  opportunit ies to optimise  development 
while providing a form of development  at a human scale which is  responsive to  the 
surrounding contextual heights across much of the borough . 
 Tall buildings are substantially t aller than their neighbours and can  significantly change 
the skyline ; they  are often seen as an option to optimise  development potential on a 
site. However, due to their scale and visibility, they can have a significant impact on a 
place, and as such must be subject to detailed scrutiny. They are not uniformly 
appropriate across the borough.   
264 
 
 For the purposes of this policy, tall buildings are split into two classifications57: 
 Buildings of more than 30 metres in height; or  
 Buildings which are more than twice the contextual reference height of 
surrounding buildings58. 
 Buildings of more than 30 metres in height may be  suitable:  
 On sites allocated in the Local Plan where the allocation makes specific reference 
to suitability for heights of 30 metres or more; and/or  
 Within specific sites identified in relevant Spatial Strategy  policies.  
 These sites have been informed by a de tailed local urban design assessment which 
took into account a variety of considerations including public transport accessibility, 
topography, conservation areas, listed buildings, protected vistas and strategic views, 
to sieve out areas unsuitable for bui ldings of  more than 30 metres in height.  
 Figure  8.3 shows all locations which are suitable, in -principle, for bu ildings of more 
than 30 metres.
                                                
57 For both classifications, height should be measured to the tallest point of the building including any 
structures on the roof, e.g. telecommunications equipment, lift overruns, plant machinery.  
58 For avoidance of doubt, a building which is less than 30m b ut more than twice the contextual 
reference height of surrounding buildings would be classed as a tall building.   
265

 Maximum permissible heights for each location, as well as some site specific design 
principles, including guidance on siting of height within the context of the site/area 
boundary (where relevant), are set out in the relevant site allocation and/or Spatial 
Strategy  policy59. They are repeated in T able 8.1 below, for reference:

59 The Islington Tall Buildings Study (2018) sets out maximum potential heights in metres and storeys 
(residential or commercial). The developme nt considerations of relevant site allocations , or the 
relevant Spatial Strategy policies and supporting text,  also refer to heights in metres and storeys. For 
avoidance of doubt, the maximum height in metres takes precedence over the height indicated in 
storeys.

 Buildings that are below the 30m threshold and less than twice of the height of the 
surrounding  context but which can still be considered prominent may be classed as tall 
buildings and, as a result, they may be subject to Part F of policy DH3 dependent on 
site specific circumstances .  
 Where policy DH3 Parts D and E refers to the surrounding  context height , this  is not 
informed  solely  by the highest existing height in the surrounding built environment . 
Surrounding context height will be determined on a case -by-case basis which includes 
consideration of the broad surrounding heights  evident in an area .   
 The Islington  Tall Buildi ngs study  (2018)  has identified locations potentially suitable for 
buildings over 30m from a broader urban design perspective. The remit of the study 
did not include assessment of all the potential impacts of a tall building on the 
neighbouring uses, such as sunlight and daylight impacts, heritage impacts, etc. 
Building heights of 30m or more are not automatically acceptable on the identified 
sites in T able 8.1; this will be subject to all relevant assessments being undertaken 
and impacts being found to be acceptable.  
 All proposals for tall buildings must consider the individual and cumulative visual, 
functional and environmental impact of the proposal:  
 Visual impact – robust assessment of the visual impact of a tall building is essential 
to ensure that the proposal is appropriate for local area. This includes 
consideration of strategic and local views and heritage constraints , which will 
require submission of relevant information including 3D modelling . Location, form, 
proportion, height and expression of ar chitecture are some of the other contributing 
factors that are imperative in creating tall buildings that perform a positive 
landmark role within the townscape. By ensuring all collective factors are met, tall 
buildings will be able to enhance the legibili ty of an area and contribute positively 
to its character and sense of place.  
 Functional impact – tall buildings must operate efficiently in and of themselves, but 
also must fit seamlessly within the function of the local area  and must  not impact 
the ongoing functionality and operation of sites  or uses  in the local area. Protection 
of amenity is also important. All tall buildings must not result in unacceptable   
268 
 amenity impacts for nearby occupiers/uses, including overlooking; policy PLA N1 
provides further details of specific amenity considerations. The impact of potential 
development sites must  also be fully considered, so that the development of tall 
buildings does not introduce constraints which would preclude such sites from 
coming fo rward . Full assessment of individual and cumulative impacts is essential 
to ascertain the true picture of functionality, thereby ensuring that adverse impacts 
are prevented. Functionality will be the most tangible day -to-day issue for the 
future operation of a tall building, and issues can be hard to rectify in future; 
therefore, it is vitally important that this is dealt with prior to permission being 
granted.  Policy DH5 will be an important consideration in this regard.   
 Environmental impact – due to thei r scale, tall buildings can cause adverse 
impacts on various elements of the local environment. They can create their own 
microclimate, with impacts from wind (and associated wind noise) being a common 
issue, and can cause localised (street -level) air poll ution issues, especially where 
there are clusters of tall buildings which preclude dispersal of pollutants. Reflected 
solar glare, night -time light pollution and overheating are some of the other issues 
associated with tall buildings that require further c onsideration.  
 Applicants will be required to provide sufficient information to enable the impact and 
planning merits of the tall building proposals to be properly assessed, including 
sufficient information on the detailed form and finishes of the building in order to 
properly assess its impact and design quality ; and assessments to identify specific 
environmental /micro -climatic  impacts, such as wind tunnel testing , sun path stud ies, 
overshadowing, heat island and glare stu dies.  
 For av oidance of doubt, the potential appropriateness for tall building locations and  
maximum heights stipulated for each location (denoted in T able 8.1 and in relevant 
site allocations  and Spatial Strategy areas ) does not in any way replace the 
requirement  for a tall building application on identified sites  to fully justify its approach 
towards height and  built form. All proposals for tall buildings  must  evaluate the benefits 
and justification for a tall  building in relation to the  surrounding context, views and  how 
it will enhance  the local townscape.  
 Applicants seeki ng planning permission for tall buildings in the Bo rough must submit 
full planning applications for th eir proposals. Outline planning applications for tall 
building s are not accepted , as detailed is sues must be considered together with the 
principle of what height is considered suitable – such considerations cannot be 
detached and considered later .  
 
A. All basement development must be proportionate to its site and cont ext. 
B. The Council  will only permit basement development where it is demonstrated to its 
satisfaction that the proposal would not cause  an unacceptable degree of  harm to:  
(i) the structural stab ility of the existing building, nearby buildings, trees an d any 
infrastructure;

 (ii) the structural, ground, or water conditions of the area;  
(iii) the architectural character of the building;  
(iv) the character and amenity of the area; or  
(v) the significance of heritage assets including conservation areas and listed 
buildings.  
C. Applicants proposing basement development must  provide evidence of the impact 
of basement development in the form of a Structural Method Statement  (SMS) , 
which satisfies the criteria in part B.  
D. For residential basement development (including extensions):  
(i) a basement must cumulatively occupy less than 50% of the original garden 
and/or unbuilt area; or the area of a basement which is outside the footprint of 
the host building must  total no more than 50% of the  area of the footprint of the 
host building, whichever is the lesser ; 
(ii) a basement must  not involve excavation of more than one (1) storey below the 
lowest original habitable floor level ; 
(iii) the height of a basement must  not exceed 3m floor to ceiling height ; 
(iv) where considered appropriate in the local context, l ightwells and other external 
manifestations must  be modest in size, discreetly located, and designed to 
protect and enhance the character and appearance of the area ; 
(v) basements must  be designed to preserve existing gardens, and must  reinforce 
the visual rel ief that soft landscaping between buildings provides ; and  
(vi) basement development must  not significantly alter the prevailing garden level.  
 
 Basement development includes any excavation to form new or additional floorspace 
under the ground level (subterranea n) of an existing property or within its curtilage and 
under its garden. It also includes basements which are part of new build development.  
 Basement development and other development that involves excavation changes the 
ground and water conditions of the area and can potentially lead to ground instability 
or flooding. Basement development can also have significant construction impacts due 
to the need to remove spoil and the complexities of excavation. The Council  
recognises the need to protect the environm ent and adjoining neighbours’  properties 
and buildings from these impacts.  
 Most basement developments will require planning permission but there may be 
certain circumstances where basement development may be permitted development 
under the General Permitte d Development Order.  
 Islington has seen an increase in basement development caused by high land values 
coupled with limited opportunities for extensions above ground. In response to this 
development pressure the Council  has produced the Basement Developmen t SPD 
which provides further guidance on the implementation of policy DH4.   
270 
 
 Above ground development  traditionally has minimal impact on ground conditions and , 
when removed , enables the site to  be restored to its (near) pre -development state ; 
however,  subte rranean basements, particularly when greater than one storey in depth, 
can permanently and irreversibly alter ground conditions.  
 Basements must be designed to safeguard the structural stability of the existing 
building, nearby buildings, trees, and any infrastructure. For all basement development 
applicants must submit a SMS that has been prepared in accordance with the SMS 
requirements set out in the Islington Basement Development SPD. The SMS must be 
signed and endorsed by a Chartered Civil Engineer or  Chartered Structural Engineer 
with relevant experience, appointed by the applicant.  
 The Council  may choose to consult (at the expense of the applicant) an independent 
suitably qualified person to undertake an independent assessment for specific cases 
wher e substantive conflicting information has been presented to the Council , or where 
there are any particularly sensitive buildings, trees, or other structures within proximity 
of the site.  
 The design and size of basement  development  must  be proportionate and  respond to 
the scale, function and character of the site and its surrounds, including the above 
ground portion of the building. Where large basement extensions are proposed, the 
resulting intensity of basement use may be out of keeping with the domestic s cale, 
function, and character of its context. Basement development must  not unduly 
intensify the use of a site, or cause significant environmental harm. Whilst modest 
basement extensions can in some circumstances be an effective way of creating 
additional floorspace , the development of private open space to achieve additional 
floor area can give rise to a number of adverse impacts unless designed sensitively, 
including increased surface water flood risk, impacts on the borough’s biodiversity and 
adaptation to climate change.   
 Basement development must  cumulatively occupy less than 50% of the original 
garden or unbuilt area; or the area of a basement which is outside the footprint of the 
host building must  total no more than 50% of the footprint of the host building, 
whichever is the lesser. The maximum extent will be measured separately for each 
garden or unbuilt area within the site, e.g. front, back, or side. The remaining area 
must  be designed to maximise garden amenity and functionality. The siting of th e 
basements must  maximise the connectivity of neighbouring gardens and green spaces 
in the wider area to support green corridors and biodiversity, and enable surface water 
drainage and lateral ground water movement to occur between sites.  
 The depth of a b asement can increase the impacts associated with basement 
construction including longer construction times, more excavation waste, greater 
potential to cause ground movement and ground water, as well as resulting in spaces 
with less natural light and venti lation. Basements must  therefore not exceed 1 storey in 
depth, and not exceed 3m floor to ceiling height. A basement extension below an 
existing basement or lower ground floor (that is not an original feature of the building) 
that would result in a two sto rey basement and will be resisted.  
 For infill residential development, the scale and extent of basement within a site must  
respond to the site context and the prevailing scale of development in the area. 
Basements must  be proportionate, subordinate  to the  above ground building element, 
and reflect the character of its surrounds. The proportion of the site that is built 
upon/under to the proportion unbuilt upon when compared with surrounding buildings 
is of particular importance to achieving a compatible sc ale of development on infill 
sites.   
271 
 
 The siting of buildings and any associated basements must  protect and enhance 
existing landscaped areas within the site, particularly where they contribute to the 
character of an area. The Council  will require the inclusion of generous deep soil 
landscape and drainage margins that can support mature soft landscaping and 
sustainable drainage.  
 On commercial and mixed use redevelopment schemes with proposed basements, the 
extent of basement developmen t must  be commensurate to the site context and 
building design. Sites within commercial areas such as the CAZ often contain buildings 
built to the boundary. Any basement component of the scheme must  be designed to 
avoid adverse impacts to sensitive sites, building, trees and other structures that may 
be affected by the construction of the proposed development.  
 Proposals must  provide satisfactory landscaping, maximise permeability, biodiversity 
value and sustainable drainage through the provision of soft lan dscaping and 
permeable surfacing, and appropriate planting.  
 Where basement comes within proximity to existing trees on the site or adjoining sites, 
trees must  be retained and the basement must  be designed to avoid any adverse 
impacts upon those trees. An Arboricultural Report must  be submitted in accordance 
with BS5837:2012 for any such application.  
 Trees proposed on a site must  be provided with sufficient rooting volumes and access 
to deep soil areas to ensure their long term survival and ability to reach  maturity.  
 Unless within 3m of the original rear wall, any basement extending beyond the original 
footprint of a building must  incorporate a minimum of 1m of soil plus 200mm drainage 
above the top cover of the basement. For particularly constrained sites, or where large 
trees are proposed, soil depth of up to 1.5m must  be provided.  
 Lightwells and other external manifestations must  be modest in size, discreetly 
located, and designed to protect and enhance the character and appearance of the 
area. Basements must be designed to preserve existing gardens.  In conservation 
areas, lightwells and other visible external manifestations of basement development in 
front gardens or the front of properties may fail to preserve or enhance the character 
or appearance of the  conservation area, and therefore may need to be confined to the 
rear of properties  
 Where rooflights are proposed, they must  be kept flush with the ground level, be close 
to the building, proportionately small, and sympathetic with the host building. 
Roofl ights that are located away from the building line such as in the middle of private 
gardens can be visually harmful and when illuminated from below can result in light 
spillage and are generally unacceptable.  
 Other associated external manifestations of bas ements such as stairs, retaining 
structures and railings must  be sensitively designed and discreetly sited so as to 
minimise the fragmentation of spaces, not contribute to visual clutter, or detract from 
the prevailing streetscape or garden pattern.  
 The de molition and construction phases of a development can have an impact on 
amenity and this is a particular issue for basements. Many basement schemes are 
constructed in residential areas in close proximity to people’s homes, with the 
construction works often  involving significant disturbance (including removing 
significant quantities of soil) extending for many months.   
272 
 
 Basement development must minimise construction impacts such as noise, vibration, 
and dust for the duration of the works. The Council  will see k to minimise the disruption 
caused by basement development and will require Construction Management Plans to 
be submitted with applications.  
 
A. Proposals for any new development – new build, extensions and conversions – in 
proximity to an existing use(s) which may be adversely impacted by the new use 
must follow the agent -of-change principle.  
B. Any potential adverse impacts which may arise due to new development being 
located close to sensitive uses must be fully prevented via the design/layout of a 
scheme and/or the incorporation of other appropriate measures to limit the impact.  
C. If adverse impacts cannot be fully prevented, then proposals will normally be 
refused, unless non -physical measures - such as a Deed  of Easement - are put in 
place which, in the Council ’s view, would ensure there is no residual threat to the 
future operation of the existing use.  
Noise and vibration  
D. All development proposals which have the potential to cause or exacerbate 
unacceptable noise and vibration impacts on land uses and occupiers in the locality 
must fully assess such impacts, with reference to relevant noise thresholds set out 
in Appendix 2 . All proposals must : 
(i) in the first instance, aim to prevent noise and vibration impacts occurring by 
siting uses which could cause or exacerbate impacts away from potentially 
affected uses; or, vice versa, siting sensitive uses away from uses which could 
cause noise and vibration impacts. An Acoustic Design Statement, in line with 
Appendix 2, must  be provided to demonstrate satisfactory solutions; or  
(ii) where this is not possible, provide a detailed assessment of noise and vibration 
impacts in line with Appendix 2. Where noise and/or vibration impacts  are 
identified suitable mitigation measures m ust be put in place to reduce these 
impacts , through the proposed layout (including the interaction of non -residential 
and residential uses in mixed use developments), design and materials. If 
impacts  cannot be mitigated, planning permission will be refuse d. 
E. A Noise Management Plan will be required where mitigation of noise from 
behavioural sources is necessary.  
 
 Proposals for new development in proximity to an existing use(s) which may be 
adversely impacted by the new use must follow the ‘agent -of-change’  principle , which 
requires the person or organisation responsible for change to manage  the impact of 
that change. Proximity is not specifically defined but would generally  be any di stance 
where vibration, noise (including airborne noise) and/or the operation of a use ( such as  
273 
 regular ingress/egress routes  and plant noise , or waste disposal ) could cause amenity 
impacts on a proposed use.  Proximity includes both external and internal impacts. 
Internal building impacts could be where conversi on of existing floorspace within a 
mixed use building may need to consider an existing noise generating use in another 
part of the building. This is to ensure that any potential adverse impacts which would 
arise due to being located in the vicinity of noise generating  use(s) are fully prevented 
via the design/layout of a scheme and/or the incorporation of appropriate measures to 
limit effects of noise, vibration and other adverse impacts.  
 Where impacts are identified, they must  be fully mitigated , for examp le through good 
acoustic design measures such as proposed layout /design of a scheme, and through 
use of appropriate and effective materials (for example, in walls and floors) which 
dampen noise and vibration between and within dwellings, and between dwell ings and 
public and/or communal areas. Layout in particular can be effective in mitigating 
impacts arising from mixed -use developments.  
 If the adverse impacts cannot be fully prevented, then proposals will normally be 
refused, unless non -physical measures  - such as a Deed of Easement - are put in 
place which, in the Council ’s view, would ensure there is no residual threat to the 
future operation of the cultural facilities(s).  
 Specific clusters of night -time economy uses may contribute more significantly to  the 
night -time economy, particularly within the night -time economy clusters identified in the 
London Plan and the Cultural Quarter s identified in policy R10 . Therefore,  the 
introduction of sensitive uses may threaten the effective operation of night -time uses 
more acutely in these areas. Considering the potential growth of cultural uses , 
particularly  in Cultural Quarter s, must  be considered when impacts are identified , in 
order to manage change in a sensitive way  that reflects the function of an area. Deta ils 
of how potential impacts could change or increase in future will be expected as part of 
relevant assessments, to ensure that future growth – for example in culture and night -
time economy uses - is not jeopardised.  
 Islington has a 24-hour economy which,  coupled with the densely developed nature of 
the borough can lead to adverse impacts from uses which otherwise can co -exist. For 
example, office uses which operate through the night can impact on nearby residential 
uses through light spill, mechanical pla nt operation and the operation of any ancillary 
functions such as bars or smoking terraces.  In addressing policy DH5, proposals must  
put in place measures to address potential impacts, such as limits on the scale and 
hours of use of any ancillary functions , or a building management plan with proposed 
measures such as automated lighting and blinds to limit impacts of light spill 
(especially on adjacent residential properties). Measures proposed to mitigate adverse 
impacts will be secured as part of any plann ing permission.  
 The impact of noise sensitive development in proximity to cultural, night -time economy 
and other uses is one of the biggest threats which these uses face, as the introduction 
of sensitive uses may threaten the effective operation of these e xisting uses. The 
Council  will require a Noise Impact Assessment and Acoustic Design Statement as 
part of all majo r residential developments; any other developments which give rise to 
potential noise and vibration impacts ; or any other application where agent -of-change 
is considered relevant.  
 Consideration and assessment of noise and vibration impacts  as part of policy DH5  
must be  commensurate to the existing level of noise generation and the level of 
sensitivity of the use being intr oduced ; for example,  a residential use proposed next to 
an industrial use is likely to have significant impacts on the continued operation of the  
274 
 industrial use, as the operation would often entail frequent vehicle movements and 
noisy processes; therefore, the consideration a nd assessment provided must fully 
demonstrate that all potential adverse impacts have been fully considered and 
mitigated. The Council  encourage applicants to involve  occupiers of sites which may 
be affected in any assessment of impacts .  
 Where significant  adverse impacts are identified as a result of the assessment , an 
application is likely to be refused. Other adverse effects must  be mitigated and 
minimised as far as po ssible. Any assessment must be produced by a relevant 
compet ent person(s);  further deta il is set out in Appendix 2. 
 Noise and vibration impacts can make dwellings uninhabitable. It  is therefore vitally  
important that noise and vibration impacts are robustly assessed for all planning 
applications involving residential use, at the earliest pos sible stage of the 
development. Noise is one factor which can affect amenity and amenity is an important 
consideration when determining the quality of housing. The design of housing is 
intrinsically linked to amenity; poor design often means a poor standar d of amenity for 
future occupiers. Amenity can be affected by various factors, either individual factors 
or a combination of factors, including noise, levels of daylight and sunlight and the 
general level of comfort.  
 Development must  use good acoustic des ign to achieve internal sound standards , 
rather than relying entirely on achieving relevant standards through the building 
envelope. The management of noise and vibration must  be an integral part of 
development proposals and considered as early as possible . Addressing noise and 
vibration issues through good acoustic design at the initial design stage is important to 
avoid costly late stage alterations and potential non -policy compliance. Good acoustic 
design must consider  the following : 
 Location of building s on the site to minimise noise exposure (this will include 
maximising separation of noise sources and sensitive receptors and use of 
buildings or topography to screen noise) ; 
 Layout of habitable rooms within buildings to reduce noise exposure to more nois e-
sensitive rooms ; 
 Ensuring dwellings exposed to high noise levels are dual aspect to provide each 
unit with access to a relatively quiet façade where possible ; 
 Access to relatively quiet external amenity space ; and  
 Measures to reduce noise at source and \or on the transmission path where 
possible . 
 Human response to vibration varies with the magnitude, the frequency and duration of 
exposure. Si gnificant vibration within the b orough (apart from temporary construction 
works) is most likely to be generated by r ailways, for example London U nderground 
services, Overground trains and freight movements. Appendix 2  identifies when a 
Vibration Assessment will be required.   
 In cases where ongoing noise management and control is considered particularly 
important, a noise management plan (detailing controls and mitigations) will be 
required.  
 Noise management measures can be crucial for mitigating behavioural noise sources , 
which can include noise from gathering points and ingress/egress points for 
commercial uses.  It is not always possible to specify sufficiently enforceable or precise 
noise management measures to form the basis of a reasonable plan ning condition. In 
such cases, refusal of permission may be necessary depending on the scale of the  
275 
 impacts . Where it is j udged that specific, precise, reasonable and enforceable noise 
management measures can be detailed, a  Noise Management Plan  will be secured by 
condition.  
 
A. Advertisements must:  
(i) be high quality in terms of visual appearance, and must  not have flashing 
internal or external illumination;  
(ii) be sited to prevent visual intrusion by virtue of light pollution into adjoining 
sensitive land uses, including residential properties and wildlife habitats;  
(iii) not restrict pedestrian movements;  
(iv) contr ibute to a safe and attractive environment ; 
(v) not contribute to proliferation/clutter of signage in the vicinity; and  
(vi) respect local context, including listed buildings and conservation areas.  
B. Temporary shroud advertisements which cover buildings being redeve loped or 
which are undergoing refurbishment may be acceptable where:  
(i) they are in place only for the duration of the building works, or a period of 12 
months (whichever is shorter);  
(ii) there have been no shroud advertisements on the specific building for the 
preceding 12 months; and  
(iii) the dimensions of the shroud advertisement are no greater than that of the 
building.  
C. The repurposing of phone boxes for predominantly advertising use will not be 
acceptable, particularly in conservation areas and in proximity to oth er heritage 
assets including listed buildings.  
D. The Council  will seek the removal of deemed consent rights for the display of estate 
agents’ boards where they are damaging the character and appearance of an area.  
 
 The term "advertisement" covers a very wide range of advertisements and signs, 
including hoardings, illumination of hoardings, illuminated fascia signs, free -standing 
display panels, and estate agent boards. Some advertisements are not regulated by 
the Council and others benefit from "deemed consent", which means permission is not 
needed; this will depend on the size, position and illumination of the advert. Other 
advertisements will always need consent.   
276 
 
 When deciding applications for advertisements , the Council  can have regard to 
considerations of amenity and public safety, as well as the Control of Advertisements 
Regulations. Policy DH6 sets the criteria by which amenity and public safety will be 
assessed in Islington in relation to advertisements.  
 The lu minance of advertisements/signs – particularly the maximum level of luminance 
proposed - must  accord with best practice and relevant guidance, such as I nstitute of 
Lighting Professionals  ‘Professional Lighting Guidance for the Brightness of 
Illuminated Adv ertisements (PLG05) ’, in order to avoid amenity impacts for residents 
living nearby. Conditions will be attached to ensure appropriate luminance levels are 
adhered to.  
 Temporary shroud advertisements may be acceptable on buildings being 
redeveloped/refurbi shed. This only relates to a shroud covering the building itself and 
not any separate hoarding or other structure used for advertising purposes.  
 Estate agents’ boards have deemed consent rights for their display and thus do not 
need approval from the Counc il to be displayed for a limited time period. The dense 
urban nature of Islington and the high frequency of sales and lettings can lead to a 
proliferation of estate agents’  boards, which are not always removed within the 
required timescale. This results in  a build -up of boards, both legal and illegal, 
detracting from building façades and causing an untidy and cluttered street scene. In 
such situations the Council  will seek the removal of deemed consent rights from the 
Secretary of State for this type of adv ertising.  
 
A. New or refurbished shopfront design must : 
(i) respect the local street scene, the building as a whole and its design detail;  
(ii) be accessible and inclusive; and  
(iii) enhance natural surveillance and activate the frontage  
B. Shops that are converted to residential uses (including through permitted 
development) must  retain the shopfront fenestration and natural surveillance of the 
street.  
 
 The design of new shopfronts and alterations to existing shopfronts is important to the 
appearance of the individual property, to the character and appearance of shopping 
areas, and provides visual connections between ground floor shops and the street.  
 New shopfronts must be inclusive , adopting the guidance provided in the Inclusive 
Design and Streetbook SPDs and  BS8300:2018 -2 in terms of the relationship between 
the shop front and the adjacent footway.   
277 
 
 The Islington Urban Design Guide  SPD provides further detail on shopfronts and will 
be used to assess proposals concerning shopfronts and shop signs. Sufficient 
information regarding shopfront  proposals  must  be provided at planning application 
stage to enable assessment of the proposal.  
 Where shops or other uses with an active frontage are converted to res idential use, 
the shopfront fenestration must  be retained, to avoid negative impacts  on the 
streetscene . 
 
A. Provision of high quality public art is encouraged as part of new development , 
where this does not constrain other higher prio rity Local Plan policies and 
objectives.   
B. All new public art must : 
(i) be developed in consultation with the community in which it is located;  
(ii) protect and enhance local character;  
(iii) ensure that it does not compromise the delivery of sustainability or inclusive 
design policy objectives;  
(iv) be site specific in terms of the design and concept;  
(v) be visible and able to be enjoyed from a publicly accessible location;  and 
(vi) require minimal maintenance and (where neces sary) decommissioning works.  
 
 Public art can add distinct ive character to places and spaces, creating visual interest, 
influencing the use of a space  and providing a focal or meeting point. Public art can 
take many forms from more traditional sculpture to an artwork conceived as a garden, 
the façade of a buildin g or a lighting installation.  
 However, provision of public art must  not come at the cost of meeting other more 
important Local Plan priorities that have a more meaningful impact on the day -to-day 
lives of local residents and businesses. Priority will be g auged on a case -by-case 
basis, but most other policies , particularly those  relating to affordable housing, 
affordable workspace, sustainability , green infrastructure  and inclusive design will, in 
all cases, be a higher priority than public art provision.  
 Where public art projects are proposed as part of a new development, guidance must  
be sought from the Council  at the earliest possible opportunity to ensure the highest 
quality art provision. This will include:  
 the extent that the proposed public art is fre ely accessible to the public;  
 the impact on the local area and its character;   
278 
  the quality of the artwork  
 the relationship between the proposed public art and the site;  
 the level of community consultation undertaken;  
 artist selection;  
 the provision of appropriate budgets and briefs for the project team; and  
 details of maintenance and any decommissioning works required, including 
availability of funding for such works.   
 The siting of public art must  not compromise the delivery of susta inability or inclusive 
design policy objectives , for example by obstructing the public realm, affecting the 
legibility of routes or affecting sustainability measures such as SUDS.  
  
279 
 9 Strategic infrastructure  
A. The Council  will identify and deliver the infrastructure required to support 
development growth over the plan period and enable effective delivery of the Local 
Plan objectives,  through:  
(i) utilising an Infrastructure Delivery Plan and working with relevant providers to 
ensure necessary infrastructure is provided ; and  
(ii) requiring contributions from development to ensure that the infrastructure needs 
associated with development will be provided for, and to mitigate the impact of 
development.  
B. The Council  will utilise its planning function to  put in place measures to develop the 
Smart Cities approach in Islington, by:  
(i) working with infrastructure providers to ensure world -class connectivity and 
ensuring developers provide in -building  infrastructure capable of significantly 
exceeding minimum building control standards ; 
(ii) considering use and interoperability of data, and digital innovation as part of the 
planning application process ; and  
(iii) considering how the Council  can promote use of tech nology to help people to 
live better lives.  
 Infrastructure needs  and requirements change over time in response to the 
development and growth of Islington  as well  as changing objectives and priorities for 
both the Council  and its partners . Key public sect or partners include police, health 
service, and local universities.  
 Infrastructure60 includes the roads61, transport, public utilities, buildings or facilities and 
the services provided by them which are used both by residents and those who come 
to work, study in, or visit the borough. The  Local Plan is informed by the  Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan  (updated 2019)  which provides a benchmark of infrastructure and future 
infrastructure requirements.  
                                                
60 Social and community infrastructure and green infrastructure are  forms of infrastructure which fall 
within this term, but they are  covered by other Local Plan policies.  
61 Relevant road infrastructure includes roads within Islington and also those  roads outside of the 
borough which may be affected by development in Islington. This includes the strategic road network 
(SRN) managed by Highways England, particularly the M1 which lies to the north -west of the 
borough.   
280 
 
 Utilities providers will be consulted with regards to releva nt infrastructure and 
maintaining security of supply.  
 Infrastructure requirements may be funded through both planning obligations and the 
CIL. Planning obligations are specific requirements to be fulfilled by developers to 
ensure that impacts arising from  a new development are addressed. Planning 
obligations may be contained in a S106 agreement or in a unilateral undertaking. 
Planning obligations are always drawn up and negotiated based on the characteristics 
of the individual site and development proposed . Obligations can include either direct 
provision of a service or facility, contributions towards a provision made by the Council , 
or both. Further guidance on where planning obligations will be required is set out in 
the Planning Obligations (Section 106)  SPD.  
 The CIL is a non -negotiable charge used to fund local infrastructure that will support 
future development. CIL is charged on  new developments involving the creation of one 
or more new dwellings, or 100 sqm or more of new gross internal floorspace. Th e 
Islington CIL Charging Schedule was adopted in September 2014 and finances both 
strategic and local infrastructure projects in the borough. The Islington CIL is used to 
fund the provision, improvement or replacement of community infrastructure that 
suppo rts the development of the borough. The Mayor of London can also introduce a 
CIL charge. The Mayor adopted the second mayoral CIL charge (MCIL2)  in February 
2019. MCIL2 will be used to fund Crossrail 1 (the Elizabeth Line) and Crossrail 2.  
 In most cases, the Islington CIL has replaced the use of planning obligations to secure 
contributions towards infrastructure from development. S106 agreements are used to 
secure affordable housing; to mitigate site -specific issues; and/or to address other 
policy requirements that cannot be dealt with through CIL. The Council  maintains a 
‘Regulation 123’ Infrastructure List, which sets out the items and types of infrastructure 
that may be fully or partially funded by CIL. Infrastructure included in the list cannot be 
funded through a S106 agreement.  
 Smart Cities goes beyond the role of planning. The rapid growth of mobile internet 
applications, the internet -of-things, cloud computing and open data are all part of this 
digital age and whilst they offer new bu siness opportunities, they must  also enhance 
quality of life for people living and working in Islington. Digital connectivity can also 
help the collection, analysis and sharing of data on the performance of the built and 
natural environment, including for example water and energy consumption, air quality, 
noise and congestion. Enabling the development of Smart Cities has the potential to 
greatly improve the implementation of key Local Plan objectives, such as monitoring 
the energy efficiency performance of buildings.  
 Planning can assist with the development of Smart Cities, particularly through the 
development of necessary infrastructure to allow for the future development/expansion 
of Smart Cities. This could include encouraging smart sensors which help to  monitor 
the performance of buildings as part of the planning consent; and enabling the 
expansion of key technological networks such as 5G and superfast broadband, which 
often require infrastructure/assets on buildings and within the public realm. Use of d ata 
and interoperability of data can better support building management, management of 
space including public realm to benefit residents and people who work in the borough, 
for example through the implementation of BIM.  
 Ensuring world class connectivity i n new development will help residents and 
businesses take advantage of digital opportunities. The standards set out in Building 
Regulations part R1 are unlikely to be sufficient to allow the advancement of Smart 
Cities. Therefore, higher standards must  be provided  where appropriate/feasible. The  
281 
 Council  may provide further supplementary guidance to help implement the Smart 
Cities approach, where necessary.  
A. Development proposals must  provide waste and recycling facilities which:  
(i) fit curre nt and future collection practices and targets;  
(ii) are accessible to all;  
(iii) are designed to provide convenient access for all people, helping to support 
people to recycle; and  
(iv) provide high quality storage and collection systems in line with Council  
guidance.  
B. The Council  will continue to work with the seven North London boroughs on the 
North London Waste Plan to provide sufficient land to meet waste management 
needs across the seven North London boroughs. The policies in the North London 
Waste Plan will be used to consider proposals for waste management facilities 
across the seven North London boroughs.  
C. The Hornsey Street Re -use and Recycling Centre will be safeguarded in order for 
Islington to continue to contribute to meeting aggregated waste planning 
requireme nts. Where development is proposed within close proximity to this facility, 
it must  ensure that the ability of the Hornsey Street facility to operate effectively is 
not threatened, via the design/layout of a scheme and/or the incorporation of 
appropriate m easures to limit effects of sound, vehicle movements and other 
effects, in line with the ‘agent -of-change’ principle.  
 Sustainable waste management means dealing with more waste higher up the waste 
hierarchy to reduce waste creation , increase  re-use and recycling and utilise  waste as 
an energy source.  A key part of this is ensuring that residents and businesses have 
sufficiently convenient facilities and storage to maximise re -use and recycling.  Further 
details on how development proposals are expected to consider this are set out in 
policies H4 and B2. The Council  promote s a circular economy approach to design and 
construction to keep products and materials in use for as long as possible and to 
minimise construction waste. Further detail is set out in policy  S10. 
 The seven North London Boroughs of Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, 
Islington and Waltham Forest (the Boroughs) are working together to produce the 
North London Waste Plan. Once adopted, it will form part of the statutory Development 
Plan for these areas. The purpose of the NLWP is to provide sufficient land for the 
sustainable development of waste facilities that are of the right type, in the right place 
and provided at the rig ht time to enable the North London Boroughs to meet their 
waste management needs throughout the plan period. The plan will also provide 
policies against which planning applications for waste development will be assessed, 
alongside other relevant planning p olicies/guidance.   
282 
  
A. Telecommunications, communications and utilities equipment, including masts, 
boxes  and satellite dishes will only be permitted where:  
(i) they are sited and designed to minimise their visual impact;  
(ii) they do not include advertising o r lighting that would cause a dis traction/danger 
to motorists, cyclists or pedestrians ; 
(iii) they do not have a detrimental effect upon the character or appearance of the 
building or area;  
(iv) they do n ot compromise meeting other policy requirements including the delivery 
of sustainable design measures;  
(v) innovative design and technological solutions have been explored to minimise 
visual  impact, and  
(vi) there is no reasonable possibility of sharing facilities.  
B. All digital infrastructure must provide self -certification to the effect that a mobile 
phone base station , when operational , will meet the International Commission on 
Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNRP) guidelines.  
C. Applications for mobile phone network development must demonstrate that they 
have followed and are in accordance with the Code of Best Practice on Mobile 
Network Development in England or subsequent similar guidance.  
 
 In general, it is not acceptable to l ocate satellite dishes and other telecommunications 
and utilities equipment on the front of buildings and other locations where they are 
visible from the public realm. On -street location of telecommunications boxes and 
other utilities equipment should be avoided . Where this is not  possible , equipment 
must be designed and located to prevent  street clutter and conflict with pedestrian 
movement and street furniture.  
 The operation of equipment must  not lead to any adverse impacts for residents or 
businesses, f or example, noise arising from the running of equipment. Policy DH5 will 
apply to relevant applications for new t elecommunications, communications and 
utilities equipment . 
  
283 
 A. Adequate water and wastewater infrastructure must be provided to serve all new 
developments. Applicants are encouraged to  engage with relevant 
water/wastewater companies at the earliest possible opportunity, ideally at pre -
application stage, to establish  any potential water and wastewater network 
reinforcement requirements.  
B. Planning permission will only be granted for developments which increase the 
demand for off -site service infrastructure where:  
(i) sufficient capacity already exists; or  
(ii) extra capacity can b e provided in time to serve the development which will 
ensure that the environment and the amenities of local residents are not 
adversely affected.  
C. When there is a capacity constraint and improvements in off -site infrastructure are 
not programmed, planning  permission will only be granted where the developer 
funds the appropriate improvements to cater for the development. Any 
improvements must be completed prior to occupation of the relevant phase of 
development ; this will be secured by planning condition . 
 
 The Council  will seek to ensure that there is adequate water supply, surface water, 
foul drainage and sewerage treatment capacity to serve all new developments. 
Developers are required to demonstrate that there is adequate capacity both on and 
off the sit e to serve the development and that the development would not lead to 
problems for existing users  and the impact the development may have off site further 
down the network, if no/low water pressure and internal/external sewage flooding of 
property is to be  avoided.  
 Applicants are encouraged to engage with relevant water/wastewater companies at 
the earliest possible opportunity, ideally at pre -application stage, to establish any 
potential water and wastewater network reinforcement requirements.  For example, 
Thames Water offer a free pre -planning service  which can enable developers to 
determine at an early stage whether there  will be sufficient water and/or wastewater 
network capacity  to serve their development . This service can also advise on 
appropriate solu tions if there is not sufficient capacity.  
 In some circumstances it may be  necessary for developers to carry out appropriate 
studies to ascertain whether the proposed development will lead to overloading of 
existing infrastructure. Where th ere is a capacity constraint and no improvements are 
programmed by the water company, it would be expected that the developer pays a 
fair and reasonable contribution towards the appropriate infrastructure. The 
infrastructure must be completed prior to occu pation of the development. 
284 
 10 Monitoring  
 Monitoring of Local Plan policies is essential to determine the extent to which those 
policies are delivering the Local Plan vision and objectives.  
 The Authorities Monitoring Report (AMR) is the principal mechanism for monitoring the 
Local Plan. The AMR will report at least annually on a broad range of quantitative and 
qualitative indicators to enable a full assessment of how successfully the Local Pl an is 
being implemented.   
 The AMR indicators are not fixed and may change over different iterations of the AMR. 
However, each AMR will include baseline quantitative indicators to identify  completions 
across various use classes . This completion data will be  assessed spatially with 
reference to relevant Local Plan policies and designations , including the Spatial 
Strategy areas ; this could include development located within or in proximity to a 
specific designation.  
 Further qualitative indicators will be set o ut where necessary ; this may include 
indicators to monitor trends at a local, regional and/or national level which have the 
potential to impact on the delivery of the Local Plan . 
 The AMR will set out the up -to-date housing trajectory which identifies past housing 
completion figure s and sets out Islington’s five -year housing supply. The AMR will also 
set out an up -to-date pipeline for business floorspace, particularly offices.  
 The C ouncil are required to review the Local Plan every five years from the date of 
adoption, to determine whether the Local Plan needs to be updated, e.g. in light of 
changing circumstances. The AMR will be a key consideration as part of any Local 
Plan review.  Data and trends identified in the AMR may (individually or combined with 
other considerations) trigger a need for a partial or full update to the Local Plan.  
 In line with the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 
2012 (as amende d), the AMR will also provide information on neighbourhood planning, 
what acts of co -operation  and engagement  have been carried out under the Duty to 
Co-operate, and CIL receipts and expenditure.

 11 Appendices  
1. Where policies require marketing information to be submitted, the following details will be 
used to assess the acceptability, or otherwise, of the information submitted and any 
marketing undertaken.  
 
2. Marketing evidence requires demonstration o f an active marketing campaign for a 
continuous period, whilst the premises were vacant, which has shown to be 
unsuccessful.  
 
3. The minimum period of vacancy/marketing is identified within relevant policies. It must be 
shown to the Council 's satisfaction th at marketing has been unsuccessful for all relevant 
floorspace . 
 
4. A detailed marketing report must  be submitted to the Council  and must  include 
appropriate evidence of all of the following. Examples of the type of evidence that could 
be used to demonstrate that each criterion has been met is also set out below. The 
examples provided are not an exhaustive list.  
 
a) Registration of the proper ty with at least one reputable local or national commercial 
property agent - this could be evidenced through submission of appropriate 
correspondence from the property agent setting out marketing has commenced /is 
underway.  
b) The length of marketing  and vaca ncy period s, including dates . Marketing  must  be 
continuous and from the point when the advertisement board was erected or the 
online ad was posted (not from the point at which the property agent was appointed). 
The length of the vacancy period must  be clea rly evidenced e.g. through the 
submission of correspondence from the property agent.  
c) Erection of an advertising b oard in a prominent location on -site (subject to advertising 
consent, if required) for the duration of the marketing period – this could be 
evidenced with photographs of the board in place . 
d) Publication of property details /particulars online on popular commercial property 
letting /selling websites – this could be evidenced with screenshots of the webpages 
of where the space is advertised.   
e) Advertisements must  include the following basic information: location, size, site 
description, lawful land use, property type, specification and costs (including rent and 
service charges) – this could be evidenced through providing the marketing 
particular s. 
f) Property details /particulars available to inquirers on request – this could be 
evidenced through particulars and advertising board setting out contact details.  
g) Property marketed for the appropriate use or uses as defined by the relevant 
planning policy  – this could be evidenced through marketing particulars and 
advertisement board setting out appropriate uses.  
h) Property marketed at a reasonable price that genuinely reflects the market value, 
including in relation to appropriate use or uses, condition, q uality and location of 
floorspace, including independent professional valuation from at least three agents to  
286 
 confirm the price is reasonable – this could be evidenced with statements from 
independent property agents /valuers . Where existing floorspace is i n poor condition, 
marketing should include options for both renting the floorspace as is (i.e. the 
occupier takes responsibility for any refurbishment) and in a refurbished state. The 
rental values sought for un-refurbished or refurbished  floorspace must b e aligned 
with comparable values for similar quality properties in the area.  Any submitted 
marketing at values which are not comparable to similar properties in the area will not 
be counted toward the continuous marketing requirement.  
i) Detailed commentary o n any enquiries received. The number of enquiries must  be 
set out. Information on who the enquiry was from i.e. the name and type of 
business /organisation, and the type of space /use they required must  be provided. 
Details on outcome of any enquiry and in p articular why any enquiry was not 
successful must  also be set out – this could be evidenced within a table and /or email 
correspondence from enquirers.  
j) Detailed commentary on any viewings undertaken, setting out the number viewings 
undertaken, who viewed t he space i.e. the name and type of business /organisation, 
reasons why those viewing the space did not wish to make an offer - this could be 
evidenced within a table and /or email correspondence from enquirers.  
k) Detailed commentary on the number, type, and value of offers received. Information 
on who made the offer, i.e. the name and type of business /organisation, and the type 
of space /use they required must  be provided. Where offers were received but not 
accepted, reasons for refusal must  be provided - this could be evidenced within a 
table and /or email correspondence from enquirers.  
  
287 
 1. The significance of noise impact varies dependent on the different noise sources, 
receptors and times of operation presented fo r consideration within a planning 
application. Therefore, Islington’s thresholds for noise and vibration evaluate noise 
impact in terms of various ‘effect levels’ as commonly used within dose/response 
relationships and referred to in the National Planning Policy Framework and Planning 
Practice Guidance:  
 
• NOEL : No Observed Effect Level  - This is the level below which no effect can be 
detected. In simple terms, below this level, there is no detectable effect on health and 
quality of life due to the noise.  
• LOA EL: Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level  - This is the level above which 
adverse effects on health and quality of life can be detected.  
• SOAEL : Significant Observed Adverse Effect Level  - This is the level above which 
significant adverse effects on health a nd quality of life occur.  
 
2. Three basic design criteria have been set for proposed developments, these being 
aimed at guiding applicants as to the degree of detailed consideration needed to be 
given to noise in any planning application. The design criteria outlined below are defined 
in the corresponding noise tables. The values will vary depending on the context, type of 
noise and sensitivity of the receptor:  
 
• Green  – where noise is considered to be at an acceptable level.  
• Amber  – where noise is observed to have an adverse effect level, but which may be 
considered acceptable when assessed in the context of other merits of the 
development.  
• Red – where noise is observed to have a significant adverse effect.  
 
3. Special consideration will need to be given to noise sensitive developments that are 
proposed in areas which are, or expected to become, subject to levels of noise likely to 
have an adverse effect , in line with the agent -of-change principle . 
 
4. A noise assessment must  be carried out and must  cover a period suf ficient to be 
representative of the prevailing noise climate. In most cases this will require assessment 
covering midweek and weekends. The threshold of acceptability of the noise will 
primarily depend on two factors: the intended use of the noise sensitiv e development 
and the source of the noise experienced, or likely to be experienced.  
 
Assessment /Statement Information requirements  
 
5. The Acoustic Design Statement must  include details of proposed impact s and proposed 
mitigation through acoustic design. Full details on building construction and composite 
façade calculations to predict the internal noise level in habitable rooms  must  be 
included . The Acoustics Ventilation and Overheating Guide (AVO Guide) p roduced by 
the Association of Noise Consultants must  be followed. When designing ventilation to 
mitigate noise, due consideration must be given to the impact of local air quality.  
  
288 
 6. Use of  good acoustic design to achieve internal sound standards is prefer able to sole 
reliance on the building  envelope . The following must  be demonstrated:  
 
• Location of buildings on the site to minimise noise exposure (this will include 
maximising separation of noise sources and sensitive receptors and use of buildings 
or topogr aphy to screen noise)  
• Layout of habitable rooms within buildings to reduce noise expose to more noise -
sensitive room s 
• Ensuring dwellings exposed to high noise levels are dual aspect to provide each unit 
with access to a relatively quiet façade when possibl e 
• Measures to reduce noise at source and \or on the transmission path where possible  
 
7. The layout of adjacent dwellings and the location of  plant equipment,  lifts and circulation 
spaces is required to limit the transmission of sound to noise sensitive rooms within 
dwellings. Applications which cannot demonstrate effective mitigation for all proposed 
residential units will be refused. Residential conversions in particular can commonly lead 
to adverse amenity impacts including from noise and vibration; proactiv e consideration of 
layouts and other issues can help mit igate or prevent these impacts.  
 
8. All Noise Impact Assessments and Acoustic Design Statements must  be carried out by a 
relevant competent person. Most suitably qualified consultants will be full Members of 
the Institute of Acoustics and/or the Association of Noise Consultants in addition to 
holding relevant technical qualifications such as a Degree and /or Post Graduate Diploma 
in Acoustics or related engineering fields. Noise assessments must clearly state the level 
of uncertainty attached to their conclusions.  
 
9. Noise management plans may be required for mitigating behavioural noise sources.  
 
Noise standards for r esidential use  
 
10. This section sets out specific criteria and guidance residential development. Where day 
and night periods are referenced, d ay periods are defined as 0700 -2300 , and  night 
periods are defined as 2300 -0700.  
 
11. Table A2.1 below se ts out effect level values for proposed residential developments 
affected by transportation noise:

hour 
Note: Day periods are defined as 0700 -2300; night periods are defined as 2300 -0700.  
 
12. For all new residential developments, the followi ng internal design targets should  be 
achieved:  
 
Table A2.2: internal design targets for sound insulation  in dwellings  
Room type  Noise level  
Bedrooms  35dBA L Aeq 16 hour†, 30 dBA L Aeq 8 hour*, 45dBA L AFmax* 
Living rooms  35dBA L Aeq 16 hour† 
Dining rooms  40dBA L Aeq 16 hour† 
* - Night -time between 23:00 -07:00; † - Daytime between 07:00 -23:00.  
 
13. The 10th highest individual LAFmax  event in any night should  be determined and the 
noise level from this event will  be used to inform the above mitigation design target.  
 
14. Where there is any concern over the efficacy of measures submitted to comply with 
these standards, post-completion verification testing will be required in a sample of the 
most affected rooms. Where it is unavoidable to rely on closed windows to achieve the 
above internal design targets there must be a suitable alternative means of ventilation 
provided which is sufficient to ventilate the premises and to adequately control excess 
heat in the summer months . Any alternative means must be consistent with policy S6 .   
290 
 Industrial and Commercial Noise Sources  
 
15. For industrial and commercial deve lopment,  it is necessary to submit a noise 
assessment for any development which could result in a change in noise impact on any 
sensitive receptor . A sensitive receptor is any receptor that may be adversely impacted 
by noise , typically residential dwelling s, schools, hospitals , etc. New development can 
involve installing new noise -generating plant, new work processes or equipment or 
making changes to buildings or structures that affect sound transmission. When a 
sensitive receptor is proposed near to an existing commercial noise source  this will also 
require a noise assessment in line with the agent-of-change principle.  
 
16. To assess industri al and commercial noise sources, BS 4142:2014 ‘Methods for rating 
and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ must  be used. The following criteria will  
apply:  
 
“The design and installation of new items of fixed plant shall be such that when operating 
the cumulative noise level L Aeq Tr arising from the proposed plant, measured or predicted 
at 1m from the facade of the nearest noise sensitive premises, shall be a rating level of 
at least 5dB(A) below the background noise level L AF90  Tbg. The measurement and/or 
prediction of the noise sho uld be carried out in accordance with the methodology 
contained within BS4142: 2014.”  
 
17. Where i nstallations of mechanical plant are proposed, a noise  assessment with valid 
predictions must  submitted as part of the application. The background sound level will  be 
defined as the typical minimum value. Any as sessment should  include a valid 
assessment of the acoustic features. Where data is not available for plant, site 
measurement to verify this will  be required. As per BS4142 :2014 , any assumptions made 
for chara cter will need to be justified and may need further analysis to validation. It is 
advised that a post installation verification report is carried out, with noise measurements 
of the plant, to demonstrate compliance with the design criterion.  
 
18. The Council  will take into account the hours of operation of the plant where this is set 
and controlled by timer switch. There are certain smaller pieces of equipment on 
commercial premises, such as extract ventilation, air conditioning units and condensers, 
where ac hievement of the rating levels (ordinarily determined by a BS4142 :2014  
assessment) may not afford the necessary protection. In these cases, the Council  will 
generally also require a NR curve specification of NR25 or below, dependant on the 
room (based upon  measured or predicted L eq,5mins noise levels in octave bands) 1 
metre from the façade of affected premises, where the noise sensitive premise is located 
in a quiet background area.  
 
19. Standby and emergency plant noise is a growing noise issue with the Borou gh. With 
emergency or standby plant, the same criteria will  apply . 
 
Cultural Uses and the Night -time economy  
 
20. Assessments for noise from proposed new or intensified cultural and/or night -time 
economy uses  must include consideration to amplified and unamplified music, human 
voices, footfall and vehicle movements and other general activity. The criteria in T able 
A2.3 must  be used  to measure and assess the noise impact including L Aeq and L AFmax  
metrics and ap propriate frequencies. Where it is not possible to achieve suitable and 
sufficient internal noise levels for proposed noise sensitive receptors despite appropriate 
mitigation proposals , due to the totality of noise from existing entertainment venues , then  
291 
 planning permission will not be granted . When a sensitive receptor is proposed near to 
an existing commercial noise source  this will also require a noise assessment in line with 
the agent-of-change principle.  
 
Table A2.3: Noise limits for entertainment noi se

LCeq,5min  EN minus L Ceq,5min  or L C90,5min  WEN = -10 to 0 dBC  
EN = Representative, or predicted, entertainment noise level  
WEN = Representative noise level without the entertainment noise, measured or predicted 1 m from the 
facade of noise -sensitive premises.  
 
21. Internal measurements must  be undertaken at a representative position and where 
necessary be the same for both the EN and WEN assessments. The height of the 
measuring microphone must  be between 1.2 to 1.5 m above the floor and 1 m away from 
any sound reflecting or absorbing sur faces.  
 
Sound insulation and mixed use buildings  
 
22. Any development which includes residential floorspa ce adjacent to non -residential  uses  
must  submit an assessment of the internal sound transfer , including  for any development 
which may increase noise impacts in existing multi -use buildings. Some examples of 
where an assessment would be required are:  
 
• a new development incorporating an A4 bar on the ground floor and residential flats 
above ; 
• conversion of an existing ground floor A1 shop to an A3 restaurant where there is an 
existing residential flat above ; or 
• conversion of an office sharing a party wall with a light industrial use into a residential 
dwelling  
 
23. In some cases, an airborne sound insulation standa rd will be specified rather than 
requiring compliance with a noise rating criterion.  
 
24. Party walls, floors and ceilings between the non -residential premises  and residential 
floorspace should  be designed to achieve the following minimum airborne sound 
insulation weighted standardised level difference:  
 
• For A4 premises, D1 \D2 premises such as places of worship, concert halls, 
community space for hire or B2 \B8 industrial premises, standards will be judged on a 
case by case basis depending on the exact nature o f the use. Greater than 60dB 
DnT,w + Ctr is likely to be necessary  
• For A3 or A5 premises or large A1 cafes, shops and supermarkets: At least 55dB 
DnT,w + Ctr   
292 
 • For small A1 cafés or shops: At least 50dB DnT,w + Ctr  
 
25. Where non -residential uses are placed abov e residential floorspace there are likely to be 
impact noise issues. An impact sound insulation limit will be specified. These will be 
determined on a case by case basis and in such cases specialist advice and assessment 
will be necessary.  
 
Vibration  
 
26. A vibration assessment will generally be required where railways, either surface or 
underground, are within 30m of a proposed development site. The need for a vibration 
assessment at other sites will be assessed on a case by case basis. T able A2.4  notes 
vibration levels from uses such as railways, roads, leisure and entertainment premises 
and/or plant or machinery at which planning permission will not normally be granted. 
Values are derived from BS6472 -1-2008 and are only a SOAEL (red) value - 
developments  must  be designed to minimise the effect of vibration wherever possible.  
 
Table A2.4 : unacceptable vibration levels for specific uses  
Vibration description and location

27. Ground borne  noise, as a result of vibration from adjacent rail ways and other sources, 
should  not exceed 35 dB L ASmax  within habitable residential rooms. Where it is 
predicted that noise from this source will exceed 35dB LASmax, proposals to mitigate re -
radiated noise to acceptable levels must  be submitted to and approved in writing by the 
LPA. However, due to the high c ost of mitigating vibration effects, this must  be subject to 
early discussion with the Council.  
. 
293 
 1. Developments which meet the thresholds set out in Table A3.1 will be required to 
produce a Transport Assessment and a Full Travel Plan.  
Table A3.1: Thresholds for Transport Assessments and Full Travel Plans

Care guidance.  
 
2. All major developments that fall below the thresholds in the table above will be required 
to produce a Transport Statement and a Local Level Travel Plan.  
 
3. The Council  may still require that a Transport Assessment and a Full Travel Plan 
accompany applications for new developments that do not meet these thresholds, where 
a transport impact is expected from the developm ent, or a cumulative impact is expected 
from different uses within a development or from a number of developments in the 
vicinity. Worst case scenarios in terms of t ransport impacts (for example, peak hours) 
must  be demonstrated in the relevant document . 
Transport Assessments /Transport Statements  
 
4. Transport Assessments are required to assess the impact of proposals on all relevant  
transport infrastructure, including the capacity of roads, public transport and walking and 
cycling infrastructure, and to detai l action to manage this impact. They are required to  
294 
 present qualitative and quantitative information about the anticipated transport and 
related environmental impacts before, during and after implementation of the proposed 
development, including details o f the accessibility of the site by all transport modes and 
all users, including disabled people, and the likely modal split of journeys to and from the 
site. 
 
5. Where the Council  does not consider the preparation of a full Transport Assessment 
necessary, a l ess detailed assessment in the form of a Transport Statement will be 
required.  
 
6. Developers are required to demonstrate that the Transport Assessment /Transport 
Statement has informed the  final design of the proposed development and the Full 
Travel Plan /Local Level Travel Plan. Development proposals must  meet the identified 
needs and address anticipated impacts of the development through the design of the 
scheme, effective management, including through the Travel Plan and mitigating any 
impacts of the sch eme (including through planning obligations where appropriate ). 
 
7. Up-to-date TfL online guidance62 must  be used to determine  what is required in a 
Transport Assessment .  
 
Full Travel Plans /Local Level Travel Plans  
 
8. Full Travel Plans /Local Level Travel Plans are the key management tool for 
implementing any transport solutions highlighted by the Transport 
Assessment /Statement, and are one of the primary tools for mitigating negative transport 
impacts of development proposals. Full Travel Plans/ Local Level Trav el Plans are 
required to detail the developer's response to the Transport Assessment /Statement and 
deliver sustainable transport objectives with a package of measures to promote 
sustainable transport, including measures to achieve a shift to the most susta inable 
forms of transport: walking and cycling.  
 
9. The Full Travel Plan /Local Level Travel Plan is required to set out the on -going 
management arrangements for the development, which should  normally include the 
appointment of a Travel Plan co -ordinator and a  steering group, management company 
or community trust. A monitoring schedule and outline of the approach to monitoring is 
required within a Full Travel Plan; a monitoring period of at least 5 years will apply. 
Enforcement actions are required to be agreed  prior to any grant of planning permission, 
to plan for any unimplemented or failed measures.  
 
10. Where a Full Travel Plan is required, the documents set out in Table A3.2 must  be 
submitted during  the planning application process:

11. The Council  will require  travel plans to be carried out in compliance with  relevant 
guidance , including guidance produced by TfL . All full travel plans must use TRICS 
compliant monitoring surveys. All other travel plans and travel plan statements must  
have iTRACE compliant survey s63 Travel plans must  reflect policy  T1 Part B by 
prioritising  sustainable transport modes, namely walkin g, cycling and public transport.   
 
12. For Local Level Travel Plans, a template will be required to be submitted alongside an 
application. This template must use the following headings:  
 
 Context : general information on development, e.g. use, size, location and general 
timescales for development;  
 Policy : specific focus on identifying Islington’s transport targets and other relevant 
targets;  
 Site Assessments : general overview as to what facilities are present;  
 Travel Survey /Trip Generation : mode split based on trip generation software, 
census or other relevant and robust prediction methods;  
 Objectives : based on comparisons between policy and trip generation, de velopment 
objectives and targets;  
 Targets : as per objectives;  
 Travel Plan Management : a main point of contact for a development with regards to 
Travel Plan issues;  and 
 Measures : design; post -occupation measures, action plan, securing and enforcing 
the plan, monitoring.  
 
13. This list is not exhaustive, and the Council  may require further information depending on 
the circumstances  of the development.

 1. Policy T2 states that all new developments must provide  cycle parking , and associated 
circulation space for  ease of use of cycle parking,  in accordance with the minimum 
standards and guidance  set out in this Appendix.  Table A4.1 below sets out the minimum 
long-stay (i.e. for residents or employees) and short -stay (i.e. for visitors and customers) 
cycle parking standards for different types of development which must be provided ; this 
does not include provision of circulation space, which is discussed in paragraph 9 below.  
Resident/staff parking must b e provided on -site. 
 
2. The minimum floorspace requirement provide s the opportunity for innovation and 
flexibility in the design of cycle parking facilities , with the aim to encourage increased use 
of cycle storage through improvements to overall quality and usability of cycle storage.  
This is in contrast to standards which prescribe a specified number of spaces, which can 
lead to prioritisation of quantity over quality, and result in wasted, underused cycle 
parking facilities.

 Applying the minimum long -stay cycle parking standards  
3. The first stage in applying the standards in Table A4.1 is to calculate the number of 
spaces required by the London Plan; these requirements  are repeated in the table for 
ease of reference. 20% accessible cycle parking spaces  must be provided , of which 25% 
must be designated for non -standard cycles and 75% for ambulant disabled cyclists 
using regular cycle  
 
4. When the req uired number of spaces is established, the spatial equivalent o f the spaces 
must be calculated . Each parking space for standard cycles requires 1sqm of space. 
Non-standard and accessible spaces each require 2sqm of space.  
 
5. There is a range of cycle parking  provision which can be provided; however, the Council  
will prioritise cycle parking that is  practically useful for the majority of people , which is 
secure and allows  conven ient ease of access and avoids the risk  of pers onal injury when 
manoeuvring a  bicyc le; Sheffield stands in particular are supported . The needs of all 
users must  be considered  when determining the type of cycle parking; i t is noted that 
some types of cycle storage equipment (such as vertical racks) can deter or exclude 
potential users, wh ile others can be positioned so as to undermine ease of access.  
Applicants must  have regard to relevant evidence, guidance and/or best practice , 
particularly any documents produced by the Council , when determining the type of cycle 
storage intended to be p rovided.  
 
6. In development proposals involving refurbishment/retrofitting of existing buildings, where 
there is no significant element of redevelopment or additional floorspace, there may be 
circumstances where the full spatial requirement is not practical t o deliver, for example 
due to constraints of the existing building layout and access. In these exceptional 
circumstances, the total spatial requirement for cycle parking must  be maximised, 
informed by Table A4.1  and taking into account demonstrable site -specific design 
constraints. Any identified  space  must  prioritise accessible parking  in the first instance , 
mindful of the requirements of the Local Plan to promote and incentivise cycling for a 
range of users . Where a policy compliant level of accessible parking and circulation 
space can be provided (based on the f ull spatial requirement as per T able A4.1  and the 
further guidance on provision of circulation space in this Appendix ), but the total space 
for cycle parkin g (including standard parking) remains below the minimum level which 
would normally have been required, any remaining proposed space must  maximise the 
number of parking spaces ; maximisation could include the use of racks which take up 
less space  which may otherwise have been a lesser priority . This approach ensures that 
on constrained sites where the full requirement cannot be provided, there is a balance 
between quality and quantity  of spaces.  
 
7. Where development proposals provide a policy compliant level o f cycle parking (in total 
and across specific types, e.g. accessible) , and also provide additional cycle parking in 
excess of this policy compliant level, there is no prescriptive requirement to provide 
certain types of cycle parking or storage  for the amo unt of cycle parking provided in 
excess of the policy compliant level ; however, the Council  would encourage provision of 
additional accessible spaces  as part of this excess amount. Any  excess c ycle parking 
must not affect  cycle parking provided to meet the  requirements of  policy T2, particularly 
in terms of access to this cycle parking and impacts on use of its circulation space. 
Applicants must also be mindful of other Local Plan priorities in terms of optimising sites 
to meet development needs, and whethe r provision of additional cycle parking would 
constitute the best use of a site.  
 
8. Where accessible cycle parking spaces are provided, their use must  be safeguarded for 
accessible cycles. All accessible cycle parking spaces must  be clearly marked and  
299 
 reserv ed for the priority use of disabled cyclists. Clear and appropriate contact detail 
signage must  be provided for the manager of the facility so cycle users are able to raise 
queries  regarding the use of accessible spaces . As part of the travel plan, applica nts are 
expected to set out how use of accessible spaces will be managed to ensure priority use 
for accessible cycles.  
Circulation space  
9. In addition to the space required for parked cycles  set out in Table A4.1 , applicants must  
demonstrate that there is su fficient circulation space to allow people using the standard, 
non-standard and accessible cycle parking spaces to easily use and access the facilities. 
Circulation space must enable ease of movement and manoeuvring for all users  and 
types of cycle , so tha t they can ent er the facility, reverse  and navigate as required. The 
amount of circulation space required  will be determined on a case -by-case basis, 
although in principle it must  be a quantum which facilitates the delivery of high quality 
cycle parking wh ich is easy to use for all cyclists. In arriving at an appropriate amount of 
circulation space for a particular development, applicants must have regard the design of 
the development as a whole; the layout of (and approach to) the area/room where the 
cycle  parking is located ; and/ or the type of racks proposed, as well as other relevant 
Local Plan policies, particularly policy PLAN1.  
Visitor /short -stay parking  
10. Visitor /short -stay parking must  be provided in line with the London Plan minimum short -
stay cycle parking standards. These are set out in Table A4. 1 for reference:  
 
11. Visitor/short -stay cycle parking must  be provided off the public highway. Where this is 
not possible , it may be appropriate within the public realm , where relevant Local Plan 
policies are addressed, particularly policies PLAN1 and T4 . In exceptional 
circumstances, where it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council  that 
visitor/short -stay parking cannot be physically provide d, a financial contribution will be 
sought to fund the  install ation of  an equivalent off-site parking in the public realm . 
Locations will be sought in proximity to the proposed development in the first instance.  
 
12. Visitor/short -stay cycle parking must  be easy to find and located close to a main access 
road(s) and building entry/exit points. It must  not be sited where it will obstruct passing 
pedestrians or vehicles. Facilities must  be accessible and easy to use, with no 
inconvenient detours, steep slop es or narrow access ways. The facilities must  be step -
free and convenient for visitors of any age or mobility, without the need to lift or drag the 
cycle. Sheffield stands are the priority type of cycle parking provision for visitor/short -stay 
cycle parkin g.  
300 
 1. Policy SC4 requires major development proposals to undertake a social v alue self -
assessment which clearly sets out the specific social value which would be added 
through delivery of the proposal.  The self -assessment form is provided in T able A5.1 
below. It sets out a number of potential social value benefits that could be provided by a 
proposal, but it is not an exhaustive list ; the Council  would welcome inclusion of 
additional benefits and other innovative approaches to optimising Social Value outcome s 
through planned developments.  These should be discussed with the Council as early as 
possible in the planning application process, ideally at pre -application stage.  
 
2. Applicants can contribute social  value:  
 
 as an employer and contractor;  
 as a stakeholder in the local community;  
 as a contributor to the local/sub -regional economy; and/or  
 as a steward of the environment.  
 
3. When completing the self -assessment form, it may be helpful for applicants to cons ider 
these ‘roles’ when determining what social value can be added by the proposal.  
 
4. As part of the self -assessment,  applicants  must  indicate how the social value will be 
delivered and sustained throughout the lifetime of the development ; for example, this 
may be secured through leasehold and tenancy agreements for the development

 Overview  
3. The views from Farringdon, St. John Street and Amwell Street of St. Paul's Cathedral 
form part of the original views protected in the 1930s by the City of London's St. Paul's 
Heights. Islington has maintained these original views and added to them over time. 
Protection across the whole of the local view needs to be maintained, requiring policy co -
ordination between the City of London and Islington. It should  be noted that there is a 
slight difference in height between the view the City protects and that Islington's policy 
protects for these three views. The height difference is to enable greater control of the 
development in the foreground of these views, all owing a larger viewing area and 
enhancing the appreciation of this important and attractive landmark. However, 
consistent with the City of London's St . Paul's Heights, these three views terminate at 
58.1m A bove Ordnance Datum (AOD)  (the height of the base of the cathedral's 
peristyle). The remaining local protected views terminate at 52.1m AOD (the height of 
the base of the cathedral's drum), as per the Mayor's strategic p rotected views of the 
cathedral . See also the City of London's Protected Views SPD. 
 
4. The viewpo ints for each local view  are illustrated on the Figures A6.2 to A6. 9. The view 
co-ordinates (origin and termination points) are identified in Tables A6.1 to A6.8. The 
protected viewing corridors are also shown in full on the Policies Map.  
Local V iew LV1  
5. LV1 operates differently from the other protected vie ws. It consolidates the views policies 
of the City of London and Islington to establish a strong local view , safeguarding the 
special heritage of Farringdon, the Fleet Valley and the views to St.  Paul’s Cathedral 
from this space. LV1 provides an opportunity for views of St . Paul’s Cathe dral from a 
large space and, unlike other views, it must be considered as a viewing area  rather than 
in terms of separate viewpoints . The grid re ferences for LV1 id entified in T able A6.1 
therefore describe the extent of the viewing area rather than separate viewpoints. Views 
to St. Paul's cathedral will be protected from all parts of this viewing area.  
 
6. The view aligns with the western extent of St. Paul’s Heights an d centres on St. Paul’s 
Cathedral with a width that mirrors its western extent to the east. The height of the view 
(AOD ) at St. Paul’s Cathedral is proposed to be fixed at 58.1m which is the base of the 
peristyle and the height St. Paul's Heights protects from this view.  
 
7. At the other end, the view is defined by a line parallel to the line established by the 
cathedral and set out from the corner of Turnmill Street and Clerkenwell Road bridge at a 
height that ensures clear views from this public thoroughfare  and from within the Fleet 
Valley north of this.  
 
8. The height of this line is fixed at 14.9m AOD  which is the height at which the cathedral is 
visible if one is seated in this public space. The protected view area continues north 
along Farringdon Lane and Farringdon Road to a point at the junction of Farringdon 
Road and Bowling Green Lane, to protect  this part of the valley space.

Glossary  
Term  Definition  
Active frontages  A building accommodating uses on the 
ground floor which generate passing trade 
and provide a shop -type window display 
providing visual interest for pedestrians.  
Adaptable  Premises that, whilst not immediately 
accessible or inclusive, have the capacity to 
be adapted to deliver an accessible facility; 
that adaptation should be quick, easy and 
low cost, it will not involve the relocation of 
partitions or services but may mean the 
installation of grab -rails or other 
fixtures/fittings.  
AECB Building Standard  The Association for Environment Conscious 
Building (AECB) Building Standard 
(previously known as Silver Standard) is a 
recognised and successful fabric first 
approach based on performance metrics 
and a more accurate energy demand 
assessment. The AECB Build ing Standard 
enables the construction of high -
performance buildings using widely 
available technology to reduce overall CO2 
emissions. The standard is comparable but 
less ambitious than Passivhaus.  
Affordable Private Rent  Intermediate rented housing prov ided within 
Purpose Built Private Rented Sector 
development.  
Affordable Rent/London Affordable Rent  Housing let by local authorities or private 
registered providers of social housing to 
households who are eligible for social 
rented housing. Affordable Rent is subject 
to rent controls that require a rent of no 
more than 80 per cent of the local market 
rent (including service charges, where 
applicable). London Affordable Rent is a 
type of AR product introduced by the Mayor 
of London, with rents based on s ocial rent 
levels.  
Affordable retail space  A retail unit (generally a small retail unit) 
with a rental value below the market rate 
(dependent on the sector and location). 
Market stalls or street booths could 
constitute affordable retail space where they 
meet these parameters.   
333 
 Affordable workspace  Business floorspace/workspace which is 
leased to the Council at a peppercorn rate 
for a specified period and managed by a 
Council approved operator.  Affordable 
workspace should be let to end occupiers at 
rents significantly below the prevailing 
market rent for the specific sector and/or 
location. Actual rental values will be 
considered on a case -by-case basis 
through the Council’s Affordable Workspace 
Commissioning Process.  
Agent -of-change  The principle that th e person or organisation 
responsible for change – e.g. a planning 
applicant who proposes new residential 
units near an existing cultural use – is 
responsible for managing the impact of that 
change. This includes impacts from noise, 
vibration and lighting.  
Air Quality Assessment/preliminary Air 
Quality Assessment  Documents which assess the impacts of 
existing air quality on development, and the 
impacts that the development itself may 
potentially cause. The assessments should 
include details of relevant miti gation 
measures.  
Air Quality Focus Area  Locations that exceed the EU annual mean 
limit value for Nitrogen Dioxide emissions 
and which have a high human exposure. 
Currently planned measures to reduce air 
pollution in these areas may not fully 
resolve poor  air quality issues.  
Air Quality Management Area  Specified area where national air quality 
objectives are not likely to be achieved. This 
area could be just one or two streets, or it 
could be much bigger. Where an area has 
been identified, the local autho rity will put 
together a plan to improve the air quality - a 
Local Air Quality Action Plan.  
Air Quality Neutral  A development is considered to be Air 
Quality Neutral if it does not lead to the 
deterioration of existing air quality i.e. the 
operational emi ssions from a finished 
development are no greater than the pre -
development emissions. The Air Quality 
Neutral standard is assessed with respect 
to all emissions associated with air pollution 
from a development site, including Nitrogen 
Dioxide NO2, PM10 and  PM2.5.  
Air source heat pump  An air source heat pump (ASHP) is a 
system which transfers heat from outside to 
inside a building, or vice versa. Heat 
absorbed from the outside air can be used 
to heat radiators, underfloor heating 
systems, or warm air convectors and hot 
water. Under the principles of vapour   
334 
 compression refrigeration, an ASHP uses a 
refrigerant system involving a compressor 
and a condenser to absorb heat at one 
place and release it at another.  
Albedo  The surface reflectivity of the sun’s 
radiation.  
All London Green Grid  The All London Green Grid is a policy 
framework to promote the design and 
delivery of green infrastructure across 
London.  
Ambulant disabled cyclist  A mobility impaired person who is able to 
walk short distances but who may find 
cycling an easier/better option than walking 
or public transport.  
Amenity  Amenity is a qualitative measure that 
relates to the character, sense of wellbeing 
and enjoyment of an area. It can be 
influenced by a number of factors, both 
individually and cumulatively.  
Ancillary use  An ancillary use supports or is closely 
associated with the primary use/function of 
a building/unit/land. A use would only be 
considered ancillary if its scale and/or 
function does not detract from the primary 
purpose of the building/unit/land.  
Apart -hotels   Serviced, self -contained, self -catering 
apartments, usually on short -term lets of no 
more than 90 days. The use class may be 
C1 or C3, depending on the characteristics 
of the particular development.

all permitted development rights that apply 
to a particular site or area.  
Biodiversity  The diversity or variety of plants, animals 
and other living things in a particular area.  
Bio-solar roof  Roof combining a green roof and 
photovoltaic re newable energy. PV panels 
are installed on top of green roof substrate. 
Biosolar roofs bring together the energy -
generating capability of solar PV arrays with 
the sustainable drainage, cooling and 
biodiversity  benefits of green roof systems.  
Blue infrastructure  Water -related infrastructure/assets such as 
rivers, canals and ponds, which have a 
multi -functional role.  
Blue roof  Attenuation tank(s) at roof or podium level.   
335 
 Brownfield land/previously developed land  As defined in the NPPF, land which is or 
was occupied by a permanent structure, 
including the curtilage of the developed land 
(although it should not be assumed that the 
whole of the curtilage should be developed) 
and any associated fixed surface 
infrastructure. This excludes: land that is or 
was last occupied by agricultural or forestry  
buildings; land that has been developed for 
minerals extraction or waste disposal by 
landfill, where provision for restoration has 
been made through development 
management procedures; land in built -up 
areas such as residential gardens, parks, 
recreation grounds and allotments; and land 
that was previously developed but where 
the remains of the permanent structure or 
fixed surface structure have blended into 
the landscape.  
Building Information Management  A process for creating and managing 
information on a construction project across 
the project lifecycle. One of the key outputs 
of this process is the Building Information 
Model, the digital description of every 
aspect of the built asset. This model draws 
on in formation assembled collaboratively 
and updated at key stages of a project.   
Building Regulations  Minimum standards for design, construction 
and alterations of buildings, supported by 
Approved Documents which set out detailed 
practical guidance on complia nce with the 
regulations. Building regulations approval is 
different from planning permission. 
Approved Documents L (known as Part L) 
and M (known as Part M) are particularly 
relevant for planning, with regard to 
sustainable design and accessibility 
respec tively.  
Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Methodology  A sustainability assessment method used to 
assess, rate and certify the sustainability of 
buildings.  
Business 
floorspace/buildings/development/uses  Activities or uses that fall within the B -use 
class. Sui generis uses which are akin to 
business floorspace, such as depots or 
builders merchants, can be classed as 
business floorspace for the purposes of the 
Local Plan.  
Business Improvement District  An area where businesses agree to pay 
additional rates to fund improvements to the 
local general environment, with the aim of 
encouraging local economic development.  
Business -led development  Development where the majority of 
floorspace is for business us es.   
336 
 Car clubs  Clubs where a number of people share a 
pool car(s) for rent or otherwise for personal 
use.  
Carbon  Carbon is used in the Islington Local Plan 
as a shorthand term for carbon dioxide 
emissions and all other greenhouse gases. 
London’s carbon accounting is measured in 
the carbon dioxide equivalent, which 
includes the conversion of other 
greenhouse gases int o their equivalent 
carbon dioxide emissions.  
Carbon dioxide (CO2)  The principal greenhouse gas related to 
climate change.  
Care home  Care homes are where a number of older 
people live, usually in single rooms, and 
have access to on -site care services. 
Different types of care homes provide 
different levels of care. A home registered 
simply as a care home will provide personal 
care only - help with washing, dressing and 
giving medication. A home registered as a 
care home with nursing will provide the 
same  personal care but also have a 
qualified nurse on duty twenty -four hours a 
day to carry out nursing tasks. These 
homes are for people who are physically or 
mentally frail or people who need regular 
attention from a nurse. Some homes, 
registered either for personal care or 
nursing care, can be registered for a 
specific care need, for example dementia or 
terminal illness.  
Car-free development  Car-free development means no parking 
provision will be allowed on site and the 
occupiers will have no ability to obt ain car 
parking permits.  
CAZ Fringe spatial strategy areas  Angel and Upper Street spatial strategy 
area and King's Cross and Pentonville Road 
spatial strategy area, which are both 
contiguous with the CAZ.  
Central Activities Zone  The Central Activities Zone is the area of 
central London where planning policy 
promotes the development of offices and a 
broad range of other uses such as retail and 
cultural uses and activities.  
Change of Use  A type of development that requires 
plannin g permission if it is judged to be 
‘material’. However, this excludes any 
change between uses which are within the 
same Use Class as defined in the Use 
Classes Order. It also excludes changes of 
use that are Permitted Development as 
defined in the General Permitted 
Development Order.   
337 
 Character  Individual distinctiveness created from a 
combination of natural and built elements 
with historic, socio -economic and other 
factors.  
CIBSE TM54  An energy assessment methodology 
developed by the Chartered Institution  of 
Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) to 
predict future operational energy 
performance for non -domestic buildings at 
the design stage. This allows designers to 
consider factors that impact buildings’ 
actual operational performance at an earlier 
stage and  enables a more accurate 
determination of the anticipated energy 
consumption and carbon emissions that can 
be used to verify the performance of the 
constructed building in operation. CIBSE 
TM54 can also be used to provide a more 
accurate energy demand asse ssment.  
Circular economy  A circular economy is one where materials 
are retained in use at their highest value for 
as long as possible and are then re -used or 
recycled, leaving a minimum of residual 
waste. A circular economy approach will 
save resources, improve resource 
efficiency, help to reduce carbon emissions 
and will also help to reduce waste 
production.  
City Fringe Opportunity Area  Opportunity Areas are capable of 
accommodating substantial new jobs or 
homes. The City Fringe Opportunity Areas 
includ e parts of Islington, City of London, 
Hackney, and Tower Hamlets. It is an 
important area for employment growth in 
particular and includes the Tech City cluster 
of digital and creative industries.  
Clawback  A legally binding agreement that determines 
future requirements or payments in respect 
of land, following a trigger event.  
Climate change allowance  Allowance of 40% for an increase in rainfall 
intensity from climate change in accordance 
with Environment Agency guidance 'Flood 
risk assessments: climate change 
allowances'.  
Co-living/shared living  Synonymous with large -scale HMOs. A 
form of non -self-contained accommodation 
where people, usually young professionals, 
have their own living space but share basic 
amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom. 
Accomm odation will usually feature other 
non-essential communal facilities. Co -
living/shared living is a lifestyle choice and 
does not address specific housing need. It 
is not an affordable housing product.   
338 
 Combined Heat and Power  The combined production of hea t and 
power, where the heat emitted as a by -
product of energy generation is captured for 
useful purposes.  
Commercial 
floorspace/buildings/development/uses  Activities or uses which involve business 
activities and/or the sale of good or 
services. For the purposes of the Local 
Plan, this is broad term which encompasses 
business and retail uses.  
Commercial storey  Floor to floor height of commercial 
buildings, typically in the range of 4m to 
4.5m.  
Commercial -led development  Development where the majority of  
floorspace/uses is commercial.  
Community Infrastructure Levy/Mayoral 
Community Infrastructure Ley  A tool for local authorities in England and 
Wales to help deliver infrastructure to 
support the development of the area. Most 
new development which creates net 
additional floor space of 100 square metres 
or more, or creates a new dwelling, is 
potentially liable for the levy. Rates are set 
by the local planning authority in line with 
legislation and guidance. The Mayor of 
London can set separate rates which al so 
apply in London.  
Community Needs Assessment  Document which assesses proposed 
loss/reduction/relocation of social and 
community infrastructure uses.  
Community Use Agreement  A document outlining terms of use for the 
use of private facilities by local co mmunity 
groups.  
Comparison goods retailers  Shops that sell items where some 
comparison is likely to be made before 
purchasing goods (e.g. clothing, carpets, 
electrical goods).  
Compulsory Purchase Order  A legal function that enables public bodies 
to obtain land or property without the 
consent of the landowner.  
Conservation areas  An area of special architectural or historic 
interest whose character or appearance is 
protected. Conservation area guidelines 
have been produced to guide development 
decisio ns in each area.  
Convenience goods retailers  Shops that sell everyday items such as 
food, drink and newspapers.  
Co-working space  Workspace utilised by people who are self -
employed or working for different 
employers. Co -working spaces are inclusive 
of costs such as internet access and often 
include use of facilities such as meeting 
rooms. They are occupied on an ad hoc, 
membership basis, including on a per desk 
basis.   
339 
 Creative industries  Activities which have their origin in 
individual creativity, skil l and talent, and 
which have their potential for wealth and job 
creation through the generation and 
exploitation of intellectual property.  
Critical Drainage Area  A discrete geographic area (usually a 
hydrological catchment) where multiple and 
interlinked sources of flood risk (surface 
water, groundwater, sewer, main river 
and/or tidal) cause flooding in one or more 
Local Flood Risk Zones during severe 
weather thereby affecting people, property 
or local infrastructure  
Cultural Quarter  Areas where cultural provision should be 
expanded, and/or where there is already a 
broader level of cultural activity which 
should be retained and enhanced.  
Cultural uses  Cultural uses are unique assets which add 
significant value to the social fabric and 
economy of Islington . Such uses often have 
distinct social and economic benefits, 
although cannot be specifically defined (in 
terms of planning use classes). Cultural 
facilities evident in Islington includes music 
and other entertainment venues, cinemas, 
artist studios and ga lleries, theatres, pubs, 
museums and the Emirates Stadium, 
working men’s clubs, arts and crafts 
spaces, bingo halls, community centres, in 
addition to a number of heritage assets.  
Cumulative impact  In terms of the 2003 Licensing Act, 
“cumulative impact” means the potential 
impact on the promotion of the licensing 
objectives of a significant number of 
licensed premises concentrated in one 
area.  
Decentralised Energy Network  An existing or proposed district 
heating/electricity/cooling network to which 
a bui lding or buildings can connect.  
Decibel  Unit of sound level. 0dB is the threshold of 
hearing and 140dB is the threshold of pain. 
dB(A) is a measurement which broadly 
agrees with people's perception of 
loudness.  
Deed of Easement  A legal document used to ensure that 
existing commercial occupiers are protected 
from impacts of new developers in close 
proximity. For example, where a new 
residential use is proposed in close 
proximity to a noise generating commercial 
use such as a publi c house, a deed of 
easement would be legal binding 
acceptance of the existing noise levels from  
340 
 occupiers of the proposed residential use, 
at the time of occupation.  
Density  The amount of development proportionate 
to a building or site. High density 
devel opment refers to a high proportion of 
development on site or within a building, 
which does not necessarily mean tall or 
taller buildings.  
Design and access statement  A document submitted as part of a planning 
application which explains how a proposed 
deve lopment is a suitable response to the 
site and its setting, and demonstrates that it 
can be adequately accessed by prospective 
users. Specific requirements for design and 
access statements are set out in legislation.  
Developer contributions  Contributions secured as part of new 
development to fund infrastructure, 
affordable housing and other mitigation 
measures. Developer contributions are 
generally secured through planning 
obligations or the Community Infrastructure 
Levy.  
Development  The carrying out of building, engineering, 
mining or other operations in, on, over or 
under the land; or the making of any 
material change in the use of any buildings 
or other land, as defined in the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 as amended. 
Unless it is defined under th e Act as 
‘permitted development’, planning 
permission is required for the carrying out of 
any development of land.  
Development Management  Development Management is a positive and 
proactive approach to shaping, considering, 
determining and delivering devel opment 
proposals. It is led by the local planning 
authority, working closely with those 
proposing developments and other 
stakeholders. It is undertaken in the spirit of 
partnership and inclusiveness, and supports 
the delivery of key priorities and outcomes . 
Development Plan  The Development Plan sets out the local 
planning authority's policies and proposals 
for the development and use of land. The 
Development Plan for Islington consists of 
the London Plan and Development Plan 
Documents. Planning application s are 
determined in accordance with the plan 
unless material considerations indicate 
otherwise  
Development Plan Documents  Statutory planning documents, produced by 
a planning authority, that form part of the 
Development Plan. This includes the Local 
Plan and the London Plan.   
341 
 Disabled people  People who, under the Equality Act 2010, 
have a physical or mental impairment that 
has a ‘substantial’ and ‘long -term’ negative 
effect on their ability to undertake normal 
daily activities; this will include mobility, 
sensory and or cognitive impairments.  
Discounted Market Sales  An intermediate home ownership product 
that must be sold at a discount of at least 
20% below local market value. It should be 
affordable to households which meet a 
specified household income cap and should 
remain available at a discount for future 
eligible households.  
Drainage hierarchy  London Plan hierarchy that seeks to ensure 
that surface water run -off is managed as 
close to its source as possible, in order to 
reduce the rate and volume of  surface water 
run-off. 
Ecological survey  Survey which assesses the ecological 
importance of a site, including consideration 
of wildlife habitats. Ecological surveys must 
identify potential development impacts likely 
to harm the ecology of the site and 
recommend mitigation and enhancement 
measures  
Edge -of-centre  For retail purposes, a location within 300m 
walking distance of a Primary Shopping 
Area.  
Embodied carbon/energy/emissions  The total life cycle 
carbon/energy/greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with the raw material extraction, 
collection, manufacture, transportation, 
assembly, maintenance, recycling and 
disposal of a given material or product.  
Employment floorspace/developm ent/uses  Activities or uses that generate 
employment.  
Employment -led development  Development where the majority of 
floorspace is for employment uses.  
Energy hierarchy  A tiered approach to maximising energy 
efficiency and minimising on -site 
greenhouse gas emissions in the built 
environment. The first step is to reduce 
energy demand (be lean), the second step 
is to supply energy efficiently (be clean) and 
the third step is using renewable energy (be 
green).  
Entertainment uses  Entertainment uses generally fall within the 
A3, A4 and A5 uses; live music and dance 
venues (D2 use); and nightclubs, casinos 
and amusement arcades (Sui Generis 
uses), as defined under the Town and 
Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 
and its subsequ ent amendments. 
Depending on their impact, other uses may  
342 
 also be considered to fall within this 
definition, such as private members’ clubs, 
restaurants and casinos in hotels, and 
premises that contain a mix of retail and 
entertainment (Sui Generis uses).  
Environment Agency’s Risk of Flooding 
from Surface Water  The Environment Agency’s Risk of Flooding 
from Surface Water (RoFSW) dataset 
provides an indication of the broad areas 
likely to be at risk of surface water flooding 
(i.e. areas where surface water would be 
expected to flow or pond), as opposed to 
the susceptibility of individual properties to 
surface water flooding. The RoFSW 
provides bandings of Low (within the flood 
extent during a 1 in 1000 year rainfall 
event), Medium (within the flood extent 
during a 1 in 100 year rainfall event) and 
High (within the flood extent during a 1 in 30 
year rainfall event) surface water flood risk.  
Equalities Impact Assessment  An Equalities Impact Assessment (EqIA) is 
a way of measuring the potential impacts 
(both positive and negative) that a policy, 
function or service may have on the key 
protected characteristics covered by the 
Public Sector Equality Duty, and on Human 
Rights . The EqIA process supports decent 
decision making by enabling a good 
understanding of the need and differential 
impacts that policies may have on different 
groups. The EqIA of the Local Plan is 
contained within the Integrated Impact 
Assessment.  
Essentia l services  Certain types of shops, commonly  small 
and independent shops, that perform an 
essential service and should be easily 
accessible to all residents. These essential 
services include butchers, bakers, 
greengrocers, grocers, fishmongers, 
chemists, po st offices, newsagents, dry 
cleaners and laundrettes.  
Extra -care housing  Self-contained residential accommodation 
and associated facilities. Domestic support 
and personal care are available, usually 
provided by on -site staff. Extra care will 
generally be considered to be C3 use 
unless they include a significant element of 
care.   
Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard  The Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard 
(FEES) has been developed by the Zero 
Carbon Hub to ensure that zero carbon 
homes prioritise a holistic approach to 
energy efficiency that assesses both 
specification and form compo nents under 
one metric. The FEES is available as part of  
343 
 the Government’s Standard Assessment 
Procedure (SAP). The FEES targets are the 
proposed maximum space heating and 
cooling energy demand for zero carbon 
homes that would normally be needed to 
maintain  comfortable internal temperatures.  
Family housing  Homes appropriate for occupation by an 
adult, or adults, with one or more children. 
Units of two -bedrooms or more are 
considered to be family homes. A family 
home must also include adequate outdoor 
private or semi -private space suitable for 
play.  
Flexible workspace/serviced offices  Broad terms encompassing typologies of 
workspace which provide a more flexible 
solution for occupiers in terms of lease 
lengths and options for occupying spaces, 
usually for a single flat fee which is inclusive 
of access to all facilities. In terms of 
facilities, flexible workspace/serviced offices 
would be akin to standard office space.  
Food desert  Areas where local access to affordable and 
healthy food is lacking, which can contribute 
to ill health including cancer, heart disease, 
diabetes and mental health problems.  
Fuel Poverty  Fuel poverty means spending more than 
10% of a household’s income on  simply 
keeping warm and providing basic hot water 
and lighting.  
Function  In relation to a specific area, function is 
defined as that areas predominant role , 
although some areas can have supporting 
functions. For example, Islington’s town 
centres all hav e an overtly A1 retail function 
but some also have a distinct cultural or 
night -time economy element. The 
introduction of certain uses can undermine 
the function of an area and cause harmful 
impacts either individually or cumulatively.  
gCO₂/kWh  Grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour. 
A kilowatt hour (kWh) is a unit of energy 
used to measure energy consumption. 
gCO₂/kWh is used to measure the carbon 
content of heat.  
Genuinely affordable housing  Genuinely affordable housing is primarily 
considered to be  social rented 
accommodation. Intermediate housing, in 
particular London Living Rent, which is 
demonstrably affordable to those on low to 
moderate incomes such as key workers in 
the borough, could fall within the definition 
of ‘genuinely affordable’. Share d ownership 
housing is, in the majority of circumstances, 
not affordable to those on low to moderate  
344 
 incomes and therefore in most cases would 
not constitute ‘genuinely affordable 
housing’; however, it may be classed as an 
acceptable ‘genuinely affordable’  
intermediate tenure on a case -by-case 
basis, depending on the size of units and 
location within the borough, and where the 
total monthly costs including the rental 
element are demonstrably affordable. In 
such circumstances, the rental element 
must be secu red at an affordable level 
through legal agreement.  
Geodiversity  The variety of rocks, fossils, minerals, 
landforms, soils and natural processes, 
such as weathering, erosion and 
sedimentation, that underlie and determine 
the character of our natural landscape and 
environment.  
Grade A offices  New or significantly refur bished office with 
high specification, which attracts higher 
rental values. Grade A office space tends to 
be located in central commercial locations.  
Green infrastructure  The network of green spaces, street trees, 
green roofs, and other assets such as 
natural drainage features, which together 
provide multiple benefits for people and 
wildlife.  
Green Performance Plan  A plan for the operation of the building, 
detailing measurable outputs for the 
occupied building, particularly for energy 
consumption, CO2 emissions and water 
use, and setting out arrangements for 
monitoring the progress of the plan over the 
first years of occupancy.  
Green roofs  Green roofs are vegetated layers that sit on 
top of the conventional roof surfaces of a 
building, which can suppor t a wide range of 
plant life. Green roofs can create, or 
improve, biodiversity, contribute to 
minimising flood risk, improve thermal 
efficiency and improve the microclimate. 
There are two types of green roof: extensive 
green roofs, where the priority is bi odiversity 
and greening which is virtually self -
sustaining and requires only minimum 
maintenance; and intensive/semi -intensive 
green roofs which provide amenity space 
such as rooftop gardens and food growing 
areas in addition to planting (and therefore 
necessitate higher levels of design and 
maintenance).

 Greenfield runoff rate  The greenfield runoff rate is used to assess 
the requirements for limiting discharge flow 
rates and attenuation storage for a site in 
order to achieve the pre -development 
greenfield  site runoff rates. Greenfield runoff 
is usually calculated as the peak rate of 
runoff for a specific return period due to 
rainfall falling on a given area of vegetated 
land. The greenfield runoff rate in Islington 
has been set by the Environment Agency at  
8 litres/second/hectare.  
Greenhouse gas  Any gas that induces the greenhouse effect, 
trapping heat within the atmosphere that 
would normally be lost to space, resulting in 
an increase in average atmospheric 
temperatures and contributing to climate 
change.  Examples include carbon dioxide, 
methane and nitrous oxides.  
Greening/urban greening  Greening is the improvement of the 
appearance, function and wildlife value of 
the urban environment through soft 
landscaping. Urban greening describes the 
green infrastructure elements that are most 
applicable in central London and London’s 
town centres. Due to the morphology and 
density of the built environment in these 
areas, green roofs, street trees, and 
techniques such as soft landscaping, are 
often the most appropriate elements of 
green infrastructure.  
Greywater recycling  Grey -water refers to waste water from 
showers, baths and washbasins (but not 
contaminated water from kitchen sinks and 
washing machines). As long as drinking 
quality is not required, this w ater can be 
treated and re -used, e.g. for flushing toilets, 
watering gardens and for washing 
machines.  
Gross External Area  A method of measuring the area of a 
building which includes walls, plant rooms 
and outbuildings, but excludes external 
space  such a s balconies and terraces. The 
calculation of Gross External Area, 
including what parts of a building are 
included within the calculation, should 
adhere to guidance produced by the Royal 
Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).  
Gross Internal Area  A method of measuring the area of a 
building which refers to the entire area 
inside the external walls of a building and 
includes corridors, lifts, plant rooms, service 
accommodation (e.g. toilets).The calculation 
of Gross Internal Area, including what par ts 
of a building are included within the  
346 
 calculation, should adhere to guidance 
produced by the Royal Institute of 
Chartered Surveyors (RICS).  
Gyratory  A type of road junction at which traffic 
enters a one -way stream around a central 
island.  
Habitable room  Any room used or intended to be used for 
sleeping, cooking, living or eating purposes. 
Enclosed spaces such as bath or toilet 
facilities, service rooms, corridors, 
laundries, hallways, or similar spaces are 
excluded from this definition. However, 
service/utility/store rooms larger than 8m2 
within single dwellings will normally be 
considered as habitable rooms.  
Habitats Regulation Assessment  Under Article 6 (3) and (4) of the Directive 
92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural 
Habitats and of Wild Fauna  and Flora 
(Habitats Directive), land -use plans - 
including Local Plans - are subject to a 
Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA). 
The Directive seeks to provide legal 
protection of habitats and species that are 
of European significance. The purpose of 
HRA is to assess the impacts of a land -use 
plan against the conservation objectives of 
a European Site and to ascertain whether it 
would adversely affect the integrity of that 
site. The HRA of the Local Plan is contained 
within the Integrated Impact Assessment .  
Health and wellbeing  Ensuring health and wellbeing means 
creating a healthy environment whilst not 
contributing to negative health outcomes 
and further widening health inequalities.  
Health Impact Assessment  A Health Impact Assessment considers the 
potential impacts of planning policies and 
decisions on health and health inequalities. 
It ensures that health benefits are enhanced 
and any identified impacts on the wider 
determinants of health ae mitigated, i.e. 
social determinants of health, well -being 
and inequalities. The HIA of the Local Plan 
is contained within the Integrated Impact 
Assessment.  
Heat network/District Heating Network  A heat network (sometimes called a district 
heating network) is a distribution system of 
insulated pipes carrying hot water or steam, 
usually underground, that takes heat 
generated in a central source and delivers it 
to a number of residential and commerci al 
buildings to meet their heating 
requirements. They can range from several 
metres to several kilometres in length. The 
heat source can be a facility with heat  
347 
 production equipment that provides a 
dedicated supply to the heat network, such 
as a combined h eat and power (CHP) plant, 
or heat recovered from secondary heat 
sources. In the context of the Islington Local 
Plan, a heat network includes a local 
existing or planned area -wide network to 
which a building or buildings can connect.  
Heritage  Inherited re sources, arte facts or intangible 
attributes that are valued by individuals or 
communities for their cultural or natural 
characteristics.  
Heritage Assets  A building, monument, site, place, area or 
landscape positively identified as having a 
degree of significance meriting 
consideration in planning decisions. 
Heritage assets are the valued components 
of the historic environment. They include 
designated heritage assets (e.g. listed 
buildings) and non -designated assets 
identified by the local planning aut hority 
during the process of decision -making or 
through the plan -making process (e.g. 
locally listed buildings). A heritage asset 
holds meaning for society over and above 
its functional utility. It is this heritage 
significance that justifies a degree of 
protection in planning decisions.  
Heritage -led development  Development which, as a starting point, is 
based on the principle of conserving 
heritage assets (i.e. historic buildings, 
structures or places), but also increases 
their economic viability, and imp roves the 
cultural offer to both local residents and 
visitors.  
Historic green spaces  Spaces listed on Historic England’s 
Register of Parks and Gardens; squares 
protected by the London Squares 
Preservation Act 1931; and areas listed on 
the London Garden’s Trust Inventory of 
Historic Green Spaces.  
Hostels  Residential accommodation, usually not 
self-contained, often for a particular group 
of people and classified as sui generis uses 
where no significant element of care is 
provided in accordance with the Town  and 
Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 
and its subsequent amendments. This does 
not include ‘youth hostels’ as these are a 
type of visitor accommodation (C1 Use 
Class).   
348 
 Hybrid space  The main feature of hybrid space is that it 
straddles different B -use classes. It is often 
created in older industrial building stock 
which has been repurposed for more 
modern industrial uses, but can also be 
provided in newly developed space. Hybrid 
space is space suitable for industrial 
activities/ occupiers that ‘serv e the services’, 
meaning that they provide services which 
support the expanding central London 
business market, and the wider London 
economy. Hybrid space must have a 
predominantly industrial function, which 
could combine features of light industrial, 
studio and production space, as well as 
storage and logistics; h owever , it can 
include supporting/complementary elements 
of office provided they are ancillary.  As 
such, hybrid space is likely to be considered 
a Sui Generis use. Fundamentally, hybrid 
space must  be conducive to occupation by 
a range of industrial and light industrial 
users due to its flexible des ign. 
Inclusive design  An approach to the design and 
management of the built environment and 
open spaces that takes personal and 
cultural differences into account to ensure 
parity of experience; it goes beyond a basic 
requirement for physical accessibility (as 
required by Building Regulations) to focus 
on the quality of individual experience.  
Independent retailer/service  Generally defined as a single r etail/service 
outlet, or a chain of two or three stores, 
managed by either a sole trader or a family 
firm. 
Industrial 
floorspace/buildings/development/uses/land  Activities or uses that fall within light 
industrial (B1c), general industry (B2) and 
storage and distribution (B8) uses, and 
some sui generis akin to industrial uses 
such as depots and builder’s merchants.  
Infrastructure  Infrastructure includes the roads, transport 
(including walking and cycling routes), 
public utilities, buildings or facilities and the 
services provided by them which are used 
both by residents and those who come to 
work, study in, or visit the borough. 
Infrastructure can be split into two areas, 
strategic and social. Development of 
infrastructure can often be a statutory duty 
undertaken by government departments 
and other statutory bodies and similar 
organisations.   
349 
 Integrated Impact Assessment  A combined assessment of the social, 
environmental and economic impact of 
planning policies, incorporating the statutory 
requirements of S ustainability Appraisal 
(SA) and Strategic Environmental 
Assessments (SEA); Health Impact 
Assessment (HIA); and Equalities Impact 
Assessment (EqIA).  It also incorporates a 
Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA) 
which is undertaken as a parallel process to 
the IIA. The IIA is an iterative process 
conducted throughout  the plan preparation 
period, which considers the impacts of 
emerging policies and proposes policy 
alterations or mitigation for any adverse 
impacts that are identified.  
Intermediate housing  Homes for sale and rent provided at a cost 
above social rent, but below market levels, 
subject to the criteria in the affordable 
housing definition. This includes shared 
ownership and London Living Rent but not 
affordable rented housing.  
Key shopping area  A key shopping area (for the purposes of a 
relevant prior approval assessment) is any 
Town Centre or Local Shopping Area 
designated in the Local Plan.  
kWh/yr and kWh/m2/yr  A kilowatt hour (kWh) is a unit of energy 
used to measure energy consumption. 
Kilowatt hours per year (kWh/yr) measures 
annual energy consumption. Kilowatt hours 
per square metre per year (kWh/m2/yr) 
measures annual energy consumption of a 
building by square metre. Predicted energy 
use can be declared in kWh/m2/yr and 
kWh/yr. The kW h/m2/yr metric is 
appropriate to measure heat demand as it is 
independent of fuel type and is used as the 
metric for the Fabric Energy Efficiency 
Standard (FEES).  
Landmark  A building or site which is a prominent 
identifying feature in a landscape, usually  
with historical or architectural significance. 
This includes designated local landmarks.  
Lead Local Flood Authorities  Lead Local Flood Authorities are 
responsible for developing, maintaining and 
applying a strategy for local flood risk 
management in thei r areas and for 
maintaining a register of flood risk as sets, in 
accordance with the  Flood and Water 
Management Act 2010. They also have lead 
responsibility for managing the risk of 
flooding from surface water, groundwater 
and ordinary watercourses.   
350 
 Legibility  The degree to which a place and its layout 
can be easily read, understood and

license from the local authority to operate 
(e.g. pubs, clubs and restaurants ). 
Listed building  A building of special architectural or historic 
interest, as listed under the Planning (Listed 
Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 
1990. Listed Buildings are graded under the 
English Heritage classification to show their 
relative importance, with Grade I buildings 
being of exceptional interest, Grade II* 
being particularly important buildings of 
more than special interest, and Grade II 
buildings being of special interest. The 
setting of a listed building can also be an 
important co nsideration, dependent on the 
contribution it makes to the significance of 
the listed building or its appreciation. A 
development may affect the setting of a 
listed building where it has a visual, historic 
or associational relationship with the listed 
building.   
Local Development Order  An Order made by a local planning authority 
(under the Town and Country Planning Act 
1990) that grants planning permission for a 
specific development proposal or classes of 
development.

importance to communities. Designation of 
local green spaces must be done in line 
with criteria in the NPPF.  
Local Plan  A Development Plan Document or collection 
of Development Plan Documents which is 
used to guide future development of a local 
area. A Local Plan can c onsist of either 
strategic or non -strategic policies, or a 
combination  
of the two.   
351 
 Local Shopping Area  Retail areas that provide local services, 
particularly essential convenience retailing 
which caters for daily shopping needs. 
Some Local Shopping Areas also have a 
more diverse mix of commercial uses, 
particularly leisure uses, which can help to 
sustain the vibrancy of these areas. Local 
Shopping Areas complement the more 
significant retail offer in designated Town 
Centres.  
Locally listed building  A buil ding, structure or feature of local 
importance due to its architectural, historical 
or environmental significance. Buildings are 
added to the local list in recognition of their 
value as historic assets which contribute to 
the quality of the local environme nt by 
enhancing the street scene and sustaining a 
sense of distinctiveness. Groups of 
buildings that contribute significantly to the 
appearance of a street are also eligible for 
inclusion on the local list.  
Locally Significant Industrial Sites  Designated areas where light industrial 
(B1c), general industry (B2) and storage 
and distribution (B8) are the priority land 
uses.  
London Living Rent  As outlined in the London Housing Strategy, 
London Living Rent is an intermediate 
housing product with l ow rents that vary by 
ward across London. Eligibility for London 
Living Rent is restricted to households that 
are currently renting, with a maximum 
income of £60,000 and who are not 
currently able to purchase a home 
(including through shared ownership) in the 
local area. Landlords are expected to 
actively support London Living Rent tenants 
into home ownership within 10 years, with 
tenants having ‘first dibs’ on buying the 
homes they are renting through shared 
ownership.  
London Plan  The spatial development strategy for the 
whole of Greater London produced by the 
Mayor of London. The London Plan forms 
part of Islington's Development Plan.  
London Sustainable Drainage Proforma  A proforma required by all Lead Local Flood 
Authorities (LLFAs) which sets a clear 
standard for the information that should be 
provided in a Sustainable Drainage strategy 
for all development in London.  
Low-emission CHP  In the context of the Local Plan, low -
emission CHP refers to those technologies 
which inherently emit very low levels o f 
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx).   
352 
 Lower specification office space  Office space within older premises, with a 
lesser standard of specification and lower 
rental values than Grade A offices.  
Main Town Centre uses  As set out in the NPPF, main town centre 
uses include retail development (including 
warehouse clubs and factory outlet 
centres); leisure, entertainment and more 
intensive sport and recreation uses 
(including cinemas, restaurants, drive -
through restaurants, bars and pubs, 
nightclubs, casinos, health an d fitness 
centres, indoor bowling centres and bingo 
halls); offices; and arts, culture and tourism 
development (including theatres, museums, 
galleries and concert halls, hotels and 
conference facilities).  
Major development  For housing, development where 1 0 or 
more homes will be provided, or the site has 
an area of 0.5 hectares or more. For non -
residential development, it means additional 
floorspace of 1,000sqm or more, or a site of 
1 hectare or more, or as otherwise provided 
in the Town and Country Plannin g 
(Development Management Procedure) 
(England) Order 2015.

be space which can accommodate micro 
enterprises and enable their effective 
operation.  
Microclimate  A local atmospheric zone where the climate 
differs from the surrounding area.  
Minor development  Development which is not a major 
development as defined in the Town and 
Country Planning (Development 
Management Procedure) (England) Order 
2015, i.e. for housing, development where 
between 1 to 9 will be provided, or the site  
353 
 has an area of less than 0.5 hectares. For 
non-residential development, it means 
additional floorspace of less than 1,000sqm 
or a site of less than 1 hectare, or any other 
development which does not meet the 
definition of major development set out in 
the legislation.  
Mixed -use development  Development involving a mix of 
complementary uses.  
Modal shift  A change in the method of transport, 
normally expressed as a proportion of 
overall trips within a defined area.     
National Planning Policy Framework  A document which sets out the  
government's position on planning in 
England.  
Natural Capital  Natural capital is the world's stock of natural 
resources, which includes geology, soils, 
air, water and all living organisms. Some 
natural capital assets provide people with 
free goods and se rvices, often called 
ecosystem services.  
Net Internal Area  A method of measuring the area of a 
building which includes entrance halls, 
kitchens and cleaners’ cupboards, but 
excludes corridors, internal walls, stairwells, 
lifts, WCs and other communal areas. It is 
also referred to as 'net lettable' or ‘usable’ 
area for offices and retail units. The 
calculation of Net Internal Area, including 
what parts of a building are included within 
the calculation, should adhere to guidance 
produced by the Royal Ins titute of 
Chartered Surveyors (RICS).  
Net zero -carbon  Net zero -carbon is achieved by balancing 
carbon emissions with carbon removal, 
including through carbon offsetting, so that 
the net input of emissions to the 
atmosphere due to human activities is zero;  
or by eliminating carbon emissions 
altogether.  
Night -time economy  All economic activity taking place bet ween 
the hours of 6pm and 6am. Activities 
associated with the night - time economy are 
varied and include eating, drinking, 
entertainment, shopping but  also include 
cleaning, hospitality, logistics and 
distribution, transport and medical services 
which employ a large number of night - time 
workers.  
Noise -generating uses  Uses (usually commercial and industrial) 
which generate noise as a result of their 
operation.

future waste arisings.  
Office -led development  Development where the majority of 
floorspace/uses is office within use class 
B1(a)  
Open space  All space of public value (public or private), 
including public landscaped areas, parks 
and playing fields. Areas of water such as 
rivers, lakes and reservoirs are also classed 
as open space. Open spaces are 
predominantly undeveloped but can include 
buildings or structures that are ancillary to 
the open space use.  
Operational emissions  Operational emissions are those associated 
with energy consumption as part of  the 
operation of a development, including 
emissions from plant or equipment. The 
total operational emissions include 
regulated emissions (i.e. those covered by 
the Building Regulations) and unregulated 
emissions (i.e. those not covered by the 
Building Reg ulations, such as emissions 
associated with cooking and small 
appliances).  
Out-of-centre  For retail purposes, a location which is not 
within a designated Town Centre, and is not 
in Local Shopping Area or edge -of-centre 
location.  
Parklet  Amenity space - usually temporary - which 
can also provide greening and cycle 
parking. Parklets are commonly created 
through conversion of on -street vehicle 
parking spaces.  
Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5)  Particulate matter (PM), also known as 
particle pollution or p articulates, is a 
complex mixture of microscopic solid or 
liquid particles - many of which are 
hazardous - suspended in the atmosphere 
of Earth. PM10 is particulate matter 10 
micrometers or less in diameter. PM2.5 is  
355 
 particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or l ess in 
diameter.  
Passive House Planning Package  The Passive House Planning Package 
(PHPP) is an energy assessment 
methodology and tool developed by the 
Passivhaus Institute to evaluate the 
predicted future operational energy 
performance for residential an d low energy 
non-domestic buildings. This allows 
designers to consider factors that impact 
buildings’ actual operational performance at 
an earlier stage and enables a more 
accurate determination of the anticipated 
energy consumption and carbon emissions 
that can be used to verify the performance 
of the constructed building in operation. 
PHPP can also be used to provide a more 
accurate energy demand assessment.  
Passivhaus Standard  Passivhaus is an internationally recognised 
and successful energy performance  
standard based on performance metrics 
and a more accurate energy demand 
assessment. It is considered to be the gold 
standard for energy efficiency. The aim of 
Passivhaus is to reduce the requirement for 
space heating and cooling, whilst also 
creating a hi gh standard of indoor comfort 
levels. This is primarily achieved by 
adopting a fabric first approach to building 
design by specifying high levels of 
insulation to the thermal envelope with 
exceptional levels of airtightness.  
Performance gap  The disparity between the 
predicted/modelled energy performance of 
buildings at design stage and their actual 
operational performance. Surveys of 
completed buildings often reveal a 
substantial gap between design 
expectations and delivered performance, 
especially energy performance.  
Permeability  The degree to which people can easily 
move through a place.  
Permitted development  Development set out in the Town and 
Country Planning (General Permitted 
Development) (England) Order, which can 
be undertaken without needing to apply for 
planning permission. Some permitted 
development requires prior approval of 
certain details before wor k can be carried 
out.   
356 
 Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Panels  Photovoltaics involve the direct conversion 
of solar radiation into electricity by the 
interaction of light with electrons in a 
semiconductor device or cell. Solar 
photovoltaic technology in the form o f PV 
solar panels provides a reliable source of 
clean renewable electricity which is 
generated at or near the point of use and is 
increasingly cost competitive with grid 
electricity.  
Planning brief  A document prepared by the local authority 
in advance of  a planning application being 
made, which explains which planning 
policies will be relevant to a particular site.  
Planning Obligations  Planning obligations are contributions from 
developers, either in the form of physical 
works and/or financial payments t o fulfil a 
range of functions, including to mitigate the 
impact of a development and to make 
development acceptable in planning 
terms.   Planning obligations may be agreed 
through a unilateral agreement or legal 
agreement, under Section 106 of the Town 
and Country Planning Act 1990.   
Planning Practice Guidance  Web based guidance which provides further 
detail on national planning policy.  
Policies Map  The Policies Map illustrates various policy 
designations identified in the Local Plan.  
Primary Shopping Area  Spatial designations that contain the 
greatest concentration of A1 shops within a 
Town Centre; are the most accessible part 
of the Town Centre; and are key to 
protecting the character and function of 
Town Centres, ensuring their continued 
vibrancy, vi tality and viability.  
Priority species  Species that are a conservation priority 
because they are under particular threat, or 
they are characteristic of a particular region.  
Private open space  Land within the curtilage of an existing 
property, including private gardens and 
amenity space. Private Open Space does 
not include privately -owned space that is 
wholly or partly publicly -accessible - this is 
included within the definition of open space.  
Protected species  Certain plant and animal species protected 
to various degrees in law, particularly the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981 (as 
amended).  
Protected views  Protected views include strategic and local 
views, and views of local landmarks within 
and across Islington. These views provide a 
view of St. Paul’s and/or a unique 
panoramic view of Islington and other parts 
of London, or, in the case of local  
357 
 landmarks,  provide a view of the landmark 
as part of the broader townscape 
(particularly street level views).  
Public House  An establishment generally featuring a bar 
and/or other public rooms licensed for the 
sale and consumption of alcohol on the 
premises, which c aters for a wide range of 
people within local communities and 
beyond.  
Public open space  Public open space is open space which is 
wholly or partly publicly -accessible but can 
include privately -owned spaces to which the 
public have some level/degree of acc ess, 
including un -adopted civic spaces and 
roads.  
Public realm  The space between, around and within 
buildings that is publicly accessible, 
including streets, squares, forecourts, parks 
and open spaces.  
Purpose Built Private Rented Sector  A specific business model of residential 
development where non -owner -occupied 
self-contained dwellings are built with the 
intention of being rented out as housing, 
(rather than sold) from the outset. Also 
known as 'build to rent'.  
Rainwater harvesting/recycling  Rainwater harvesting or recycling is the 
accumulation and storage of rainwater from 
hard surfaces and roofs for re -use on -site, 
rather than allowing it to run off. Stored 
rainwater can be used for irrigation of soft 
landscaping or it can be treated and 
recycle d for internal use, such as toilet 
flushing.  
Regeneration  The economic, social and environmental 
renewal and improvement of a site or area.  
Registered Provider  Registered organisations such as local 
authority landlords and private registered

associations and for -profit organisations) 
who let and manage social housing. 
Registration is governed through national 
legislation.  
Renewable energy  Energy derived from a source that is 
continually replenished, such as w ind, 
wave, solar, hydroelectric and energy from 
plant material, but not fossil fuels or nuclear 
energy.

building or site that is included in the 
Schedule of Monuments kept by the  
358 
 Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media 
and Sport. The regime i s set out in the 
Ancient Monuments and Archaeological 
Areas Act 1979.  
Secondary heat  Processes or activities that produce heat 
which is normally wasted (for example heat 
from the London Underground network) or 
from heat that exists naturally within the 
environment (air, ground and water). Useful 
energy can be recovered from these 
sources in the form of heat.  
Section 106 Agreements  Planning obligations are legally binding 
agreements typically negotiated between 
local authorities and developers in the 
context of planning applications. They are a 
mechanism by which measures are secured 
to make acceptable development which 
would otherwi se be unacceptable in 
planning terms.  
Secured by Design  A UK Police initiative focused on designing 
out crime to improve the safety and security 
of buildings and their surroundings.  
Sequential Test (flooding)  The NPPF requires that all plans apply a 
sequential, risk -based approach to the 
location of development, taking into account 
the current and future impacts of climate 
change to avoid flood risk to people and 
property. The aim of the sequential test is to 
ensure that areas at little or no risk of 
flooding from any source are developed in 
preference to areas at higher risk.  
Shared Heat Network   A heat network created as part of a new 
development which includes the connec tion 
of neighbouring buildings.  
Shared Ownership  Intermediate ownership product which 
allows households to purchase a share in a 
new home and pay rent on the remaining, 
unsold, share. Eligibility for shared 
ownership is subject to an income cap.  
Shared space  An approach to street design that seeks to 
improve the pedestrian environment by 
decluttering and reducing the impact of 
vehicular traffic to encourage/promote 
walking and cycling. This includes the 
removal of features such as kerbs, road 
surface markings,  designated crossing 
places and traffic signs.  
Single surface  A type of shared space involving the 
removal of kerbs between the footway and 
carriageway to create a shared surface for 
pedestrians and other vehicles and cyclists. 
Single surface includes no n-physical 
delineation such as tactile paving and or a 
tonal contrast.   
359 
 Site allocation  As specified in the Town and Country 
Planning (Local Planning) (England) 
Regulations 2012, a site allocation policy is 
‘a policy which allocates a site for a 
particular  use or development’. Site specific 
policies are set out for land and buildings on 
sites which are likely to be subject to 
development proposals during the lifetime 
of the plan, to help secure specific land 
uses, meet identified development needs 
and/or en sure the infrastructure required to 
support growth is in place.  
Site of Importance for Nature Conservation  Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINCs) are areas designated for their 
importance for wildlife, biodiversity and 
access to nature. SINCs  are graded in 
terms of importance, with Metropolitan 
grade being the highest grade, then 
Borough Grade 1, Borough Grade 2 and 
Sites of Local Importance. Sites of 
Metropolitan Importance are those which 
contain the best examples of London’s 
habitats and ra re species that are of 
significance to London. Sites of Borough 
Importance are those identified to have an 
importance to Islington, and any damage 
would mean a significant loss to the 
borough. A site of Local Importance is 
identified because of its value t o the nearby 
community, especially in areas that are 
deficient in wildlife sites.  
Small and Medium Enterprises  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) (as 
defined by European Commission 
Recommendation 2003/361/EC) are 
businesses/organisations with between 10 
and 49 employees (small enterprise) or 51 
and 250 employees (medium enterprise). 
SME floorspace/workspace/units would 
therefore be space which can 
accommodate SMEs and enable the 
effective operation of a small or medium 
enterprise.  
Small shops/retail unit  A shop unit of around 80sqm gross internal 
area or less, which is particularly suitable 
for small and independent retailers.  
Smart Cities  The use of data and technology to improve 
the performance of infrastructure networks

enhance quality of life for people living and 
working in such areas.   
360 
 Social and community infrastructure  Infrastructure that is  available to, and 
serves the needs of, local communities and 
others, which is often funded in some way 
by a grant or investment from a government 
department, public body and/or the 
voluntary sector. Social and community 
facilities comprises a wide variety  of 
facilities/buildings including those which 
accommodate social services such as day -
care centres, luncheon clubs, and drop -in 
centres; education and training facilities 
including early years providers, nurseries, 
schools, colleges and universities; chil dren 
and young peoples ’ play facilities; health 
facilities; youth centres; libraries; community 
meeting facilities; community halls; places 
of worship; sport, leisure and recreation 
facilities; and policing facilities. Social and 
community infras tructure g enerally falls 
within Use Classes C2, D1 or D2, and 
possibly some Sui Generis uses. This list is 
not intended to be exhaustive and other 
facilities can be included as social and 
community infrastructure.  
Social rented housing  Low cost rented homes provide d to 
households whose needs are not met by 
the market, typically by councils and 
housing associations, with rents set within 
guidelines issued by the social housing 
regulator.  
Social value  The delivery of positive social, economic 
and environmental impacts, arising from the 
actions and operations of various 
organisations. This includes the direct 
effects of interventions and the wider effects 
on other areas, particularly the effects on 
the local economy and the health and 
wellbeing of local residents.  
Source Protection Zones  Areas of influence around groundwater 
sources used for public drinking which 
provide additional protection to safeguard 
drinking water quality, through constraining 
the proximity of an activity that may impact 
upon a drinking water abstraction.  
Spatial policies  These focus on a specific part of the 
borough.  
Spatial strategy  The development strategy for a specific 
area.  
Specialist housing  Term covering a variety of forms of housing 
which purports to meet the needs of specific

housing is informed by specific identified 
needs.   
361 
 Specialist Shopping Area  Unique retail areas featuring specialist retail 
uses that add significant character, vitality 
and viability to the Town Centres and wider 
area in which they are located. They draw 
shoppers from outside the borough due to 
the more bespoke nature of the goods on 
offer.  
Standard Assessment Procedure  The Standard Assessment Procedure 
(SAP) is the methodology used by the UK 
Government to assess and compare the 
energy and environmental performance of 
dwellings. Its purpose is to provide accurate 
and reliable assessments of dwelling 
energy performances that are needed to 
underpi n energy and environmental policy 
initiatives.  
Starter Homes  Starter Homes are similar to the Discounted 
Market Sale affordable product. They are 
covered by various statutory requirements, 
including an income cap (£90,000 in 
Greater London), price cap (£4 50,000 in 
Greater London, which includes the 
minimum 20% discount) and age 
restrictions (Starter Homes can only be 
purchased by qualifying first time buyers 
aged between 23 and 40, although limited 
exceptions apply). Also, Starter Homes 
have a set period d uring which the home 
needs to be sold at a set discount, although 
this discount is not recycled following the 
end of the discount period.  
Statement of Licensing Policy  A document prepared by the local authority 
under the Licensing Act 2003, which sets 
out what considerations the local authority 
will take into account in making its licensing 
decisions.  
Strategic infrastructure  Strategic infrastructure covers the areas of 
transport and the public realm, waste, 
utilities, and climate change adaptation and 
mitigation measures.  
Strategic policies  Policies which set out an overall strategy for 
the pattern, scale and quality of 
development in the borough.  
Structural Method Statement  Document required as part of applications 
for basement development, which ensures 
that the basement development can be 
undertaken safely and will safeguard the 
structural stability of the existing building 
and other nearby buildings.  
Studio/bedsit  A residential unit which is self -contained but 
which has no permanent separation 
between sleeping and living space.   
362 
 Supplementary planning documents  Supplementary planning documents  (SPDs)  
provide further guidance on Local Plan 
policies. They do not form part of the 
Development Plan and are not subject to 
independent examination.  
Supported housing  Supported housing can take many forms 
and helps to meet the needs of those 
people unable to live independently or those 
who are at risk or vulnerable. There are 
specific needs across a wide range of 
supported housing types including 
perma nent, long term and shorter term time 
scales which meet temporary need. In 
planning use class terms, supported 
housing may be considered Sui Generis, C2 
or C3 and would usually be considered 
exempt from (or be provided instead of) 
affordable housing requir ements.  
Sustainability Appraisal  Under section 19(5) of the Planning and 
Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, a 
Sustainability Appraisal (SA) must be 
undertaken for new or revised Development 
Plan Documents. The SA should include an 
assessment of the likely significant impacts 
- economic, social  and environmental - of 
the plan. The SA of the Local Plan is 
contained within the Integrated Impact 
Assessment.  
Sustainable Design and Construction 
Statement  Document which accompanies planning 
applications, detailing how the application 
meets all relev ant sustainable design 
policies. It can comprise a range of specific 
strategies/assessments.  
Sustainable development  Development that meets the needs of the 
present without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their own needs.  
Sustainable transport  Alternative modes of transport to the private 
car, primarily walking, cycling and public 
transport.  
Sustainable Urban Drainage System  A means of managing surface water 
drainage to reduce peak run -off rates and 
improve water quality.  They can also 
contribute to a higher quality, more 
attractive public realm by creating attractive 
landscape features; reduce the need for 
artificial watering of trees and landscaped 
areas; and create wildlife habitat such as 
small ponds.  
Tall buildings  Buildings of more than 30 metres, or those 
that are more than twice the contextual 
reference height of surrounding context 
(whichever is the lesser).   
363 
 Tenure blind  The principle that dwellings of different 
tenures should be designed to be 
indistinguishable . 
Town Centres  A defined area of predominantly retail, 
leisure, business and other main town 
centre uses. Town centres in Islington have 
a primary shopping area where the core 
retail uses are focused. Islington has both 
Major and District Town Centres. The 
hierarchy of Town Centres is designated in 
the London Plan and their boundaries 
shown on Islington's Policies Map.  
Tree Preservation Order  A Tree Preservation Order is an order made 
by a local planning authority in England to 
protect specific trees, g roups of trees or 
woodlands in the interests of amenity.  
Ultra -low NOx gas boiler  A gas boiler which emits very low levels of 
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), below a specified 
level.  
Urban Fabric  The physical form of the built environment 
in towns and cities.  
Urban Greening Factor  A planning tool to ensure new 
developments provide adequate urban 
greening.  
Urban Heat Island Effect  The urban heat island effect is caused by 
extensive built up areas absorbing and 
retaining heat during the day and night 
leading to  temperatures in some parts of 
London being several degrees warmer than 
the surrounding area  
Use Classes  The Town and Country Planning (Use 
Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) puts 
uses of land and buildings into various 
categories known as 'Use Classes'. It  is 
generally the case that planning permission 
is required to change from one use class to 
another, although certain permitted 
development rights exist which allow some 
uses to change without planning 
permission.  
Vacant Building Credit  A financial credit  equivalent to the existing 
gross floorspace of relevant vacant 
buildings, deducted from any affordable 
housing contribution sought.   
Vertical greening/green wall  Vertical greening, otherwise known as a 
green wall, is a building façade or other 
internal or external wall partially or 
completely covered with vegetation for 
functional and aesthetic purposes. A green 
wall can be attached to an existing building 
façade, or be a free standing structure. 
Planting can be rooted in soil from both 
ground level and roof level planters, or the 
green wall can be part of a vertical or  
364 
 modular system. Green walls provide 
benefits in terms of biodiversity, air quality, 
thermal effic iency and cooling, and they can 
reduce surface water runoff where they are 
irrigated via rainwater runoff.  
Viability  Viability – in a retail sense - is a measure of 
the ability and capacity to grow and develop 
the role of a retail area and bolster 
economi c activity. This factors in whether 
the area has scope to respond to changing 
dynamics in the retail sector. Factors that 
influence viability include the introduction of 
uses which detract from the existing mix of 
uses and affect any agglomeration benefits ; 
uses which reduce footfall to particular parts 
of centres; and uses which affect perception 
of safety and occurrence of crime. Viability 
is intrinsically linked with vitality.  
Visitable  Premises that are designed to enable a 
wheelchair user to approach enter, 
participate in an event 
(social/economic/cultural) use the sanitary 
facilities and leave safely; such premises 
are not necessarily wheelchair accessible 
throughout.  
Visitor accommodation  Visitor accommodation refers to any 
building or place that pr ovides temporary or 
short term accommodation on a commercial 
basis. This includes hotels, hostels, bed and 
breakfasts, guesthouses, some apart -
hotels, youth/backpackers hostels and any 
other visitor accommodation model that 
meets this definition; this incl udes proposals 
for the short -term letting of residential units 
for 90 days or more per annum. Visitor 
accommodation generally falls within the C1 
use class, but can in some instances be 
classed as a sui generis use.  
Vitality  Vitality - in a retail sense - is the ability of a 
retail area to maintain economic activity in 
the face of potential impacts. Vitality is 
inherently linked with viability and is largely 
affected by the same factors as viability.  
Whole life -cycle approach  A whole life -cycle approach captures a 
building’s operational emissions from 
energy consumption (regulated and 
unregulated) and its embodied emissions.  
Wildlife corridor  Areas of habitat connecting wildlife 
populations.  
Windfall sites  A site that is not specifically allocated for 
development in a Development Plan, but
