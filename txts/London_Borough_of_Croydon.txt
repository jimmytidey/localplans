The Croydon Local Plan 2018 is the most important planning 
policy document for the borough and provides an exciting and 
deliverable vision for Croydon up to 2036. It brings together the 
Strategic Policies with the Detailed Policies and Proposals. Our 
Local Plan has ‘Ambitious for Croydon’ enshrined in the overall 
vision, objectives and policies to ensure Croydon continues to be 
an attractive and thriving place for all who live, work and visit. 
Most importantly, the Local Plan will enable increasing the supply 
of homes through sustainable growth (together with affordable 
homes), and the renewal and regeneration of the borough’s 
District Centres and the Croydon Opportunity Area.  
We are pleased that Croydon Local Plan 2018 has now been 
found sound by the Planning Inspectorate. The Local Plan 
demonstrates how sustainable growth of Croydon’s suburbs can 
increase the supply of new homes, including affordable housing 
whilst continuing to protect the borough’s important green spaces 
and heritage and cultural assets that make the 16 Places of 
Croydon and our neighbourhoods so special and the valued 
places that they are. It shows how Croydon will evolve sustainably 
from 2016 to 2036 setting out the policies that will guide 
development and the sites that we expect to be developed to help 
meet the need for new homes, jobs, schools, healthcare, leisure 
and other essential facilities and infrastructure we need across the 
borough. 
The Croydon Local Plan 2018 also supports the Council’s Growth 
Zone, which is essential to the whole borough. Our Growth Zone 
will benefit from the Local Plan allowing for development that underpins the Growth Zone and the plans for the infrastructure the 
Growth Zone will deliver with partners. 
This Council believes in people focussed planning, making 
Croydon a better borough to live, work and visit from stepping out 
of your front door, going to the local shop, community hall or 
school or visiting your Neighbourhood Centre, District Centres or 
Croydon Opportunity Area for restaurants, shops, work and 
entertainment. As part of our commitment to people focussed 
planning the Croydon Local Plan 2018 has been developed in 
consultation with local communities and stakeholders across the 
borough and we thank everyone who has been involved in the 
making of the Croydon Local Plan 2018. We hope that you 
continue to be engaged in planning in Croydon. 
The Croydon Local Plan Review  is an important planning policy 
document for the borough and provides an exciting and 
deliverable vision for Croydon up to 2039. The Local Plan Review 
details how the borough intend to deliver good growth while 
ensuring the unique character of the borough is protected and 
enhanced. Whilst the impact of Covid-19 has had a significant 
change to the way Croydonians choose to live and work, the 
Croydon Local Plan Review is reflective of this change and 
considers how our environments and economic growth will evolve 
to suit the growing needs of our communities.  Our priority as a 
Council is to plan for future growth, so that development makes a 
lasting and positive impact on communities and opens up new 
opportunities for our people.  
The Local Plan sets out a vision and policies about infrastructure 
provision, housing delivery, employment opportunities and  
 protection of our environment. Our Local Plan has our corporate 
vision;  ‘Choose Your Future’ encompassed in the overall vision, 
objectives and policies to ensure Croydon continues to be a place 
of prospect and a thriving place for all who live, work and visit. The 
policies will guide development and the sites that we expect to be 
developed to help meet the need for new homes, jobs, schools, 
healthcare, and leisure and other essential facilities and 
infrastructure we need across the borough.  
The Croydon Local Plan Review supports the Council’s Growth 
Zone and the renewal of the borough’s District Centres and the 
Croydon Opportunity Area which are essential to the whole 
borough. The 16 places of Croydon provide the landscape for 
good growth that will establish the right development in the right 
places at the right scale, creating attractive sustainable 
neighbourhoods as well as new economic opportunities allowing 
Croydon to remain consistent with future demand and need.  This 
approach is supplemented by three new transformation areas – 
The Purley Way, Brighton Main Line and East Croydon 
Transformation Corridor and the North End Quarter.    
The Croydon Local Plan Review supports the development of a 
prosperous and innovative economy thriving communities and 
acts as an exemplar to sustaining a great quality of life.  This is a 
plan for the kind of borough we want to enjoy in the future. 
As part of our commitment to people focussed planning the 
Croydon Local Plan Review has been developed in consultation 
with local communities and stakeholders across the borough.  We 
thank everyone who has been involved in the making of the 
Croydon Local Plan Review. We hope that you continue to be 
engaged in planning in Croydon and we can continue the 
conversation with you.

 How to use this Document  
The Croydon Local Plan 2018 is broken down into 12 sections 
with a Glossary and other Appendices at the back. Section 1,  the 
introduction, sets out the context and purpose of the Croydon 
Local Plan. Section 2  sets the scene and looks at the borough’s 
historical context, demographic factors, the regional context and 
drivers for change. Section 3  lays out Croydon’s overarching long 
term spatial vision, accompanying strategic objectives, the 
overarching Places of Croydon policy and the Key Diagram. 
Sections 4 to 10  set out the thematic strategies that will ensure 
delivery of the strategic objectives and realisation of the spatial 
vision. These sections start with a Strategic Policy and are then 
followed by a set of more Detailed Policies that provide further 
details as to how the thematic strategies will be delivered. A guide 
to the Strategic Policies and the Detailed Policies and how to use 
and interpret them can be found below. See below for more 
information on how to use and interpret these sections. Section 
11 shows what Strategic Policies and Detailed Policies will mean 
for the 16 Places of Croydon, setting out the Places vision, 
summarising the opportunities and constraints and the changes 
that can be expected to take place up to 2036. This section also 
sets out Place Specific Policies and Detailed Proposals (sites that 
the Croydon Local Plan allocates for development) for each Place. 
A guide to the Place-Specific Policies and the Detailed Proposals 
and how to use and interpret them can be found below. Finally 
Section 12  explains how the policies proposed will be delivered. 
This is closely linked to the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which in 
comprehensive detail outlines how infrastructure required to 
support the Strategic Policies will be delivered. This section also 
links to the Monitoring Framework for the Croydon Local Plan 
2018 to measure the effectiveness of the policies.

The Strategic Policies
Strategic Policies start with the prefix ‘SP…’ These policies are 
broken down by a series of headings phrased as statements: 
‘Where we want to be’, How we are going to get there’ (this is 
where the strategy and policies are set out), ‘What it will look like’, 
and ‘Why we have taken this approach’. 
Where we want to be 
This looks at the key issues and priorities; it articulates the issues 
and strategic objectives needed to contribute to the delivery of the 
overall spatial vision, Croydon’s Sustainable Community Strategy 
priorities and the desired policy direction. 
How we are going to get there 
This sets out the proposed strategic policy for achieving the 
strategic objectives. These provide the strategic planning policies 
that provide the opportunity for the production of Neighbourhood 
Plans. This will enable communities to influence the planning of 
their Place, in conformity with Strategic Policies. 
What it will look like 
This shows the spatial elements of the strategic  policy on a map. 
Why we have taken this approach 
Here we set out our reasoned justification for the policy citing 
evidence and rationale. 
The Detailed Policies 
Detailed Policies start with the prefix ‘DM…’ These policies are 
broken down by a series of headings that as follows: 
 Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan 
strategic policies;  
 Why we need this policy;  
 The policy itself  
 How the policy works; and  
 Key supporting documents.  
The Place-specific policies (including the detailed 
proposals) 
For each Place of Croydon there is a vision, summarising the 
opportunities and constraints and the changes that can be 
expected to take place up to 2036. This is followed by a Place-
specific policy (prefixed with ‘DM…’ for which the following 
information is provided: 
 A description of the general character of the Place;  
 The policy wording;  
 A full description of how the policy works; and  
 A list of all the detailed proposal sites in each place 
including the proposed use on each site.  
A guide to how the detailed proposals were identified can be found 
in Appendix 6 and a schedule containing further details of each 
site including indicative unit numbers and phasing can be found in 
Appendix 7.

 1. Introduction  
1.1 Croydon is a growing borough. It is already the most populous 
borough in London and aims to be London’s most enterprising 
borough. Planning is critical to ensuring that Croydon meets the 
needs of its residents, business community and visitors. The 
Croydon Local Plan sets out the strategy, sites and planning 
policies necessary to meet these needs. 
1.2 The Croydon Local Plan 2018 is a key document in Croydon’s 
Local Plan. It sets out the spatial vision and plan for the future of 
the borough and how it will be delivered. 
1.3 Croydon needs a spatial plan to rise to the challenges facing 
the borough and its communities over the next 20 years and 
beyond. The borough has a need for new homes, jobs and the 
infrastructure to support them, whilst respecting the context of the 
Places of Croydon. The Croydon Local Plan 2018 addresses each 
of these needs and sets out how Croydon will plan to meet them 
up to 2036 .  Increasing the supply of homes through sustainable 
growth, including affordable homes, is a key element of Ambitious 
for Croydon, which is enshrined throughout the Croydon Local 
Plan.  In part, the sustainable growth of the suburbs will deliver 
this growth as encouraged by this Plan.  This will be achieved 
whilst protecting the borough’s open space and the distinctive 
heritage and character, alongside the necessary infrastructure to 
mitigate the impact of growth. The Croydon Local Plan 2018 sets 
out the issues that the Plan as a whole is addressing and the 
strategic policy framework.  
1.4 In preparing the Croydon Local Plan 2018 and this review the 
Council has worked with partners and interested parties to devise 
policies and proposals that it thinks will best address the needs of 
the borough up to 2036. As part of this process the Council has drawn upon an extensive evidence base referenced throughout 
this document and the comments made during consultation on 
drafts of the Plan s. The Strategic Policies have been subject to 
four periods of consultation. It started out with an Issues and 
Options consultation in July 2009 followed by two consultations on 
Preferred Option in February 2010 and September 2010, which 
led to their adoption in April 2013 after independent examination. 
A Partial Review of the Strategic Policies has been subject to 
further consultation on Preferred and Alternative Options in 
November 2015. The Detailed Policies were subject to two 
periods of consultation, both on Preferred and Alternative Options, 
one in October 2012 and the next in November 2015. The 
November 2015 consultation also included all of the Detailed 
Proposals.  This review of the Croydon Local Plan 2018 has been 
undertaken since it was adopted in accordance with the Statement 
of Community Involvement and the Local Development Scheme  
1.5 Between February and November 2017 an independent 
Planning Inspector examined the Strategic Policies and found 
them to be positively prepared, justified, effective and consistent 
with national policy as well as complying with the relevant 
legislation and regulations. 
1.6 The Croydon Local Plan 2018 is accompanied by a number of 
other documents which together form the development plan for 
Croydon and supporting documents. Table 1.1 shows the different 
scales of documents forming Croydon’s planning policy 
framework. The Strategic Policies in the Croydon Local Plan 2018 
set the framework that provides the opportunity for the production 
of Neighbourhood Plans. This will enable communities to influence 
the planning of their Place, in conformity with Croydon’s Strategic 
Policies.

 2. Setting the scene  
‘Setting the Scene’ picture break 
2.1 The Croydon Local Plan addresses the needs of the borough for new homes and jobs plus the infrastructure needed to support growth 
from 2011 up to 2036. Determining what these needs are begins with understanding how Croydon became the borough that it was in 2011 
and by looking at the challenges it will face from 2011 up to 2036.  
18 
 Historical context 
2.2 Croydon historically was a market town, which in the 
medieval period benefited from the presence of an Archbishop’s 
residence and key trading links with the outlying villages of 
Addington, Sanderstead and Coulsdon to the south. A period of 
prosperity in the 18th century saw the development of 
settlements at Broad Green, Woodside and Thornton Heath. 
Construction of the pioneering Surrey Iron Railway in 1801-03, 
initially between Wandsworth and Croydon, created new links for 
the thriving manufacturing industries along the Wandle Valley. 
The borough’s character was fundamentally changed by the 
arrival of railway connections to London in 1839 and then 
Brighton in 1841, with new stations appearing along the line later 
in the century promoting the rapid development of town centres 
at Thornton Heath, Norbury and South Norwood. Stations at 
Purley and Coulsdon likewise encouraged growth of both towns 
and suburbs. Croydon was incorporated as a borough in 1883 
and with subsequent civic enthusiasm rebuilding took place 
across its towns through the proceeding decades with new 
buildings and parks. By 1914, the borough had become 
contiguous with central London. 
2.3 1915 saw the arrival of the world’s first international terminal 
building at Croydon Airport (the original London airport); resulting 
in the subsequent development of industry to the west of the 
town. A developing road and public transport system also paved 
the way for suburban expansion further to the south and south 
eastern edge of the borough, which was newly accessible by car. 
As a consequence, areas of the countryside were developed for 
house building, a trend that stopped with the introduction of the 
Green Belt. The town experienced its most dramatic 
transformation following the Croydon Corporation Act of 1957. 
Redevelopment led to an unparalleled office boom, with almost 
500,000m2 of office space built or given permission in the town between 1957 and 1964. Private developers also took advantage 
of new commercial opportunities, with the Whitgift Foundation 
notably relocating the Trinity School out of the town to release its 
11 acres of land for a large new shopping centre between North 
End and Wellesley Road, which itself was being transformed into 
an urban motorway. 
2.4 Increased emphasis from central government on allowing out 
of town shopping areas through the 1980’s and 90’s resulted in a 
new retail area growing along the A23 (Purley Way). A new 
station at East Croydon was built in 1992, and Tramlink, in 2000, 
providing much needed additional transport infrastructure across 
the borough from east to west. From the 1970s, however, 
Croydon Town Centre suffered a period of gradual decline as the 
Modernist vision fell out of favour and with the launch of a new 
office district at Canary Wharf. Central government’s increased 
emphasis on out of town shopping areas through the 1980’s and 
90’s resulted in a new retail area growing along the A23 (Purley 
Way).  Croydon is changing the reputation it received as a result 
of its post-war development endeavours. As it became clear that 
the vehicular transport system previously central to the Modernist 
vision was unsustainable, new public transport infrastructure was 
developed as part of a new vision. The new East Croydon 
railway station was opened in 1992 and the Croydon Tramlink 
(introduced 2000) provided improved transport links. A series of 
detailed masterplans have already been drawn up for Croydon 
Town Centre and supported the Croydon Local Plan 2018 too. 
These lie at the heart of a new wave of transformation across the 
Town Centre 
19 
   
Croydon Today .in 2011 
2.5 By 2011 Croydon as a borough had many strengths and 
opportunities. It also faced some challenges too, which the 
Croydon Local Plan sets out to address. 
2.6 By 2011 Croydon had become is a borough of contrasts. It 
was a borough with a series of distinct places from Victorian 
railway suburbs in the north and along the railway line in the 
valley, towards Purley and Coulsdon to 20th century suburbs on 
wooded hillsides in the south and away from the railway line in 
the east.  The challenge for the Croydon Local Plan is to respect 
local character and distinctiveness whilst accommodating 
growth.  Croydon already has  all the right ingredients. It is one of 
the top retail and commercial centres in London and enjoys 
some of the best transport connections in the UK, with London’s 
only tram system; 15 minute rail connections from East Croydon 
Station to central London, on ly 20 minutes to Gatwick and 
connections to London Overground at West Croydon. The 
borough is renowned for its long and rich cultural history, 
including fostering the birth of Punk, Dubstep and Grime. 
Institutions such as The Fairfield Halls, Croydon Art C ollege, and 
the Brits School have fostered and showcased world class 
creative talent. Croydon plays host to an increasing number of 
festivals and events, celebrating its diverse mix of cultures; in 
December 2018, Croydon was named as one of the Mayor of 
London’s first Creative Enterprise Zones (CEZ) to further 
establish it as a place where creative industries flourish and 
grow. The newly refurbished Fairfield Halls lies at the centre of 
the emerging Cultural Quarter, acting as a further catalyst for 
culture  within the borough. Croydon was named as the Mayor of 
London’s Borough of Culture for the year 2023  2.7 In Croydon Metropolitan Centre the borough has more shops 
in one location than anywhere else in London apart from the 
West End itself. However, in 2011 they faced stiff competition 
from other centres such as Bromley, Kingston and Bluewater. 
The Metropolitan Centre had more office floor space than 
anywhere else in South London and neighbouring districts in 
Surrey, but many of the offices in Croydon were seen as dated 
and vacancy had increased. Croydon competes against more 
recent office developments in Docklands, Redhill and 
surrounding boroughs. The challenge for the Croydon Local Plan 
includes rejuvenating a dated Croydon Metropolitan Centre and 
growing a new residential community and jobs. Improvements to 
the public realm in the Metropolitan Centre to attract shoppers, 
employers, workers and new residents are vital to its 
regeneration and future vitality.  Croydon Town centre is dated 
and unattractive to shoppers, employers, workers and new 
residents. In some areas progress has been made, for example 
the Ruskin Square development around East Croydon Station. 
This development is just under a quarter the size of Canary 
Wharf. Additionally, Croydon’s Town Centre was designated only 
the second Growth Zone nationally. This released over £500M to 
finance and deliver a major regeneration programme to unlock 
further growth in the centre and beyond  
2.8 The growth of retailing along the Purley Way leads to its own 
challenges of traffic congestion at peak times. The Purley Way 
employment areas are prime locations owing to their accessibility 
to the M25 and the rest of London and the Mayor of London's 
strategic employment protection recognises the demand for 
industrial premises in Croydon. The challenge for the Strategic 
Policies are to address ways of reducing traffic impact and 
making the shift from private transport to more sustainable 
modes of transport.  
20 
  
Figure 2.1: Deprivation in Croydon relative to the rest of England  
  
 
21 
 2.9 In 2011 the borough ranked as the 14th least deprived 
borough in London (out of 33 authorities). Deprivation levels, 
however, differ greatly, with greater concentrations in the north of 
the borough and in the places of Addington and Shirley. The 
Victorian and Edwardian areas of the borough suffer from 
deprivation as do some of the inter and post-war local authority 
built housing estates. In general the south and east of the 
borough incorporate some of the least deprived areas of London. 
The challenge for the Strategic Policies is to reduce social, 
economic and environmental deprivation, look at measures to 
reduce unemployment, improve skills and education, community 
and environmental conditions and renew housing. 
2.10 By 2011 Croydon was the largest borough in London in 
terms of population (with a population of 363,000 people) and 
was expected to grow by 30,000 people by 2031. They will need 
to have homes in which to live.  By 2019 Croydon was the second 
largest borough in London in terms of population1. Croydon is 
home to 396,837 people2 and this is expected to increase to just 
under 500,0003 by 2050. They will need to have homes in which 
to live.  
2.11 Demographically Croydon is a young borough and in 2011 
a quarter of its residents were under the age of 20 . 
Demographically, Croydon is a young borough and in 2019 just 
under a quarter of its residents were under the age of 174. 
However, the residents of the borough are getting older and by 
2031 the number of people in Croydon over the age of 65 will 
                                            
 
 
 
 
 
 have increased by 41% which will bring with it challenges in 
terms of the types of homes that are needed in the borough and 
the infrastructure needed to support an aging population. In 
contrast, the population aged between 20 and 64 will have 
increased by just 2.5%5. By 2031 Croydon will also be a more 
diverse borough with over half of the population being a member 
of a black and minority ethnic community6, compared to 36% in 
20017. The challenge for the Strategic Policies is to meet the 
needs of the population growth, the aging population and the 
cultural diversity. 
2.12 The Green Belt around Croydon together with the 
protection of open spaces elsewhere in the borough has ensured 
that over a third of the borough is open space. Whilst this is an 
asset, it is also a constraint for the borough as it limits the land 
available for new homes to house Croydon's growing population. 
The open space is unevenly distributed in the borough creating 
some areas, mainly to the north, with degrees of deficiency in 
access to nature and/or open space. The challenge for the 
Croydon Local Plan is to ensure access and quality of existing 
open space is improved whilst making the most of the natural 
resources and adapting to climate change. 
Croydon in the wider sub-region 
2.13 The future of Croydon needs to be viewed in the context of 
growth and development in London and the south east of

 England. At a London level, direction is provided by the Mayor of 
London through the London Plan. 
2.14 Croydon has responded to the Mayor's policy direction in 
the London Plan to work with neighbouring local authorities and 
cross borough issues have been considered by the Croydon 
Local Plan. Looking ahead it will be important for Croydon to 
build positive relationships with the Wandle Valley regional co-
ordination corridor (through south London and outwards towards 
Gatwick Airport) and the Brighton to London corridor, which 
includes working closely with the Coast to Capital Local 
Enterprise Partnership of which Croydon is a member. 
2.15 A summary of how Croydon relates to the wider sub-region 
is shown in Figure 2.3  below.

 3. We are Croydon  
‘Spatial Vision, Objectives’ picture break 
3.1 This section sets out how the sustainable priorities contained within the Sustainable Community Strategy together with the overarching 
‘We are Croydon’ vision are embedded into the Croydon Local Plan. A complimentary Spatial Vision sets out how Croydon will develop 
over the next 20 years in response to the local challenges and opportunities. The Spatial Vision is translated into a set of Strategic 
Objectives which have informed a series of thematic policies, sub visions for the 16 Places of Croydon, the programmes of delivery 
(including a schedule of infrastructure projects) and the accompanying monitoring framework.  
27 
 Past Visions  
3.2 The Croydon Local Plan builds upon the historic visions of the 
past, some realised, such as the Croydon Board of Public Health 
in 1849 and the comprehensive developments of the ‘sixties, and 
others, such as Vision 2020 and Alsop's 'Third City' vision. These 
historic visions reveal the tension between Croydon’s large urban 
and suburban areas.  This paragraph is deleted . 
Imagine Croydon 
3.3 The ‘Imagine Croydon’ project that ran from February to 
September 2009, sought local views on what the overarching, 
long term vision for Croydon should be up to the year 2040. Over 
20,000 people were involved and the views received were 
distilled to articulate a new long term vision for the borough, 
entitled 'We are Croydon'. This paragraph is deleted . 
We are Croydon 
3.4 The 'We are Croydon' vision will be used by all partners as 
the touchstone for all future strategies and plans, including 
Croydon’s Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) prepared by 
Croydon’s  Congress (the Local Strategic Partnership). This 
paragraph is deleted . 
3.5 The government intends that the spatial vision and strategic 
objectives, as set out in the Croydon Local Plan, should foster 
growth, objectively establish and plan for development needs, 
whilst being informed by an analysis of the characteristics of the 
area, its constituent parts and the key issues and challenges 
facing them. It must be in general conformity with the London 
Plan and be consistent with national policy. It should also reflect 
the shared local priorities as set out in the SCS and 'We are 
Croydon' vision. The SCS identifies three overarching outcomes which the Local Strategic Partnership will focus on delivering. 
These three outcomes are: to make Croydon a great place to 
learn, work and live, a place of opportunity for everyone and a 
place with a vibrant and connected community and voluntary 
sector.  This paragraph is deleted . 
3.6 The overriding themes from the 'Imagine Croydon' 
consultation were that Croydon should be a place of opportunity, 
a place to belong and a place with a sustainable future.  This 
paragraph is deleted . 
The We are Croydon Vision  
Croydon’s vision is to be : 
 Enterprising:  A place renowned for its enterprise and 
innovation with a highly adaptable and skilled workforce and 
diverse and thriving local economy  
Learning :  A place that unleashes and nurtures local talent, is 
recognised for its support and opp ortunity for lifelong learning 
and ambitions for children and young people  
Creative:  A place that draws people to  its  culture and creativity 
– an inspiration and enabler  of new artistic and sporting talent 
in the country  
Connected:  A place that is wel l connected, easy to get to and 
around, and supported by infrastructure that enables people to 
easily come together,  with one of the best digital, 
communications and transport networks in the country  
Sustainable: A place that sets the pace amongst London  
boroughs on promoting environmental sustainability and where 
the natural environment forms the arteries and veins of the city   
28 
 The We are Croydon Vision  
Caring:  A place noted for its safety, openness and community 
spirit where all people are welcome to live and work and where 
individuals and communities are supported to fulfil their potential 
and deliver solutions for themselves  
Graphic removed 
3.7 The 'We are Croydon' vision together with the SCS has 
informed the final spatial vision and strategic objectives (set out 
in 3.15). The spatial vision and strategic objectives are used to 
guide the overall strategy and spatial choices about where 
developments should go in broad terms and how development 
should take place.  This paragraph is deleted . 
The Croydon Local Plan’s Spatial Vision 
3.8 In 2036, By the end of the plan period, we will be London’s 
most enterprising borough - a city that fosters ideas, innovation 
and learning and provides skills, opportunity and a sense of 
belonging for all; an enterprising borough  city, a Metropolitan 
Centre, a learning borough city, a creative borough city, a 
connected borough city, a sustainable borough city, and a caring 
borough city 
3.9 The historic legacy of Croydon as a major trading centre 
within the Wandle Valley and south of central London gives 
richness to its streets and public spaces. The ‘sixties boom' 
added many buildings with a range of varied and interesting 
attributes. New development in our borough has been respectful 
of this historic legacy, including enhancement and intensification 
of Croydon’s distinctive district centres and suburbs. Croydon’s 
suburbs will have sustainably grown to accommodate homes, 
including affordable homes, to contribute to the borough’s 
housing need.   3.10 Croydon Metropolitan Centre has a friendly atmosphere 
with a retail and commercial centre unrivalled south of the 
Thames, serving the wider Gatwick Diamond economic area 
following the comprehensive redevelopment of the retail core. 
The scope for growth and new enterprises to locate is significant 
and the Council will be continuing to create an environment for 
inward investment. Large numbers of people use its shops, 
businesses, leisure and cultural facilities and enjoy returning to it 
with its compact and convenient arrangement of large stores, 
(including a choice of department stores), multiples and brand 
shops as an alternative to central London or out- of-town centres. 
Historic areas such as Surrey Street, Church Street and George 
Street, South End and the area around West Croydon station 
boast bijou, independent and culturally diverse shops, markets 
and restaurants, all within easy walking distance of North End 
and Wellesley Road. The cultural offer within Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre stems from the recently refurbished Fairfield 
Halls and links through to Exchange Square. The public realm is 
high quality and encourages outdoor life, vitality and cultural 
activity. Many existing office blocks have been refurbished, 
converted or redeveloped into homes and a new residential 
community now resides in the centre which boasts an 
environment that is family friendly. The Council will continue to 
take a flexible approach to offices in the Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre becoming residential, whilst not undermining the 
opportunity for economic growth and office development around 
East Croydon Station and in New Town. 
3.11 Croydon’s connectivity has continued as its main strength, 
being outer London’s largest regional public transport 
interchange. Access to people, markets and goods, puts 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre at the top of the list of successful 
business centres. The upgrades to Brighton Mainline, rebuild of 
East Croydon station, the metroisation of the suburban services 
and continued investment into the Tram network have all  
29 
 assisted in retaining this status. The Square Mile and West End 
can be reached more quickly on public transport from Croydon 
than from most parts of east and west London. Croydon has the 
largest economy in the Wandle Valley and is the main business 
centre serving Gatwick Airport, supplying it with many of the 
people, skills and facilities it needs. Croydon’s relations with both 
Central London and the South Coast are stronger, providing an 
alternative, exciting place to do business, live and visit. 
3.12 In 2036, By the end of the plan perio d the borough’s 
District, Local, Neighbourhood Centres and local parades will still 
possess their unique characteristics and support the growing 
communities they serve. The Council’s regeneration, capital and 
public realm programmes will have enhanced the centres vitality 
and viability. Enterprise and leisure facilities in these areas 
contribute to diverse local economies. The economic growth of 
the borough has benefitted all sections of Croydon’s community 
and access to work has been increased. The richness of 
character of Croydon’s suburbs has been respectfully enhanced 
and intensified through demanding the best design from new 
development and having a deep understanding of the qualities 
places have for homes, open spaces, diversity, facilities and 
natural resources. Their easy access to the beautiful countryside 
of the North Downs is an important asset and a substantial factor 
in people’s decision to live in the borough. 
3.13  The borough has experienced an uplift in housing delivery 
to aid with alleviating borough’s pressing housing need. This has 
led to the increased opportunity for affordable housing 
throughout the borough. This housing delivery has occurred in 
sustainable locations, is supported by the necessary 
infrastructure and the growth has supported the vitality and 
viability of the borough’s centres.   3.14 The delivery of critical infrastructure, particularly in Croydon 
Opportunity Area, has been enabled by Croydon’s Growth Zone 
status and the Council’s willingness to embrace the opportunities 
presented by devolution to ensure delivery.      
30 
 Strategic Objectives 
3.15 The strategic objectives form the link between the high 
level spatial vision and the detailed strategy (made up from the 
thematic policies and the Places of Croydon section). They are 
the objectives needed to fulfil the spatial vision. The policies and 
delivery programme within the Croydon Local Plan show how 
this can be achieved within the plan period. 
A Place of Opportunity 
Strategic Objective 1:  Establish Croydon as the premier 
business location i n South London and the Gatwick Diamond.  
 
Strategic Objective 2:  Foster an environment where both 
existing, and new, innovative, cultural and creative enterprises 
can prosper.  
 
Strategic Objective 3:  Provide a choice of housing for people

 The Places of Growth in Croydon – strategic policy 
How we are going to get there 
 The Places of Croydon Growth in Croydon 2019-2039  
SP1.0A Growth in homes, jobs and services that constitutes 
sustainable development following a brownfield land first 
approach, will be welcomed, provided growth is directed to places 
with good concentrations of existing infrastructure or areas where 
there is capacity to grow with further infrastructure and following 
the good growth principles. Across the borough growth will be 
accommodated as follows:  
Targets for growth up to 2039  
a) A minimum of 41, 580 homes will be delivered (2019 -2039) 
to address future demographic and economic needs. Of 
these, 6410 homes (641 dpa) will be del ivered on small sites 
(below 0.25ha) and at  least 20,790 homes by March 2029.  
b) The Croydon Opportunity Area will accommodate at least 
14,500  new homes and 10,500 jobs up to 2039, supported by 
upgrades to the Brighton mainline and provision 
new/enhanced supp orting infrastructure.  
c) Ensure 40%  (or 831 dpa ) of all additional housing 
delivered is affordable to low income groups during the life of 
the Plan    
d) The local economy will be supported by retaining and 
intensification of employment land, primarily in the Croydon 
Opportunity Area and District Centres for all sectors that support 
sustainable economic growth and job creation.  e) To support the overall growth, sufficient new and 
enhanced infrastructure will be provided in sustainable 
locations.  
Development Hiera rchy 
These locations according to the hierarchy provide for a level 
of services and facilities  to serve their appropriate catchment. 
Growth and facilities should be provided in line with the 
hierarchy.   
a) The Croydon Opportunity Area - This is the main focus  of 
significant growth of housing, employment, town centre 
uses and infrastructure as it provides excellent access to 
jobs, retail, services and visitor facilities with well -
established transport links with other places within and 
outside the borough.  
b) Main  District Centres of Purley and Thornton Heath -.  
These locations have a sufficient provision of retail, local 
services, community facilities and good public transport 
provision including main line stations that are able to be 
accessed from more than one o f the Places of Croydon, 
enabling them to be the secondary focus of development 
and other supporting facilities.  
c) District Centres –Addiscombe, Coulsdon, Crystal Palace, 
New Addington, Norbury, South Norwood and Selsdon . 
These locations provide good access  to local services and 
facilities such as retail, community uses and public 
transport and can accommodate growth and additional 
facilities, for the wider local area.  
  
32 
 d) Local and Neighbourhood Centres –These locations 
provide small scale facilities and comm unity uses for day 
to day needs for the immediate local area, with some 
access to public transport.  
 
Transformation areas  
SP 1.0B Transformation areas are identified locations for 
large scale redevelopment, change and renewal alongside 
the required infras tructure.  
a) The Purley Way transformation area is an opportunity for 
mixed use redevelopment using large areas of brownfield 
land. It will include three new local centres, a 
neighbourhood centre, renewed and intensified light 
industry and warehousing providi ng jobs to support 
residential growth alongside much improved public realm 
that reduces the dominance of the road infrastructure and 
creates a safe and welcoming environment for pedestrians 
and cyclists;  
b) The North End Quarter transformation area will be 
renewed with integrated retail and leisure alongside green 
and blue infrastructure and public life at its core. It will have 
a more balanced and resilient mix of uses including new 
homes, public realm, education and other knowledge 
economies, creative and cu ltural uses,  and supporting 
services.  
c) The Brighton Main Line and East Croydon Transformation 
Corridor will accommodate major new transport 
infrastructure to address the ‘Croydon Bottleneck’ and 
enable growth (development and inward investment) across the  borough and elsewhere in the Croydon -
Gatwick -Brighton corridor.  
Delivering Homes  
SP1.0C There are residential areas where the characteristics 
and infrastructure provision have led to the identification of 
potential for sustainable housing growth and rene wal.  
a) Areas of Focused Intensification are areas where a step 
change of character to higher density forms of 
development around transport nodes and existing services 
will take place  in locations where access to local transport 
and services is good.  
b) Moderat e Intensification – are areas where density will be 
increased, whilst respecting existing character, in 
locations where access to local transport and services is 
good.  
c) Evolution and gentle densification will be supported across 
all other residential areas.  
Place to Belong  
SP1.0D Developments will be supported that can achieve the 
following.  
a) Protect and enhance what is distinctive about Croydon 
and its Places collectively by securing a sense of 
belonging and high quality design that sits well with its 
surro undings.  
b) Sustainable growth while protecting and enhancing the 
borough’s natural environment and built heritage.   
33 
 c) An enhanced Green Grid with creating a biodiversity 
network contributing towards better health and well -being 
of the residents and help addre ss climate change.  
d) A welcoming place that is designed inclusively to meet 
the needs of the residents and visitors.  
 
Sustainable development  
SP1.1 When considering development proposals , the Council 
will take a positive approach that reflects the presumption in 
favour of sustainable development contained in the National 
Planning Policy Framework. It will always work proactively with 
applicants jointly to find solutions which mean that proposals 
can be approved wherever possible, and to secure development 
that imp roves the economic, social and environmental 
conditions in the area. Planning applications that accord with the 
policies in this Local Plan (and, where relevant, with polices in 
neighbourhood plans) will be approved without delay, unless 
material considera tions indicate otherwise. Where there are no 
policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of 
date at the time of making the decision then the Council will 
grant permission unless material considerations indicate 
otherwise – taking into  account whether:  
a) Any adverse impacts of granting permission would 
significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when 
assessed against the policies in the National Planning Policy 
Framework taken as a whole; or  
b) Specific policies in that Framework  indicate that 
development should be restricted.  
Place making  
SP1.2 The Council will require all new development in the 
borough to contribute to enhancing a sense of place and improving the character of the area, whilst acknowledging the 
need for growth:  
a) Develo pment proposals should respond to and enhance 
local character, the heritage assets and identity of the Places 
of Croydon; and  
b) Development proposals should be informed by the 16 
Places of Croydon (refer to Section 11 - The Places of 
Croydon ), the Borough Character Appraisal and other place -
based evidence.  
Growth  
SP1.3 Growth in homes, jobs and services that constitutes 
sustainable development will be welcomed; provided growth is 
directed to places with good concentrations of existing 
infrastructure or areas where there is capacity to grow with 
further sustainable infrastructure investment within the plan 
period to 2036. Croydon Opportunity Area will be the primary 
location for growth, including approximately a third of the 
borough’s residential growth, with the Places of Waddon, 
Purley, Broad Green & Selhurst, Thornton Heath and Coulsdon 
accommodating medium and moderate residential growth (see 
the Key Diagram).  
SP1.4 The Council will seek to encourage growth and 
sustainable deve lopment and to manage change, so as to 
create a network of connected, sustainable, high quality, locally 
distinctive, healthy places .

 Why we have taken this approach 
3.16 Croydon is a borough made up of a series of varied and 
distinctive neighbourhoods and areas, which are referred to here 
as ‘Places’. Understanding and expressing the character and 
what makes each place special and different enables sensitive 
planning. 
3.17 The overarching strategy must make sense for the borough 
as a whole, and celebrate and respect the characters of different 
parts of the borough whilst delivering the spatial vision. All 
Places will grow and change, to varying degrees, as a 
consequence of the strategy of welcoming sustainable 
development and growth of the suburbs, with renewal and 
regeneration. 
3.18 The overarching thematic policies put forward in the 
Croydon Local Plan ’s Strategic Policies have developed and are 
based on the distinctive character and unique places of Croydon; 
whilst also encouraging and creating a collective policy 
environment for the borough's development needs to be 
delivered. The appropriate approach for the 16 Places over the 
plan period will be determined largely by the opportunities and 
constraints that exist. Opportunities for development should 
always consider brownfield sites in the first instance. 
3.19 The Borough Character Appraisal 2016, identified and 
analysed the characteristics of the 16 Places of Croydon, 
considered a number of key aspects that add to the way these 
Places are today and what contributes to their local 
distinctiveness. This Appraisal has helped to inform the 
production of more detailed policies contained within the 
Croydon Local Plan. 3.20 National guidance clearly sets out the need for planning to 
be “spatial” - dealing with the unique needs and characteristics of 
places. Place making helps to deliver sustainable communities.  
3.21 The 16 Places are frameworks that help to steer those 
involved in shaping the built environment, in order to assist in 
creating sustainable neighbourhoods. Each Place includes a 
vision, map and summary of how the borough-wide thematic 
policies will shape the places over the plan period up to 2036. 
Forthcoming planning documents, including Development Plan 
Documents, Supplementary Planning Documents and 
masterplans, as well as planning applications will be used to help 
implement each of the Place's visions. Furthermore, it is 
considered the Places provide some context to the possible 
formulation of Neighbourhood Plans.

 4. Homes
Strategic policy 
Where we are now 
4.1 The key issues that the borough faces in terms of planning for 
new homes up to 2036 are as follows: 
 Population growth means that an additional  44,1498 new homes 
would be needed in Croydon by 2036 to meet the need for new 
homes. Population growth in the first decade of the plan period is 
expected to be higher than in its second decade.    
 There is limited developable land available for residential 
development within the built up area meaning that it is only possible 
to plan for 32,890 new homes in the plan period. 
 Croydon is home has the second largest population in London 
and an attractive employment location, which has increased 
demand for housing and created an imbalance in the housing 
market 
 A quarter of the population comprises of the under 17 youth 
growth, but this group is expected to experience a lower growth 
than the older population growth. This will impact the type, size and 
tenure of housing that will be needed to address local needs.  
 There is a need to increase the delivery of three bed (+) homes 
to cater for families, as well as a range of different sized housing.  
 New homes need to be well designed to address the needs of 
residents with disabilities and age related illnesses, as well as 
specialised housing for an ageing population.  
                                            
8 Croydon’s Strategic Housing Market Assessment - 2015 and Addendum Report 
2015  The need to achieve a level of affordable housing that 
addresses the level of need, whilst still ensuring that developments 
are viable and much needed market homes continue to be built in 
Croydon.  
 Managing Croydon’s sustainable growth that accommodates 
homes across the borough which contributes to the borough’s 
housing need and vitality and viability of centres, whilst not 
undermining the borough’s valued character and heritage.   
 The need to meet housing targets at the same time should allow 
for land to be provided for employment, education, health, retail and 
other community facilities to ensure a good quality of life for the 
residents of new housing in the long term.

community and environmental conditions.  
Strategic Objective 5:  Ensure that high quality new development 
both integrates, respects and enhances the borough’s na tural 
environment and built heritage.

Strategic Objective 7  Conser ve and create spaces and buildings 
that foster safe, healthy and cohesive communities.  
Strategic Objective 9:  Ensure the responsible use of land and

41 
 How we are going to get there 
Policy SP2: Homes 
SP2.1 In order to provide a choice of housing for people in socially -balanced and inclusive communities in Croydon , the Council will apply a 
presumption in favour of sustainable development of new homes provided applications for residential develo pment  to meet the  future needs 
of the area  requirements of Policy SP2, SP3.14 and other applicable policies of the development plan . 
Quantities and Locations  
SP2.2 In order to provide a choice of housing for people in Croydon , the Council will seek to deliver a minimum of 32,8909 37,736 (or 2,100  
over 18  years)  homes between 2016 and 2036  2019 -2039 . This will be achieved by:  
a) Concentrating development in the places with the most capacity to accommodate new homes whilst respecting the local 
distinctiveness of the P laces and protecting the borough’s physical, natural and historic environment, whilst recognising that Places 
change and in particular suburbs will sustainably grow; and  
b) The a llocation of 6,970  11,384 homes in the Croydon Local Plan ’s Detailed Policies and  Proposals  beyon d the Croydon Opportunity 
Area;  
c) Within the Croydon Opportunity Area, the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals has been informed by the Croydon 
Opportunity Area Planning Framework and allocates  allocate  sites for at least 10,760 14,500  net additional homes;   and 
d) 10,060 10,897 (.i.e. 641 *17, assuming adoption in 2023 ) homes being delivered across the borough on windfall sites; and  
e) Seeking to return at least 190 vacant homes back into use by 2026; and  The additional growth at a nd delivery of up to 7,515 homes 
in the Purley Way Transformation Area that can be delivered subject to the future provision of further infrastructure and  
f) Ensuring land is used efficiently, and that development addresses the need for different types of hom es in the borough and 
contributes to the creation or maintenance of sustainable communities; and  
g) Not permitting developments which would result in a net loss of homes or residential land; and 
                                            
9 Of which 4,890  3,844 are either  completed or under construction   
42 
 h) Supporting a range of housing delivery methods, including self -build, custom -build and community -led housing.  
 
Affordable Homes  
SP2.3 The Council will seek t To ensure that a choice of homes are available in the borough  that will contribute to addressing the borough’s 
need for affordable homes , the implementation of the Plan  is seeking to achieve the following . This will be achieved by a  The strategic policy 
target s of: 
a) 25% of all new homes developed  delivered  in the borough over the plan period to be  either affordable  will be low cost rented homes 
(homes which are up to 80% market rent)  comprising of social and affordable rented homes or homes for social rent to meet the 
borough’s need ; and  
b) 15% of all new homes in the borough developed  delivered over the plan period to be  will be  intermediate affordable housing for 
starter h omes , low cost shared  or intermediate rent home ownership  managed by a Registered Social Landlord or intermediate rent . 
SP2.4 To deliver affordable housing in the borough, on sites of ten or more dwellings the Council will : 
a) Negotiate to achieve up to 50% afforda ble housing, subject to viability  providing that ;  
b) Seek a 60:40 ratio between affordable rented homes and intermediate (including starter) homes unless there is agreement betwe en 
Croydon Council and a Registered Provider that a different tenure split is ju stified and subject to national regulations on provision of 
starter homes or, on schemes which are covenanted Private Rental Schemes where the 60:40 ratio is not viable10;  
c) Require a minimum provision of affordable housing as set out in SP2.5 .  
Residential development should respond positively to the need for affordable homes that are genuinely affordable for local re sidents by . 
a) Providing at least (i) 35% of new housing as affordable on residential developments of  10 or more dwellings, exploring all possible 
options to achieve 50% affordable housing and (ii) 50% onsite affordable housing if publically owned land or land protected b y Policy 
SP3.2  
                                            
10 In such instances, the Council will expect the covenant to require the scheme to be solely for private rented accommodation owned by one institution or company for a 
minimum of seven years post completion of the development.   
43 
 b) Providing affordable housing in a ratio of: (i) 70% low cost rented h omes, comprising of social rented or affordable rented housing, 
prioritising increasing the delivery of social rented housing (ii) 30% intermediate housing to meet a range of needs. To depa rt from this, 
an agreement with a Registered Provider will be requi red to demonstrate that a different tenure split is justified and it will address local 
housing needs; and  
c) Ensur ing that low cost rented homes are genuinely affordable to lower income households;  
d) Ensuring that the provision of intermediate homes responds to local needs by providing rented or low cost home ownership products 
that are in reach of local household incomes;  
e) Making the most efficient use of land in order to facilitate and maximise the delivery of affordable housing . In instances,  where a 
develo pment site is sub -divided , to create two or more separate development schemes one or more of which falls below the relevant 
threshold, the appropriate level of affordable housing to reflect the provision that would have been achieved on the site as a whole  had it 
come forward as a single scheme for the site, will be sought.  
f) Where development seeks to add additional dwellings on a site that has an existing consent or is under construction , the affordable 
housing will be calculated on the gross number of dwel lings;  
g) Building out the development and achieving an agreed level of progress on implementing the scheme within 2 years of grant of 
planning consent, otherwise an early stage review will be triggered to assess whether additional affordable housing is viab le. 
SP2.5  The Council will require a minimum provision of affordable housing to be provided either:  
a) Preferably as a minimum level of 30% affordable housing on the same site as the proposed development or, if 30% on site provi sion 
is not viable;  
b) If the site is in the Croydon Opportunity Area or a District Centre , as a minimum level of 15% affordable housing on the same site as 
the proposed development plus the simultaneous delivery of the equivalent of 15% affordable housing on a donor site with a pr ior 
planning  permission in addition to that site’s own requirement. If the site is in the Croydon Opportunity Area , the donor site must be 
located within either the Croydon Opportunity Area or one of the neighbouring Places of Addiscombe, Broad Green & Selhurst, S outh 
Croydon or Waddon. If the site is in a District Centre, the donor site must be located within the same Place as the District Centre; or  
c) As a minimum level of 15% affordable housing on the same site as the proposed development , plus a Review Mechanism ente red 
into for the remaining affordable housing (up to the equivalent of 50% overall provision through a commuted sum based on a re view of  
44 
 actual sales values and build costs of completed units) provided 30% on -site provision is not viable, construction cost s are not in the 
upper quartile and, in the case of developments in the Croydon Opportunity Area or District Centres, there is no suitable don or site.  
In the following specific instances  where affordable housing is not provided in full the following may ap ply:  
a) In exceptional circumstances, affordable housing is not provided in accordance with policy , applications must be supported by a 
viability assessment which will be independently tested, demonstrably designed to maximise affordable housing delivery, be  able to 
demonstrate a planning benefit which outweighs the provision of affordable housing and will be subject to a late stage review  (i.e. at the 
point of 75% of sales/tenancies). Developments proposing below a minimum of 20% affordable housing will not be supported;  
b) Where development proposes a higher level of affordable housing than 35%, a different tenure mix may be supported without the  
need for a viability assessment, where this is agreed with a Registered Provider;   
c) Where development is for  build t o rent38 or community -led housing scheme, the affordable housing may be provided in a different 
form such as discounted market rent, providing it is genuinely affordable and meets identified housing needs in the borough.  Affordable 
housing contributions fo r large purpose built shared living schemes will be in the form of a single upfront payment in line with London 
Plan Policy H16.  
d) In assessing viability, the Council will compare Residual Land Value with Existing Use Value Benchmark Land Value (competitive ) 
(plus an incentive to provide a competitive return to a willing landowner)  or Alternative Use value if there is an alternative use for the site 
which would comply with the policies of the development plan and could be implemented11; will take account of f eatures which appear to 
seek to exclude affordable housing by design or by incurring upper quartile construction costs12; and will take  account of abnormal costs 
incurred .  
SP2.6 The Council will only accept in exceptional circumstances commuted sums on sites wit h ten or more units in lieu of on -site provision 
of affordable housing (or provision on a donor site) if it is not possible to find a Registered Provider to manage the on -site affordable homes.  
Affordable housing should be delivered on site to support the development of mixed and inclusive communities.  In exceptional   
circumstances:  
a) Where it is not practical to provide affordable housing on site, alternative provision may be accepted in the form of off -site affordable 
housing on a donor site. Any offsit e affordable housing requirement will be calculated in relation to the total provision on the main site plus 
                                            
11 To be implementable an alternative use will generally need to have an existing implementable planning permission unless other evidence on how it will be implemented 
can be provided.  
12 By reference to Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) or similar indices for similar development types in London.  
45 
 any donor sites. The donor site should be in an area with a similar land value to the main site or otherwise provide a signif icant additional 
benef it in terms of the overall level or type of affordable housing  
(b) Where all options have been explored and it is not possible to provide the affordable housing onsite or on an alternative  site, and 
evidence is provided to justify this, a commuted sum paym ent towards the cost of providing additional affordable housing in the borough will 
be required instead.  
Mix of Homes by Size  
SP2.7 The Council will seek to ensure that a choice of homes is available in the borough that will address the borough’s need for h omes of 
different sizes. For both market and affordable housing, this will be achieved by:  
a) Setting a strategic target for 30% of all new homes up to 203 69 to have three or more bedrooms; and  
b) Setting a preferred unit mix on individual sites in the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals, applicable to sites of ten 
or more homes across the borough including sites within Croydon Opportunity Area;  and 
c) Working with partners to facilitate the provision of specialist and supported housing for elderly , care leavers  and vulnerable people.  
Quality and Standards  
SP2.8 The Council  will seek  All housing developments should be designed to ensure that they new homes in Croydon  meet the needs of 
residents over a lifetime , be fit for purpose  and contribute to sustainable c ommunities with the borough. This will be achieved by : New 
housing should  
a) Requiring that all new homes achieve the minimum standards set out in the London Plan Mayor of London’s Housing Supplementary 
Planning Guidance and National Technical Standards (2015 ) or equivalent;  Meet minimum design and amenity standards set out in the 
Local Plan's Detailed Policies and proposals as well as the internal space standards for different sized dwellings set out in  table 3.1 of 
the London Plan;  
b) Ensuring that all new home s be designed for families meet minimum design and amenity standards set out in the Croydon Local 
Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals and other relevant London Plan and National Technical Standards (2015) or equivalent. 
Development will need to demonstr ate the design of both private and communally shared spaces, and supporting management 
strategies successfully meet the needs of all residents, including families ;  
46 
 c) Provide internal and external spaces which contribute positively to resident’s health and  wellbeing, whilst offering places for activity, 
shared experiences and  retreat ;   
d) Ensure the  design and layout will support independent living;  
e) Be designed to a the highest quality; be functional, accessible, adaptable, sustainable, in compliance wi th all relevant standards and 
applied neutrally  across all tenures and  
f) All developments should provide accessible and adaptable dwellings. At least 10% of all affordable homes built to meet M4 (3) 
‘wheelchair user dwellings and the remainder should me et M4 (2) accessible and adaptable dwellings standards.  in exceptional 
circumstances, site specific factors may be considered to assess whether meeting the above requirement is achievable within 
development.  
Gypsies and Travellers  
SP2.9 The Council will deliver  a minimum of 36 additional Gypsy and Travellers pitches in the borough by 2036 to meet the need of 
Croydon’s Gypsy and Traveller community. Land is allocated for Gypsy and Traveller pitches in the Croydon Local Plan ’s Detailed Policies 
and Proposals. Any proposals for additional sites that are not allocated should meet the following criteria:  
a) Should be available and deliverable; and  
b) Should have good access to essential services including health and education facilities and access to local shops; and  
c) Have g ood means of access from roads; and  
d) Not be located in areas of high flood risk (Flood Risk Zone 3); and  
e) Should not have unacceptable adverse impact on the biodiversity of the borough.

 Why we have taken this approach 
Quantities and Locations  
4.2 There is a need for over 41,580 42,930  new homes in Croydon 
by 2039 2036  and evidence indicates that approximately 40% half 
of these need to be larger homes13. However  there is only a limited 
supply of land in Croydon for new homes without eroding the 
Metropolitan Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and 
Local Green Spaces which are all protected by national policy and 
the London Plan . The target of 37,736 31,850  homes reflects the 
availability of land for development in Croydon, facilitating the 
sustainable growth of the suburbs, the need to provide a mix of 
homes to support sustainable communities and the objective to 
provide a choice of homes for people at all stages of life. It also 
reflects the need to provide land for other uses such as 
employment, education, health and other infrastructure to support 
growth in Croydon14. In particular, in Croydon Opportunity Area 
allowance has been made for office and retail development in line 
with Policy SP3 (Employment). 
4.3 The provision of new homes is phased in accordance with the 
supply of land for new homes. Sites identified by the Strategic 
Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) as being 
deliverable have been included in the first five years of the plan. 
Those sites which could be developed but are not available now 
have been phased after 2026. Sites with planning permission 
have been included in the first five years of the Plan, those sites 
with developer interest the second five years of the Plan, and 
those which could be developed but are not available now have 
                                            
 
 
14 The infrastructure needs of the proposed new homes are considered by the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan which sets out in its Infrastructure Delivery 
Schedule how the required infrastructure will be provided. been phased after 2034 (.i.e. 15yrs+). Other factors have been 
considered when determining site delivery on a case- by-case 
basis . identified by the Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment (SHLAA) as being deliverable have been included in 
the first five years of the plan. Those sites which could be 
developed but are not available now have been phased after 
2026 . The nature of the borough being primarily built-up means 
that a number of the available sites for delivery growth are small. 
These small sites are allocated for development in the Plan and 
have been identified in Appendix 7. It is recognised that there are 
many types of housing that can help diversify the market and 
speed up delivery, as well as providing more specific products to 
cater for the needs of different communities. Community-led 
housing schemes should be genuinely community-led and 
provide benefits to the locality, in line with the Mayor of London’s 
definition15. Proposals for custom-build or self-build homes 
should demonstrate that the initial owner(s) of the dwelling(s) has 
played a meaningful role in the ultimate design as outlined in the 
Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 (and any further 
revisions) and conform with the requirements of applicable 
design policies in this Plan.  
Affordable Homes 
4.4 Of the overall number of homes needed in Croydon, about 
91% need to be affordable homes for residents on lower 
incomes. It is not realistic to expect that this proportion of new 
homes in the borough will be affordable, both in terms of 
deliverability and because the private rental sector also meets 
and will continue to meet a significant proportion of the need for 
 
  
49 
 affordable housing. For this reason the strategic target is 40% of 
overall supply, which reflects the findings of the Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment, has regard development viability 
and the need to deliver balanced communities with a mixture of 
tenures and dwelling types. The Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment undertaken in 2019 identifies a considerable need 
for new affordable housing in the borough (2,254 dwellings per 
annum) compared to the overall housing need (2,302 dwellings 
per annum) and concludes that the Council should continue to 
seek as much affordable housing as is viably possible when 
setting affordable housing policies. A strategic policy target for 
affordable homes based on this level of annual need would be 
unrealistic and undeliverable. For this reason the strategic target 
is 40% (minimum) of overall supply, which reflects the findings of 
the Strategic Housing Market Assessment, has regard to 
development viability and the need to deliver balanced 
communities with a mixture of tenures and dwelling types. But 
the Council will seek to increase the provision of affordable 
housing, above this (where viable) to meet the London Plan 
Strategic target of ensuring 50 per cent of all new homes 
delivered across London to be genuinely affordable.  
4.5 An appraisal of development sites in the borough The Whole 
Plan Viability Assessment has found that a requirement for 30% 
35% on site affordable homes housing will be viable for the 
majority of the major residential development types sites in the 
borough. House prices have risen much faster against the 
original Dynamic Viability Model compared to construction costs 
such that, unless there is a severe economic downturn resulting 
in house prices falling by 25% (as happened in 2008) then either 
a minimum requirement of 30% on-site provision or an 
alternative of 15% on-site provision and a review mechanism is 
always likely to be viable. The Council will calculate the 
proportion of affordable housing based Viability evidence and 
sensitivity testing around changes in sales values and construction costs suggest that in most cases development that 
is not viable with 35% on-site provision of affordable housing 
would be viable with a 20% affordable housing requirement. 
Development types that are not viable with 20% on site 
affordable housing, and are therefore unlikely to be built. 
Affordable housing requirements will be calculated using  on 
habitable rooms so long as the resultant mix of units on the site 
meets the need for affordable housing in the borough identified 
by the most up to date Strategic Housing Market Assessment (or 
equivalent).  In order to follow the fast-track approach, 
development is expected to maximise the provision of affordable 
housing and provide a mix of low cost rented housing and 
intermediate housing. A target tenure mix of 70% low cost rented 
housing and 30% intermediate housing has been set, based on 
the findings of the Strategic Housing Market Assessment and 
viability evidence from the Whole Plan Viability Assessment. A 
different tenure mix may be acceptable in certain circumstances, 
for example, where a development is proposing more than 75% 
affordable housing or where an increased level of low cost rented 
housing is proposed on a development providing at least 35% 
affordable housing where this will continue to support the 
delivery of mixed and inclusive communities. This will be decided 
on a case by case basis having regard to the housing need that 
will be met by the scheme and the additional benefit provided. In 
other circumstances where an applicant is proposing a lower 
proportion of low cost rented homes for viability reasons, they will 
have to submit a viability assessment for review and to 
demonstrate that they are meeting local housing needs.  
4.5a First Homes is the Government’s initiative to increase home 
ownership amongst individuals and households, who are first time 
buyers and were priced out of the housing market, either due to 
their low income, lack of supply of supply of affordable homes or 
shortage in suitable accommodation that adequately addresses 
their needs. The key national criteria’s new housing must meet the  
50 
 definition of First Homes are; a minimum discount of 30% must be 
applied against the market value that must be protected in 
perpetuity to ensure the housing remains affordable for future 
buyers. The price of first homes must be no higher than £420,000 
in London, after the discount has been applied. Thirdly to be 
eligible for a First Homes, the purchaser(s) must be an individual, 
couple or groups who are first time buyers whose annual income 
does not exceed £90,000. Government indicates 25% of all 
affordable housing contributions in new housing schemes will 
need to be First Homes.  
4.6 For schemes where it is not viable to provide 30% affordable 
housing on site, and, if applicable, there is no suitable donor site 
then a reduced provision of 15% affordable housing on-site 
combined with a review mechanism will ensure that, if the 
viability of the development improves such that by the time the 
homes are sold more affordable housing would have been viable 
than at the time of granting permission, a commuted sum will be 
payable to cover the cost of providing affordable housing on 
another site in the borough. The review mechanism will be linked 
to the gross development value difference between affordable 
and market units provided through a review mechanism at 
agreed stages of the development. Viability evidence suggests 
that schemes that are not viable with 15% on-site provision of 
affordable housing would not be viable with any affordable 
housing, and are therefore unlikely to be built.  In line with the 
Ministerial Statement, the Council will consider the need to 
provide First Homes within major housing developments, as part 
of the overall housing affordable housing contributions. The 
Council will maintain a First Homes register, to enable potential 
first time buyers to declare their interest and demonstrate they 
meet the local, national eligibility criteria. This will form a key 
evidence base of the type, size and location homes may be 
required and address the needs of those individuals/households 
considered a priority. Developers of First homes will be required to refer to this register and address the needs of first time buyers 
included on this. If the units remain unsold, evidence will be 
required to demonstrate that the First Homes units have been 
actively and extensively marketed, prior the removal any legal 
restrictions to enable them to be sold on the open market. 
Compensation will need to be paid to the Council to the value of 
the final sale price of the units in the open market (less the 30% 
discount) to enable Council to deliver First Homes on another 
site and provide compensation.  
4.7 All viability assessments will be reviewed by comparing the 
Residual Land Value with the Existing Use Value (plus a 
premium) or Alternative Use value, if there is an alternative use 
for the site, which would comply with the policies of the 
development plan and could be implemented. Features which 
have been found to exclude affordable housing by design include 
an insufficiency of circulation cores (lifts and stairwells) to allow 
both affordable rented and private market homes to be managed 
in coexistence, or unnecessary basement car parks which inflate 
service costs. 
4.8 In exceptional circumstances where it is not possible to 
provide affordable housing on site or off site, for example if 
Where the number of on-site affordable homes is low, the 
Council may accept a commuted sum in lieu of on-site provision 
of affordable homes may be acceptable  if it is not possible to find 
a Registered Provider to manage the on-site affordable homes. 
The Council may also consider a different tenure split during 
negotiations, for example if the number of affordable units on-site 
is low and there is agreement between a Registered Provider 
and the Council that a different tenure split is justified. A 
minimum of three Registered Providers should be approached 
before the Council will consider applying this policy . Registered 
Providers should be approached and feedback presented as 
evidence in order to demonstrate that onsite affordable housing  
51 
 cannot be practically delivered. The calculation of the commuted 
sum payment will be based on the uplift in the gross   
development value that results from the replacement of onsite 
affordable housing with market housing and index-linked to 
reflect the value at the point of sale.  
4.9 Croydon Council considers that affordable rent homes 
(homes available at 80% of market rent levels) meet a range of 
housing needs within the affordable sector (including the need 
for social rented affordable homes due to the availability of 
Universal Credit/Housing Benefit to tenants unable to afford the 
full rent for an affordable rent property). Development proposals 
should be accompanied by a sustainable letting scheme to 
support the use of affordable rent homes in meeting the need for 
social rented housing and also develop and maintain balanced 
communities.   Affordable housing should be genuinely affordable 
and respond to local housing needs and income levels.   Social 
rent and London Affordable Rented homes are considered to 
meet the needs and income levels of the majority of lower 
income households. Affordable rented homes at rents at up to 
80% of market rent will only be affordable for a minority of 
households on the housing register and will only be considered 
in exceptional circumstances or where the rents are significantly 
lower than 80%. Intermediate housing should contribute towards 
a mix of rented and low cost home ownership tenures which 
meet the full range of need. Intermediate housing products such 
as shared ownership, discounted market sale and intermediate 
and discounted market rent, including London Living Rent, will be 
supported where they are genuinely affordable, and targeted at 
local residents with incomes that are insufficient to afford decent 
housing that meets their needs in the market. From time to time, 
updated non-statutory guidance will be issued setting out the 
preferred forms of affordable housing, the local definition of 
genuinely affordable and any local eligibility requirements.  This 
will take account of the changes in affordable housing products and funding priorities over the plan period and the availability of 
updated data sources and evidence on housing need. 
Mix of Homes by Size 
4.10 Analysis of the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 
suggests that approximately 50% 40% of homes should have 
three or more bedrooms. Unfortunately, analysis suggests that to 
meet this demand on the sites likely to come forward for 
development is impractical. Nevertheless a doubling of the 
outturn for family houses achieved since 2011 is a realistic 
target.   
4.11 Between 2011 and 2031 the number of people in Croydon 
over the age of 55 is projected to increase by 63%, from a 2013 
base. Due to the ageing population older peoples’ wellbeing 
must be at the forefront, with the physical and mental needs of 
older people and their carers varying greatly. Housing should 
respond to these needs, providing a variety of homes and 
environments that meet the changing needs of older people, 
allowing them to live independently for longer. In addition there is 
a growing and significant number of care leavers in the borough, 
which the Council must legally support, requiring appropriate and 
suitable accommodation. Therefore the Council will need to work 
with partners to facilitate the provision of specialist and 
supported housing for the elderly , care leavers and vulnerable. 
4.11a The SHMAA indicates the population of the area will live 
longer and the proportion of household containing at least  one 
person with long -term health problem or a disability will increase 
by 24% by 2036 (.i.e. 40% of population), particularly impacting 
the quality of life of lower income groups living within social rented 
housing. All new housing will need to be built to accessible and 
adaptable design standards, to ensure people are able to 
independently live within their properties longer, feel safe and do 
not face any discrimination, as well as enjoy a good quality of life.    
52 
 Flatted development will need to incorporate innovative design 
solutions both inside and out so that living and private amenity 
spaces meet the needs of families with children. The layout and 
design of these spaces will need to be inherently flexible and be 
usable child play, family activities and needs of multiple age 
groups.  
Quality and Standards 
4.12 New homes in Croydon need to provide a choice of housing 
for people at all stages of life. In order to do so they will need to 
meet minimum standards of design. The London Plan space 
standards  National Technical Standards (2015), Mayor of 
London’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2016) will 
be applied to all new residential developments in conjunction 
with Croydon’s Borough Character Appraisal. 
4.13 A good quality design can mean that a smaller two 
bedroom property is suitable for smaller families. In order to 
establish what a home suitable for a family is, the Croydon Local 
Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals will set out the design and 
amenity standards that are expected of family homes. 
4.14 Policy SP6 (Environment and Climate Change) of the 
Croydon Local Plan requires all new homes to achieve the 
National Technical Standards (2015), Mayor of London’s 
Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (2015) or equivalent.   
Older peoples’ wellbeing must be designed in, with the physical 
and mental needs of older people and their carers varying 
greatly. New housing should respond to these needs, providing a 
variety of homes and environments that meet the changing 
needs of older people, allowing them to live independently for 
longer.  A variety of housing types will be encouraged, including 
those between traditional market housing and nursing homes 
                                            
16 London Plan Policy 3.8 such as downsizer living with shared amenities (e.g. communal 
gardens), supported or sheltered housing including support or 
care services, and older people’s co-housing with an informal 
care offer. The London Plan also sets requirements for 10% of 
homes to be designed to be wheelchair accessible (units that are 
designed for wheelchair users to live in) or easily adaptable for 
residents who are wheelchair users16. All buildings should be 
positioned to maximise access, mitigating the need for unsightly 
ramps, external lifts, stairs or terraces, whilst working 
sympathetically with the existing landscape conditions and 
character. In exceptional circumstances, the Council will take into 
site specific factors (.i.e. topography, small infill sites, type of 
scheme such as flats, maisonettes) to determine whether it is 
achievable for the developments to meet the accessible 
adaptable housing requirements. The London Plan also requires 
all new housing to make provision for play and informal 
recreation based on the expected child population generated by 
the development17. The Mayor's Supplementary Planning 
Guidance ‘Shaping Neighbourhoods: Play and Informal 
Recreation’ provides further guidance on the requirements. As 
the London Plan forms part of the statutory development plan for 
Croydon, these requirements are not duplicated in the Croydon 
Local Plan but will be applied to all residential developments. 
4.15 The London Plan’s design led approach seeks to optimise 
the best use of land for delivering of high quality homes Good 
design of homes forms a basis for a good quality of life. Together 
these requirements contribute to ensuring that developments 
incorporating new homes will contribute to promoting sustainable 
use of resources and the principles of good design. They will 
also help to address the health and wellbeing impacts of poor 
quality housing. Homes need to be well connected, spacious, 
accessible, adaptable, pleasurable, manageable, sociable, and 
17 London Plan Policy 3.6  
53 
 green. As much of the needs for family homes will be delivered 
through flatted development this is of particular importance. 
Gypsies and Travellers 
4.16 Both English Gypsies and Irish Travellers are recognised 
as ethnic groups and, like other members of Croydon’s Black 
and Minority Ethnic communities, are protected from 
discrimination by the Equalities Act 2010. Local authorities are 
required to assess their need for housing in the same way that 
they are required to assess the needs for new homes for people 
who live in “bricks and mortar” homes. 
4.17 There is a need for 49 new Gypsy and Traveller pitches (a 
pitch being space for one mobile home) and one emergency 
stopping place in Croydon up to 2036 providing for the English 
Gypsy and Irish Traveller communities18.  However, that need 
was identified by a method which is reported to result in an 
overestimate of need. Subsequent to the study, government has 
amended the definition of gypsy and traveller for planning 
purposes so the figure for identified need is further reduced. 
Three spaces have been found at the existing Latham’s Way 
site. In consequence, the residual requirement is estimated to be 
36 pitches. The location of new pitches (including the emergency 
stopping place) must enable the residents to access services 
including schools and health facilities in the same way that 
residents of new houses need to be able to access community 
facilities. In addition, Gypsy and Traveller sites need good 
access to the road network as they often need to move larger 
vehicles as part of their livelihood and way of life19.The Croydon 
Local Plan ’s Detailed Policies and Proposals allocates land to 
help meet this need for additional pitches.

 Policy SP2.1  Policy SP2.7 
 Policy SP2.8 
 Policy  SP4.1 
Why we need this policy
4.18 The Council seeks the provision of a mix and range of 
housing as set out in Strategic Policy SP2.7  of the Croydon Local 
Plan and it is also the aim of Strategic Objective 3. This will 
assist in building sustainable communities, in line with paragra ph 
50 of the Nation al Planning Policy Framework. 
4.19 In line with Strategic Objective 7, residential development 
should set out to achieve healthy and liveable communities to 
support the health and wellbeing of residents. 
4.20 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2019 identifies 
that over 40% of the future requirement for market housing is for 
larger homes.  The need for larger homes in Croydon was 
identified in the Croydon Strategic Housing Market Assessment 
2015. Croydon has large numbers of households that are 
overcrowded. Meanwhile there is also a growth in single person 
households which is driving the requirement for smaller homes. 
The loss of 3-bedroom homes particularly through sub-division or 
conversion of existing homes can result in poor housing.  
4.21 Three bedroom (or more)  residential units are needed to 
house families and the existing stock retained to assist provision. The London Plan defines family housing as ‘a dwelling that by 
virtue of its size, layout and design is suitable for a family to live 
in and  generally having three , four, five  or more bedrooms’. In 
line with London Plan Policy 3.14 H10, the retention of residential 
units originally designed with three or more bedrooms is 
supported by the Council.  
  4.21a There has been a steady decline in the number of new 
homes being delivered designed with 3 or more bedrooms, from 
over 25% in   the 2012/13 monitoring period to approximately 11% 
in the 2018/19 monitoring period . The recent delivery of many 1 
and 2-bedroom homes, with uptake particularly strong from 
younger households, contrasts with the Strategic Housing 
Assessment’s findings that 40% of new homes should be larger 
homes. To redress this imbalance in new supply there is a need 
for policy that both protects the existing supply of larger units, and 
promotes the delivery of more, new larger homes. This will help to 
future-proof the borough’s housing market and is particularly 
relevant in suburban locations where larger homes are more 
common and delivery takes place on small sites.  
55 
 4.22 Croydon’s Strategic Housing Market Assessment identified 
the need for 44,149 new homes to be built between 2016 and 
2036. The strategic policy requirement is for 32,890 new homes 
to be built in the same period, making more efficient use of 
housing stock a necessity including sub-divisions, conversions 
and change of use to residential. A significant number of homes 
will need to be delivered during the life of the Plan, but  it will be 
important that the right size, type of homes are delivered to 
address future needs and ensure the efficient use of the existing 
housing stock. 
4.23 The Strategic  Housing Market Assessment 2015 identifies 
that 50% of the future requirement for market housing is for 
larger homes. The Strategic Housing Land Availability 
Assessment has identified that whilst projections of future 
housing requirements are rising, levels of building have fallen. 
Existing three bed residential units should therefore be retained 
and any conversions should ensure that there is no loss of three 
bed homes . There has been a steady decline in the number of 
new homes designed with 3 or more bedrooms being delivered, 
from over 25% in the 2012/13 monitoring period to approximately 
11% in the 2018/19 monitoring period. The recent delivery of 
many 1 and 2-bedroom homes, with uptake particularly strong 
from younger households, contrasts with the Strategic Housing 
Assessment’s findings that 40% of new homes should be larger 
homes. To redress this imbalance in new supply there is a need 
for policy that both protects the existing supply of larger units, 
and promotes the delivery of more, new larger homes. This will 
help to future-proof the borough’s housing market and is 
particularly relevant in suburban locations where larger homes 
are more common and delivery takes place on small sites. 
                                            
20 Paragraph 9.12 of the Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework Jan 
2013 4.24 Within the Croydon Opportunity Area, the Croydon Housing 
Typologies Study has found that the strongest opportunities for 
homes suitable for families will be associated with the lower and 
moderate density sites in the Croydon Metropolitan Centre 
(including the inner residential area in the Croydon Opportunity 
Area20). It indicates that there will be more opportunities for 
studio, one and two bedroom units on the higher density sites in 
the Croydon Metropolitan Centre.

 Policy DM1: Housing choice for sustainable communities 
DM1.1 The Council will seek to enable housing choice for sustainable communities by  requiring the minimum provision of homes designed 
with 3 or more bedrooms on sites of 10 or more dwellings as shown in Table 4.1, except:  The Council seeks to retain 3 or more bedroom 
family homes, and smaller homes below 130m2 (as originally built), to address local needs. Development should not result in a  net loss of 
family housing.  
a. Where there is agreement with the associated affor dable housing provider that three or more bedroom dwellings are neither viable 
nor needed as part of the affordable housing element of any proposal, or;  
b. Within three years of the adoption of this plan, where a viability assessment demonstrates that larger homes would not be viable, an 
element may be substituted by two bedroom, four person homes complying with the floor space specification of national Technic al 
Standards or the London Mayor’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance or equivalent.  
DM1.2  The C ouncil will permit the redevelopment of the residential units where it does not result in the net loss of 3 bedroom homes (as  
originally built) or the loss of homes smaller than 130m2. To enable housing choice for sustainable communities, the minimum provi sion of 
homes designed with 3 or more bedrooms, must comply with Table 4.1 except where there is evidence from an associated affordable 
housing provider that 3 or more bedroom dwellings are neither viable nor neede d as part of the affordable housing element of any proposal .

 How the policy works 
4.25 This policy applies to both market and affordable housing, 
whether the homes are new build or conversions. Family housing 
is a dwelling that by virtue of its size, layout and design is 
suitable for a family to live in and generally has three, four, five, 
or more bedrooms. To manage the current shortage of family 
homes, proposals must not result in the net loss of three bed or 
larger homes or the loss of smaller homes below 130m2 (as 
originally built) that can address the needs of young and low 
income households. This policy is intended to ensure that the 
redevelopment of larger homes, including 4 or 5 bedroom 
homes, incorporates a replacement unit of that size to retain 
existing stock. This policy is intended to ensure that any loss of 
three bed (or more) homes should as a minimum be replaced by 
an equivalent quantity of three bed homes within schemes . 
4.26  To meet the need for three bedroom homes the Council 
will require a minimum proportion of homes to have three 
bedrooms or more. London Plan Policy 3.4 Optimising Housing 
Potential provides the basis of Table 4.1 and the definitions of 
Suburban, Urban and Central, and relating new development to 
access to the public transport network.  The approach recognises 
that more central locations with higher density development will 
not be so compatible for accommodating larger units.  For small 
schemes where it is not possible to adhere exactly the 
percentage requirements of Table 4.1 , the percentage provision 
of 3 or more bedroom homes achieved should be the closest 
percentage figure to that required . 
4.27 The proportion of homes to have three bedrooms will vary 
across the borough based on existing character and public 
                                            
23 London Plan Policy 3.4 transport accessibility and is based upon the London Plan’s 
density matrix23. The approach recognises that more central 
locations with higher density development will not be so 
compatible for accommodating larger units. The Council’s 
housing allocations scheme gives more priority to households 
that are working and the use of local letting schemes and the 
level of housing need will help to balance any issues arising 
regarding the viability of providing family homes. Paragraph 
deleted  
4.28 The Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2015 2019 
identifies a difference in the size of housing required between 
tenures with affordable housing requirement for a greater 
proportion of smaller homes (particularly one two bedroom 
homes) than market homes.24  
4.29 The Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework 
identifies percentages for levels of three bed housing in six 
‘character areas’ in the Croydon Opportunity Area which are

Why we need this policy
4.32A  One of the key aims of the Plan is to address local housing 
needs  and the housing crisis. Alongside this, there is still a need 
for site layout and design to consider the provision of useable 
amenity space alongside the siting of the building. This policy sets 
the local amenity standard for residential dwellings alongside the 
policies and guidance in the London Plan. 
4.32B It is important that private outdoor spaces should be 
useable not only for residents but  also their visitors,  so they should 
have level access with the mi nimum depth and width. Other  good  design  requirements that  communal open 
space  should adhere to are that it should be;  overlooked by 
surrounding development,  accessible to wheelchair users and 
other disabled people, seeking  to take advantage of direct 
sunlight, as well as have  necessary  management arrangements in 
place  to provide suitable amenity for residents. This will ensure the 
outdoor space remains useful and welcoming to all its intended 
users. The only exception to this is the management 
arrangements  which are a matter for residents and the body 
managing the building.   
61 
 Policy DM 1A Amenity standards for residential developments 
`DM1A .1 Residential development will need to provide private amenity space that:  
(a) Is of high quality design, and enhances and respects the local character  
(b) Provides a minimum amount of outdoor space of 5m2 per 1 -2 person unit and an extra 1m2 per extra occupant thereafter;  and it 
must achieve a minimum depth and width of 1.5m  
(c) Provides functional space with a minimum width and dept h of balconies should be 1.5m  
(d) All flatted developments and major developments need to provide a minimum of 10m2 per child of new play space, calculated using 
GLA’s the Mayor of London’s population yield calculator  
(e) All flatted developments of 10 units shou ld provide a minimum of 50 square metres of communal amenity space with a further 1 
square metres per additional unit thereafter  
DM1A.2  Large scale purpose built shared living schemes and non -self-contained student housing must also provide communal amenit y 
space. When calculating the communal amenity space requirements each bedroom will be treated as a 1b1p flat and the resultant  private 
outdoor space requirement will be combined to form the total need for communal amenity space. In Large scale purpose bui lt shared 
living scheme and non -self-contained student housing communal areas (including kitchens) may be considered as communal amenity 
space. 
 
How the policy works 
4.32C  Amenity space is an important and essential element of a 
residential development, providing an outdoor space that is 
practical and can be used as a utility, social and recreation area.  
The health and wellbeing of local residents is a key consideration 
on the quantum of outdoor space, child’s play space and 
communal open space to be provided for developments.  
 4.32D  Private outside space is defined as an area which is 
accessible only to, useable for and screened for the purposes of 
individual dwellings at the rear or in the case of flatted schemes 
within the grounds.  Private outside spaces can take form of a 
garden, terrace, roof garden, courtyard garden or balcony. The 
use of roof areas, including podiums, and courtyards for additional 
private or shared outside space is encouraged.  
62 
 4.32E  Communal amenity space is defined as amenity space that 
is shared, accessible to all within the development and be used for 
their exclusive use. 
4.32F  Balconies, winter gardens or roof terraces may help to 
meet a development’s private outside space requirement and will 
be supported providing they are designed to minimise any 
overlooking and privacy issues. Enclosures may need to be 
opaque to achieve this. They may be an innovative way of 
providing private or communal amenity space in areas of high 
density.  
4.32G  The amenity space provided for play space can be part of 
the shared amenity area; it may be a void deck within a tall flatted 
development, possibly on the ground floor and in small 
developments of less than ten dwellings it could be part of the 
shared or private garden. 
4.32H  The GLA Population Yield Calculator should be used to 
calculate the expected number of children and young people likely 
to live in the development. The London Plan Housing 
Supplementary Planning should be referred to for the allocation 
and design guidance for play space. 
4.32I  All new housing developments should enhance the quality 
of local places, considering their physical context, local character, 
density; tenure and land use mix; and relationships with, and 
provision of public, communal and open spaces that takes into 
account the needs of children and old people. The need to provide 
communal amenity space should reflect the local character. It is 
important that the site layout, ensures the provision of useable 
amenity space, alongside the siting of the building. Private outdoor 
spaces should have level access.

Why we need this policy
4.33 The Council seeks the provision of a mix and range of 
housing as set out in Strategic Policy SP2.7  of the Croydon Local 
Plan and it is also the aim of Strategic Objective 3. This will 
assist in building sustainable communities, in line with paragraph 
50 of the National Planning Policy Framework. The London Plan 
(2021) notes the population of city will experience an aging 
population, with the number of older people households (aged 65 
and over) experiencing a 37% increase by 2029. Whilst the 
number of older people households aged 75 (and over), who are 
most likely to move into specialist older people housing, are 
expected to increase by 42%. Further, it has estimated that the 
future benchmark requirement for specialist older people housing 
for the Council area has increased to 225 units per annum (2017 
-2029) from a figure of 195 units (2015-25) per annum in the 
previous Plan. To address the implications of this and assist in 
building sustainable communities, a mix and range of housing 
needs to be delivered as informed by the latest housing needs 
assessment.  
4.34 In line with Strategic Objective 7, residential development 
should set out to achieve healthy and liveable communities to 
support the health and wellbeing of residents.  4.35 Croydon has a very high number of nursing and residential 
care homes compared to other London boroughs . Analysis of 
changing needs for services supplied by the nursing and 
residential care home market evidences a ‘saturation point’ has 
been reached for some customer groups or categories of people 
in need. At the same time there is a greater public policy focus 
on supporting people to remain living at home safely whenever 
possible. It is therefore necessary that Croydon plans to enable it 
to supply care provision to meet current and future needs of 
Croydon residents. A change in policy ensures :  
 Croydon’s planning policy supports its commissioning 
intentions ; 
 The Council has first -hand knowledge of the services 
operating in the borough as required by the Care Act 2014 ; 
and 
 The provision is in alignment with emerging care needs . 
4.36 Croydon experiences a range of challenges arising from 
the significant number of nursing and residential care homes that 
continue to be sited in the borough. These challenges include 
excess demand on a range of local health and social care  
64 
 services which is not reflected in national funding formulae for 
central Government funding towards local services. 
4.37 As of September 2015 March 2020 the 142 126 care 
homes in Croydon have a total capacity of 2,796 2,837 bed 
spaces. Between April 2014 2019  and November 2014 2019 , 
761 872 of those bed spaces were occupied by people placed by 
Croydon Council and Croydon Care Commissioning Group (the 
grou
ping of GPs in Croydon that provides primary health care 
services in the borough). It was estimated that between 1,000 
and 1,150 bed spaces were occupied by self-funders. The 
remainder of the bed spaces were either vacant or occupied by 
people placed from outside of Croydon. This has an adverse 
impact on the provision of health services in Croydon. 
4.38 Services provided by care homes within the borough do not 
fully meet the needs of Croydon residents with more specialised 
or urgent needs. As a consequence between April and 
November 2014, 2019  382 412 people were placed in nursing 
and residential care homes outside the borough. This is an 
undesirable outcome because vulnerable people risk losing their 
natural family and community support networks when placed at 
distance from Croydon. 4.39 Croydon will seek to meet the  has produced a Market 
Position Statement (2015) to ascertain the level of future need s 
of households with complex and dual care housing needs. This 
includes family members and individuals with  As need changes , 
it is projected that 1,118 beds spaces will be needed by 2020 
and 1,450 by 2030 across learning disability ies, mental health 
illnesses , older people and physical disability ies services, to 
meet the increased complex and dual care needs of people 
placed by the Council or the Croydon Care Commissioning 
Group. 
4.40 The National Planning Policy Framework (paragraph 50) 
states that local planning authorities should plan for a mix of 
housing based on current and future demographic trends, market 
trends and the needs of different groups in the community. 
4.41 In accordance with the London Plan, the need for this type 
of accommodation has been identified taking into account the 
indicative requirement benchmarks set out in Annex A5 Table 
4.3: Specialist Housing for Older People. 
Policy DM2: Residential care and nursing homes 
DM2.1 Planning permission for new residential care or nursin g homes will only be granted if  there i s a need for the particular services 
provided by the home in supporting with the care of residents of Croydon.  
DM2.2 Proposals for supported living and sheltered accommodation will generally be supported in the borough  in accordance with the 
London Plan, Annex A5 Table 4.3 , Specialist Housing for Older People .  
DM2.3 This policy does not apply to accommodation for children (under the age of eighteen) . 
  
65 
 How the policy works 
4.42 Where there is an identified demand for residential care 
and nursing home bed spaces, the Council will support provision 
of this type of housing. This policy seeks to meet this need, 
however does not support an over-provision of care and nursing 
home bed spaces. This is the preferred approach as set out in 
the care home forecast.  
4.43 The Care Act 2014 places a duty on all local authorities to 
meet the need for residential care and nursing home bed spaces 
within their own area. The policy accords with Annex A5 Table 
4.3: Specialist Housing for Older People of the London Plan.  
4.44 According to Croydon’s Market Position Statement there 
are ample care and nursing home bed spaces within the borough 
to satisfy demand up to 2031. The policy therefore seeks to 
address the current over-provision and supply this type of 
accommodation only where there is an identified need.  
4.45 Croydon’s Market Position Statement will be used to 
assess applications for new residential care and nursing homes 
to determine whether there is a need. 
4.46 It is considered preferable that people within the borough 
that require care are cared for within their community, close to 
their networks of friends and family.

 Large scale purpose built shared living  
Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic 
policies 
 Strategic Objective 3  
 Strategic Objective 4  
 Strategic Objective 7  
 
 Policy SP1  
 
Why we need this policy  
4.46A  Large-scale purpose-built shared living housing is generally 
understood to be a large scale purpose built managed rental 
block, comprising of functional private living units with extensive 
communal facilities, under single professional management. 
These schemes include a wide range of amenities to support a 
diverse community of residents and their needs. These may be 
able to help meet the housing needs  among single-person 
households by adding to the stock of rooms available for rent in 
the borough; as well as help free up larger dwellings and flats to 
address the shortfall in family homes, 
4.46B  Large scale purpose built shared housing is a unique new 
form of development that seeks to address the demands of a 
niche subset of the housing market, so policies are required to 
shape the delivery of these. This will ensure the development of 
well designed, adequately sized rooms with a sufficient quantity of 
quality communal areas and facilities in order to enable future residents to fulfil their daily needs, interact with one another; and 
develop sustainable and cohesive communities, as well as 
promote their health and well-being. It will provide residents with 
increased security via a medium – long term tenancy agreement, 
to enable them to establish themselves, feel more connected to a 
locality, and be part of a community. This will also help avoid 
generic issues related to HMO properties such as a lack of/poor 
quality shared communal facilities and amenity facilities, 
insufficient parking spaces, lack of long term tenancy security and 
transitory living as well as poor management/maintenance of 
properties. Finally, it will seek to ensure future schemes are 
located within the most accessible locations to local facilities, 
services and avoid the potential loss of residential 
uses/permissions via speculative applications and an over 
concentration of large scale purpose built shared living and 
student accommodation.       
   
67 
 Policy DM2A: Large scale purpose built shared living 
DM2A.1 Development proposals for large -scale purpose -built shared living will be supported where they meet both the requirements of 
London Plan P olicy H16 an d the following additional Croydon -specific requirements:  
a) Proposal should not compromise the delivery of self -contained housing to meet the future  needs of the b orough during the life of the Plan   
b) Proposals should be sited with in locations with good or e xcellent public transport accessibility  and is well served by local services ;  
c) There should not be more than two large scale purpose built shared living schemes and purpose built student housing within a 250m 
distance of each other and total capacity of sc hemes (using a ratio of 1.8 beds/per C3 unit) should not exceed 5% of total place based 
housing growth. This will ensure development would not result in an over -concentration of similar uses, which may be detrimental to 
residential amenity or the balance a nd mix of uses in the area or place undue pressure on local infrastructure Including Green and social 
Infrastructure).  
 
DM2A.2 Affordable housing contributions should be made in accordance with London Plan policy H16 in the form of a single upfront 
paymen t to Croydon based on 50 per cent discount to market value of 35 per cent of the units (or 50 per cent of the units where the  London 
Plan threshold applies).  
 
DM2A.3 Each private unit shall include or have exclusive access to the following;  
a)  at least 20-30sqm range of functional living space separate from the communal facilities;  
b) A minimum of 5m2 of communal amenity space shall be provided per bed space/person incorporating a wide range of amenities to 
support a diverse and inclusive community of resident s and to address their needs   
c) Include at least one set of cooking facilities for every 2 -5 persons and two sets for every 6 -10 persons  
d) Provided storage space in both private and communal areas.  
e) includes a management plan that, to the satisfaction of the Council, will appropriately mitigate potential harm to the amenities of future 
resident and neighbouring properties   
68 
  
How the policy works  
4.46C   In Croydon, large-scale purpose-built Shared living 
developments are generally considered to consist of at least 50 
non-self-contained units.  
4.46D Proposals for large-scale purpose-built shared living should 
not compromise delivery of self-contained housing to meet the 
future housing needs of the borough .  
4.46E A minimum range of circa 20-30 SQM of personal 
functional living space per bed/person is considered acceptable in 
a large scale purpose-built shared living development. A smaller 
area per person would not provide an adequate living environment 
for the health and well-being of the borough’s residents. Each 
personal room should include a window. In addition, proposals will 
need to be; well-designed that will include an adequate level of 
natural sunlight and ventilation,  
4.46F  In contrast, a minimum communal space of 5SQM per 
bed/person is considered reasonable, given the relatively small 
size of private space and potentially a high number of residents 
residing and using these. An adequate quantity of kitchen facilities 
are an important component of shared living and these should be 
well designed and highly accessible, to meet needs of all users. 
This will enable residents to fulfil their day to day needs, interact, 
socialise with their neighbours, develop healthy relationships and 
build a diverse inclusive, cohesive community. Communal spaces 
should provide a range of amenities that facilitate health and well-
being that support a diverse community and address their daily 
needs. Given the very high density nature of this type of 
accommodation, proposals should be located the in parts of the 
borough with good or excellent public transport accessibility levels and well -served by local services. To avoid an over concentration 
of Purpose Built large scale Purpose Built shared living and 
purpose built student living schemes, no more than two of these 
similar uses should be located within 250m distance of each other 
and the total quantity of the former should not exceed 5% of the 
total housing growth proposed for a place within the Plan. This will 
ensure that shared living schemes are located throughout the area 
and within the most sustainable locations of the borough in line 
with the settlement hierarchy. Further, it will help ensure that 
schemes do not compromise the delivery of conventional housing, 
particularly in places where lower levels of housing growth is 
proposed by the Plan, where the delivery of 50 bed unit schemes 
(assuming London Plan ratio of 1.8bed: 1 C3) may not be possible 
or in delivered lower quantities, vice versa. This approach will 
prioritise the delivery of conventional housing to address the 
needs of families, avoid any potential adverse effects of over 
concentration on residential amenity or the mix of uses and 
balance of population in a neighbourhood and local pressures on 
services, infrastructure given the very high-density characteristics. 
4.46G  Large-scale purpose-built shared living schemes fall within 
a sui generis non-self-contained market housing use. Both the 
functional private living areas, communal areas/facilities should be 
designed, planned to be used integrally by future residents at the 
outset and these schemes should not be used to provide a mass 
quantity of poor quality mini living units, as an alternative to 
providing well designed, high quality C3 residential dwellings. Any 
applications for change of use to convert these schemes to C3 
residential use at a later date will be very challenging. To 
effectively achieve this, it will need to ensure full compliance with 
London Plan Space standards or national technical standards, as  
69 
 well as the minimum design and amenity standards of the local 
Plan.

 Vacant building credit 
Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies 
 Strategic Objective 3  
 Policy SP2  
Why we need this policy
4.47 A Ministerial Statement on 28th November 2014 introduced 
a vacant building credit for developers of vacant buildings such 
that a reduced provision of National policy provides an incentive 
for brownfield development on sites containing vacant buildings, 
via a vacant building credit. This allows the developers of these 
to reduce their requirements for affordable housing should be 
required contributions based on the amount of vacant floor space 
being bought back into use or redeveloped . This vacant building 
credit only applies to buildings which have not been made 
intentionally vacant in order to redevelop them and to sites which 
do not have an extant or recently expired permission for the same or similar development. A policy is required to set out how 
it will be determined that a building has not been made 
intentionally vacant, to define a same or similar development and 
a recently expired permission. 
4.48 The Mayor of London’s Draft Interim Housing SPG 
encouraged boroughs to have policies in their local plans that set 
out the criteria for how the vacant building credit will be applied. 
In particular it suggested minimum vacancy periods and 
marketing requirements should be set. 
Policy DM3: Vacant building credit 
DM3.1 The Council will promote the re -use or redevelopment of existing buildings by applying a vacant building credit such that affordable 
housing req uirements will only apply to the net increase in floor space resultant from development of buildings which have been:  
a. Vacant for a period of at least eighteen months prior to the granting of planning permission; and  
b. Marketed for their lawful use (or uses w hich could be lawful under the General Permitted Development Order) throughout the period they 
have been vacant.   
71 
 DM3.2 Vacant building credit will not be applied to development proposals  or to proposals to modify S106 agreements for schemes which 
are the s ame as or similar to an extant or recently expired planning permission where:  
a. A similar planning permission is one  where there is less than a 25% increase in the proposed residential  and non -residential floor space  
and where the overall residential floor s pace  is more than half that of the existing or recently expired permission; and  
b. A recently expired permission is one that lapsed within the previous two years prior to the granting of consent of the new pl anning 
permission.  
 
How the policy works 
4.49 The policy should ensure that only genuinely vacant 
buildings benefit from the vacant building credit and thus 
encourage their return to use. 
4.50 Buildings that have been made intentionally vacant, 
including those made redundant through estate rationalisation 
will not benefit from the vacant building credit. 
4.51 Vacant building credit does not apply to abandoned 
buildings. There is no planning definition of abandoned buildings; 
however an abando ned building cannot be marketed Courts 
have set out circumstances for deciding whether a use has been 
abandoned and the relevant circumstances for consideration, 
such as the condition of the property, the period of non-use, 
whether there is an intervening use; and any evidence regarding 
the owner’s intention. 
4.52 The threshold for a similar proposal is set to prevent 
applications for developments with marginal increases or 
decreases in floor space, or changes of use or reduction in size 
of non-residential floor space avoiding providing needed 
affordable housing. 4.53 Likewise, a two year period as the definition of a recently 
expired permission is set to provide a disincentive to simply let 
existing permission expire so that vacant building credit can be 
applied for thus reducing the amount of affordable housing 
provided. 
4.54 Where vacant building credit is applicable to a development 
proposal, the full affordable housing requirements set by Policy 
SP2.4 of the Croydon Local Plan will apply to the net increase in 
floor space. This means that the Council will negotiate for 50% of 
the net increase in floor space to be for affordable housing and 
the current minimum requirements will apply in full. The Council 
will expect overall scheme viability to improve with the 
application of vacant building credit and this will be reflected in 
negotiations around any planning obligations including affordable 
housing.

 5. Employment  
Strategic policy 
Where we are now 
5.1 The key issues that the borough faces in terms of planning for 
employment up to 2036 are: 
 Land for industry and warehousing will need to have continued 
protection to support these sectors in the future. 
 There is approximately 30% vacant office floor space in Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre and current low rents do not support the 
development of new office floor space, although some speculative 
office is being built out. 
 While there is approximately 30% vacant office floor space in 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre, this is predominantly B grade office 
space with the area is experiencing an undersupply of Grade A 
floor space, which is exacerbated by low rents which do not support 
the development of new office floor space 
 Supporting the area around East Croydon Station and New 
Town as Croydon Metropolitan Centre’s office centre.   
 The public realm of Croydon Metropolitan Centre has seen 
considerable investment and improvement, but renewal remains 
necessary as poor public realm discourages businesses from 
locating in Croydon and people shopping in the town. 
 Encouraging development in Croydon Metropolitan Centre 
through flexible and pragmatic planning, that contributes to the 
centre's economic prosperity and vitality. 
 Croydon faces competition from other areas of London and the 
South East for inward investment both in office and retail markets.  The increase in the population of Croydon and planned house 
building will result in an increase in the need for jobs. 
 Establishing a policy response to the contracting of retail uses 
within District, and Local Centres, increased vacant premises,  with 
poorly  designed conversions uses, has impacted on the public 
realm and the ability of the Centres to attract new business and 
create attractive residential areas. 
 Retail Uses are declining with Croydon’s Town Centres which 
include Croydon Metropolitan Centre and the District and Local 
centres. This has led to an increase in vacant premises, this in 
combination with poorly designed conversions to other uses has 
had a negative impact on the public realm and consequently the 
ability of centres to attract new businesses to create attractive focal 
points for the community. 
Where we want to be 
Strategic Objective 1:  Establish Croydon as the premier 
business location in South London and the Gatwick Diamond.  
Strategic Objective 2:  Foster an environment where existing, 
new, innovative, cultural  and creative enterprises can prosper.  
Strategic Objective 4:  Reduce social, economic and 
environmental deprivation, particularly where it is spatially 
concentrated, by taking priority measures to reduce 
unemployment, improve skills and education and rene w housing, 
community and environmental conditions.  
Strategic Objective 8:  Improve accessibility, connectivity, 
sustainability and ease of movement to, from and within the 
borough.

SP3.5 The Council will support Croydon is home to a diverse population known for its creative industries and unique culture, development 
for these uses that support culture and diversity will be supported as well as the temporary occupation of empty buildings and cleared sites 
by creative industries , and cultural organisations and other meanwhile uses where they contribute to regeneration and enhance the 
character and vitality of the area.  
Town and N eighbourho od Centres  
SP3.6 The Council will apply the London Plan Town Centre hierarchy:  
a) Croydon Metropolitan Centre  
b) District Centres: Addiscombe, Coulsdon, Crystal Palace, New Addington, Norbury, Purley, Selsdon, So uth Norwood and Thornton 
Heath  
c) Local Centres: Beulah Road, Brighton Rd (Sanderstead Road), Brighton Road (Selsdon Road), Broad Green, Hamsey Green, 
Pollards Hill, Sanderstead, Shirley and Thornton Heath Pond . 
d) Future new Local Centres: Fiveways, Waddon Mars h, Valley Park  
Neighbourhood Centres   
75 
 e) In addition , a number of Neighbourhood  Centres have been identified as follows:  
Ashburton Park, Bridgstock Rd., Brighton Rd./Downlands Rd, Coulsdon Rd./Court Road, Green Lane/Northwood Rd., Godstone Rd., 
Fieldway, Londo n Rd./Kidderminster Rd, Lower Addiscombe Rd./Cherry Orchard Rd.,Portland Rd./Watcombe Rd./Woodside Ave., 
Shirley Rd., Selsdon Park Rd./Featherbed Lane, Selhurst  Rd, South End/Parker Rd./St. Peter’s Church, Spring Park/Bridle Rd., South 
Norwood Hill, Waddo n Rd./Abbey Rd., Woodside Green.   
f) A new Neighbourhood centre is proposed at Waddon Way.  
SP3.7 The Council will work with the GLA and neighbouring boroughs to ensure Croydon’s network of town centres is sufficiently flex ible to 
accommodate change up to 2031 by:  
a) Working with its partners through the process of regular town centre ‘health checks’ to highlight reclassifications of the boro ugh’s 
existing Local and District Centres ; and 
b) Designating the boundaries of the network of town centres and their Primary Shoppin g Areas in the Croydon Local Plan ’s Detailed 
Policies and Proposals and undertaking regular review to ensure the vitality of the centres is maintained . and 
c) Considering the designation of new Local Centres at Fiveways and Valley Park when they can be suppor ted by population growth in 
these areas.  
SP3.8 The Council will promote and support the development of all B1 uses (including office, light industry and research & developm ent) 
retail, leisure (including evening/ night -time economy uses), visitor accommodation, a nd housing and community facilities within Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre, District Centres and Local Centres.  As a borough with a focus on innovation and enterprise development that 
encourages opportunities for local business to start, grow and remain in Cro ydon are supported. Local business and enterprise should be 
encouraged through a healthy mix of uses at a variety of scales with the provision and retention of affordable units and oppo rtunities such as 
provision of studios or managed workspace.  
SP3.9 Croydon’s  location lends it a number of strategic benefits, positioned centrally in the London – Gatwick Diamond , Croydon is well 
positioned to support innovation and enterprise uses. As the borough’s metropolitan centre the  Croydon Metropolitan Centre will remain t he 
principal location in the borough for office, retail, cultural business uses (including office, light industry and research & development), retail, 
leisure (including evening/night -time economy uses), visitor accommodation, housing and community facilit ies and hotel activity, and also be  
76 
 the largest retail and commercial centre in South London . A flexible approach will be applied to these uses, the mix and scale of these uses 
must be appropriate to support the Croydon Metropolitan Centre‘s higher order d estination function . 
SP3.10 The Council will adopt a flexible approach to B1 uses (office, light industry and research & development), retail, leisure 
(including evening/night -time economy uses), visitor accommodation, and housing and community facilities within Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre.  This flexible approach will be supplemented by the Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework and the Council's mas terplans 
that apply to the Croydon Metropolitan Centre.  Neighbourhood centres are key to sustainable neighbour hoods. Intended to be located within 
walking or cycling distance from neighbourhoods, these centres provide multimodal access to a communities day -to-day service needs . A 
wide variety of smaller scale development proposals which will enhance the vitality a nd viability of a neighbourhood centre and meet 
community needs will be supported.  
SP3.11 The Council will promote and support measures to improve the quality of the borough’s stock of retail27 and office28 premises, 
particularly in the Croydon Metropolitan Centre . Much  of Croydon’s office stock is characterised by older B grade offices. Development that 
supports the creation and refurbishment of the borough’s office stock, provision of affordable workspace and retail premises in the Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre will  be encouraged.  
SP3.12 The Council will favourably consider net increases to the stock of retail premises commensurate with Croydon’s retail functio n 
as a Metropolitan Centre and ensuring the viability and vitality of Croydon Metropolitan Centre, District Centre and Local Centres.  The 
Council will seek to maintain as a minimum, the current amount of retail floor space in Croydon, enhance the quality of retai l floor space in 
Croydon and seek to reduce A Use Class vacancy . Development should reflect the implication s of a shifting work environment supporting 
flexible use of office space to reinforce the areas employment function. At the street level development should encourage wal kability and the 
pedestrian experience creating pedestrian friendly frontages along key  pedestrian routes leading to the town centres.    
SP3.13 The Council will promote and support the development of new and refurbished office floor space in Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre, particularly around East Croydon Station and within New Town, and the District Centres as follows29:  East Croydon Station is the 
borough’s key transportation hub, development and refurbishment of office floor space that encourages sustainable travel and provision of 
new local working and employment opportunities including affordable workspace around the station and within the Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre  is supported as follows .   
a) Up to 92,000 30,500 m2 by 2031  2039  to be located in Croydon Metropolitan Centre;  and

 b) Retaining, or through refurbishment providing, higher quality office flo or space (Grade A), or lower quality floor space for which there 
remains a demand, within the Office Retention Area of the Croydon Metropolitan Centre. Mixed use developments must include a level of 
office floor space proportionate to Croydon’s role as an Edge of London Outer London  Office Centre ; and  
c) Up to 7,000m2 to be spread across the borough’s District Centres . 
SP3.14 Opportunities for employment and skills training will be considered by means of section 106 agreements for major 
developments (residential deve lopments of 10 units or more or non -residential developments exceeding 1,000 m2). The Council will seek to 
secure a minimum of 20% of the total jobs created by the construction of new development above the set threshold to be advert ised 
exclusively to local  residents through the Council’s Job Brokerage Service for a specified minimum period. It is expected that best 
endeavours be used and that the developer will work with the Council to ensure that the target of 20% employment of local res idents is 
achieved in both construction and end user phase of new qualifying development.  
SP3.14A Each of Croydon’s District and Local Centres collectively form the borough’s town centres as defined in Annex 2 of the NPPF. 
Each has a diverse community and unique culture. To  encourage local opportunities to live, work and play development in these centres 
should support the consolidation of uses to target toward the local community. Business and Town Centre Uses coming forward s hould 
provide affordable workspace for small and  medium size businesses that reflect the scale and nature of the centre.

 Why we have taken this approach 
Innovation, Investment & Enterprise 
5.2 The vision from Croydon’s Sustainable Community Strategy 
states ‘We will be London’s most enterprising borough – a city 
that fosters ideas, innovation and learning and provides skills, 
opportunity and a sense of belonging for all’. A network of 
Enterprise Centres focusing on cultural and creative industries 
and innovation will be pursued across the borough as part of 
realising this vision. 
5.3 The Council is committed to training, work placements and 
apprenticeships and views them as being a sustainable way to 
improve employment prospects for local people. The Council is 
determined to ensure that S106 obligations secure placements 
for local people during the construction phase of building projects 
and the provision of skills training. 
5.4 In the face of strong competition from other uses, planning 
policies giving strong protection for industrial sites have served 
the borough well in terms of retaining the stock of industrial and 
warehousing premises and land.36  
5.5 To achieve our vision to ‘…be London’s most enterprising 
borough …  create a fairer, more inclusive Croydon with a vibrant, 
resilient and sustainable local economy ’ it is essential that 
Croydon has the capacity to meet expected demand for small 
and medium enterprise employment,  industrial and warehousing 
activities. The evidence base indicates that the current supply is 
tight and predicted to become more so. The Croydon Monitoring 
Report (April,201 58) found that overall there was a net loss of 
                                            
36 Table 7.3, p.107 – LB Croydon Office, Industrial, Warehousing 
Land/Premises Market Assessment (August 2010) 
37 The London Plan sets out the approach each borough should take in relation 
to industrial land. For some boroughs, this means releasing an identified over almost 42,000m2 34,811m2 of Class B floor space in Croydon 
between 2011 and 2015 8. 
5.6 The ‘4-tier’ approach  is a strong approach to the protection of 
industrial capacity (in line with Croydon’s ‘restrictive transfer’ 
status37) which supports the South London Waste Plan DPD, yet 
also offers greater prospects of bringing about investment and 
renewal of industrial/employment locations, bringing forward new 
workshops/studios in town centre locations and meeting other 
policy objectives. 
5.7 ‘Tier 1' locations are significant sized industrial locations that 
have historically been established and are self -contained so that 
they benefit from better separation from nearby residential 
properties and therefore lend themselves to the highest level of 
protection for industrial and warehousing activity. Two of these 
areas Purley Way (comprising Purley Way North and South) and 
Marlpit Lane  are also identified as Preferred Industrial Locations 
in the London Plan – see Fig 5.1). “Tier 1” locations due to their 
strategic function and economic importance will be subject to the 
highest policy protection to ensure their economic importance is 
assured. in the London Plan as Strategic industrial Locations  and 
should therefore have the highest policy protection to ensure 
their economic importance which have local as well as regional 
economic significance is assured . 
5.8 ‘Tier 2' Locations perform an important economic function but 
are smaller scale industrial e states where residential 
development grew up alongside the commercial buildings. This 
proximity between uses has not resulted in undue harm to 
supply for alternative uses. For Croydon, it means continuing with a more 
restrictive approach to the transfer of industrial sites to other uses.  
88 
 residential amenity and therefore, new mixed-use schemes, that 
are well designed and give priority to the area’s commercial 
functionality, are acceptable. New Class B1b, B1c, B2 and B8 
premises in mixed use developments should be designed to 
meet the needs of future occupiers and to preclude future 
conversion to residential use. Mixed use developments in these 
locations must not result in an increase in operational difficulties 
for businesses. 'Tier 2' locations also perform an important 
economic function so will be subject to strong policy protection to 
ensure their role is assured.  They perform a valuable economic 
function as they generally employ a local workforce. This function 
of Tier 2 locations has a social benefit as well as being 
sustainable as the workforce does not travel so far encouraging 
sustainability of the location .   
5.9 The fringes of some Tier 1 and Tier 2 locations within the 
context of Policy SP3.2 have the potential for transition through 
development that enables the locations to relate better to their 
surrounding uses and character.  This transition could come in 
the form of intensification of development, high density 
development and the introduction of new land uses or mix of land 
uses. Paragraph deleted 
5.10 Extending protection of industrial/warehousing activities to 
sites falling  Wwithin town centres  ('Tier 3' ) 
(industrial/warehousing uses will be pro tected to help the Council 
limit the losses in the borough wide stock of such premises. The 
promotion of new workshops in these locations will also add a 
greater degree of diversity (and theoretically a greater 
resilience), to the employment offer of the b orough's town 
centres. However the Council will adopt a flexible approach to B1 
uses (excluding B1a office), leisure, visitor accommodation, and 
housing and community facilities within Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre . 5.11 The Council is aware that D1 uses can struggle to find 
suitable premises. This has led, in the past, to situations where 
‘Tier 1’ type premises have been lost to community uses to the 
detriment of the area’s business function. Allowing the change of 
use or redevelopment of ‘Tier 2 and 4’ premises in the more 
accessible locations, to D1 use class activities (non-residential 
institutions), not only helps safeguard ‘Tier 1’ for continued 
industrial uses, it also opens up a significant supply of premises 
for community uses/groups to consider. Restricting this flexibility 
to higher PTAL locations means that uses which attract large 
numbers of visitors will be able to make more use of public 
transport.  Paragraph deleted  
5.12 Likewise Gypsies and Travellers also struggle to find 
suitable sites for new pitches. To enable provision of sites 
throughout the Plan period, particularly the last ten years of the 
Plan period, the development of ‘Tier  1’ sites to use as Gypsy 
and Traveller pitches (for those families with a qualified 
connection to Croydon) will be permitted. In the case of Gypsies 
and Travellers, a qualified connection is defined as being 
resident on an existing authorised site in Croydon (but with no 
space to expand), being the parent, grandparent, child, 
grandchild, brother or sister of a Gypsy or Traveller currently 
resident in Croydon on an authorised site; or having resided in 
Croydon on unauthorised sites for a period of not less than five 
years ending on the date of adoption of the Local Plan. If there is 
no qualified connection then the use of Tier 1 sites would not be 
permitted. 
5.13 In order to demonstrate that there is no demand for a 
scheme comprised solely of Class B1b and B1c, B2 and B8 uses 
in ‘Tiers 2, 3 and 4’ locations, evidence will need to be submitted 
that a marketing exercise has been undertaken for a minimum of 
18 months. The Council will need to be satisfied that the site has 
been offered at a price commensurate with the value of the site  
89 
 for the permitted uses and that active promotion has been 
undertaken by agents marketing the site. 
5.14 Croydon is good at producing creative talent (BRIT School, 
College of Art, Dance, Dubstep etc.), but less successful at 
providing them with a base in the borough38. Other London 
boroughs have been able to address this – e.g. the ‘Chocolate 
Factory’ in Hackney and Westbourne Studios in Kensington and 
Chelsea. Evidence supports promotion and supporting cultural 
and creative industries to assist in changing Croydon's image39. 
5.15 The study, ‘Understanding and Shaping the Cultural Sector 
in the London Borough of Croydon, Sept 2010’, highlights 
clusters of creative industries talent in four locations with a 
recommendation that the  The creative and cultural sectors are a 
key industry in Croydon, the  Enterprise Centre in Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre act as a flagship for the sector. Developing a 
central location as a 'hub' will provide a clear signal that Croydon 
is 'open for creative businesses'. 
5.16 Croydon is well known for the success rising from its 
creative economy.  The Fairfield Halls is a cultural asset  and 
creative space  synonymous with Croydon and is also of regional 
importance. therefore its retention and remodelling merits 
inclusion within the Strategic Policies of the Croydon Local Plan .   
As a creative space synonymous with Croydon, its retention  has 
a prominent role in supporting the development of spaces for the 
creative economy and  merits inclusion within the Strategic 
Policies of the Croydon Local Plan . 
5.17 The creative economy has previously been associated with 
those of with low social mobility which has constraining  the 
                                            
38 ‘Understanding and Shaping the Cultural Sector in L.B. Croydon (Draft Final 
Report)’ (Sept 2010) sectors ability to thrive. Across Croydon, but particularly within 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre, there are substantial amounts of 
underused sites/buildings. This usually corresponds with sites 
that are pending development. The Council considers such sites 
lying dormant a potential opportunity.  Organisations  within this 
sector such as ACAVA (Association for Cultural Advancement 
through Visual Art) and ACME (providing artists with affordable 
studio and living space) are experts at making temporary use of 
such space. Opportunities to support Croydon’s Cultural and 
Creative industries through temporary occupation should be 
taken allowing the industry to grow and support chances for 
increased social mobility.  Elsewhere in the Strategic Policies 
other temporar y uses are promoted such as urban greening, 
urban agriculture and providing space for community groups. 
Providing a variety of different sized employment and 
workspaces aims to encourage and maintain local business in 
Croydon. Ensuring small and medium uni ts are available 
following redevelopment provides affordable options for 
businesses starting out as well as making sure there is space in 
the borough for businesses to grow into remaining in the borough 
as they expand . 
5.18 As well as encouraging new activity in this sector, it is 
essential that the Council continues to protect existing capacity 
for activities such as theatres, cinemas, art galleries etc. This is 
supported by the Culture for all Londoner’s – Mayor of London’s 
Cultural Strategy. Policy Action 2.1 of the London Mayor’s 
Cultural Metropolis Strategy. 
5.19 Encouraging design that is sensitive to the character of the 
area is an important way to improve the quality of the built 
environment in the borough. Development should consider its 
39 ‘Understanding and Shaping the Cultural Sector in L.B. Croydon (Draft Final 
Report)’ (Sept 2010)  
90 
 orientation on site with respect to main roadways, providing clear 
signage and landscaping where appropriate. Addressing the 
interface between industrial and non-industrial sites as well as 
the streetscape should be used to improve the quality of the 
environment. Design considerations that address placemaking 
should be integrated into industrial sites to improve conditions for 
employment and worker amenity. Derelict sites and buildings can 
impact on the perception of the borough and the visual quality of 
the public realm. They can have an adverse impact on 
community safety owing to lack of active frontages. A policy to 
encourage creative and cultural uses can enhance the public 
realm to help build social cohesion, support cultural diversity and 
engender a sense of safety and belonging as well as helping this 
sector to grow in the borough. 
Town Centres 
5.20 The process of conducting town centre health checks 
should ensure that the role of the borough’s town centres and 
their relationships to one another is fit for purpose and 
adequately supports the London network of town centres and the 
borough’s convenience and comparison retail needs. Centres 
can be reclassified in the light of subsequent reviews or 
alterations to future LDF DPDs. Changes to the upper tiers in the 
network (Major and above) should be coordinated first through 
the London Plan   the Local Plan or the London Plan . 
5.21 The objective to direct town centre uses to existing centres 
(because of their higher levels of accessibility and ability to 
support multiple purpose trips) rema ins central to government 
policy in the National Planning Policy Framework and provides 
justification for this policy. The mix of uses in each centre will be 
determined by factors such as existing  clusters of activity (e.g. 
vibrant evening economy, groupin g of large offices, presence of 
higher education providers, etc.) as well as other designations . 
For example, both Crystal Palace and Croydon Metropolitan Centre are identified in the Sub-Regional Development 
Framework, South London, 2006 (Table 1D.3), as Primary 
Locations for future visitor accommodation.  
5.22 Croydon Metropolitan Centre has the highest level of 
regional and sub -regional  accessibility in the borough. The case 
for it to be the principal location for the town centre uses is 
supported by the impor tance attached to Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre in the London Plan. The Council is committed to 
facilitating development within Croydon Metropolitan Centre. 
Therefore, the Council will seek to strengthen Croydon's role as 
a Metropolitan Centre as covered in detail in the North End 
Quarter policies of this Plan, the supplementary Croydon 
Opportunity Area Framework and the Council’s  Masterplans  that 
apply to the Croydon Metropolitan Centre.  Therefore, the Council 
will seek to strengthen Croydon’s role as a  Metropolitan  Centre  
and adopt a flexible approach to B1 uses (office, light industry 
and research & development) retail, leisure (including 
evening/night -time economy uses), visitor accommodation, and 
housing and community facilities within Croydon Metropolit an 
Centre. This flexible approach will be supplemented by the 
Croydon Opportunity Area Framework and the Council's 
masterplans that apply to the Croydon Metropolitan Centre.  
Policies in the Transport and Telec ommunications section to 
improve Wi -Fi connecti vity and mobile phone bandwidth will 
support this policy . 
5.23 Furthermore, changing the town centre hierarchy as set out 
in Croydon’s Unitary Development Plan to the hierarchy set out 
in the London Plan brings the Strategic Policies into general 
conformity with the regional plan. Development in Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre will be promoted in accordance with the 
London Plan designation as an ‘Opportunity Area, a 
‘Metropolitan Centre’, a ‘Potential Outer London Development 
Centre’ for ‘Strategic Office’ and ‘Higher Education’ uses and in  
91 
 accordance with its status as a ‘Strategic Cluster of Night-Time 
Activity with Regional/Sub-Regional Importance’. 
5.24 Regular town centre ‘health checks’ form part of the 
Council’s promotional role and help to ensure boundaries, 
policies and classifications remain relevant. The nature of 
planned growth in the borough over the plan period could 
necessitate the need to provide additional town centres. 
Conversely, other centres which face challenges resulting from 
changes in retailing (growth in online shopping, competition from 
out-of-town retail, etc.) may require consolidation. 
5.25 In addition to the London Plan town  centre  hierarchy,  
Neighbourhood Centres  have been identified. These offer the 
opportunity for clusters of uses, in particular  community uses, to 
emerge or be supported by planning policy. Accessible to 
residents by active transport these well connected areas are key 
to encouraging population health by increasing activity and 
improving air quality through reduced dependence on th e private 
vehicle. The identification of  Neighbourhood  Centres goes 
beyond  recognising centres  solely for their retail function, but for 
the wider role they play in supporting the local community .  
5.26 Croydon is in competition for inward investment with other 
parts of London, notably the Thames Gateway and the M4 
corridor (the Western Wedge). It also competes with centres in 
Surrey and West Sussex and to do so successfully, the stock of 
commercial premises needs to be improved. Policy SP4 (Urban 
Design & Local Character) will also help Croydon to retain/attract 
new job opportunities. 
5.27 It is anticipated that the level of reduction in retail vacancies 
will be achieved through the regeneration of Croydon as a 
Metropolitan Centre and through a mixture of new letting s and 
redevelopments of town centre sites. Within Croydon Metropolitan Centre, the Opportunity Area Planning Framework 
will address this point and the uptake of approximately 15,500m2 
floor space alone could equate to the provision of approximately 
800 additional jobs. For the District and Local Centres the 
proposed reduction in vacancy would equate to an uptake of 
approximately 16,000m2 floor space and provision of 
approximately 850 additional jobs.  
5.28 Based on labour growth forecasts  the demand for office 
space in the borough over the plan period 2013 to 2031 is for 
between 29,440 33,000  m2 and 91,840  44,000 m2. It is estimated 
that there is potential for 60,010m2 of space . This space 
requirement is of a similar scale to that estimated for the 2010 
Employment Land Review. The lower end of the range reflects a 
change to more home working as a result of the COVID -19 
pandemic, and it is this figure that is taken forward as the floor 
space target in the Local Plan. This takes into account the 
uncertainty in the off ice market at the time of preparing the Local 
Plan as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. The majority of this 
office space demand, (90%), is projected to be for Grade An 
accommodation in prime locations within the Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre in the vicinit y of East Croydon station, within 
the New Town area (as defined in the Opportunity Area Planning 
Framework). Croydon being identified as a strategic outer 
London office location in the London Plan means this area is the 
borough’s most attractive to commerc ial developers.  Therefore, 
development in this area is encouraged to be office based (in full 
or part) and it is required that office development is explored fully 
as part of any development proposal. Demand is highest in this 
area for Grade A Office floo r space (as defined in the Glossary in 
Appendix 1). There remains demand for cheaper, lower quality 
accommodation for new businesses so, within the Office 
Retention Area loss of office floor space needs to be justified by 
the submission of a viability appr aisal to show that there is no 
demand for office floor space, proportionate office floor space or  
92 
 refurbished offices. Office floor space provision within a scheme 
will also be considered against the complexion and merits of the 
other uses proposed. This growth and protection will increase the 
opportunities for employment in Croydon Metropolitan Centre, 
support its urban renewal and contribute to the Croydon Local 
Plan’s spatial vision of being London's most enterprising 
borough . Higher education attainment has been shown to 
correspond to lower rates of unemployment and poverty. Positive 
outcomes in these areas are associated with increased resilience 
within the community through reduced societal deprivation. 
Opportunities to provide higher education uses such as 
universities and associated facilities to the borough are 
supported. Provision of higher education uses should encourage 
the full eco system of associated activities to the town centre .

Why we need this policy 
5.29 Retailing  Community is at the heart of the borough’s town 
centres. These spaces serve as the primary location for retail, 
meeting the day- to-day needs of the community and can often be 
accessed through active travel. However, they are also places 
where a wide range of other uses help to ensure vitality and 
viability is maintained. This policy sets out the approach to uses 
by location within a centre. For this purpose it sets the following 
designations: 
 Boundaries of the Croydon Metropolitan Centre, District 
and Local Centres (the borough’s  town centres);  
 Primary Shopping Areas ; and 
 Main  Retail Frontages .; and  
 Secondary Retail Frontages . 
5.30 These boundaries were  have been reviewed during the 
preparation of this the 2018 Local Plan to ensure they met meet 
the needs of the borough. The review was has been supported 
by an Assessment of Boundaries and Designations for Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre, District and Local  Centres including 
analysis of mixed use developments (2012 and 2015) and a 
Review of Town Centre Designations (2013).  
94 
 5.31 London Plan policy 2.15 SD6 identifies a range of 
measures boroughs should undertake in relation to town centres, 
including setting out policies for each type of area within centres. 
5.32 Paragraph 23 85 of the National Planning Policy 
Framework states ‘Planning policies should be positive, promote competitive town centre environments and set out policies for the 
management and growth of centres over the plan period support 
the role that town centres play at the heart of local communities, 
by taking a positive approach to their growth, management and 
adaption .’ 
Policy DM4: Development in Croydon Metropolitan Centre, D istrict and Local Centres 
DM4.1 The Council will ensure that the vitality and viability of Croydon Metropolitan Centre and the borough’s District and Local  Centres is 
will be maintain ed and increased by not permitting new developments or changes of use at ground floor  in accordance with Table 5.3 which 
would result in a net loss of ground floor40 Class A uses within Main Retail frontages (unless  it relates to the expansion of an existing 
community use) . 
DM4.2 Within Croydon Metropolitan Centre and the borough’s District and Local Centres development proposals and changes of use on t he 
ground floor must accord with Table 5.3. Policy deleted  
DM4.3 Outside of Main and Secondary  Retail Frontages, but within centres, proposals for mixed use developments will be required to either:  
a) Demonstrate that a specific end user will be occupying the ground floor unit upon completion;  or 
b) Provide a free fitting out of all ground floor units for the eventual end occupier to ensure that the unit is capable of occu pation and 
operation by the end user and ensure that the ground floor units are capable of conversion to the same use as the re mainder of the 
building if after two years, subsequent to completion, no end user has been found for the ground floor unit.

41 For the purposes of calculating the percentage of units within a given frontage, the Council will apply a rule of seven units either side of the subject property and an 
equal number of units on the opposite side of the road (if the frontage designation extends there also). Guidance is given in Appendix 2.

How the policy works 
5.33 In part, this policy sets thresholds for  uses within the Main 
and Secondary Retail  Frontages.  To allow for flexibility in uses 
this policy allows for Class E uses in town centre frontages. This 
policy l imits the saturation of A5 uses Hot Food Takeaways as 
the associated waste and delivery issues can cause harm to 
residential amenity. The clustering of hot -food takeaways can 
have an adverse impact on the vitality and viability of town 
centres, therefore l imiting hot -food takeaways will help to ensure 
residents have a greater choice of retail services . 
5.34 Studies have identified that one in three children is 
overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school and in 
2014, an estimated 62% of the adult population were overweight  
97 
 or obese42.Croydon was selected as a pilot for the Mayor of 
London’s Food Flagship program and one of the aims of the 
program is to improve the quality of food available to schools and 
communities. Limiting the number of hot food takeaways in the 
borough’s town centres will support the public health agenda of 
tackling obesity and associated health problems and will promote 
access to healthier food options.  
5.35 Proposals for B1business uses and affordable workspaces  
will be supported in Secondary  Retail Main Frontages to create 
opportunities for office, research & redevelopment and light 
industrial workshops within town  centres . However, these uses 
should not undermine the retail function of the frontages and  will 
be only permitted if the y should provide an active frontage to 
enhance the vitality of the area .  
5.36 The reason why 250m2 is the threshold for community uses 
within Secondary Retail Frontages in Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre and District and Local Centres, is that it would allow uses 
such as dentist surgeries and a High Street police office to 
operate but would deter larger scale activities from potentially 
undermining the A Use Class focus of these locations. 
Paragraph deleted 
5.37 Across the borough there are many examples of mixed use 
developments in town centres, but outside of Main and 
Secondary Retail Frontages, where the ground floor units have 
been left as an empty shell. The costs of fitting out these units to 
a standard that allows them to be used for their intended purpose 
can be prohibitive and the resultant boarded up units harm the 
vitality of the centre. To avoid this all mixed use developments 
within a town centre but outside of a designated frontage will be 
                                            
42 Building the foundations: Tackling obesity through planning and development 
(Town and Country Planning Association, March 2016) required to have either an end user for the unit (evidenced by a 
pre-let agreement or by the applicant being the end user) at the 
time of granting permission or to provide a free fitting out of the 
unit for the first occupier. 
5.38 All speculative schemes in town centres but outside of Main 
and Secondary Retail Frontages will also be required to be 
designed in a way that would allow conversion of the ground 
floor unit to residential or the same use as the remainder of the 
building if not residential. In some cases, the Council may enter a 
legal agreement with the applicant to ensure that the ground floor 
unit is let and if not then converted to the same use as the 
remainder of the building. 
5.39 For the purposes of Part 3 Class M of the General 
Permitted Development Order (2015), which sets out the 
circumstances where planning permission is not required for 
changes of use from retail to residential use, Main Retail 
Frontages and Secondary Retail Frontages are considered to be 
key shopping areas. In these locations any change of use from a 
retail use to residential will require an application to be made for 
planning permission which will be considered against the 
requirements of this policy.

Why we need this policy
5.40 The Council seeks to provide a range of services and 
community facilities to contribute to its aim of creating healthy 
and liveable neighbourhoods.  as set out in the Croydon Local 
Plan Strategic Policy SP5.3 and Strategic Objectives 5, 6 and 7. 
This will help in promoting healthy communities in line with 
paragraphs 69 and 70 of the National Planning Policy 
Framework. 5.41 In appropriate areas, the Council will seek to promote 
development of community facilities that will serve a 
neighbourhood demand for these uses.   
5.42 Community facilities are defined in the Croydon Local Plan 
as facilities providing for the health and wellbeing, social, 
educational, spiritual, recreational, leisure and cultural needs of 
the community.  
100 
 5.43 Neighbourhood Centres are not intended to compete with 
designated District or Local Centres, and should serve a local 
need smaller in scale to that of a Local Centre. They should be 
able to meet the day- to-day needs of the local community and 
allow for modest growth in order to accommodate local needs.  
5.44 Typically more limited in retail offer to Local or District 
Centres , Neighbourhood Centres may contain a place of 
worship, playground, school, public house, GP and pharmacy. 
5.45 Neighbourhood Centres serve the whole community, but 
are particularly important to those who do not have access to a 
car, are unable to travel far or those with a disability.  
5.46 The London Plan states that boroughs should identify and 
promote the complementary offers of the other smaller centres in 
the network including neighbourhood centres and local shopping 
parades. These play a key role in meeting ‘walk to’, everyday 
needs and are often the core of local ‘Lifetime’ neighbourhoods. 
5.47 Neighbourhood Centres typically serve a localised 
catchment often most accessible by walking and cycling and 
include local parades and small clusters of shops, mostly for 
convenience goods and other services. They may include a 
small supermarket, sub-post office, pharmacy, launderette and 
other useful local services. They can play a key role in 
addressing areas deficient in local retail and other services. 
5.48 The London Plan sets out its ambitions to plan for a range 
of social infrastructure required for London’s communities and 
neighbourhoods to support a high and improving quality of life. It 
supports a city of diverse, strong, secure and accessible 
neighbourhoods and seeks to ensure that neighbourhoods 
provide convenient access, especially by foot, to local goods and 
services needed on a day to day basis. . Local neighbourhoods should act as a focal point for local communities and enhance 
their overall attractiveness. 
5.49 Surplus commercial capacity should be identified and 
brought forward to meet housing and local community needs, 
recognising that this process should contribute to strengthening 
the ‘offer’ of the Centre as a whole. 
5.50 The London Plan advocates a light touch approach 
regarding neighbourhood centres in order to sustain and improve 
their convenience offer while supporting redevelopment of 
surplus units for housing. Paragraph deleted  
5.51 The Urban Design Compendium notes that ‘local facilities 
bring residents together, reinforce community and discourage car 
use’. Furthermore, it states that newsagents should be within a 
five minute walk, and local shops, health centres and other 
services which serve a local need, should be a ten minute walk. 
This approach is also considered appropriate in Shaping 
Neighbourhoods: A Guide for Health, Sustainability and Vitality.

 Policy DM5: Development in Neighbourhood Centres 
DM5.1 The Council will ensure that the vitality and viability of Neighbourhood Centres are maintained and enhanced and that they co ntinue 
to provide a level of service of neigh bourhood significance.  
DM5.2 In the vicinity of  Neighbourhood Centres, development proposals : 
a) For A1-A5 uses, B1 uses Town centre Class E (C ommercial, business and service) uses, Pubs and drinking establishments and 
community facilities should be of a reasonabl e scale, proportionate to serve a neighbourhood need and have a clear relationship to other 
facilities within the centre. Guidance is given in Appendix 4 ; 
b) Must accord with Table 5.5; and  
c) Demonstrably relate to the Neighbourhood Centre, be in scale and be within reasonable walking distance to other retail and 
community uses within the centre.

How the policy works 
5.52 This approach is the preferred approach as it assists in 
promoting the development of community facilities to serve  
103 
 neighbourhood areas and complies with the National Planning 
Policy Framework and the London Plan.  
5.53 Neighbourhood Centres are not town centres (unlike 
District and Local Centres). Thresholds are applied to specific 
uses within Neighbourhood Centres to ensure that proposed 
developments only serve a neighbourhood need and should not 
be to the detriment of designated Local or District Centres whilst 
enabling development of town centre uses that serve the local 
community.t enabling development of town centre uses that 
serve the local community.  
5.54 This policy seeks to ensure that flexibility is granted to 
community facilities that wish to locate in Neighbourhood 
Centres in order to serve a local identified need. 
5.55 Where indicated as acceptable in principle, proposals will 
also have to comply with other policies in the plan such as those 
on neighbouring amenity or traffic safety. 
5.56 Neighbourhood Centres typically serve their immediate 
residential properties, and as such a five to ten minute walk is 
considered an appropriate distance .  
5.57 The Council will not permit the development or expansion 
of retail or commercial premises that would significantly increase 
the ‘offer’ of the Neighbourhood Centre to the detriment of a 
Local or District Centre. For this reason, development of retail 
and town centre community uses with a floor space above 280m2 
will still be subject to a sequential test in accordance with Policy 
DM8:  Development in edge of centre and out of centre locations . 
Town centre uses consider ed are as defined in the glossary of 
the National Planning Policy Framework (under Main town centre 
uses) and in Appendix 1 of this Plan . 5.58 For the purposes of Part 3 Class M of the General 
Permitted Development Order (2015), which sets out the 
circumstances where planning permission is not required for 
changes of use from retail to residential use, designated 
Shopping Parades within Neighbourhood Centres are considered 
to be key shopping areas. In these locations any change of use 
from a retail use to residential will require an application to be 
made for planning permission which will be considered against 
the requirements of this policy which would not allow for the 
conversion.

Why we need this policy
5.59 The primary function of Shopping Parades is to provide 
local convenience shopping facilities. This policy sets out the 
policy approach to different uses within Shopping Parades and 
also designates each Shopping Parade in the borough.  
5.60 In relation to drawing up Local Plans, paragraph 23 60 of 
the National Planning Policy Framework states that local 
planning authorities should ‘set policies for the consideration of proposals for main town centre uses which cannot be 
accommodated in or adjacent to town centres’. 
5.61 A review of all retail units outside any town centre or 
Shopping Parade based on the Croydon Monitoring Report 
2014/15 has identified that there are a number of locations in the 
borough that could benefit from designation as a Shopping 
Parade.  
105 
 Policy DM6: Development in Shopping Parades 
The Council will ensure that the vitality and viability of the borough’s Shopping Parades is maintained and increased and tha t they continue 
to serve local communities by ensuring new development proposals and chang es of use on the ground floor are in accordance with Table 
5.7.

within the Shopping Parade are within Class E (Commercial, 
business and service)  A1 use (or a pub or drinking 
establishment) . Under certain circumstances when one or more 
units within a Parade are much larger than the other units (for 
example, when there is an 'anchor' store) the 50% threshold may 
be applied to the gross floor space within the Parade rather than 
the number of units. Unless it relates to a Class F2 community 
use, proposals involving the net loss of ground floor A Class  E 
floor space within Shopping Parades will be refused. The 
Council's annual land use surveys suggest this threshold is 
generally effective in securing a predominance of A1 Class 
activity in Shopping Parades but does not render them prone to 
issues of long-term vacancy.  
108 
 5.63 The policy limits the opening of new A5 Hot Food 
Takeaways units or changes of use to A5 Hot Food Takeaways 
in shopping parades. This will help to ensure residents have a 
greater choice of local retail services and will limit associated 
waste and delivery issues that can cause harm to residential 
amenity. Controls on the opening of new hot food takeaways 
support access to healthier food options outside town centres as 
shopping para des are often located in residential areas in close 
proximity to open spaces and schools . 
5.64 Other Sui generis activities which serve the local area (such 
as a launderette) and community facilities are also acceptable 
uses within Shopping Parades. Shopping Pa rades can also 
provide space for small start -up companies who need office or 
workshop space so changes of use to Class B1  Business uses 
are also acceptable to facilitate this. However all other uses 
(including sui generis which serve a wider catchment) are  not 
acceptable uses . New development of Class B1 uses are also 
unacceptable as new development of this type could threaten the 
retail character of a Shopping Parade in a way that change of 
use would not . 
5.65 For the purposes of Part 3 Class M of the General 
Permitted Development Order (2015), which sets out the 
circumstances where planning permission is not required for 
changes of use from retail to residential use, Shopping Parades 
are considered to be key shopping areas. In these locations any 
change of use from a retail use to residential will require an 
application to be made for planning permission which will be 
considered against the requirements of this policy.

Why we need this policy 
5.66 The Restaurant Quarter in South End has grown over many 
years into a popular collection of largely independent bars and 
restaurants. The area is also home to Scream Studios, a 
recording studio and live music venue, which, along with other 
complementary activities, helps to diversify the cultural/leisure 
offer. 
5.67 This policy applies to the ground floor only and seeks to 
encourage more bar and restaurant activity. The  policy differs 
from that which relates to Shopping Parades by not placing a 
limit on the number of A3 and A4 uses  Restaurants,  Cafes and, 
Drinking Establishments  within the frontage . It creates a new designation, a The Restaurant Quarter Parade, to be  is shown 
on the Policies Map . 
5.68 In relation to drawing up Local Plans, paragraph 23 of the 
National Planning Policy Framework states that local planning 
authorities should ‘set policies for the consideration of proposals 
for main town centre uses which cannot be accommodated in or 
adjacent to town centres’. Paragraph deleted  
5.69 A survey of South End indicated that the cluster of bars and 
restaurants is significant not only in terms of the cultural and  
110 
 leisure offer, but also as a generator of direct and indirect 
employment.  5.70 Policy 4.6c HC5of the London Plan encourages the 
designation and development of cultural quarters. 
Policy DM7: Development in Restaurant Quarter Parades 
The designate d Restaurant Quarter Parades will ensure the vitality and viability is maintained and incr eased and that  it continue s to serve 
local communities by ensuring new development proposals and changes of use are in accordance with Table 5.9.

Designations shown on the Policies Map

How the policy works 
5.71 This policy seeks to promote bar and restaurant activity by 
limiting the amount of other uses that can occupy (or extend) the ground floor of premises. A new Restaurant Quarter Parade has, 
therefore, been  designated at 6 - 78 (even) and 1 - 77 (odd). 
5.72 The policy limits Class A5 activity (which could undermine 
the area’s function if restaurants and bars are replaced with hot-
food takeaways). This will help to safeguard and promote the 
Restaurant Quarter. 
5.73 Allowing community uses to locate here but limiting their 
size will enable complementary activities to move into the area 
but not dominate it.

Why we need this policy
5.74 In line with the ‘Town Centres First’ principle, commercial 
activity should be directed to town centres to take advantage of 
their better transport functions and so as not to undermine the 
established centres. However, there are circumstances when 
proposals for town centre uses in edge of centre and out of 
centre locations may be acceptable. 5.75 In relation to drawing up Local Plans, paragraph 23 of the 
National Planning Policy Framework states that local planning 
authorities should ‘set policies for the consideration of proposals 
for main town centre uses which cannot be accommodated in or 
adjacent to town centres’. 
  
112 
 Policy DM8: Development in edge of centre and out of centre locations 
The Council will ensure the vitality and viability of the borough’s town centres is maintained and increased by:  
a) Ensuring new development proposals for main town centre uses in edge of centre and out of centre locations are in accordance with 
Table 5.11 and Table 5.12; and  
b) Applying planning conditions to control the subdivision of units, e xtensions (including mezzanines), and the range and mix of 
convenience and comparison goods sold.

National Planning Policy Framework’s main town centre uses. 
Together these are defined as the following: 
 Retail development (inclu ding warehouse clubs and factory 
outlet centres);  
 Leisure, entertainment facilities and the more intensive 
sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, 
drive -through restaurants, bars and pubs, night -clubs, casinos, 
health and fitness centres , indoor bowling centres, and bingo 
halls);  
 Offices; and  
 Arts, culture and tourism development (including theatres,

5.77 When undertaking a sequential test, applicants will be 
required to demonstrate there is no town centre or edge of 
centres sites or units that accommodate their proposal. For a site 
or unit to be able to accommodate a proposal it must be both 
suitable for the proposed development (noting that both  
115 
 applicants and the Council should be flexible over issues such as 
format and scale) and likely to be available at the point in time 
that the proposal is expected to be delivered. For out of centre 
locations they will be required to assess whether there are any 
existing vacant out of centre units which can accommodate the 
proposal as it is sequentially preferable to occupy an existing unit 
in an out of centre location than develop a new unit.  
5.78 Extensions to existing, changes of use to or new A5 uses 
will not be permitted in edge of centre or out of centre locations 
unless the end user is accredited in accordance with the 
Council’s Eat Well Croydon scheme, and the ward in which the 
proposal is located has a density of hot food takeaways which is 
at the national average or less. This will restrict the opening of 
unhealthy hot food takeaways in close proximity to schools and 
open spaces. In turn this will support the public health agenda of 
tackling obesity, particularly for children and young people, and 
promotes access to healthier food options.  
Figure 5.3 Density of takeaways in Croydon in 2016 – graphic removed  
 
5.79 As set out in the National Planning Policy Framework, the 
purpose of an impact assessment is to understand the impact of 
the proposal on existing, committed and planned public and 
private investment in a centre or centres in the catchment area of 
the proposal. It also assesses the impact of the proposal on town 
centre vitality and viability, including local consumer choice and 
trade in the town centre and wider area, up to five years from the 
time the application is made. 
5.80 Where a proposed extension results in a unit greater than 
2,500m2 of floor space, an impact assessment will be required. 
Impact assessment will be required to assess the impact of the 
whole unit and not just the proposed extension.  5.81 For major schemes where the full impact will not be 
realised in five years, the National Planning Policy Framework 
states impact should also be assessed up to ten years from the 
time the application is made. Impact assessments will be 
required to assess the impact of the whole unit if it results in a 
floor space greater than 2,500m2.  
5.82 The use of planning conditions on the subdivision, 
extensions and the range of goods and mix of convenience and 
comparison goods sold ensures that developments in edge of 
centre and out of centre locations do not have any significant 
adverse impact of the vitality and viability of the Metropolitan, 
District and Local Centres. 
5.83 New community facilities in edge of centre or out of centre 
locations are acceptable in principle. This does not apply to 
facilities considered to be a n assembly or leisure  D2 use. These 
main town centre uses will require a sequential test and an 
impact assessment.

Why we need this policy
5.84 Croydon continues to lose industrial/warehouse capacity at 
a rate which exceeds the forecast decline in demand. Croydon 
has extremely low industrial land vacancy rates and a high 
demand for industrial and warehousing spaces. A natural 
response to this situation is to could be  to adopt a more 
restrictive approach to the loss of such premises than was 
previously the case. The London Plan and national planning 
policy guide the provision and maintenance of a sufficient supply 
of land and premises to meet current and future demand for 
industrial and related functions. This guidance supports the 
protection of industrial locations in Croydon given the high 
demand and lack of supply for industrial and warehousing land 
and floor space.  However, such an approach would not be 
consistent with the London Plan or the National Planning Policy 
Framework.. 
5.85 Alternatively, the The Council could seek to allocate more 
land for industrial/warehouse activities by extending one or more 
of the existing Strategic, Separated or Integrated Industrial 
Locations. However, the physical constraints associated with the 
Locations (railway lines, quarry walls, Metropolitan Open Land 
and neighbouring residential uses) means this is not practical.  5.86 Based on this constraint the 2020 Employment Land 
Review recommends that the council increase protections on 
Strategic, Separated and Integrated Industrial Locations. The 
intensification of industrial sites through a holistic and strategic 
design approach is one way of making the borough’s industrial 
land more efficient.  The Office, Industrial & Warehousing 
Land/Premises Market Assessment recommends that the 
Council promote improved estate management at Purley Way 
North (Mill Lane area), Selsdon Road (north and central parts of 
estate) and Vulcan Way with the intention of encouraging 
redevelopment and intensification of land use, and improving 
environmental quality. 
5.87 The Employment Land Review (2020) found that with an 
increase in e-commerce, demand for industrial and warehousing 
land in Croydon had increased since the 2013 Employment Land 
Review update. Along with growth in demand for B8 space, the 
ELR pointed to a contraction in manufacturing employment 
indicating a reduction in demand floor space for heavy industrial 
uses (B2). The decreased demand for B2 space is balanced with 
an increase in demand for light industrial space, justifying the 
need to protect the borough’s employment and industrial land.   
117 
 The Employment Land Review Update (2013) found that 
forecasts for demand and supply of industrial/warehousing land 
in Croydon was broadly consistent with the Office, Industrial & 
Warehousing Land/Premises (2010) and the Land for Industry 
and Transport Supplementary Planning Guidance (2012). 
5.88 The Mayor of London’s Supplementary Planning Guidance 
on Land for Industry and Transport sets out an annual indicative 
industrial land release benchmark for Croydon of 0.5 hectare 
with a total release benchmark for 2011 – 2031 of 9 hectares. 
However, as Croydon lost 9 hectares of industrial land in a single 
five year period between 2006 and 2010, it is likely that 
expansion in Strategic and Separated Industrial Locations will be required to compensate for losses to the industrial stock 
elsewhere.   Croydon aims to become London’s most enterprising 
borough by 2040. To achieve this support must be given to the 
full range of enterprise. Evidence from the 2020 Employment 
Land Review reflects increasing demand for small and medium 
sized businesses space as well as demand for affordable 
workspace in central locations. The need to protect existing 
affordable workspace in the borough has been seen through the 
uptake of the borough’s centrally located Grade B office space 
by local businesses . 
 
Policy DM9: Expansion of industrial and warehousing premises in Strategic, Separated and Integrated Industrial 
Locations 
DM9.1 Within the Strategic, Separated and Integrated Industrial Locations identified in Table 5.2 of Policy SP3.2 , the Council will encourage 
the redevelopment of low density industrial and warehousing premises with higher density industrial and warehousing premises  to enhance 
the function of the SIL . 
DM9.2 Schemes that work to improve the function of the overall SIL while making more efficient use of land for business, heavy indu stry and 
warehousing uses or take opportunities to support the integration of research and development of processes and products , or uses related 
to education or training connected to industrial processes , without loss of industrial floor space will be suppor ted. This approach must ensure 
no net of floor space for industrial or warehousing uses.  
DM9.3 In Strategic, Separated and Integrated Industrial Locations, and on Town Centre and Scattered Employment Sites development 
proposals and changes of use must accord wit h Table 5.13.

How the policy works 
5.89 The approach promoted by this policy is to encourage 
greater density of occupation within the current boundaries of the 
Strategic, Separated and Integrated Industrial Locations. There 
are isolated examples where higher densities have been 
achieved without compromising the operational ability of the 
premises and the Council is keen to see more of this type of 
development. 
5.90 The Council is aware that some community uses can 
struggle to find suitable premises. This has led, in the past, to 
situations where 'Tier 1' type premises have been lost to community uses to the detriment of the area's business function. 
Allowing the change of use or redevelopment of 'Tier 2 and 4' 
premises in the more accessible locations, to non-town centre 
community uses, not only helps t o safeguard 'Tier 1' premises for 
continued industrial uses, it also opens up a significant supply of 
premises for community uses/groups to consider. Restricting 
non-town centre community uses to higher PTAL locations 
means that uses which attract large numbers of visitors will be 
able to make more use of public transport. 
5.91 Likewise Gypsies and Travellers also struggle to find 
suitable sites for new pitches. To enable provision of sites 
throughout the Plan period, particularly the last ten years of the  
124 
 Plan period, 'Tier 1' sites have been identified as suitable to use 
as Gypsy and Traveller pitches (for those families with a qualified 
connection to Croydon). 
5.92 Industrial and warehousing uses are important sectors for 
the employment of Croydon’s residents. Planning conditions will 
be applied to schemes coming forward with research and 
development and light industry uses on ‘Tier 1’ and ‘Tier 2’ 
industrial sites preventing their conversion to non-industrial uses. 
This is necessary to ensure that the integrity of industrial land 
within the borough is not impacted by inappropriate uses that 
would undermine the areas overall function.  
5.93 As outlined in table 8.13 limited food and drink 
establishments as well as crèche and day nurseries are 
permitted within Tier 1 sites . The provision of a limited number of 
these uses can enhance the employment function of SIL, 
addressing the particular needs of those working within the SIL. 
The provision of ancillary child care facilities aims to reduce 
barriers to employment opportunit ies and increase the availability 
of opportunities to an increasingly diverse demographic. These 
uses should be ancillary to the areas industrial function, while 
designed as safe and nurturing spaces. Location, design access 
and orientation of these spaces  within SIL should consider the 
function of the wider area, whilst also ensuring the safety and 
well-being of users.  
5.94 An acceptable way to demonstrate that there is no demand 
for a scheme comprised solely of research and development, 
industrial or warehousing uses in ‘Tiers 3 and 4’ locations would 
be the submission of evidence that a marketing exercise has 
been undertaken for a minimum of 18 months continuously. The 
Council will need to be satisfied that the site has been offered at 
a price commensurate with the value of the site for the permitted uses and that active promotion has been undertaken by agents 
marketing the site. 
5.95 The approach promoted by this policy is to retain a mix of 
employment units available across the borough while allowing for 
the redevelopment of older employment units. This policy 
recognises the value small and medium enterprise adds to the 
creative culture of Croydon. These small and medium 
employment spaces provide employment that is located within 
neighbourhoods and is easily accessible to residents. Having a 
variety of units is important for the retention of local business in 
the borough as it provides a range of spaces and opportunities 
for growing business to upsize their facilities.  
5.96 Businesses in Croydon are similar to that of London on 
average, 89% of which employ 10 or fewer people. These 
businesses typically demand a range of small scale premises or 
managed workspace for traditional small scale engineering 
activity, arts and other creative uses, the ELR suggest that the 
types of premises, many of which are located in the Purley Way 
are experiencing strong demand with low vacancy rates. 
Additionally, these premises often experience competition from 
larger schemes coming forward. With this in mind policy protects 
existing managed workspace in ‘Tier 2 and 3’ while encouraging 
this space coming forward across all employment land in order to 
maintain employment space for a variety of industries.

Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic

 Strategic Objective  1 
 Policy SP6.2B  
 
Why we need this policy
5.97 Croydon aims to become London’s most enterprising 
borough by 2040. To achieve this support must be given to the 
full range of enterprise. The borough’s business base includes a 
large number of small and medium sized businesses coming 
from the creative and manufacturing industries within the 
borough. Ensuring space and a range of scales and price points 
in the borough is essential to retaining workspace that is 
affordable, ensuring that local business can remain in the 
borough as they grow. 
5.98 The London Plan defines affordable workspace as 
workspace that is provided at rents maintained below the market 
rate for the space for a specific social, cultural, or economic 
development purpose. These types of workspaces, for example 
business incubators, accelerator spaces and creative production 
spaces, are an integral part of London’s ecosystem, including for 
creative and digital innovation. 
5.99 Evidence from the 2020 Employment Land Review reflects 
new demand for small and medium sized businesses and local 
business demand for affordable workspace in central locations. 
The uptake of the borough’s Grade B office space in central 
locations by local business illustrates the need to protect existing 
affordable workspace in the borough and provide additional affordable workspace in these locations. The 2020 Employment 
Land Review findings also demonstrate that there is a need to 
provide “affordable workspace” to support the creative and 
cultural sectors in a variety of locations across the borough.   
5.100 Past trends show the redevelopment of the 
borough’s smaller employment units resulting in the loss of 
smaller units has left larger units that are often not affordable for 
local business. This policy aims to encourage the availability of 
workspace at a variety of sizes and affordability.  
126 
 Policy DM9A: Protection and provision of affordable workspace 
DM9A.1 Proposals for the enhancement, and intensification of existing employment uses will be required to provide flexible an d 
affordable space suitable for the creative and cultural sectors and/or small and medium enterprises, unless justified by the type and 
nature of the proposal and subject to viability  
DM9A.2 Proposals resulting in the loss of existing affordable workspace will be resisted un less it can be demonstrated that the quantum 
of affordable workspace is replaced on -site or re -provided elsewhere in suitable locations in Croydon on equivalent terms.  
DM9A.3 Provision of affordable workspace will encouraged in the following locations:  
a) Transformation Areas  
b) Croydon Opportunity Area  
c) All tiers of  designated employment locations identified in Policy SP5  
DM9A.4 Elsewhere proposals for affordable workspace may be appropriate in district, local and neighbourhood centres provided they do 
not unde rmine the primary retail and community functions of the centres.  
 
  
How the policy works 
5.101 The approach promoted by this policy is to retain a mix of 
employment units available across the borough while allowing for 
the redevelopment of older employment units. This policy 
recognises the value small and medium enterprise adds to the 
creative culture of Croydon, while encouraging the preservation of existing employment space that is easily accessible to residents. 
Having a variety of units is important for the retention of local 
business in the borough as it provides a range of spaces and 
opportunities for growing business to upsize their facilities. All 
planning applications will be required to be supported by viability 
information to justify the amount of affordable workspace that is 
proposed. The viability information will be independently assessed  
127 
 and where this assessment determines that a greater level of 
affordable workspace could viably be supported, a higher level of 
affordable workspace will be required.

Character  
Strategic policy 
Where we are now  
6.1 The key issues to be addressed to ensure Croydon's spatial 
vision is realised are:  
 Improving the image of Croydon is important in attracting new 
investment and encouraging people to want to live and work in the 
borough. 
 Poor public realm, due to dominance of the car, vacant sites and 
empty shops and street furniture and adverts accumulating over the 
years make it unattractive and difficult to navigate and add to 
perceptions of poor safety. 
 With growth, the public realm needs to be sustainable, adapting 
to climate change, robust and multifunctional, providing well 
designed, connected open spaces where people want to be, and 
assisting in the establishment of healthy, safe and cohesive 
communities. 
 Croydon needs to ensure protection of its heritage assets and 
their settings for the enjoyment of future generations and , to retain 
local distinctiveness and character.  
 New development will need to be designed to respect the local 
character and distinctiveness.  
Where do we want to be 
Strategic Objective 4:  Reduce social, economic and 
environmental deprivation, particularly where it is spatially concentrated, by taking priority measures to reduce 
unemployment, improve skills and education and renew housing, 
community and environmental conditions.  
Strategic Objective 5:  : Ensure that high quality new 
development both integrates, respects and enhances the 
borough’s natural environment and built heritage.  
Strategic Objective 7  Conserve and create spaces and bui ldings 
that foster safe, healthy and cohesive communities.  
Strategic Objective 9:  Ensure the responsible use of land and 
natural resources and management of waste to mitigate and 
adapt to climate change.

 141 Why we have taken this approach 
6.2 The National Planning Policy Framework sets out the 
requirements for the protection and enhancement of the borough's 
heritage assets.  Croydon's built environment is characterised by 
rich, pioneering heritage and distinctive local characters that 
derive from its varied history, urban form, uses, architecture, 
topography, landscape and diverse communities. High quality new 
buildings, streets and open public spaces can respond to and 
enhance the positive elements of local character and heritage, 
whilst providing accessible, inclusive places that contribute to the 
identity of the borough and well-being of its diverse communities.  
6.3 Croydon’s vision is to be London’s most enterprising borough, 
a city that fosters ideas, innovation and learning and provides 
skills, opportunity and a sense of belonging for all, and recognises 
the value of heritage assets and their contribution to local 
character. 
Urban Design 
6.4 Croydon has been designated in the London Plan as an 
Opportunity Area, therefore it is critical that the borough addresses 
the implications of this growth through the Strategic Policies. 
Robust urban design policies are necessary for Croydon to 
encourage significant levels of growth in a sustainable way and 
ensure new development respects heritage assets and their 
settings,  local character and the historic and natural landscape, 
including established suburban residential areas and open 
spaces. 
6.5 National policy refers to the importance of good design and 
that DPDs should include policies that ensure development is 
sustainable, responds to local context and is visually attractive.  6.6 The Equalities Analysis advises that the Strategic Policies 
should ensure the well-being of new communities by promoting 
gGood standards of design, and help to address the impacts of 
growth on ethnic minority communities by including policies that 
support diversity, equality , inclusivity  and access for all. Design 
needs to consider inclusivity and accessibility from the beginning 
of the design process through to completion, occupation, 
management and maintenance.  
Croydon Opportunity Area 
6.7 The Croydon Opportunity Area will be an area of significant 
growth and renewal. In this context, with available land and 
renewal opportunity, the substantial amount of new dwellings 
planned will require high density development and a number of tall 
buildings, all of high quality in order to deliver successful places. 
Areas of Intensification 
6.7a In order to meet the development needs of the borough, 
sustainable locations to support sustainable growth have been 
identified on the policies maps as Focussed Areas of Intensification 
and Moderate Intensification. Whilst delivering tangible benefits 
including providing a richer mix of types and sizes of 
accommodation to suit different lifestyles, policies seek to ensure 
that development is of a good design, whilst reducing car 
dependency and promote local economic activity.  
Tall Buildings 
6.8 To manage the more intense areas of growth, the Croydon 
Local Plan needs policies setting out an approach to tall buildings. 
This is supported by CABE and Historic England’s Advice Note 4 
which promotes a development plan-led approach to tall buildings. 
In assessing the appropriateness of locations for tall buildings, 
Policy SP1.3 and the capacity of existing infrastructure, or the  
 142 capacity to grow with further sustainable infrastructure investment, 
should be considered. The London Plan states that the 
development of tall and large buildings is one way of increasing an 
area’s density and that Local Plans should identify where tall 
buildings should be located. For this reason, Tall buildings are 
directed to the Croydon Opportunity area and Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre to reinforce the role of this area as the 
borough’s main centre. To ensure the development of tall and 
large buildings creates positive change the design of tall, large 
and high density buildings should take into account the character 
of the area such as preserving and enhancing the heritage assets 
(and their surroundings) and complementing local architectural 
styles that positively contribute to character.  
6.9 In the context of this policy a tall building is one that is 
significantly  taller than most of the surrounding buildings or in 
excess of six storeys or  25m greater than 30m in height.  The 
height at which buildings will be considered `tall` on individual 
sites, together with detailed criteria for assessing the design and 
impact of tall buildings and consideration of the appropriateness 
for tall buildings on individual sites or in District Centres will be set 
out in the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals.  
This will take account of the Croydon Opportunity Area Planning 
Framework and adopted Masterplans .  
6.10 The London Plan states that tall and large buildings should 
be part of a strategic approach to changing or developing an area 
and should not have an unacceptably harmful impact on their 
surroundings. It also states that ideally tall buildings should form 
part of a cohesive group that enhances the skyline and improves 
legibility of the area. 
6.11 The London Plan includes a policy on implementing the 
London View Management Framework (LVMF). Whilst the LVMF does not include any protected views in or from Croydon, Local 
Designated Views and Croydon Panoramas are identified in the 
Appendix 5. The London Plan states that “Tall buildings should not 
impact on local or strategic views adversely”, which justifies the 
requirement to sustain Local Views, Croydon Panoramas, the 
setting of Landmarks and other important vistas and skylines. All 
views are accessible and are indicated in Figure 6.2 , on the 
Places maps and on the Policies Map .  
6.12 The topography and landscape of Croydon is characterised 
by wooded hillsides with hillside ridges and valleys.  The potential 
visual impact of tall and large buildings; therefore, requires careful 
consideration. to assess the impact of views to and from the wider 
area.  
6.13 The Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework 
(COAPF) and the Croydon Local Plan ’s Detailed Policies and 
Proposals will provide detailed policies for tall buildings. The 
COAPF identifies areas that are appropriate for tall buildings in the 
Croydon Opportunity Area. 
Public Realm 
6.14 In order to achieve Croydon's vision is to be a London’s most 
enterprising borough  that business wants to invest in. To achieve 
this vision  and to respond to the increased demand on public 
realm from a growing population it is essential that Croydon’s 
public realm reflects this aspiration and is The borough’s public 
realm needs to be well-designed, safe, inclusive, and related to 
the local character and historic context. It also needs to b e 
welcoming, simple, clean, accessible, sustainable, well managed 
and easy to understand, service and  maintain ed. To encourage a 
new residential community and business to the Croydon  
 143 Opportunity Area and Town Centres, the quality and design of 
public realm needs to be improved.  
6.15 The public realm policies are in conformity with local, 
regional and National Planning Policy.  
6.16 The National Planning Policy Framework advocates 
attractive, inclusive and safe environments. Croydon’s adopted 
Supplementary Planning Document No. 3: Designing for 
Community Safety also provides guidance which will help achieve 
Croydon’s vision for creating safer places. 
6.17 The public realm needs to be well maintained if it is to 
ensure civic pride, sense of belonging, encourage regeneration 
and reduce the perception of crime. The London Plan and SPD 
No. 3: Designing for Community Safety endorses this policy. 
6.18 Greater London Authority's mapping  and the Borough 
Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) Report  identified parts of the 
borough as being deficient in access to nature . The NCA Report 
particularly notes a discrepancy between access to open space in 
the north of the borough, where there is more deficiency in access 
compared to the south. Public realm deficiency should be 
addressed as a first principle of design approach, by maximising 
the amount of amenity for future occupiers. By ensuring easy 
access for all, this will encourage the increased use of facilities 
within open spaces and District and Local Centres helping to 
regenerate areas, encourage natural surveillance, making places 
feel safer and improving wellbeing. 
6.19 In order to ensure that the local distinctiveness is respected 
and enhanced, new public realm improvements will need to be in 
keeping with the identified character and in line with the Borough Character Appraisal. This will also help residents to continue to 
feel a connection to, and pride for their neighbourhoods. 
6.20 Many of Croydon’s Places experience segregation caused 
by the transport network. This policy focuses on improving access 
to places most people visit or pass through.  
6.21 The public realm framework includes areas where most of 
the community will interact. The District and Local Centres and the 
main connecting roads between the District Centres i.e. the routes 
that people travel which inform their perception of a place. 
6.22 Creating a public realm framework enables resources to be 
allocated in order of priority, while the use of guidance allows 
resources to be creatively and efficiently matched in a sustainable 
manner to each place. This policy will ensure resources are 
focussed to achieve smart growth through continued regeneration 
and inward investment. 
Character, Conservation and Heritage Conservation of Heritage 
Assets and their Settings and Townscape 
 
6.23 The protection and enhancement of Croydon’s heritage 
assets in line with National Planning Policy Framework is essential 
to achieve the ‘We are Croydon’ long-term vision. Conservation of 
the historic environment contributes to making Croydon 
sustainable by ensuring that new development enhances and 
integrates with the local distinctiveness and character of the 
Places of Croydon.  
6.24 In the context of the protection and enhancement of 
Croydon’s heritage assets the Council has de-designated Local 
Areas of Special Character and has designated Local Heritage 
Areas (LHAs). LHAs are distinctive locally significant heritage  
 144 assets that have been designated as a result of their heritage and 
architectural or townscape or landscape value. LHAs are 
characterised by their locally recognised distinctive and 
particularly high quality examples of more familiar types of local 
historic development. These form a more robust basis for the 
protection and enhancement of the borough’s character and 
heritage. All LHAs are accessible and are indicated in Figure 6.2  
and the Policies Map . Whilst the London View Management 
Framework does not include any views in or from Croydon, 
Croydon's topography and layout gives rise to a number of 
important local and strategic views. These views, and key 
landmarks within them, contribute directly to the identity and 
character of the borough. They also perform key orientation and 
wayfinding roles. The 'mini Manhattan' skyline of Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre is a particularly distinctive element of the 
borough's townscape. Key vistas where this skyline can be 
appreciated are designated as Panoramas. Buildings that 
particularly contribute to the identity of and navigation around the 
borough - such as the NLA Tower at East Croydon Station and th e 
clock towers at the Town Hall, Thornton Heath and South 
Norwood - are identified as local landmarks, with key views toward 
them are also designated .  
6.25 Alongside Historic England, the Council has undertaken a 
review of the borough’s Archaeological Priority Areas (APA’s) to 
align with Historic England’s (London) methodology and 
categorisation, which determines the likelihood of the presence of 
articles of archaeological importance. The APA’s are identified on 
the Policies Map . Heritage assets including designated heritage 
assets (listed buildings, conservation areas, registered historic 
parks and gardens and scheduled monuments) and non-
designated heritage assets (including locally listed buildings, local 
heritage areas, locally listed historic parks and gardens and non-
designated archaeology identified through archaeological priority areas) have been identified as being of heritage significance and 
worthy of conservation and enhancement  for the enjoyment of this 
and future generations. Each type of heritage asset is subject to 
specific selection criteria and a robust assessment process. 
Further non-designated heritage assets may be discovered 
through the planning process. Croydon’s heritage assets and their 
settings contribute to local character and a sense of place and 
identity, whilst being significant contributors to the local economy, 
communities and environment. They are a finite resource that 
cannot be replaced once lost. A sensitive approach is required to 
ensure their sustainable future whilst recognising the particular 
challenges climate change, inclusivity and accessibility can 
present.  
6.26 The detailed policies of the Croydon Local Plan address 
issues in relation to the detailed application of the Strategic Policy 
on heritage assets in the borough. 
6.27 In order to maintain Croydon's heritage assets, the borough 
needs to maintain lists of these to ensure regular monitoring to 
identify where further protection is required in line with the 
National Planning Policy Framework and the London Plan. 
6.28 Encouraging virtual and physical  access to heritage assets , 
and the associated interpretation required to support this , and 
assisting in the understanding of Croydon's heritage will help to 
develop a greater understanding and  sense of belonging.

Why we need this policy 
6.29 The Council recognises that the built environment and 
landscape play a vital role in creating and reinforcing positive 
perceptions, and engendering a sense of place. Croydon Local 
Plan Strategic Policy SP4, ‘Urban Design , Heritage  and Local 
Character’ supports the creation of places that are well designed, 
safe, accessible, inclusive and enrich the quality of life for all 
those who live in, work in and visit the borough. To achieve this, 
the Council will encourage and continue to work with developers 
to ensure that all developments are of high quality. Croydon has 
strategic objectives to ensure that high quality new development 
both integrates respects and enhances the borough’s natural 
environment and historic environment, to create spaces and 
buildings that foster safe, healthy communities. The borough has 
the largest population of any London borough. Provision of 
outdoor amenity space is important for health and wellbeing, 
particularly as the north of the borough is urban in character and 
has less open space compared to south, where most of the 
borough’s Metropolitan Green Belt can be found. Private and communal outdoor amenity space can assist in mitigation of 
climate change with vegetation that contributes to biodiversity 
and space that is multi-functional; for socialising, play, and sport, 
food growing and gardening. The provision of space that is easily 
accessible and designed in the context of local character will 
assist in providing a sense of ownership to the local community 
and will contribute to the health, well-being and perception of the 
security of Croydon’s community. 
6.30 A fundamental part of achieving high quality built 
environments is through understanding the local character and 
the qualities which contribute to local distinctiveness. 
6.31 In specific areas where it is unclear which predominant 
character should be referenced, additional place specific 
development management policies have been included. These 
can be found in ( The Places of Croydon ) of this Plan.  
 146 6.32 In other areas where no Place-specific development 
management policy applies, the character can be managed 
through other policies on urban design and local character within 
this Plan along with the masterplans, Conservation Area 
Appraisal and Management Plans, Local Heritage Areas and the 
Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework.  
6.33 The Place-specific policies in Section 11 (The Places o f 
Croydon ) also include all the Detailed Proposal sites in each 
Place. Full details of each Detailed Proposal including the 
reasons why particular uses are proposed can be found in 
Appendix 7 . Paragraph deleted  
6.34 The National Planning Policy Framework paragraph 58 
directs local authorities to develop a set of robust and 
comprehensive policies which are based upon objectives for the 
future of the area and an understanding and evaluation of its 
defining characteristics.  Paragraph deleted  
6.35 Paragraph 56 of the National Planning Policy Framework 
states that ‘Good design is indivisible from good planning’. It 
advocates good design to ensure attractive, usable, durable, 
adaptable and sustainable development. 
6.36 The Croydon Local Plan Strategic Policy SP4.1 and London 
Plan Policy 7.6 set s out the need to ensure that developments 
are of a high quality. 
6.37 The Croydon Local Plan provides policy on urban design, 
local character and public realm. However, in line with the 
National Planning Policy Framework, there is a need to provide 
detailed guidance on scale, density massing, height, landscape, 
layout, materials and access. This will provide greater clarity for 
applicants. 6.38 Paragraph 57 of tThe National Planning Policy Framework 
advises planning authorities to ‘plan positively for the 
achievement of high quality and inclusive design for all 
developments, including individual buildings, public and private 
spaces and wider area development schemes. Good design 
should contribute positively to making places better for people. 
Design which is inappropriate in its context, or which fails to take 
the opportunities available for improving the character and 
quality of an area and the way it functions, should not be 
accepted.’ 
6.39 Additionally a review of the borough’s existing Unitary 
Development Plan, carried out by the Council’s Development 
Management and Spatial Planning services, identified a need for 
policies relating to layout, form and design. Paragraph deleted  
6.40 The existing policy review identified a need for a roofscape 
policy that acknowledges the visual contribution roof-forms make 
and the need to provide guidance on the way in which the 
transition between new and old developments are addressed. 
Guidance for roof-form (roofscape) has not been included within 
the National Planning Policy Framework or the Strategic Policy. 
6.41 The National Planning Policy Framework in paragraph 50 
encourages location authorities to plan for the delivery for a wide 
choice of high quality homes and sustainable communities. It 
advises that in doing so, development plans should be based on 
evidence of local needs and demands. The notions of balance 
and risk are also recognise in the National Planning Policy 
Framework, which states that the cumulative impact of standards 
and polices should not put the implementation of the plan at 
serious risk (paragraph 174). Paragraph deleted  
6.42 The need to deliver 32,890 a significant number of homes 
does not outweigh the need to respect the local character, and 
amenity and to protect biodiversity.  
 147 6.43 The Mayor of London’s Housing Supplementary Planning 
Guidance (2016) states that, alongside new build provision and 
turnover within the existing housing stock, extensions to existing 
homes and sensitive renewal and intensification of existing 
residential areas is likely to play an important role in meeting 
demand for larger properties in the capital, helping to address 
overcrowding and affordability issues.  
6.44 The Mayor of London’s Housing Supplementary Planning 
Guidance March 2016 provides guidance on private garden land 
development (paragraph 1.2.44) and the implementation of 
London Plan Policy 3.5 Quality and Design of Housing 
Developments. It advises  Borough’s and developers of the 
strategic and local aspects and objectives when considering 
development of gardens and to strike a balance between these 
and other objectives when seeking to optimise housing provision 
on a particular site.   
6.45 This policy seeks to resist inappropriate development in 
residential gardens where it would cause harm to the local area 
in accordance with paragraph 53 of the Framework. The policy 
aligns with the Local Plan’s Strategic Objective 5 ensuring new 
development integrates, respects and enhances the borough’s 
natural environment and built heritage.   
6.46 The London Plan, Policy 3.5, states that borough’s may 
introduce a presumption against development on back gardens 
or other private residential gardens where this can be locally 
justified. In addition to this, the London Plan also states that new 
development, including that on garden land should avoid having 
an adverse impact on sites of European importance for nature 
conservation.  
6.47 Poorly planned piecemeal development of garden land can 
have significant negative impacts on local biodiversity, amenity, 
and character. It can also result in noise and visual intrusion into neighbouring property, interrupt predominant building lines along 
streets and weaken the predominant built form and architecture. 
In landscape terms it can also result in weakened landscape 
character with loss of trees, including street trees, to make way 
for new access roads.  
6.48 The Borough Character Appraisal and the Character 
Typology identify the predominant type of building form and 
range of plot sizes for different residential forms. The Typology 
shows that nine per cent of the borough area is made up of 
buildings and thirty five percent occupied by residential garden 
space. Overall, sixty percent of the borough is made up of 
residential garden space, recreational space and woodland.  
6.49 The London Plan’s Policy 3.2D introduces an additional 
requirement for new development to be mindful of health issues. 
New development should be designed, contracted and managed 
in ways that improve health and heathy lifestyles to help to 
reduce health inequalities. The provision of communal outdoor 
amenity will provide opportunities for outdoor activities and social 
interaction.   
6.50 The London Plan (in Policy 3.5B) also requires that ‘all new 
housing dDevelopments should enhance the quality of local 
places, taking into account physical context, local character, 
density; tenure and land use mix; and relationships with, and 
provision of public, communal and open spaces, taking account 
of the needs of children and old people’. This supports the need 
to increase the communal amenity space standards from those 
identified in the Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary 
Planning Guidance for sites in the borough to reflect local 
character or where there is a deficiency in open space  
6.51 The Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning 
Guidance expands on the London Plan’s Policy 3.5 and Chapter 
7 policies on design and acknowledges the need for site layout  
 148 and design to consider the provision of useable amenity space 
alongside the siting of the building. This is incorporated in the 
preferred option. Moved to homes chapter 
6.52 The Mayor of London's Housing Supplementary Planning 
Guidance in Annex 1 ‘Summary of the Quality and Design 
Standards for private outdoor space’ has a minimum standard of 
5m2 of private outdoor space for 1-2 person dwellings and an 
extra 1m2 to be provided for each additional occupant.  
Paragraph deleted  
6.53 Paragraph 4.10.2 of Annex 1 of the Mayor of London's 
Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance applies to all the 
borough and states that private outdoor spaces should have 
level access, and in 4.10.3 that the minimum depth and width of 
all balconies and other private external spaces is 1.5m. 
Paragraph deleted  
6.54 The minimum standard of 10m2 per child of children's play 
space, where there are 10 or more children living in the 
development is from the Mayor's Housing Supplementary 
Planning Guidance (2.16) and, although it applies to publicly 
funded housing development and that on GLA land, it is 
considered best practice. The Mayor's Supplementary Planning 
Guidance Providing for Children and Young People's Play and 
Informal Recreation also recommends a minimum benchmark of 
10m2 of dedicated play space per child. Paragraph deleted 
6.55 The Mayor's Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance 
refers to the Baseline Standard 1.2.3 for communal open space 
which states that development proposals should demonstrate 
that the communal open space is overlooked by surrounding 
development, is accessible to wheelchair users and other 
disabled people, is designed to take advantage of direct sunlight, 
and has suitable management arrangements in place. It also 
refers to the Baseline Standard 2.2.8 which explains that this will ensure the outdoor space remains useful and welcoming to all its 
intended users. With the exception of management 
arrangements which are a matter for residents and the body 
managing the building, this is incorporated in the preferred 
option. Moved to homes chapter  
6.56 The London Housing Design Guide in 5.1.1 Standards – 
identified that ‘in the past, planning guidance for privacy has 
been concerned with achieving visual separation between 
dwellings by setting a minimum distance of 18-21m between 
facing homes.’ It says that ‘these are still useful yardsticks for 
visual privacy, but adhering rigidly to these measures can limit 
the variety of urban spaces and housing types in the city, and 
can sometimes unnecessarily restrict density’. Paragraph 
deleted.  
6.56a  The character and growth policies respond to the London 
Plan which says that gentle densification should be actively 
encouraged by boroughs in low and mid-density locations to 
achieve a change in densities in the most appropriate way. This 
should have regard to the target set for development on small 
sites by Policy H2 of the London Plan. To achieve the housing 
needs for the borough, areas where sustainable development can 
be focused for growth according to a series of sustainable 
indicators and characteristics of an area have been identified.  
6.56b  The London Plan also says that where there are existing 
clusters of high density buildings, expansion of the clusters should 
be positively considered by boroughs . The character and growth 
policies also incorporate this steer from the London Plan by 
identifying clusters and where high density development can take 
place.  
  
 149 Policy DM10: Design and character 
The following policies DM10.1  to DM10.10  apply in circumstances other than those where intensification policies ( DM10.11 a-d) and place -
specific policies (DM3 4 to DM 49 and Table 11.1) spe cify otherwise and will be interpreted with reference to the description of each of the 
Places of Croydon set out in the introduction to each policy DM3 4 to DM 49 and in the Council’s Borough Character Appraisal and by 
reference to Table 6.5. 
DM10.1  Proposals Development should be of high quality and, whilst seeking to achieve a minimum height of 3 storeys, should  respect  
reflecting and maintaining the local character of the area including any heritage assets  having regard to :  
a) The area’s  development pattern, layout and siting;  
b) The scale, height, massing, and density;  line deleted  
c) The area’s  appearance, existing materials and roofscapes, scale, height, massing and density of existing built form  built and natural 
features of the surrounding area ; the Place of Croydon in which it is located . and 
d) The heritage assets and natural features of the surrounding area and the Place of Croydon in which it is located.  
Where an extension or alteration is proposed, adherence to Sup plementary Planning Document 2 Residential Extensions and Alterations or 
equivalent will be encouraged to aid compliance with the policies contained in the Local Plan.  
Where a conversion or house in multiple occupation is proposed the Council will also con sider the effects of noise, refuse collection and 
additional car parking on the character of an area. For this reason, the Council will seek proposals to incorporate parking w ithin the rear, to 
the side or underneath building.  
In the case of development i n the grounds of an existing building which is retained, development shall be subservient to that building.  
The council will take into account cumulative impact .  
DM10.2 Proposals should create clear, well defined and designed public and private spaces.  The Coun cil will only consider parking 
within the forecourt of buildings in locations where the forecourt parking would not cause undue harm to the character or set ting of the 
building and where forecourts are large enough to accommodate parking and sufficient scr eening without the vehicle encroaching on the 
public highway. The Council will support proposals that incorporate cycle parking within the building envelope, in a safe, se cure, convenient  
 150 and well -lit location. Failing that, the council will require cycle parking to be located within safe, secure, well lit and conveniently located 
weather -proof shelters unobtrusively located within the setting of the building.  Policy deleted  
DM10.3 The Council will seek to support proposals that restore and incorporate historic st reet furniture within the development.  Policy 
deleted  
DM10.4 All proposals for new residential development will need to provide private amenity space that.  
a) Is of high quality design, and enhances and respects the local character;  
b) Provides functional space (the m inimum width and depth of balconies should be 1.5m);  
c) Provides a minimum amount of private amenity space of 5m2 per 1 -2 person unit and an extra 1m2 per extra occupant thereafter;  
d) All flatted development and developments of 10 or more houses must provide a  minimum of 10m2 per child of new play space, 
calculated using the Mayor of London’s population yield calculator and as a set out in Table 6.2 below. The calculation will be based on 
all the equivalent of all units  being for affordable or social rent unless as signed Section 106 Agreement states otherwise , or an 
agreement in principle has been reached by the point of determination of any planning application on the amount of affordable  housing to 
be provided. When c alculating the amount of private and communal open space to be provided, footpaths, driveways, front gardens, 
vehicle circulation areas, car and cycle parking areas and refuse areas should be excluded ; and  
e) In the case of development in the grounds of an ex isting building which is retained, a minimum length of 10m and no less than half or 
200m2 (whichever is the smaller) of the existing garden area is retained for the host property, after the subdivision of the garden . 
Adherence with Supplementary Planning d ocument 3 Designing for Community Safety or equivalent will be encouraged to aid compliance 
with the policies contained with the Local Plan. Moved to Homes chapter  
DM10.5 In addition to the provision of private amenity space, proposals for new flatted development  and major housing schemes will 
also need to incorporate high quality communal outdoor amenity space that is designed to be flexible, multifunctional, access ible and 
inclusive.  Policy deleted  
DM10.6 The Council will support proposals for development that ensure t hat; 
a) The amenity of the occupiers of adjoining buildings are protected; and that  
b) They do not result in direct overlooking at close range or habitable rooms in main rear or private elevations; and that   
 151 c) They do not result in direct overlooking of private out door space (with the exception of communal open space) within 10m 
perpendicular to the rear elevation of a dwelling; and that  
d) Provide adequate sunlight and daylight to potential future occupants; and that  
e) They do not result in significant loss of existing sunlight or daylight levels of adjoining occupiers.  Policy deleted  
DM10.7 To create a high quality built environment, proposals should demonstrate that:  
a) The architectural detailing will result in a high quality building and when working with existing buildings, o riginal architectural features 
such as mouldings, architraves, chimneys or porches that contribute to the architectural character of a building should, wher e possible, 
be retained;  
b) High quality, durable and sustainable materials that respond to the local character in terms of quality, durability, attractiveness, 
sustainability, texture and colour are incorporated; and 
c) Services, utilities and rainwater goods will be discreetly incorporated within the building envelope48; and  
d) To ensure the design of roof -form positively contributes to the character of the local and wider area; proposals should ensure the 
design is sympathetic with its local context.   
Development will be required to:  
(a) Make an efficient use of land whilst respecting the character of the surro unding area by reinforcing and promoting local distinctiveness;  
(b) Ensure that it is designed to avoid unacceptable harm to the amenity of existing neighbours and future occupants, includi ng by way of 
overlooking and loss of privacy, overbearance, obtrusi veness and overshadowing;  
(c) Provide adequate amenity including daylight and sunlight for future occupants;  
(d) Use high quality, durable and sustainable materials that respond to the local character of an area;  
(e) Retain existing architectural features where possible, when working with existing buildings;  
                                            
48 The building envelope (also known as the building shell) refers to the outer structure of a building.  
 152 (f) Create a safe environment by maximising opportunities for natural surveillance and reducing the risk of crime;  
 (g) Makes adequate provision for access, servicing, communal storage, circulation, tur ning space and parking taking account of the impact 
on the character of the area; and  
(h) Where appropriate, proposals should restore historic street furniture and provide additional street furniture, trees and public art to 
enhance the public realm and se nse of place.  
Landscape  
DM10.8 To ensure a cohesive approach is taken to the design and management of landscape within the borough the Council will 
require proposals to:  
a) Incorporate hard and soft landscaping;  Provide landscaping as part of the overall design that  enables the development to respect the 
character of the existing area and contributes to the integration of the buildings with the surrounding area;  
b) Provide spaces  wildlife -friendly landscapes which are visually attractive, easily accessible and safe and inclusive  for all users, and 
provide a stimulating environment;  
c) Seek to retain existing landscape features that contribute to the setting and local character of an area;  
d) Retain existing trees and vegetation including natural habitats49;  
e) In exceptional ci rcumstances where the loss of mature trees is outweighed by the benefits of a development, those trees lost shall be 
replaced with new semi -mature trees of a commensurate species, scale and form; and  
f) Adherence with Supplementary Planning Guidance 12 Lands cape and the Croydon’s Public Realm Design Guide, or equivalent, will 
be encouraged to aid compliance with the policies contained in the Local Plan.  
DM10.9 To ensure a creative, sensitive and sustainable approach is taken to incorporating architectural lighting on the exterior of 
buildings and public spaces the Council will require proposals to:  
a) Respect enhance and strengthen local character;  
                                            
49 Natural Habitats are defined as the natural home or environment of an animal, plant or other living organism.  
 153 b) Seek opportunities to enhance and emphasise the key features of heritage assets and local landmark buildings; or seek to encourage 
the use of public spaces and make them feel safer by incorporating lighting within public spaces; and  
c) Ensure lighting schemes do not cause glare and light pollution.  
d) Adherence with Croydon’s Public Realm Design Guide, or equivalent, will be enco uraged to aid compliance with the policies 
contained in the Local Plan.  
DM10.10  When considering the layout of new development, the council will support proposals that minimise the amount of blank and 
inactive frontages, increase the amount of natural surveillanc e and avoid dark and secluded areas. Policy deleted  
DM10.11  In the locations described in Table 6.3 and shown on the Policies Map as areas of focussed intensification, new development 
may be significantly larger than exist ing and should : 
a) Be up to double the predominant height of buildings in the area ; 
b) Take the form of character types “Medium -rise block with associated grounds”, “ Large buildings with spacing”, or “Large buildings with 
Continuous frontage line” ; 
c) Assume a subu rban character with spaces between buildings.  
Developments in focused intensification areas should contribute to an increase in density and a gradual change in character. They will be 
expected to enhance and sensitively respond to existing character by be ing of high quality and respectful of the existing place in which they 
would be placed.  Policy deleted  
Character and growth  – Urban Intensification  
DM10.11a To deliver the homes that Croydon needs in suitable and sustainable locations that will accommodate  higher levels of growth. In 
the areas of focused intensification, development should sustainably optimise site capacity. They may be significantly larger  than existing and 
should:  
a) Achieve a step change of density, scale and height within the area of fo cussed intensification which enhances and evolves local 
characters, except for locations in the Places of Purley, Broad Green and Selhurst where place specific policy takes precedence ; 
b) Have active well detailed frontages;   
 154 c) Address the higher density o f the development by providing amenity and communal facilities for intensified use including utilities 
infrastructure, play space, parking, cycle storage and refuse storage within the capacity of the site;  
d) Demonstrate innovative and sustainable design i mplementing mitigation measures to counter any identified flood risk ; and 
e) Enhance landscape character, biodiversity and create opportunities for ecological, walking and cycling corridors.  
DM10.11b  Developments in areas of focused intensification should contribute to an increase in density and a change in character. They will 
be expected to enhance and sensitively respond to positive aspects of existing local character by being of high quality and r espectful of the 
existing place in which they would be pl aced.  
DM10.11c  Developments within the areas of moderate intensification should be larger than the existing by delivering at least an additi onal 
storey. The increasing density should:  
a) Respect and enhance the character of the area and  
b) Provide amenity and communal facilities for intensified use including utilities infrastructure, play space, landscaping, parking, cycle 
storage and, refuse storage within the capacity of the site.  
DM10.11d  In other areas of the borough (excluding Conservation Areas and L ocal Heritage Areas) to support evolution without significant 
change, the developments should complement the predominant height, scale and density of buildings in the area.

How the policy works 
Character 
6.57 The Council recognises the need to proactively plan for the population growth housing need . The challenge for the Croydon Local 
Plan is to respect local character and distinctiveness whilst accommodating growth. Croydon’s aspiration is for this to be done in a way 
that contributes to the improvement of each of Croydon’s 16 places and accommodated in the following ways as set out in Table 6.4 , 
Figure 6.3  and Figure 6.4  below :

Evolution without significant change of area’s character Urban and 
Suburban Evolution  
 
6.58 There are existing residential areas which have the 
capacity to accommodate growth without significant impact on 
their character. Character in most areas of the borough will 
evolve over time through the recycling of existing plots with 
denser forms of development without significant impact on their 
character. In these locations new residential units can be created 
through the following interventions.  
 159 
 Conversi on – The conversion or subdivision of large 
buildings into multiple dwellings without major alterations to the 
size of the building.    
 Addition – This can include one or more extensions to the 
side, rear, front or on the roof, and is often combined with 
conversion of the existing building into flats.  
 In-fill including plot subdivision – Filling in gaps and left over 
spaces between existing properties. It can also include 
subdivision of large plots of land into smaller parcels of land 
with a layout that com plements the existing urban pattern.  
 Rear garden development – The construction of new 
buildings in rear gardens of the existing properties. Houses 
must be subservient in scale to the main house.  
 Regeneration  Redevelopment  – The replacement of the 
existing  buildings (including the replacement of detached or 
semi -detached houses with flats) with a development that 
increases the density and massing, within the broad 
parameters of the existing local character reflected in the form 
of buildings and street scene  in particular.  
6.59 The level of growth depends on existing local character. 
The capacity for natural evolution is dependent upon the local 
character typology. The new development should not adversely 
impact on the predominant character. The objective of the 
evolution of local character is to achieve an intensification of use 
without major impacts on local character. Each character type 
has capacity for growth. Natural evolution is an ongoing process 
where development occurs in a way that positively responds to 
the local context and seeks to reinforce and enhance the existing 
predominant character.  
6.60 Character in most areas of the borough will evolve over 
time through the recycling of existing plots with denser forms of 
development still within keeping of local character, the 
subdivision of larger properties, infill development and the 
development of the largest back gardens in the borough. Growth will be accommodated with Evolution in urban and suburban 
areas will be accommodated as shown in  Table 6.5 . Table 6.5

be acceptable compared to the predominant character of a local 
area.

6.61 In areas where the predominant character is weakly defined 
or of poor quality, it is important that applicants developments  
take the opportunity to improve the overall quality of the area.  
6.62 Conversions of large residential properties and the use of 
front gardens for car parking can cause unacceptable harm to 
the setting of building and the character of the local area.  
Paragraph deleted . 
6.62a  Developments proposed to support urban and suburban 
evolution are required to provide amenities on the site and 
sustainably optimise site capacity in accordance with the guidance 
in the supplementary planning document. 
Moderate intensification  
 
6.62b  Moderate intensification will see developments that 
reasonably increase density in a way that positively responds to 
the local context and seeks to reinforce and enhance the existing 
predominant character. Developments will be scattered 
throughout areas, with a gradual change over time where the level 
of intensification will be limited by access to transport links, shops 
and green space.   
 161 6.62c  In areas of moderate intensification shown in the policies 
map, new homes may be created by replacement of the existing 
buildings (including the amalgamation of sites) or the creation of 
new streets (such as a Mews development across multiple back 
gardens). Developments will increase the density and massing, 
within the broad parameters of the existing local character reflected 
in the form of buildings and street scene in particular.  
6.62d  Moderate intensification will not take place within in a 
Conservation Area or Local Heritage Area. Developments will have 
good access to services and public transport meaning either: 
1. It is within 800m of Croydon Metropolitan Centre or a Town 
Centre designated as a District Centre in the London Plan;  
2. It is within 800m of a Local Centre, Neighbourhood Centre or 
Shopping Parade and it is an area with a PTAL of 3 or above; or 
3. It is within 800m of a Local Centre, Neighbourhood Centre or 
Shopping Parade and within 800m of a train or tram stop. 
 
6.62e  To accommodate growth which would complement the 
existing individual character of Places of Croydon and improve 
efficiency of land use, the Council promotes intensification by 
delivering at least an additional storey . The developments in the 
moderate intensification areas are required to provide amenities on 
the site in accordance with the guidance in the supplementary 
planning document.  
Focused intensification  
 
6.62f  Focused intensification aims to maximise use of the existing 
growth capacity and to support sustainable spatial vision for the 
borough through an increase in density of development. Sites will 
be redeveloped with denser forms of development of an evolv ed 
and enhanced character to that which exists in the local area 
currently. At the heart of each area of focused intensification is an 
area with a variety of character s. As each area of focused Intensification is currently low density it would not be justified, when 
there is unmet housing need, to seek to move towards a more 
consistent character that replicates surrounding low density 
development types. 
6.62g  Focused intensification areas shown in the policies map are 
identified using the following indicative criteria: 
1.  Within 800m of a school (secondary or primary); 
2. Within 800m of open space (Green Belt, Metropolitan Open 
Land, Local Green Space or Other Open Space); 
3. The area has capacity to change meaning either the local 
predominant character types are Detached Houses on Large Plots 
and Scattered Houses on Large Plots; or there are large 
development sites in the area and 
4. It is not within in a Conservation Area or Local Heritage Area. 
6.62h  Additional indicative criteria used to ensure that the focused 
intensification areas have good access to services and public 
transport are as follows: 
1. It is within 400m of Croydon Metropolitan Centre or a Town 
Centre designated as a District Centre in the London Plan; 
2. It is within 400m of a Local Centre, Neighbourhood Centre or 
Shopping Parade and it is an area with a PTAL of 4 or above; or 
3. It is within 400m of a Local Centre, Neighbourhood Centre or 
Shopping Parade and within 400m of a train or tram stop. 
6.62i  It has been identified that there are a number of heritage 
assets in several focused intensification areas. Any development 
proposals proposed in these locations must be informed by and 
enhance the design and character of heritage assets, and be 
subservient to them.  
6.62j  Each of the areas of focused intensification are, in part, at 
risk of fluvial, surface water or groundwater flooding. However, a  
 162 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment has identified that developments 
in these areas could be made safe from flooding without increasing 
flood risk elsewhere. 
6.62k  Developments located on the edge within the boundary of 
intensification areas should create a respectful transition in scale, 
height, and density, stepping down to lower density adjacent sites 
that fall outside of the boundary. 
Guided intensification associated with enhancement of area’s local 
character (Place specific policy) 
6.63 In line with the London Plan Policy 7.4, the local character 
of the borough’s 16 Places has been mapped. There are places 
of inconsistent character that overlap with focused intensification 
areas. In such cases a Place Specific Policy will also apply. In 
locations within the places of Purley, Broad Green and Selhurst, 
the place specific policies will override the building height 
requirements of policy DM10.11a. In line with the London Plan, 
the local character of the borough's 16 Places has been mapped.  
The Borough Character Appraisal, the Opportunity Area Planning 
Framework and the Council’s masterplans should be considered 
in conjunction with these policies. The applicable Place-specific 
development management policies should also be taken into 
account. Where the proposed development is located within a 
Conservation Area, further guidance should also be sought from 
Croydon’s Conservation Area Appraisal Management Plan and 
the Conservation Area General Guidance. Where the 
development sits within the setting of a heritage asset, the 
significance of this heritage asset should be identified and should 
inform the design of the proposed development.   
6.64 Place specific policy guides development (and assists 
growth) by setting out policies on design in specific locations that 
seek to more towards a more consistent or appropriate character 
in these locations, deliver the spatial vision for the Borough and wider Local Plan policies and objectives (including delivery of 
new homes).  Paragraph deleted. 
6.65 The character of the areas will evolve towards a more 
consistent one (as opposed to multiple character typologies); or 
one that might be expected in a District or Local Centre as sites 
are redeveloped. The policies often seek to permit development 
that is one or two storeys higher than the predominant building 
height so as to facilitate a level of growth and enable 
development. However, they are character policies first and 
foremost, not a policy about growth. Paragraph deleted. 
6.66 To accommodate growth which would complement the 
existing individual character of Places of Croydon and improve 
efficiency of land use, the Council promotes a minimum building 
height of three storeys. Paragraph Deleted  
Layout 
6.67 Streets form an integral part of a place, creating movement 
networks that serve the built form rather than dominate it. 
Consideration should be given at a sufficiently early stage of the 
design process to how the development site links to the local a nd 
wider area. Additionally, the creation of routes punctuated by 
landmark buildings or features, public squares or spaces helps to 
make a place easy to understand. 
6.68 The Council will require detailed design of roads, footpaths 
and cycleways to be clearly communicated. Early planning of 
road and site layouts enables applicants to incorporate parking 
and servicing in locations where their presence will not dictate 
the urban form and their visual impact can be minimised. When 
designing parking and road layouts, careful consideration should 
be given to creating layouts that are safe, secure, accessible, 
and permeable and balance the needs of all users. Particular 
attention should be paid to ensure safe and accessible 
pedestrian routes are accommodated within the development.  
 163 6.69 When considering the layout, proposals should 
demonstrate a clear and logical arrangement of buildings that 
provides a high quality design solution on the site. Buildings , 
other than on back land developments, should positively address 
the street and the public realm and particular care should be 
taken to address how they enclose private secure spaces, car 
parks and servicing areas. 
6.70 Supplementary Planning Document No. 3 Designing for 
Community Safety or equivalent should be referred to for aspects 
of safety in layout, and design. The provision of sufficient lighting, 
in line with EU lighting uniformity requirements, will encourage 
greater pedestrian access, movement and reduce opportunity for 
undesirable behaviour.  
6.71 The Council considers the health and wellbeing of those 
living and working within the borough to be of the upmost 
importance. New developments can impact upon the amenity of 
the occupants of neighbouring properties. Site layouts should be 
designed to protect or improve conditions for occupants of 
nearby properties and future occupants. In line with the Housing 
Supplementary Planning Guidance, when assessing site layouts 
the Council will consider a development’s impact on visual 
amenity, overlooking, outlook, and sunlight and daylight.   
Amenity space 
6.72 Policies DM10.4  and DM10.5  apply to all new residential 
developments and conversions. Croydon’s local character is the 
leading consideration on the quantum of private and communal 
open space to be provided for developments. When calculating 
the amount of private and communal open space to be provided 
the following elements should be excluded: 
 Footpaths;  
 Driveways;  
 Front gardens;  
 Vehicle circulation area s; 
 Parking areas;  
 Cycle parking areas; and  
 Refuse areas.  Paragraph deleted  
 
6.73 Private open space is defined as amenity space which is 
accessible only to, useable for and screened for the purposes of 
individual dwellings at the rear or in the case of flatted schemes 
within the grounds. Paragraph deleted  
6.74 Communal open space is defined as amenity space that is 
shared, accessible to all within the development and could be for 
their exclusive use.   Moved to homes chapter 
6.75 Balconies, winter gardens or roof terraces may help to meet 
a development’s private amenity space requirement but will have 
to comply with the privacy requirements of policy DM10.6  so 
enclosure may need to be opaque. They may be an innovative 
way of providing private or communal amenity space in areas of 
high density.  Moved to homes chapter 
6.76 In exceptional circumstances where site constraints make it 
impossible to provide private outdoor space for all dwellings , 
indoor private amenity space may help to meet policy 
requirements. The area provided should be equivalent to the 
private outdoor amenity space requirement and this area added 
to the minimum Gross Internal Area. Paragraph deleted  
6.77 The provision of private and communal amenity space per 
unit, including child play space of 10m2 per child, based on the 
calculation of numbers of children yielded from the development 
as set out in the Table 6.2  may be pooled to create a communal 
amenity space for a flatted development that meets all the 
requirements of this policy. Paragraph deleted   
 164 6.78 The amenity space provided for play space can be part of 
the shared amenity area; it may be a void deck within a tall 
flatted development, possibly on the ground floor and in small 
developments of less than ten dwellings it could be part of the 
shared or private garden. Moved to homes chapter 
6.79 The Play Space Standards are based on Wandsworth yield 
calculator which the London Plan Supplementary Planning 
Guidance (Supplementary Planning Guidance) Shaping 
Neighbourhoods: Children and Young People Play and Informal 
Recreation is based on. This Supplementary Planning Guidance 
should be referred to for the allocation and design guidance for 
play space. The requirements for play space will be calculated 
on the basis that all units are for affordable or social rent. This is 
because many applications are made by private developers 
which are then later sold, prior to occupation, to a Registered 
Provider of affordable housing and let on an affordable rent 
basis. In order to ensure that these affordable homes have 
sufficient play space for all the child occupiers, it is necessary to 
require that all developments meet the higher play space 
requirements of affordable and social rented homes unless there 
is a signed Section 106 agreement specifically stating a different 
mix of housing tenures in a development. Paragraph deleted 
6.80 Evidence will be required to demonstrate that privacy is 
protected, and the character of the area is respected in the 
layout of private and communal amenity space as part of 
development proposals. A minimum separation of 18-21m 
between directly facing habitable room windows on main rear 
elevations is a best practice ‘yardstick’ in common usage and 
should be applied flexibly, dependent on the context of the 
development to ensure that development is provided at an 
acceptable density in the local context. For new major 
developments, as long as the perimeter buildings take account of 
this local context, the density may vary within the development. 
Paragraph deleted  6.81 Designers should consider the position and aspect of 
habitable rooms, gardens and balconies, and avoid windows 
facing each other where privacy distances are tight. Planning 
guidance has, in the past, been concerned with achieving visual 
separation between dwellings by setting a minimum distance of 
18-21m between facing homes (between habitable room and 
habitable room as opposed to between balconies or terraces or 
between habitable rooms and balconies/terrace). These can still 
be useful yardsticks for visual privacy, but adhering rigidly to 
these measures can limit the variety of urban spaces and 
housing types and can sometimes unnecessarily restrict density. 
Paragraph deleted  
6.82 A planning condition may require a management plan to 
provide the Council with some assurance that the communal 
amenity space will be maintained, and therefore continue to be 
useable. A well maintained appearance will assist with 
enhancement of the development, with a sense of ownership of 
residents, and increase the perception of safety in the 
neighbourhood. Paragraph deleted 
6.83 Amenity, including sunlight and daylight need to be 
considered in the layout of private and communal open space 
and Building Research Establishment Guidelines referred to. 
Paragraph deleted  
Design  
6.84 The need for good design is supported in Paragraph 56 of 
the National Planning Policy Framework. Both the London Plan 
(policy 7.4b) and the Croydon Local Plan Strategic Policy SP4.1 
identify the need for high quality design. To achieve high quality 
designs, proposals should consider the physical appearance and 
functionality of the development site and local area. In 
accordance with the London Plan, Croydon is committed to 
working with applicants to create modern, high quality innovative 
and well -designed buildings and places that are, safe,  
 165 accessible, and inclusive and enrich the quality of life for all 
those who live, work and visit them.  
6.85 The quality of materials can play an important role 
determining whether the integrity of the design concept is 
realised. The choice of materials and the quality of craftsmanship 
is vital to the overall success of the development in terms of 
function and appearance.  
6.86 The design, position and rhythm of windows and doors can 
contribute or detract from the overall appearance of the building 
and the character of an area. The Council will seek to encourage 
applicants at an early stage of the design process to give careful 
consideration to the detailing of the overall design (including 
setbacks and reveals) of windows and doors. The Mayor of 
London’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance provides 
guidelines on window sizes and the required levels of light to 
protect the residential amenity and well-being of future residents.  
6.87 Servicing equipment such as plant, utility boxes, ventilation 
systems (including heating and cooling), lift, mechanical 
equipment, fire escapes and rainwater goods form an integral 
part of the operational components of a building. Early 
consideration will enable it to be incorporated within the building 
envelope without compromising the integrity of the original 
design concept.  
6.88 Roof-form plays an important role in creating and 
contributing to the visual character of an area and in some 
instances their visual prominence creates local landmarks or 
frames designated views. When considering the pitch, shape and 
materials of roofs, care should be taken to ensure that design is 
of high quality and appropriate to neighbouring buildings. The 
                                            
50 The public realm is defined as public spaces that are accessible to all without 
charge. These can include public, semi-public and privately owned spaces.  Council will  also consider the impact of a scheme in terms of its 
effect on Local Designated Views (as shown on the Policies 
Map) .  
6.89 Information and guidance about the relationships of 
proposed extensions to neighbouring properties is available in 
the Residential Extensions and Alterations Supplementary 
Planning Document or equivalent. 
6.90 The design of our built environment can affect our health, 
and our psychological and physiological well-being, and can 
have long-term implications for quality of life. Good house design 
should not be limited to the appearance of building and setting, it 
should also consider the wellbeing of the end user.  
6.91 Croydon ’s Local Plan Strategic Policies SP5.2 b set out the 
Council’s objective to ensure new development provides healthy 
living by encouraging good house design. This is increasingly 
impor tant in locations where densities are increased and/or 
separation distances are reduced. In these locations, to assist in 
the creation of buildings that improve the health and wellbeing of 
future occupiers, developments will be expected to exceed the 
minim um standards outlined in the Mayor’s Housing 
Supplementary Planning Guidance. 
Public Realm 
6.92 A well-designed, cared for and high quality public realm50 
plays an important role in reinforcing the perception of Croydon 
as a welcoming, safe and accessible place. Croydon’s 
aspirations for its public realm are outlined in SP4.6 to SP4.10. 
6.93 Most proposals include an element of public realm. This 
can range from large scale public realm improvements such as  
 166 the design of hard and soft landscaped areas (including 
footways) throughout a site or smaller scale public realm 
improvements to the forecourt; and in some cases, the area 
adjoining it.  
6.94 Where public realm improvements have been included 
within a proposal, these should result in a high quality public 
realm that is usable, permeable, legible and accessible.  
6.95 As outlined in the Strategic Policy SP4.10, t The Croydon 
Public Realm Design Guide sets out materials and layout 
guidelines. Further details, including a materials palette can be 
found in the Croydon Public Realm Design Guide. 
6.96 Historic street furniture such as traditional red telephone 
boxes, post boxes, ornamental lamp columns, drinking fountains, 
cattle troughs, monuments and memorials can make a positive 
contribution to local character  by reinforcing a sense of place. 
Opportunities to retain, restore and incorporate historic street 
furniture should be taken. 
Landscape 
6.97 The character of a place can be significantly affected by the 
quality of the landscape and the way it is maintained. Sensitively 
designed landscape can enrich and reinforce existing wildlife 
habitats and improve the ecological value of sites and their 
surroundings. This includes the historic environment, such as 
historic landscapes and their settings, and the landscape 
character of heritage assets such as rural village conservation 
areas. The Council considers landscape as an integral part of all 
development and would therefore require proposals for new 
developments and extensions to be accompanied by plans 
detailing all existing and proposed hard and soft landscaping 
affected by or to be incorporated into the scheme.  6.98 Supplementary Planning Guidance 12 Landscape Design is 
referenced in the policy and provides detailed guidance and 
clarity on what the Council is seeking from development 
proposals on providing safe well-designed landscaped schemes. 
The Croydon Public Realm Design Guide also sets out detailed 
guidance and clarity on what the Council is seeking from the 
public realm components of development proposals. If these 
documents are superseded the equivalent Council documents 
should be referred to. 
Lighting 
6.99 Lighting plays an important role in creating the perception 
of safe and welcoming place for people to use and interact with. 
A well-designed lighting scheme can improve the borough’s 
image and if creatively implemented can give dimension to a 
building and the landscape surrounding it. 
6.100 Architectural lighting is most effective when used to 
highlight a few structural elements such as colonnades, towers 
spires, sculpture or walls or by emphasising texture, such as 
brick, stone and steelwork rather than flooding every surface with 
light.  
Design and Access Statements 
6.101 The Council will require applicants to justify and fully 
demonstrate how the principles of good design are being met. 
Design and Access Statements  should be proportional to the 
size of the scheme and should fully demonstrate: 
 A thorough understanding and analysis of the physical, 
social and economic and policy context;  
 A clear understanding of the development objectives and 
brief;  
 Clear d esign principles and design concept ; and  
 The evolution of the design and how the final design 
solution was arrived at.   
 167 6.102 The Statement should refer to By Design, 
Supplementary Planning Document 3 Designing for Community 
Safety or equivalent and Supplementary Planning Guidance 12 
Landscape Design or equivalent, and demonstrate how the 
National Planning Policy Framework, the London Plan and the 
Croydon Local Plan design policies are being met. Advice on the 
content of the Design and Access Statements can be found in 
the Council’s advisory note ‘Preparing Design Statements Advice 
Note for Applicants and Agents’ and CABE’s ‘Design and Access 
Statements, How to write, read and use them’. 
Focused intensification associated with gradual change of area’s 
local character 
6.103 Focussed intensification aims to maximise use of the 
existing growth capacity and to support sustainable spatial vision 
for the borough through an increase in density of development 
and a gradual change in character to similar but higher density 
forms of development. Sites will be redeveloped with denser 
forms of development of a different character to that which exists 
in the local area currently. At the heart of each area of Focused 
Intensification is an area with no one predominant character 
type. As each area of Focused Intensification is currently low 
density it would not be justified, when there is unmet housing

Why we need this policy
6.105 Given the renewed interest in shop front security 
brought about as a result of the civil unrest on 8 August 2011, 
the Council acknowledges the key benefits of a robust shop front 
design. It is necessary to develop a security policy that will 
enable the delivery of secure well-designed shop fronts which 
improve Croydon’s public realm, urban environment, and vitality 
of its town centres.  
6.106 There is a need to ensure that opportunities are 
taken to promote a succinct and cohesive approach to shop front 
design and security. Addition al guidance that provides clear and 
concise policies is required to help commercial premises across 
the borough to incorporate shop front designs which maintain 
local distinctiveness and provide adequate levels of security 
whilst reducing the requirement for enforcement action.  
6.107 The new Shop Front Policy will apply greater 
emphasis in favour of quality shop front design and security in 
line with the revised addendum to Supplementary Planning 
Guidance No.1 Shop Fronts & Signs.  6.108 Over recent years, changes in retail patterns and a 
growing demand for housing have led to many of these shops 
being converted into residential accommodation. Many of these 
conversions have been carried out in a way which often 
destroyed the inherent adaptability of shop units and the shop 
fronts. This policy will provide guidance to ensure that 
conversions are carried out sympathetically and flexibly to allow 
for future change. 
6.109 Paragraph 56 of the National Planning Policy 
Framework (requiring good design) outlines the need for robust 
and comprehensive policies that ‘establish a strong sense of 
place, using streetscapes and buildings to create attractive and 
comfortable places to live, work and visit’. Furthermore policies 
should aim to ‘create safe and accessible environments where 
crime and disorder, and the fear of crime, do not undermine 
quality of life or community cohesion’ .  
6.110 The Council’s Shop Fronts and Signs 
Supplementary Planning Guidance No.1 was published on 27 th 
March 1996 and Shop Front Security Addendum to  
 170 Supplementary Planning Guidance No.1 Shop Fronts & Signs 
was adopted in April 2012. The Addendum provides advice on 
shop front security technology and innovation and offers greater 
clarity regarding acceptable forms of shop front security .  
6.111 The Converting Shops into Homes Addendum to 
Supplementary Planning Guidance No.1 Shop Fronts & Signs 
was adopted October 2004. This addendum provides guidance 
on how to sympathetically convert shops to residential 
development. 6.112 The Strategic Policy SP4 makes no reference to 
detailed policies on shop front design. Paragraph deleted 
6.113 The existing policy requires updating to align with the 
Council’s recently revised Shop Front Security Addendum to 
Supplementary Planning Guidance No.1 Shop Fronts & Signs 
adopted April 2012. Paragraph deleted
 
Policy DM11: Shop front design and security 
DM11.1 To ensur e shop fronts are attractive, secure and of a high quality design, the Council will support proposals for new shop fronts 
and related alterations that respect the scale, character, materials and features of the buildings of which they form part.  
DM11.2 To ensure shop fronts are attractive, secure and of a high quality design, the Council will support proposals for new shop fronts 
and related alterations in the Metropolitan Centre, District and Local Centres, Shopping Parades and Restaurant Quarter Parad es that : 
a) Do not include wholly solid or perforated/pinhole external shutters;  
b) Employ less obtrusive solutions which could include: security glazing, internal shutters, external open, tube and link grille , brick bond 
parallel pattern lattice type grilles and shutters,  concertina or scissor grilles, removable shutters; or  
c) In some instances a mix of solid and open grille shutters may be acceptable as a solution where any element of solid external  shutter 
proposed is transparent.   
DM11.3 To ensure shop fronts are sympatheticall y incorporated and to provide future flexibility, developments that convert shops into 
residential accommodation should:  
a) Respect the scale, character, proportions, materials and features of the buildings of which they form part;  
b) Retain and incorporate his toric shop fronts, including signboards, roller blind boxes, corbels, stall risers, cornices, fanlights, console 
brackets, transoms, pilasters and lobbies into the design;  
c) For new elements, adopt and reinterpret the language of shop front design;   
 171 d) Optimise  window and door openings ; and 
e) Ensure the design includes elements that provide privacy  for the occupiers . 
 
How the policy works 
6.114 The Council expects all shop front design to be of a 
high design quality and craftsmanship and whenever possible, 
use sustainable or recycled materials.  
6.115 The Council encourages improved shop front 
security and public realm through the integration of innovative 
technologies. 
6.116 By encouraging shop owners to consider the 
inclusion of internal shop front shutters during the early stages of 
the design process. Proposals will respect the distinctive local 
character of an area whilst maintaining a welcoming environment 
and public realm. 
6.117 Those seeking planning permission for shop front 
improvements and new shop fronts should seek additiona l 
guidance from the Council’s Shop Fronts and Signs 
Supplementary Planning Guidance No.1 published on 27th 
March 1996 and Shop Front Security Addendum to 
Supplementary Planning Guidance No.1 Shop Fronts & Signs 
adopted in April 2012 or equivalent guidance. 
6.118 Changes in retail patterns and a growing demand for 
housing have led to the piecemeal change of shops converted to 
residential. Construction works often associated with these 
changes in use (usually brick-infill) often destroy the inherent 
adaptability of shop units and shop fronts and detract from the 
character of the area. 6.119 Wherever possible it is preferable to keep and adapt 
existing historic shop fronts. Key features such as large windows, 
details and proportions of the shop front can make for an unique , 
adaptable and attractive home that enhances and compliments  
the character of the local area.  
6.120  When designing conversions of retail units to 
residential use, careful consideration should be given to the 
designing-in of privacy, given that retail units are commonly hard 
against the pavement. This could include retention or 
replacement of existing shop fronts and integration of a winter 
garden space at the front of the former retail unit to create a 
degree of environmental protection, privacy and private amenity 
space. Those seeking planning permission to convert shops into 
homes should seek additional guidance from the Addendum to 
Supplementary Planning Guidance No.1 Converting Shops into 
Homes, adopted October 2004.

 172 Advertisement hoardings 
Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies 
 Strategic Objective 5  
 Strategic Objective 7  
Why we need this policy
6.121 Advertising is closely associated with urban life and 
can be one of the most dominant elements of the environment. In 
the right context advertisement hoardings can enhance the 
appearance and vitality of an area . However, where they are 
poorly designed or located and where too many signs have been 
installed they can cause considerable damage to visual amenity 
by cluttering the built environment and detracting from the quality 
of the area. 
6.122 Changes in legislation and national policy have 
resulted in the need for updated guidance . The provision of a 
policy for advertisement hoardings would a lign with paragraph 67 
of the National Planning Policy Framework which highlights a 
need for controls on advertisements to be efficient, effective and 
simple in concept and operation. This policy provides guidance 
that is clear and concise. 6.123 The National Planning Policy Framework 
acknowledges the impact that advertisements can have on the 
appearance of the built and natural environment. It highlights the 
importance of the need for detailed assessment where 
‘advertisements would have an appreciable impact on a building 
or on their surroundings. Advertisements should be subject to 
control only in the interests of amenity and public safety, taking 
account of cumulative impacts’51. The Advertisement and 
Hoardings & Other Advertisements Supplementary Planning 
Guidance No.8 (February 2003) provided guidance about 
acceptable locations, number, scale and type of advertisements 
such as wall mounted and Free standing hoardings and ‘A’ 
boards, panels, signs and window advertisements. The 
Supplementary Planning Guidance highlights the need to ensure 
advertisements are sensitively located and design to minimise 
the impact on residential areas and on heritage assets.
Policy DM12: Advertisement hoardings 
DM12.1 To ensure advertisement hoardings positively contribute to the character and appearance of existing and new streets, the 
Counc il will require advertisement hoardings to:  
                                            
51 National Planning Policy Framework paragraph 67.  
 173 a) Be designed to improve the public realm;  
b) Demonstrate that the rear of the signs are well designed;  
c) Reinforce the special character of heritage assets and other visually attractive parts of the borough; and  
d) Ensure  the location and size of hoardings does not harm amenity or conflict with public safety.  
DM12.2 To ensure advertisement hoardings positively contribute to the character and appearance of the building on which they are 
attached:  
a) The design and proportions should  complement the symmetry and proportions of the host structure;  
b) They should be located where they do not obscure or destroy interesting architectural features and detailing; and  
c) They should be located where they do not cover windows or adversely impact on  the functioning of the building.  
DM12.3 A proposal to display advertisements in Areas of Special Advertisement Control will need to demonstrate that it would not : 
 Significantly detract from residential amenity;  
 Affect the setting or character of a heritage asset ; 
 Have a significant impact on the character of Metropolitan Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land, or other rural spaces;  
 Have a significant impact on public safety including potential for traffic hazards;  
 Have a significant impact on environmentally sensiti ve and major gateway approaches to the borough;  
 Visually separate areas such as car parks and other locations where a safety issue may arise as a result of obscured views in to an 
area; and  
 Result in numerous hoardings in an area where the cumulative impact  would be detrimental to visual amenity.  
  
 174 How the policy works 
6.124 Larger hoarding sizes are becoming increasing 
prevalent, with new displays now incorporating high level brightly 
illuminated or flashing LCD screens. These are often mounted on 
large, poorly designed and unsightly platforms and gantries or on 
exposed flank brick walls which are intrusive in the street scene 
and can be a potential distraction for motorists. When assessing 
proposals for advertising hoarding, the Council will expect signs  
and the ir supporting structures  to be of a high quality 
architectural design that positively enhances its setting.  
Hoardings affecting heritage assets 
6.125 In sensitive locations such as Conservation Areas, 
Local Heritage Areas, and adjacent to Listed Buildings and 
Locally Listed Buildings , an excessive number of advertisements 
and signs in close proximity can lead to visual clutter and can 
detract from the ir character, appearance and setting . To reduce 
their impact on the significance of these heritage assets in thes e 
locations, the number of advertisements will be restricted and 
proposals will need to demonstrate that they positively enhance 
and respect their immediate setting and context. 
Wall mounted hoardings 
6.126 Wall mounted advertisement hoardings are often 
difficult to sensitively integrate on buildings because they can be 
overbearing in scale, dominate the street scene and can create a 
poor relationship with building on which they are located. To 
ensure wall mounted hoardings can be sensitively incorporated 
on the side of buildings or on boundary walls, the Council  will 
need to be satisfied that their design, scale, and siting would not 
have an adverse impact on the host building or structure on 
which it will be located. Areas of Special Advertisement Control 
6.127 To protect the open character of and visual amenity 
of the Metropolitan Greenbelt and the Bradmore Green 
Conservation Area, the Secretary of State designated these 
locations as Areas of Special Advertisement Control. This 
designation prohibits the display of certain advertisements 
without the consent of the Council.   
6.128 Assessments relating to amenity and safety will need 
to comply with Town and Country Planning (Control of 
advertisements) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012.

 Policy SP4.6  
Why we need this policy 
6.129 Most residential and non-residential developments 
generate waste which will need to be temporarily stored on site. 
The current kerbside recycling scheme necessitates the need to 
provide sufficient room to store separated waste within all 
developments.  
6.130 Both the London Plan and the National Planning 
Policy Framework do not contain policies relating to refuse and 
recycling within developments. Additionally the Strategic Policies 
refer to the Detailed Policies and Proposals for specific design 
guidance. 
6.131 This policy will provide developers working on 
residential and non-residential schemes  greater clarity about 
what the Council will expect them to provide. 6.132 The existing Unitary Development Plan policies have 
proved useful to both the Council and those applying for planning 
permission by providing guidance about the location and design 
of facilities which are integral to the functional running of each 
development. Paragraph deleted  
6.133 The Mayor’s Housing Supplementary Planning 
Guidance provides some general guidance, however, it states 
that it should be used in conjunction with local guidance. The 
Mayor’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance does not 
address non-residential development.  
 176 Policy DM13: Refuse and recycling 
DM13.1 To ensure that the location an d design of refuse and recycling facilities are treated as an integral element of the overall design, 
the Council will require developments to:  
a) Sensitively integrate refuse and recycling facilities within the building envelope , or, in conversions, where th at is not possible, 
integrate within the landscape covered facilities that are located behind the building line where they will not be visually i ntrusive or 
compromise the provision of shared amenity space ; 
b) Ensure facilities are visually screened;  
c) Provide  adequate space for the temporary storage of waste (including bulky waste) materials generated by the development; and  
d) Provide layouts that ensure facilities are safe, conveniently located and easily accessible by occupants, operatives and thei r vehicles.  
DM13.2 To ensure existing and future waste can be sustainably and efficiently managed the Council will require a waste management 
plan for major developments and for developments that are likely to generate large amounts of waste.  
  
 177 How the policy works 
Design considerations 
6.134 The Council considers the layout, siting, function and 
design of recycling and refuse storage facilities to all be of equal 
importance. It is important that these facilities are considered as 
an integral part of the development process.   
6.135 If considered at the initial stage of the design 
process, proposals for new developments can integrate refuse 
and recycling within the building envelope without causing undue 
noise and odour nuisance.  
Technical considerations 
6.136 It is important that refuse facilities are located in an 
area where they are easily accessible to all residents, including 
children and wheelchair users. This would include the provision 
of a safe route for those on foot as well as ensuring facilities are 
located on a hard level surface. Facilities must also be easily 
accessible for waste collectors. 
6.137 It is essential that developments incorporate enough 
suitable space to store the amount of waste and recycling likely 
to arise from the development once they are occupied and to 
build in capacity to meet future demand. This ensures that 
problems with rubbish being left on footways are minimised, 
occupants have space to recycle, commercial and household 
waste are kept separate ly and waste collection services can 
operate safely and efficiently. To ensure this demand can be 
met, major developments or those which are likely to generate 
large amounts of refuse and recycling will be required to submit a 
waste management plan.

Why we need this policy 
6.139 Despite its size there are relatively few examples of 
public art within the borough. The Council acknowledges the 
important role that public art can play in enhancing the setting of 
a building and creating a visually stimulating public realm and 
strengthening local distinctiveness. 
6.140 There is a need to ensure that opportunities to 
incorporate public art within new developments or public realm 
improvements are taken and that it relates to the local character , 
contributes to the sense of place and reinforces local 
distinctiveness.  
6.141 The incorporation of public art offers the opportunity 
to work with the local community to create distinctive works that 
help engender a sense of ownership and strengthen the sense of 
place. 
6.142  Croydon’s Supplementary Planning Guidance 19 
provided a useful guidance for those wishing to incorporate 
public art within their development. However, this document 
referenced ‘percent for art’, a policy that is no longer live. The Croydon Local Plan now refers to the Council’s Public Realm 
Design Guide which provides more detailed guidance.  
 179 Policy DM14: Public art 
To enhance and express local character, the Council will support the inclusion of public art and require all major52 schemes to inclu de public 
art that:  
a) Is integrated into proposals at an early stage of the design process;  
b) Enhances and creates local distinctiveness and reinforces a sense of place;  
c) Responds to local character;  
d) Makes a positive contribution to the public realm; and  
e) Engage s the local community in its creation.  
 
How the policy works 
6.143 By considering public art during the early stages of 
the design process and clarifying the scope at the beginning of 
the p re-application process, opportunities can be taken to 
integrate public art into the fabric of the development itself in 
more imaginative ways. Public art should not be confined to 
statues, but can be incorporated in imaginative, simple and cost 
effective ways such as bespoke paving, gates, lighting, signage, 
street furniture, playground equipment, railings and landscaping , 
murals (painted or ceramic) , decorative bargeboards or works of 
art incorporated on elevations where they will be visible to 
pedestrians.  
6.144 The Council expects all public art to be of the highest 
design quality and craftsmanship and whenever possible, 
encourage the use of sustainable or recycled materials. When 
commissioning public art, developers should place equal weight 
on creating the right piece of work, the craftsmanship of the artist 
                                            
52 Major schemes are defined as being over 0.5 hectares or residential schemes over 10 units or developments over 1000m2 and those installing the piece and the maintenance after it has 
been installed.  
6.145 Those commissioning public art should seek 
additional guidance from Croydon’s Public Realm Design Guide.

 Policy SP4.5  
 Policy SP4.6  
Why we need this policy 
6.146 The Council acknowledges the positive contribution 
that well-designed tall buildings and high density developments  
of high architectural quality can make. If sensitively and 
appropriately located, these buildings this development can 
facilitate regeneration through the provision of new jobs, homes 
and community facilities and an attractive built environment.  
6.147 The need for this policy has been identified in the 
Croydon Local Plan’s Strategic Policies which sets out the 
Council’s intention to include detailed tall buildings policies within 
the Detailed Policies and Proposals plan. The Detailed Policies 
and Proposals also provide a link to the Croydon Opportunity 
Area Planning Framework and contain the Place-specific 
development management policies which identify areas suitable 
for tall buildings and high density development .  
6.148 The borough’s Open Space Needs Assessment 
identified significant gaps in the provision of amenity green 
space, particularly in the north of the borough. To address this 
there is a need to ensure tall and large high density  residential 
developments are located in areas with sufficient green infrastructure or provide new green infrastructure to meet the 
increased demand. These developments should also integrate 
with and enhance the green grid wherever possible.  
6.149 London Plan Policy 7.7 refers to tall and large 
buildings. It is a requirement of London Plan Policy D9 for 
boroughs to produce Tall Buildings Guidance based on the 
specific character of the borough’s places. This policy advises 
boroughs to work with the Mayor to identify areas that are 
appropriate, sensitive or inappropriate for tall or large buildings.  
6.150 The Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework 
identifies locations within the Croydon Opportunity Area that are 
suitable for tall buildings. It provides guidance on indicative tall 
building heights, form and typologies. This approach reflects the 
Mayor’s aspirations for new residential development within the 
Croydon Opportunity Area. 
6.151 The base line information used to select locations 
outside of the Croydon Opportunity Area included mapping of the  
 181 residential and non-residential character analysis and mapping, 
PTAL53 ratings and open space deficiency mapping.

 182 Policy DM15: Tall and large buildings and high density developments  
To ensure tall or large buildings respect and enhance local character, and do not harm the setting of heritage assets, proposals will be 
permitted where they  meet the following criteria : 
a) They are located in areas identified for such buildings in Policies DM 34 to DM 49; 
b) They are located in areas meeting a minimum Public Transport Acce ssibility Level (PTAL) rating of 4 , with direct public transport 
connections to the Croydon Opportunity Area;  
c) The design should be of exceptional quality and demonstrate that  a sensitive approach has been taken in the articulation and 
composition of the bu ilding form which is proportionate to its scale ; 
d) The building height, footprint and design relates positively to any nearby heritage assets, and conserves or enhances the sig nificance 
and setting of the assets of the wider historic environment ; 
e) To improve the quality  of and access to open space , development s including  buildings taller than 40 storeys will need to incorporate 
amenity space , whether at ground level  such as atria or above ground level, such as sky gardens and roof terraces , that is accessible to 
the public as well as residents of the development ; and 
f) To ensure tall , and large  high density developments  buildings  are well integrated with the local area, they should include at least an 
active ground floor and inclusive public realm .and 
g) Tall, large  and high density developments shall positively respond to their surrounding environment, with no change to wind comfo rt 
category of all surrounding public realm and carriageways, particularly the experience of pedestrians and cyclists.  
 
How the policy works 
6.152 Tall and large high density buildings have been 
defined as those which are significantly taller and larger; in terms 
of scale, mass and height than the predominant surrounding 
buildings, causing a significant change to the skyline or over 30m 
in height . 
                                            
54 An urban block is a rectangular area in a city surrounded by streets and 
usually containing several buildings.  6.153 When assessing whether a development can be 
considered to be tall or large high density , the context within 
which the building is situated must be taken into account. This 
would mean that a proposal for six storeys; in an area where 
predominant building heights are two storeys, would be 
considered to be a tall building. In an area where an urban 
block54 comprises of buildings with narrow frontages, a proposal  
 183 for a building with a scale that differs from this would be 
considered to be large. 
6.154 This definition closely aligns with the Croydon Local 
Plan Strategic Policy SP4.5, London Plan Policy 7.25 D9 and 
CABE and Historic England’s guidance which refer to tall and 
large buildings.  
6.155 There is a need to expand the current definition of 
tall buildings to include large buildings. This policy will expand 
the definition of tall buildings to include large buildings and 
ensure development is sensitive to its local context.  
6.156 This policy in conjunction with the policies for the 
Areas of Transformation and Place-specific development 
management policies (Policies DM34 to DM49) will establish 
clear principles and more certainty for developers about the 
locations for tall and large buildings. 
6.157 Proposals for tall or large buildings will need to 
include urban design analysis that demonstrates how they align 
with the Opportunity Area Planning Framework and the Fair 
Field, Mid Croydon, Old Town and East and West Croydon 
Masterplans. In locations outside of these areas, proposals for 
tall or large buildings will be expected to demonstrate that they 
will not cause unacceptable harm to the character of the 
surrounding area and to the wider setting of heritage assets and 
meet all policy requirements, including those relating to tall 
buildings. 
                                            
55 Sensitive locations include sites close to heritage assets, residential amenity 
spaces, schools, or where topography changes would result in the development 
crowding or blocking designated views or viewing corridors.,  6.158 Proposals for tall or large developments within 
sensitive locations55 will be expected to demonstrate that it 
meets the requirements of the London Plan Policies 7.6 and 7.7. 
6.159 Paragraph 6.23 of the Croydon Opportunity Area 
Framework outlines the importance of creating slender tall 
buildings in locations where the proposed building will be taller 
than the predominant surrounding development heights. This 
criterion will help to minimise the impact that the proposed 
building will have upon the setting and character in terms of 
microclimate, overshadowing and wind turbulence. This criterion 
is equally applicable in locations outside of the Croydon 
Opportunity Area (as listed in the Places of Croydon Policies 
DM34 to DM49) where opportunities for tall or large buildings 
may be available. 
6.159A Potential i mpacts of tall, large buildings and high density 
developments include but are not limited to wind, sunlight, and 
wider microclimate. When wind and microclimate conditions 
within the public realm are worsened, but still suitable for their 
intended use, then  all reasonable wind mitigation measures in 
the buildings layout, form and design should be incorporated into 
the development to achieve as close as possible to the original 
wind conditions. Rigorous testing will be carried out to assess 
potential impacts at the earliest possible opportunity in order to 
assess the suitability of development.  
6.159B The scope of wind studies and other microclimate 
impacts should be sufficiently wide to ensure the full and 
cumulative impact of the development. Wind and wider  
microclimate studies will also be required at the early stage of a 
pre planning application process in order to assess suitability of  
 184 options, and again at key milestones as a scheme develops. The 
scope of the studies should include but not be limited to streets 
and public spaces including both habitable, walking and cycling 
environments, and communal and private amenity spaces. 
Development should drive improvements to any problematic 
areas to create a safe, comfortable and inviting public realm.  
6.160 Due to their size and scale and the increased 
densities arising from tall buildings, their impact o n surroundings 
are greater than those of more conventionally sized buildings. 
Tall and large buildings, in areas such as the Metropolitan Centre 
that have been identified for growth, will place additional 
pressure on existing resources such as community facilities and 
public space. There is an opportunity to address the shortage of 
space by incorporating high quality public amenity spaces such 
as sky gardens, atrium spaces and roof terraces in tall buildings . 
To ensure that these buildings address current and future need 
for amenity space, provision full public access to these spaces 
will be supported . The Council will work with developers to 
secure legal agreements for this type of amenity space provision. 
6.161 The design quality of the top of tall buildings is 
equally as important as the base. A base with a design that has 
been carefully considered can have a significant impact on the 
streetscape, local views and how the building physically and 
visually integrates with the street and the spaces surrounding it. 
To ensure a tall building is well integrated within its immediate 
local area, it should incorporate active ground and first floors and 
a stimulating and inclusive public realm. To make the public 
realm around the building feel safe and attractive for pedestrians, 
the façade should have sufficient openings to assist overlooking 
and passive supervision.

Why we need this policy
6.162 The links between planning and health are well 
established. Chapter 8 of the National Planning Policy 
Framework sets out the role of the planning system in promoting 
healthy communities, facilitating social interaction and creating 
healthy and inclusive places. The National Planning Practice 
Guidance recommends that health and wellbeing and health 
infrastructure are considered in Local Plan and planning 
decisions. 
6.163 Policy 3.2 of the London Plan, Improving health and 
addressing health inequalities, states that boroughs should work 
with key partners to identify and address significant health issues 
facing their areas and that new developments should be 
designed, constructed and managed in ways that improve health 
and promote healthy lifestyles to help reduce health inequalities. 
It recommends that Health Impact Assessments are used to 
consider the impact of major developments on health and 
wellbeing of communities.  Paragraph deleted  6.164 SP5.2 of the Croydon Local Plan sets out the 
Council will work in partnership with health authorities to improve 
health in Croydon and will ensure new developments provide 
opportunity for healthy living. 
6.165 Croydon, like many places, has a number of health 
inequalities. These health inequalities can be addressed by 
ensuring the planning system and new developments are 
considering health and wellbeing. This will allow local 
communities to lead healthy lifestyles and adopt healthy 
behaviours through living in quality homes, participating in 
physical activity and have access to quality open spaces.   
 186  
Policy DM16: Promoting healthy communities 
DM16.1 The Council , working with relevant organisations , will ensure the creation of healthy communities which encourage 
healthy behaviours and lifestyles by requiring developments to:  
a) Consider health and wellbeing during t he design of a development to maximise potential health gains and  ensure any 
negative impacts can be mitigated;  
b) Ensure access to open spaces and facilities for sport, recreation, play and food growing;  
c) Promote active travel and physical activity through cycling and walking opportunities that are well linked to existing 
pedestrian and cycling infrastructure;  
d) Create spaces for social interaction and community engagement which are designed to be safe and accessible to all; and  
e) Assess and mitigate pollutants  and other environmental impacts on health.  
DM16.2 The Council will work with NHS partners to support the provision of new healthcare facilities and improvements to 
existing facilities which provide services important for the  physical health, mental health and g eneral wellbeing  of communities .  
How the policy works 
6.166 Considering health and wellbeing as early as 
possible in to the design of a development presents greater 
opportunities for maximising positive gains, addressing health 
inequalities and mitigating any negative impacts. For example, to 
ensure a positive impact on mental health, developments should 
consider exceeding internal space standards, provide private or 
semi -private open spaces, ensure a sense of privacy for 
residents but also provide opportunities for social interaction and 
should ensure access to natural daylight.  
6.167 Developments can support physical activity, promote 
healthy weights and address health problems associated with 
obesity. This can be done by considering the layout and access to stairwells, ensuring the provision of accessible cycle storage in 
both homes and workplaces and providing changing facilities to 
encourage people to cycle to work. Developments should 
provide quality open spaces, particularly in areas identified as 
being deficie nt, for sport, recreation and play whilst improving 
links to existing spaces and sport facilities. The design of a 
development can also promote access to healthy food 
opportunities by providing food growing opportunities whilst 
protecting existing facilities. 
6.168 Air pollution affects everyone living and working in 
the borough but can have greater impact on children, older 
people and those with heart and respiratory conditions. 
Developments must assess and mitigate the impacts of pollution 
and look for opportunities to improve air quality. Developments  
 187 should also be designed to be energy efficient and well insulated 
to ensure residents are able to live in warm homes and are 
protected against noise pollution. 
6.169 Health Impact Assessments are a tool which can be 
used to assess the impact of development proposals on health 
and wellbeing. They should be used to set out how health and 
wellbeing have been considered during the design of a 
development, how positive impacts have been maximised and 
how any negative impacts have been mitigated, particularly 
where developments are located in the borough’s most deprived 
wards. Health Impact Assessments should be undertaken as 
early in the process as possible to ensure the assessment is 
meaningful and can involve engagement from Croydon Public 
Health and NHS partners.  
6.170 New development in the borough needs to be 
supported by health and social infrastructure to ensure 
communities have access to facilities and services they require 
at every stage of their lives. Facilities should be accessible to all 
and should be easily reached by walking, cycling or public 
transport. The Council will continue to work with NHS partners to 
identify requirements for new facilities to meet the need arising 
from the borough’s growing population. It will support 
improvements to existing facilities and will also work with NHS 
partners to identify opportunities for facilities to come forward as 
part of mixed-use schemes, particularly where there is an 
identified need. The impact of developments on existing 
healthcare facilities should be considered through a Health 
Impact Assessment.

Why we need this policy
6.171 Croydon has compiled a list of Local Designated 
Views of significance for the borough. These include Croydon 
Panoramas that reinforce Croydon’s sense of local place and 
identity and Local Designated Landmarks that assist with way 
finding and contribute to local character of the borough. 
6.172 The Unitary Development Plan Policy UD1 contained 
a list of Views and Landmarks. These have been assessed 
alongside others suggested in the Borough Character Appraisal , 
by Development Management Officers and from the previous 
consultation on the Detailed Policies (Preferred and Alternative 
Options) of the Croydon Local Plan in 2013 and 2015. The 
proposed Views and Landmarks are detailed in Policy SP4 and 
Appendix 5. Policy DM17 details what the Council will consider in 
terms of possible impact of proposed development on the Local 
Designated Views, Croydon Panoramas and Local Designated 
Landmarks.   
 189 Policy DM17: Views and Landmarks 
DM17.1 The Council will consider t he proposed development in relation to its impact on protected Local Designated Views  such that 
developments should not create a crowding effect around, obstruct, or appear too close or high in relation to any Local Desig nated 
Landmarks identified in the L ocal Designated View . 
DM17.2 Developments should enhance Croydon Panorama s as a whole and should  not tightly define the edges of the viewing 
corridors  from the Croydon Panoramas . Developments  should not create a crowding effect around, obstruct, or appear too clo se or high in 
relation to any Local Designated Landmark s identified in the Croydon Panoramas.  
DM17.3 Public access to all viewpoints to Local Designated Views and all Croydon Panoramas should be maintained . 
How the policy works 
6.173 When new development is proposed it should 
consider the effect on a Local Designated View to avoid 
detrimental impact on the quality of the View and ensure it is not 
sited too close to avoid overcrowding the View of a Local 
Designated Landmark. This is considered in the Croydon Local 
Plan Strategic Policy SP4.2 which states that development will 
be required to protect Local Designated Views, Croydon 
Panoramas, the setting of Local Designated Landmarks, other 
important vistas and skylines. 
6.174 The London Plan Policy 7.11 ‘London View 
Management Framework’ is reflected in the Croydon Local Plan 
Strategic Policy SP4.13 which states that the Council and its 
partners will strengthen the protection of and promote 
improvements to local views, Croydon Panoramas and Local 
Designated Landmarks. Paragraph deleted 
6.175 The Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework 
refers to the potential impact of tall buildings on views and 
assessment of impact on the skyline. It identifies townscapes 
along which people have generous views of the Croydon Opportunity Area. Further to this, it identifies the need for 
development to demonstrate that it integrates with and improves 
the local character and, that new buildings will be assessed 
against their impact on these views to ensure they do not result 
in an overbearing wall of development. 
6.176 The Panoramas selected (listed in Appendix 5 ) are 
the wide expansive views of substantial parts of Croydon where 
public access to a view point to view the Panorama should be 
maintained.  
6.177 The important Local Designated Landmarks in the 
views  are noted in the list  of Croydon Panoramas and Local 
Designated Views in Appendix 5 . This policy aligns with the 
London Plan, Policy 7.12.

Why we need this policy
6.178 Croydon has a rich and varied heritage that provides 
depth of character  historic and architectural significance to the 
borough’s environment and a sense of identity and belonging . 
The historic environment contributes to local character and 
distinctiveness and enables an understanding of the pattern of 
historic development of an area. In order to maintain the 
borough’s character, it is vital that heritage assets are protected 
and sensitively adapted and that their setting is not harmed. The 
historic environment is a finite resource and, once lost, cannot be 
replaced.  
6.179 The Council recognises the value of the historic 
environment, especially in relation to the positive contribution it 
can make to creating and maintaining sustainable communities, and considers it to be important to conserve the valued 
components of the borough’s historic environment for the future. 
This view is supported by the National Planning Policy 
Framework (Chapter 12), the London Plan (Chapter 7) and the 
strategic objectives and policies of the Croydon Local Plan. The 
strategic policies state that ‘Croydon needs to ensure protection 
of its heritage assets and their settings, to retain local 
distinctiveness and character’. This is particularly important given 
the context of the significant change that Croydon, in particular 
the Croydon Opportunity Area, has seen in the last century and 
is likely to continue to experience. The Council also supports the 
principles of heritage-led regeneration.  
 191 6.180 This policy seeks to improve the protection afforded 
to heritage assets in the borough. Heritage assets are the valued 
elements of the historic environment and make an important 
contribution to the quality of the borough’s architectural, historic 
and townscape character. A heritage asset is a building, 
monument, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a 
degree of significance meriting consideration in planning 
decisions, because of its heritage interest. Heritage assets can 
be identified in various ways, for example through statutory 
designation as heritage assets of national significance, such as 
Listed Buildings, Conservation Areas, Scheduled Monuments, 
and Registered Historic Parks and Gardens, or through 
designation by the Local Planning Authority, which includes 
Locally Listed Buildings , Local Heritage Areas and Locally Listed 
Historic Parks and Gardens. Heritage assets can also be 
identified through area assessments, master planning or during 
the planning process itself. 
6.181 Through the planning process the Council will 
consider the significance of all sites and areas identified as 
having heritage significance. The Council will monitor proposed 
removals and additions to the established lists of heritage assets 
as and when appropriate. The Council will continue to make 
information relating to heritage assets available to view on the 
Croydon Council website. There is the opportunity to further 
designate conservation areas across the borough to protect 
areas of particular special architectural or historic interest for 
future generations to enjoy.  
6.182 Heritage assets may be nationally or locally 
designated, or undesignated non designated: the reason for their 
being identified is their special interest. This may be historic, 
architectural, artistic, or archaeological and these are the 
attributes that make up their unique quality or significance.  6.183 The setting of a heritage asset is defined in the 
glossary of the National Planning Policy Framework as ‘the 
surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent 
is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings 
evolve.’   
 192 6.184 This policy addresses detailed issues that relate to 
the detailed application of the Strategic Policies to heritage 
assets in the borough and fulfils the aim outlined in strategic 
Policy SP4 to strengthen the protection afforded to heritage 
assets in the borough. 
6.185 The National Planning Policy Framework paragraph 
126 states that ‘local planning authorities should set out in their 
Local Plan a positive strategy for the conservation and 
enjoyment of the historic environment’. Paragraph deleted  
6.186 The London Plan Policy 7.8G states that boroughs 
should ‘include appropriate policies in their LDFs for identifying, protecting, enhancing and improving access to the historic 
environment and heritage assets and their settings where 
appropriate, and to archaeological assets, memorials and historic 
and natural landscape character within their area’. Paragraph 
deleted. 
6.187 The Croydon Local Plan 2018 provides general 
policies SP4.11 to SP4.15 that relate to the historic environment. 
However, there is a ne ed to provide detailed policy on specific 
issues in order to provide additional policy protection to the 
borough’s heritage assets and to enable the Council to meet its 
statutory duties. 
Policy DM18: Heritage assets and conservation 
DM18.1 To preserve and enhance the charact er, appearance and setting of heritage assets within the borough, the Council will 
determine all development proposals that affect heritage assets in accordance with the following:  
a) Development affecting heritage assets will only be permitted if their signi ficance is preserved or enhanced;  
b) Proposals for development will only be permitted if they enhance the setting of the heritage asset affected or have no advers e impact 
on the existing setting;  
c) Proposals for changes of use should retain the significance of a building and will be supported only if they are necessary to keep the 
building in active use;  and 
d) Where there is evidence of intentional damage or deliberate neglect to a heritage asset, its current condition will not be ta ken into 
account in the decisio n-making process . 
DM18.2 Applications for development proposals that affect heritage assets or their setting must demonstrate:  
a) How particular attention has been paid to scale, height, massing, historic building lines, the pattern of historic developmen t, use, 
design, detailing and materials;  
b) That it is of a high quality design that integrates with and makes a positive contribution to the historic environment; and  
c) How the integrity and significance of any retained fabric is preserved.   
 193 DM18.3 To preserve and enhance List ed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and Registered Parks and Gardens within the borough, the 
Council will determine all development proposals that affect these heritage assets in accordance with the following:  
a) Substantial harm to or loss of a Grade II Listed  Building or Registered Park and Garden should be exceptional;  
b) Substantial harm to or loss of a Grade I or II* Listed Building or a Scheduled Monument should be wholly exceptional; and  
c) All alterations and extensions should enhance the character, features a nd setting of the building or monument and must not adversely 
affect the asset’s significance.  
DM18.4 To preserve and  enhance the character, appearance and setting of Conservation Areas within the borough, the Council will 
determine all development proposals tha t affect Conservation Areas in accordance with the following:  
a) The demolition of a building that makes a positive contribution to the special character and appearance of a Conservation Are a will be 
treated as substantial harm;  
b) Where the demolition of a buil ding in a Conservation Area is considered to be acceptable, permission for its demolition will only be 
granted subject to conditions linking demolition to the implementation of an approved redevelopment scheme; and  
c) All proposals for development must have r egard to the development principles in the Conservation Area General Guidance 
Supplementary Planning Document  and Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan Supplementary Planning Documents  or 
equivalent.  
DM18.5 To preserve and enhance the character, appeara nce and setting of Locally Listed Buildings within the borough, the Council will 
determine all development proposals that affect Locally Listed Buildings in accordance with the following:  
a) Substantial weight will be given to preserving and enhancing Locally  Listed Buildings; where demolition is proposed, it should be 
demonstrated that all reasonable attempts have been made to retain all or part of the building;  
b) All alterations and extensions should enhance the building’s character, setting and features and m ust not adversely affect the 
significance of the building; and  
c) All proposals for development must have regard to Croydon’s Local List of Buildings of Historic or Architectural Importance 
Supplementary Planning Document  or equivalent.   
 194 DM18.6 To preserve and enhanc e the character, appearance and setting of Local Heritage Areas within the borough, the Council will 
determine all development proposals that affect a Local Heritage Area in accordance with the following:  
a) Substantial weight will be given to protecting and enhancing buildings, townscape and landscape features that make a positive 
contribution to the special character and appearance of a Local Heritage Area; and  
b) All proposals for development must have regard to the development principles in the Conservation A rea General Guidance 
Supplementary Planning Document  and the Local Heritage Area evidence base.  
DM18.7 Substantial weight will be given to conserving and enhancing landscape features or planting that makes a positive contribution 
to the special historic character  and original layout of Registered and Locally Listed Historic Parks and Gardens.  
DM18.8 All development proposals must preserve and enhance War Memorials and other monuments, and their settings.  
DM18.9 In consultation with the Greater London Archaeological Advisory Se rvice, or equivalent authority, the Council will require the 
necessary level of investigation and recording for development proposals that affect, or have the potential to affect Croydon ’s archaeological 
heritage. Remains of archaeological importance, whet her scheduled or not, should be protected in situ or, if this is not possible, excavated 
and removed as directed by the Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service or equivalent authority.  
How the policy works 
6.188 While the Council recognises that many non-
designated heritage assets do not benefit from statutory 
protection, the Council will seek to protect all heritage assets 
from demolition due to their national or local historic and 
architectural significance and the contribution they make to the 
borough’s townscape character. The Council will seek to retain 
original features and detailing present on buildings and ensure 
that alterations and extensions to historic buildings are carried 
out in a manner that does not harm their significance and 
respects the scale, character, detailing and materials of the 
original building and area. Proposals that include the 
reinstatement of significant lost architectural or landscape 
features or the removal or harmful alterations, where this can be demonstrably undertaken without harm to the significance of the 
heritage asset, will be supported in principle. 
6.189 In addition to the collective value of buildings and 
their relationship to each other, the character of Conservation 
Areas and Local Heritage Areas may be defined by the wider 
townscape, land uses, public realm, open spaces, road layout or 
landscaped areas. This character can be relatively consistent or 
in larger areas may contain several ‘character areas’ within the 
Conservation Area or Local Heritage Area. In addition to 
protecting individual buildings the Council will ensure that the 
wider character of an area is protected and enhanced. 
6.190 All planning applications submitted that relate to 
heritage assets should include a description of the significance of 
the heritage asset affected and analysis of the resultant impact of  
 195 the development on the heritage asset and its setting. The level 
of detail of this statement should be proportionate to the 
significance of the asset affected and will, if necessary, be 
directed by the Council.  
6.191 All development that relates directly to heritage 
assets or affects their setting must be of a high quality design 
that enhances their special character. New development will be 
discouraged from copying existing buildings but rather must be 
informed by and well integrated with the established character 
and heritage significance of the area.  
6.192 Development will be encouraged to enhance the 
setting of heritage assets, or at the very least not have any 
adverse impact on the current setting. In some cases there may 
be opportunities to better reveal the setting of heritage assets; 
however this must not have adverse impacts on local character 
or other heritage assets.  
6.193 Historic buildings should be maintained in their 
original use wherever possible unless fully justified by 
demonstration that this is necessary to secure its long term 
future viability. Where a proposed change of use is fully justified, 
it should be demonstrated how the building’s original fabric and 
character is to be preserved.  
6.194 Historic landscapes, including Registered and 
Locally Listed Historic Parks and Gardens may have interest 
from their age, connection with historic buildings, events or 
people, presence of ornamental features and artefacts, style of 
layout, or work of an important designer. The Council will ensure 
that Historic Parks and Gardens are not adversely affected by 
new development.  
6.195 Croydon’s archaeological heritage comprises of both 
above and below ground remains, previously identified through individual finds, evidence of previous settlements and standing 
structures. At present, approximately a quarter of the borough is 
covered by archaeological priority areas, which are areas that 
have a high likelihood of archaeological significance. Due to its 
nature, much of the borough’s archaeological heritage is likely to 
have been undiscovered and as a result is very sensitive. If a site 
is identified as having potential archaeological significance 
applicants will be required to undertake an archaeological desk-
based assessment and, if necessary, a field investigation. Any 
discovered archaeological remains will be required to either be 
preserved in situ or through a programme of excavation, 
recording, publication and archiving, undertaken by an 
archaeological organisation approved by the Council, prior to the 
commencement of any development. The Council will consult 
with and follow the guidance of the Greater London 
Archaeological Advisory Service, or equivalent authority, on the 
archaeological implications of development proposals.  
6.196 Where development proposals affect heritage 
assets, the submission of a full planning application will be 
sought as opposed to an outline planning application, unless the 
Local Planning Authority has sufficient comfort that the level of 
detail submitted will ensure that the proposed development will 
preserve or enhance the affected asset or assets.  
6.197 The Council supports the principle of improving 
physical and virtual access and improved interpretation of the 
historic significance of to historic buildings but will ensure that 
works undertaken to achieve this are done so in the most 
creative manner possible and that any harm to significance is 
minimised and outweighed by the public benefit of securing 
access .  
6.198 The Council will maintain the ‘Heritage at Risk 
Regist er’, which is managed by Historic England, and monitors 
the condition of heritage assets where possible. If deemed  
 196 appropriate, the Council will exercise its legal powers to ensure 
that essential maintenance of designated heritage assets is 
undertaken. The Council will seek to work with partners to secure 
creative solutions that would contribute positively to local 
character and vitality. 
6.199 When, in exceptional circumstances, a heritage 
asset cannot be retained, the development will be required to 
conduct a full recording survey (including photographs) and 
deposit the information in the Croydon Local Studies Library and 
Archives Centre. This should be secured through a planning 
condition. This is in addition to the recording requirements 
imposed in respect of the loss of nationally significant designated 
heritage assets.

 197 7. Community Facilities 
Strategic policy 
Where we are now 
7.1 The main issues for the provision of community facilities and 
education facing Croydon are that: 
 An increasing population will put more pressure on existing 
community facilities and is likely to require the provision of more. 
 Over time the types of community facilities provided will need to 
change to reflect demographic change – the population becoming 
older and more ethnically diverse, more people living alone and 
changing lifestyles.  
 There are, and will be changes to public policy on service 
provision and co-location of services. 
 There will be a need to accommodate 1,900 extra burials in 
Croydon by 2031 10,000 interments  in the borough. 
Where we want to be 
Strategic Objective 4 : Reduce social, economic and 
environmental deprivation, particularly where it is spatially 
concentrated, by taking priority measures to reduce 
unemployment, improve skills and education and renew housing, 
community and environme ntal conditions.  
Strategic Objective 6 : Provide and promote well designed 
emergency services, community, education, health and leisure 
facilities to meet the aspirations and needs of a diverse 
community.  
Strategic Objective 7  Conserve and create spaces a nd buildings 
that foster safe, healthy and cohesive communities.  Strategic Objective 8: Improve accessibility, connectivity, 
sustainability and ease of movement to, from and within the 
borough.   
 198 How we are going to get there 
SP5.1  The Council will have a  presumption in favour of new development  provided it is in accord with Policy SP5 and other applicable 
policies of the development plan . and it  Development that provides for contributes to  the provision of infrastructure and community 
facilities to meet t he needs of the borough will be supported in appropriate locations . through Community Infrastructure Levy and 
planning obligations requirements . 
Health and wellbeing  
SP5.2  The Council and its partners will create and safeguard  opportunities  Opportunities for healthy, fulfilling and active lifestyles will be 
created and safeguarded by: 
 Working in partnership with the health authorities to improve health in Croydon;  
 Ensuring new developments provide opportunity for healthy living by the encouragement of walki ng and cycling, good housing design, 
sufficient open space and opportunity for recreation and sound safety standards;  
 Improving education facilities and skills training in Croydon and encouraging life -long learning;  and 
 Promoting the growth and expansion o f further and higher education to improve skills and act as a driver of growth and enterprise in 
the local economy.  
SP5.3 The Council and its partners will encourage the creation of healthy and liveable neighbourhoods by:  
a) Ensuring the provision of a network of  community facilities, providing essential public services; and  
b) Protecting existing community facilities that still serve, or have the ability to serve, the needs of the community.  
Providing new community facilities  
SP5.4 The pattern, scale and quality of commun ity and education facilities will be adjusted:  
a) To meet the evolving needs of the community ; 
b) To improve service provision ; and   
 199 c) To support housing and employment growth . 
SP5.5 Community facilities will be well designed and located so as to be accessible to all se ctions of the community where they provide an 
on-site service. The Council and its partners will encourage and plan for the co -location of services where this provides convenience to the 
user and resource efficiency and can be achieved in a timely way. Det ailed location and site allocation policies are set out in the  Detailed 
Policies and Proposals of the Croydon Local Plan . 
SP5.6 The Council will support and enable the provision and improvement of places of worship. Criteria for can be found in Policy DM19.2 . 
SP5.7 The Council will support the temporary occupation of empty buildings and cleared sites for community uses where they contribu te to 
regeneration and enhance the character of the area.  
Burial space  
SP5.8 The Council will  plan and provide additional space for burials. The site or sites will be selected through a study and should meet the 
following criteria : 
a) Meet burial needs until at least 2031 and be of sufficient size for that purpose;  
b) Be suitable for burial of all group s and faiths;  
c) Be accessible to all sections of the community; and

Education and skills  
SP5.9 The Council will support investment in the improvement and expansion of primary and s econdary schools and special schools to meet 
the needs of the community and its growing population.  
SP5.10 The Council will support investment in new schools by identifying sites for new sc hools in the Croydon Local Plan . 
SP5.11 Children’s Centres and pre -school facilit ies will be provided, enhanced and updated in alignment with the growing population.   
 200 SP5.12 The Council will support the growth and improvement of further and higher education in the borough and in particular seek to 
bring a university or 'multiversity' to Croydo n. Subject to p rogress , the Croydon Local Plan will define a campus location at a suitable site 
with high public transport accessibility.  
SP5.13 The Council will seek to encourage the new university/multiversity to be a centre for innovation, enterprise and assoc iated 
employment.  
SP5.14 The Council will support skills training and further education of residents by modernising and enhancing the quality of libra ries, 
assisting home learning and training at work, and supporting adult education and training.  
SP5.15 The Council will  work with higher and further education services to better provide for the needs of employment and life 
enhancement training.   
 201 Why we have taken this approach 
7.2 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 
infrastructure provision is part of planning for prosperity. New 
housing, employment and other development brings with it 
additional requirements for community facilities. Government 
policy has enabled Councils to raise resources in support of social 
infrastructure through a Community Infrastructure Levy and 
through planning obligation agreements. Evidence of the needs for 
additional infrastructure is provided in the accompanying 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan and will be further specified in the 
Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL). This policy, as a first step, 
specifies the principle that Croydon will use a CIL to aid the 
funding of community infrastructure. 
Health and wellbeing 
7.3 The Local Plan has a role to play in  creating opportunities for 
healthier and more active lifestyles is part of evolving national 
policy, recently reaffirmed in the Government’s White Paper on 
which contribute to better  public health. The creation of 
opportunities requires local action jointly between the health, care 
and local planning authorities. Croydon’s Sustainable Community 
Strategy endorses the need for people to have an active healthy 
lifestyle to increase independence and healthy life expectancy to 
help people stay healthy and independent so that they can 
improve their own health and wellbeing. 
7.4 Creating a safe home and physical environment whilst 
encouraging physical exercise will have a positive impact on the 
physical and mental health of residents, workers and visitors to 
Croydon.  7.5 London and borough policies all seek to improve the 
education, training and skills levels of the population to improve 
their quality of life, increase life-long opportunities for employment 
and to improve the competitiveness of national, regional, and local 
economies. Local strategic policy is required to embed these 
educational, training and skills objectives into sustainable spatial 
development in Croydon. 
7.6 Croydon’s level of skills at degree level and above is now less 
than the London average. It is a disincentive to inward investment 
for high knowledge industry and investment. To overcome these 
deficiencies and to increase opportunities for degree level 
education and enhanced training for skills, the expansion of higher 
and further education is to be encouraged. In particular, the 
attraction of a university or complex of university facilities to 
Croydon is seen as important and was envisaged in the ‘We are 
Croydon’ Vision. This will require in time the expansion of existing 
colleges and the provision of a new university complex in or near 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre. The London Plan identifies Croydon 
Opportunity Area as a Strategic Outer London Development 
Centre for higher education. 
7.7 Local planning authorities are asked to ensure that 
infrastructure is provided in support of existing and growing 
communities. Modern society needs a wide range and network of 
facilities provided locally to support the population in its health, 
safety, sport, leisure, education and meeting place needs. The 
precise needs of these services vary but an essential requirement 
is that they are located so as to be reasonably accessible to the 
diverse population they serve.  
 202 7.8 The pattern and extent of existing health facilities, schools and 
colleges, indoor and outdoor leisure, libraries, halls and of schools 
and Children's’ Centres is described in the accompanying 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. The pattern of service provision will 
need to change over time to reflect changing needs caused by 
demographic change (aging, more people living alone, more 
children, a more ethnically diverse population and changing 
lifestyles). Additionally the process of growth creates service 
pressures for more public service outlets in the community. The 
policy gives positive support for physical changes to 
accommodate more and improved community facilities.  
7.9 The expected growth in the borough's population means 
complementary community facilities will be required. In addition to 
seeking opportunities to provide new facilities, the Council will 
protect existing community facilities where they still serve, or have 
the ability to serve the needs of the community. The community 
facilities are largely outlined in the Croydon Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan. The needs of the community evolve, for example the 
borough’s public houses have come under considerable pressure 
in recent years and are now considered a community facility. 
Whereas the borough has an over provision of care homes, 
residential homes and nursing homes, so these are no longer 
considered a community facility to be protected by policy.  
7.10 Provision and ease of access to health and community 
facilities have positive impacts on wellbeing and healthcare. Such 
facilities need to be accessible to all sections of the community, 
including those without a car, the disabled or others with social, 
economic or physical characteristics limiting their mobility. Where 
possible services will be co-located so as to enable multi-purpose 
trips, reduce the need to travel and for the convenience of the 
user. Additionally, the service providers through co-location will be 
able to share spaces and services and to reduce capital and revenue costs. This policy is supported by Policy SP8 (Transport 
and Communication). 
7.11 Public satisfaction with local neighbourhoods increases with 
ready access to sport and leisure facilities. Likewise the probability 
of people enjoying an active and healthy lifestyle increases with 
access to leisure and sporting facilities. 
Providing new community facilities 
7.12 Croydon has a wide range of faith groups, many of which for 
demographic and other reasons are growing and in need of new 
or expanded accommodation both for worship and for associated 
education, social and assembly needs. The Council will, as a 
general principle, enable development of this nature at appropriate 
and accessible locations. Detailed policy on this is specified in the 
Croydon Local Plan ’s Detailed Policies and Proposals. 
7.13 The extensive need for community facilities, together with 
pressure on public and voluntary sector resources requires that 
resources are used carefully. Empty buildings and premises offer 
a low cost, if temporary, source of supply for some community 
facilities to commence their function pending a more permanent 
solution. Not all empty buildings will be suitable for community 
uses, for example where there is a shortage of parking or they are 
adjacent to noise sensitive uses. A policy to encourage temporary 
uses can enhance the public realm to help build social cohesion, 
support cultural diversity and engender a sense of safety and 
belonging. 
Burial Grounds 
7.14 A burial needs study on behalf of the borough shows a need 
to accommodate 10,000 deaths interments  by 2031  with a 
resultant need for 1,900 new burial spaces . The London Plan 
urges boroughs to consider supplying burial grounds close to the  
 203 communities they serve. The criteria for site selection is identified 
in the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals. 
Education and skills 
7.15 The quality of educational facilities needs continual renewal 
and improvement to meet modern standards. Additionally, the 
educational estate needs to be expanded to meet the 
requirements arising from housing and demographic growth and to 
fulfil the objectives of Croydon's Sustainable Community Strategy . 
This will require both the expansion of existing schools and the 
provision of new schools . The latest pupil projections indicate tha t 
there are sufficient primary school places across the majority of 
the borough to accommodate the planned growth up until 2026. 
Projections suggest that two new primary schools may be 
required, one to serve the Croydon Opportunity Area and another 
in the Purley/Coulsdon area after 2026. Two sites have been 
allocated to meet this projected need; Allocation 201 and 
Allocation 490. Any long-term future need for primary school 
places in the south of the borough will be taken into account in the 
review of this plan. Currently, the growth in the Purley Way 
Transformation Area is not projected to create a need for 
additional primary school places due to over-capacity within the 
existing schools in the area. The majority of the planned housing 
developments in the Purley Way Transformation Area are due to 
be delivered after 2026. To safeguard against a future rise in 
demand for primary school places, a site has been allocated in the 
Purley Way Transformation Area for a new 2FE primary school. 
Pupil projections suggest that the borough currently has enough 
secondary school places to meet the demand from the proposed 
housing numbers for the next 5-10 years. Any additional need for 
secondary school places in the south of the borough will be 
accommodated in the proposed school on the Heath Clark site 
and the existing site on Duppas Hill where St. Andrews CE High 
School (owned by the Diocese of Southwark, with Croydon Council only owning the playing field) was located. This is further 
described in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Sites for additional 
schools will be identified in the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed 
Policies and Proposals 
7.16 The Council has a demographic model and methodology to 
estimate the need for form expansion in the state sector which is 
described in more detail in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 
7.17 The needs of children with learning difficulties or behavioural 
problems also requires physical improvement and expansion with 
more children educated close to home in the borough rather than 
further afield. Specialist provision is thus required in both existing 
and in special schools . New sites will be identified in the second 
part of the plan period based on an updated Special Education 
Needs Estate strategy. The current Special Education Needs 
Strategy meets the need for the next 5 to 10 years.  
7.18 Croydon Council has recently provided 26 Children’s 
Centres in line with current requirements. Over the period of the 
Plan these centres will need to be renewed and adapted to meet 
changing pre-school needs. At the same time housing growth will 
bring additional demands and in due course call for expansion of 
Children’s Centres or other pre-school facilities. The principle of 
such expansion and adaptation is established in this policy. 
7.19 Universities and university sites with multiple university 
representation (multiversities), have a track record for innovation 
and technical developments, many of which have commercial 
applications. There are now institutions offering university grade 
education in the borough One purpose for establishing a 
University or multiversity in Croydon is to provide ing the 
opportunity for the direct application of new technologies in young 
and growing enterprises. For this reason, Policy SP5.13  The  
 204 policy establishes in principle that university presence in Croydon 
should be in a form and in a place with space and opportunity for 
there to be adjoining centre(s) of innovation.  
7.20 In a fast changing world, the skills needed for employment 
and wider knowledge, require constant informal and formal 
learning throughout life. The Council, as part of its effort to raise 
the quality of life for its residents, will continue to support this 
process through the work of the Adult Learning and Training 
Service, the provision of a central and hub libraries of an 
improving standard and through partnership with the higher 
education colleges. The end result is to give opportunities for and 
to stimulate life-long learning, as envisaged in Croydon’s 
Sustainable Community Strategy.

Why we need this policy
7.21 The National Planning Policy Framework in paragraph 69 
states that the The planning system can play an important role in 
facilitating social interaction and creating healthy, inclusive 
communities. The Council recognises the benefits of a healthy 
community and with the expected growth in the borough’s 
population, existing community facilities that serve their current 
and future needs should be retained and new facilities provided. 
7.22 Croydon's population, as it grows, will put increasing 
pressure on community facilities. Consequently, a changing 
approach towards locating services and facilities is needed, 
especially to ensure they are provided in sustainable locations. 
7.23 The London Plan Policy 3.16 cites requires the protection 
and enhancement of social infrastructure which includes 
community uses and encourages London boroughs to ensure 
that London’s diverse communities’ social infrastructure needs 
are met develop policies to protect these uses.  
 206 Policy DM19: Providing and protecting community facilities  
DM19.1 The Council will permit the loss of existing community facilities where:  
a) It can be demonstrated that there is no need for the existing premises or land for a community use and that it no longer has the ability to 
serve the needs of the community;  
b) The existing use is located on the ground floor within a Main  Retail Frontage,  a Secondary Retail Frontage , a Shopping Parade or a 
Restaurant Quarter Parade; or  
c) Community facilities for a specific end user  (either on site or off site as part of a comprehensive redevelopment) that meet current or 
future needs are provided.  
DM19.2 The Cou ncil will support applications for community use where the proposals:  
a) Include buildings which are flexible, adaptable, capable of multi -use and, where possible, enable future expansion;  
b) Comply with the criteria for D1 class  community uses in industrial loc ations set out in Table 5.13; 
c) Are accessible to local shopping facilities, healthcare, other community services and public transport or provides a community us e in 
a location and of a type that is designed to meet the needs of a particular client group; and 
d) Are for a use that is a town centre use, as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework, are located within Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre or a District or Local Centre, have no more than 280m2 of floor space (net) and are in the vicinity of a Neighbourhood 
Centre, or are a change of use of an existing unit in a Shopping Parade.  
How the policy works 
Protection of existing community facilities 
7.24 Proposals involving the loss of a community facility may 
comply with the policy by: 
 Explain ing why the current use is no longer needed if the 
building/site is occupied;  and 
 Show ing that the loss would not create, or add to, a 
shortfall in provision of floor  space/sites for the existing 
community use by providing details o f a marketing exercis e 
that meets the criteria below  or provide a replacement  
community facility for a specific end user either on site as part 
of a mixed use development or elsewhere on a site with no 
current community use.   
 207 7.25 The marketing exercise associated with this evidence 
should be for a minimum period of eighteen months. Space 
should be offered at a reasonable charge for community 
groups/voluntary sector organisations reflecting its existing use 
value unfettered by any hope value. In the event that a 
community facility is listed on the Assets of Community Value 
register and is offered for sale, the local community is given six 
months to prepare a bid to buy it. In such circumstances, the 
marketing statement could be reduced to a period of a minimum 
continuous period of twelve months in addition to  the six months 
that the community has to prepare a bid to buy it.  
7.26 Developments subject to this policy may include proposals 
involving the loss of an existing profit-making community use 
(such as a private gym or cinema). These could submit evidence 
to demonstrate that the existing community use is not financially 
viable and so no longer has the ability to serve the needs of the 
community. 
7.27 In cases where a community use ceases, it has to be 
successfully demonstrated that there is no local need or demand 
for alternative community uses . 
7.28 Policy DM 19.1(b) removes the protection of community 
facilities located in Main Retail Frontages, Secondary Retail 
Frontages, Shopping Parades and Restaurant Quarter Parades 
as these are locations where Class A E (Commercial, Business 
and Service) uses are the preferred uses. Policies DM 4, DM6 
and DM7 permit the extension and change of use of units in 
these designations  (with the exception that change of use is not 
permitted in Main Retail Frontages) . In order to allow any unit 
converted to a community use in one of these location to revert 
to a Class A E (Commercial, Business and Service) use, the 
protection of community use does not apply within one of these 
designations. As Policies DM4, DM6 and DM7 permit the change 
of use of units in these designations to a community use there should be a supply of units within the same area to replace a lost 
community use if needed. The aim to retain an end user is to 
ensure that no existing function is lost. The replacement or 
consolidated community facility should meet the current and 
future needs of what the site provides already. An inventory of 
current uses needs to be submitted along with the application, 
which should provide a schedule of how these uses will be 
accommodated in the proposed premises alongside other uses. 
However, if a particular function/tenant no longer wishes to 
operate, then the space has to be open to alternative groups of 
the same function or new community uses, by way of marketing. 
Proposals for new community facilities 
7.29 The use of a building and the needs of communities can 
change over time. Therefore, new community facilities should be 
designed to be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances 
including being capable of multi-use and expansion.  
7.30 New community facilities should be located so that they are 
close to schools, local shopping facilities and public transport 
and other community services to reduce the number of trips 
people need to make to access them. However, it is 
acknowledged that the re may be circumstances where the needs 
of a particular group or client base mean that it that it does not 
need to be located close to other services. In such instances 
applications would need to be supported with informatio n 
demonstrating how the lack of access to other services will not 
have a negative impact on the end users of the new community 
facility and the amenity of the surrounding area .  
 208 Supporting Selhurst Park as the home stadium of Crystal Palace Football Club 
Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies 
 Strategic Obj ective 1  
Why we need this policy
7.31 Selhurst Park has been home to Crystal Palace Football 
Club since 1924. 
7.32 The Council recognises the existing role that Crystal Palace 
Football Club has in the community identifying it as a large scale 
community and leisure facility that continues to make a 
significant contribution to local area regeneration, creating 
opportunities for people to share a sense of pride in where they 
live, as well as delivering initiatives that support community 
cohesion and facilitate greater social inclusion. 
Policy DM20: Supporting Selhurst Park as the home stadium of Crystal Palace Football Club  
The Council will continue to support Selhurst Park as the home stadium of Crystal Palace Football Club and ensure that any 
redevelopment would enhance the club’s position with a football stadium which makes a significant contribution to the Borough . 
How the policy works 
7.33 The presence of a major Football Club within Croydon 
brings many economic, social and cultural benefits. It is therefore 
important to protect the facilities that are considered necessary 
for the retention of such a club. 
7.34 London Plan policy 4.6 provides support for the continued 
success of professional sporting enterprises and the cultural, social and economic benefits that they offer to residents, workers 
and visitors. 
 209 Protecting public houses  
Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies 
 Strategic Objective 6  
 Policy SP5  
Why we need this policy
7.35 The National Planning Policy Framework in paragraph 69 
states that the planning system can play an important role in 
facilitating social interaction and creating healthy, inclusive 
communities . The loss of public houses over recent years has 
increased due to rising property values. The importance of public 
houses as a community asset has been acknowledged through 
the National Planning Policy Framework which requires local 
authorities to ‘plan positively’ for such uses. There is also a body 
of evidence produced by organisations such as CAMRA (The 
Campaign for Real Ale), the All Party Parliamentary Beer Group 
and the Institute for Public Policy Research which also supports  
this view. 
7.36 The Institute of Public Policy Research’s ‘The Social Value 
of Community Pubs’ details the social and community importance of public houses and their importance as hubs for 
development of social networks. It notes the significant long term 
consequences and associated costs for communities with a lack 
of social infrastructure which can support the wellbeing of 
individuals and communities. In May 2013 CAMRA advised that 
public house losses had been running at 26 per week in the six 
months to March 2013.  
7.37 The London Plan Policy 3.16  HC7 cites the protection and 
enhancement o f social infrastructure which can include of public 
houses and encourages London boroughs to develop policies to 
as part of London’s built, social and cultural heritage as they are 
the hubs of social gatherings protect public houses  as a 
community asset.  
Policy DM21: Protecting public houses  
The Council will not grant planning permission for the demolition or change of use of a public house  which displays the characteristics of a 
community pub such as : 
 Space for organised : social events such as pub quizzes, darts com petitions, pool leagues ; 
 Meeting rooms, performance spaces, room for hire(appropriately sound proofed) ; 
 Ancillary facil ities (skittles alley, children’s play area ); and  
 Associated  clubs and teams ;  
 210 Unless : 
 The loss of the public house would not result in a shortfall of local public house provision of this type;  
 That the public house is no longer considered economically viable when considered against the CAMRA’s Public House Viability Test; 
and that a range of measures  have been undertaken to seek to improve viability  including  (but not restricted to ): 
 Hosting quiz nights,  craft fairs, live music or comedy ; 
 Food offer diversification ; 
 Providing B&B Accommodation ; 
 Renting out space  for meetings, classes or community events ; 
 Maintenance, repair and visual impro vements ; and  
 Varied opening hours ; and  
The public house has been marketed as a public house, at a market rate for public houses, for a consistent period of 18 24 months.  
 
How the policy works 
7.38 Public houses play an important role at the heart of many 
local communities. In many cases they have historically provided 
social hubs and make a positive contribution to townscape and 
local identity. A defined need can be demonstrated by the 
submission of a marketing statement for a period of eighteen  24 
months and consideration against CAMRA’s viability 
assessment. Other criteria which would be consider edations 
would include sustained and documented evidence of local 
objections to the loss of the public house and the public house 
being used for a wider variety of ancillary uses such as functions, 
social events and other community activities.  
7.39 Public houses can provide an important role in promoting 
community cohesion and can offer opportunities for people from 
different walks of like to mix. They are more than just a place to 
relax and drinks; they can host events, clubs and provide 
informal meeting spaces for local interest groups. In 2012 the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) report on Pubs and 
Places found that 23% of pub goers had made friends in their 
local public house with people “they would not normally mix 
with”. Supporting such industries is particularly important given 
the importance of the food and drinks industry to Croydon. As a 
consequence, the Council will protect Public Houses as long as 
their benefit to the community can be justified.  
7.40 The Council will resist the loss of these facilities unless it 
can be demonstrated that is no longer required in its current use. 
Evidence will be required to show that the loss would not create, 
or add to, a shortfall in provision for the public house and 
demonstrate that there is no demand for such a use on the site. 
This would include the submission of evidence of suitable 
marketing activity for a period of eighteen 24 months. In the 
event that a public house is listed on the Assets of Community 
Value register and is offered for sale, the local community is 
given six months to prepare a bid to buy it. In such 
circumstances, the marketing statement could be reduced to a  
 211 period of a minimum continuous period of twelve eighteen 
months in addition to the six months that the community has to 
prepare a bid to buy it. This evidence should demonstrate that 
the existing use is no longer financially viable through the 
submission of financial evidence. Marketing details need to 
include a site description, photographs and reasonable terms 
commensurate with public house use. In cases where a public 
house use has ceased it has to be successfully demonstrated 
that there is no local need or demand.

Why we need this policy
7.41 In 2012 Croydon had less than two years supply of burial 
space remaining in its cemeteries within the borough and at 
Greenlawns Memorial Park in Tandridge district and Bandon Hill 
Cemetery in the London Borough of Sutton. Planning permission 
to extend Greenlawn Memorial Park, a council owned cemetery 
in Warlingham was obtained in January 2020 . 
7.42 A planning application was made to Tandridge District 
Council to extend the existing burial ground at Greenlawns 
Memorial Park following consideration of all known options within 
the London Borough of Croydon itself. The planning application 
was refused and the refusal was upheld upon appeal. In 2010, the Council commissioned a study for future requirements of 
burial ground and the recommendations estimated that a need 
for 10,000 interments was required for the period up to 2031 . 
7.43 Therefore, Croydon needs to find an alternative site for a 
new burial ground and a policy is proposed to guide the search 
for a site and to help determine any subsequent planning 
application. 
7.44 The Burial Land Need and Provision Study identifies that 
space needs to be found for 1,900 burial spaces in the borough 
up to 2031. paragraph deleted  
Policy DM22: Providing for cemeteries and burial grounds 
The Council will support applications for new cemeteries and burial grounds  where the proposals : 
a) Have good means of access from roads and are near bus routes or other transport nodes;  
b) Are located in areas of with no  risk of flooding from all potential sources of flooding;  
c) Are not located in a Groundwater Source Protection Zone; and 
d) Would not have unacceptable adverse impact on the biodiversity of the borough; and  
 213 e) Are not located in Metropolitan Green Belt or on Metro politan Open Land , unless it has been demonstrated that there are no suitable 
sites that are not in Metropolitan Green Belt or on Metropolitan Open Land, there is no impact on openness and existing provi sion of 
public access is maintained.  Paragraph delete d 
How the policy works 
7.45 A new cemetery or burial ground needs to be well accessed 
from roads and bus routes or other transport nodes in order to be 
accessible for residents of the borough to visit and attend to 
gravestones. 
7.46 Cemeteries and burial grounds would be particularly 
adversely affected by flooding. Therefore, they must not be 
located in areas of flood risk (from any source of flooding) . 
Applications will be refused if there is any risk of flooding to the 
site irrespective of whether a sequential test demonstrates that 
there are no other suitable sites within the borough. 
7.47 They also have a greater potential to contaminate 
groundwater supplies. Groundwater provides a third of our 
drinking water in England and Wales, and it also maintains the 
flow in many rivers. In some areas of Southern England, 
groundwater supplies up to 80% tap water. It is crucial that these 
supplies and sources are looked after and ensure that tap water 
is completely safe to drink. The Environment Agency has defined 
Groundwater Source Protection Zones for groundwater sources 
such as wells, boreholes and springs used for public drinking 
water supply. These zones show the risk of contamination from 
any activities that might cause pollution in the area. The closer 
the activity, the greater the risk. Maps are available from the 
Environment Agency (on their website) showing the extent of 
Groundwater Source Protection Zones in Croydon.  
7.48 The National Planning Policy Framework lists facilities for 
cemeteries as potentially being acceptable in Green Belt. However, the presumption is that this is for existing cemeteries 
and that new cemeteries and burial grounds need to 
demonstrate exceptional circumstances before being permitted 
in Green Belt (and by default, Metropolitan Open 
Land). Paragraph deleted  
7.49 Therefore, a new cemetery or burial ground will only be 
permitted in Metropolitan Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land 
if it has first been demonstrated that there are no suitable sites 
outside of Metropolitan Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land. 
These sites do not have to be within the borough boundary of 
Croydon. Furthermore   aAny ancillary facilities associated with a 
new cemetery or burial ground must be kept to a minimum so 
that there is no impact on openness of Metropolitan Green Belt 
or Metropolitan Open Land. Existing public access to any site in 
Metropolitan Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land must also be 
maintained.

climate change up to 2036 are: 
 Climate change is a global issue with impacts that are felt 
most acutely at the local level in terms of more extreme 
weather, including hotter summers and periods of heavy 
rainfall. 
 There is a Council target to be carbon neutral of a 34% 
reduction in carbon emissions  in Croydon by 2030 25.  
 25% of the heat and power used in London must be generat ed 
through the use of localised decentralised energy systems by 
2025. 
 Croydon is ranked the 4th settlement in England most 
susceptible to surface water flooding. 
 The London Plan sets a target for the capital to become 
100% 85% self-sufficient in managing waste by 202 60. 
 If Croydon town centre undergoes intensive development, 
more aggregate recycling facilities may be required to 
minimise waste and its transportation. Where we want to be

 216 How we are going to get there 
Policy SP6: Environment and Climate Change Sustainable Design and Construction 
SP6.1 In order to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions and deliver development that is adaptable in a changing climate, the Council will apply 
a presumption in favour of development provided a pplications meet the requirements of Policy SP6 and other applicable policies of the 
development plan.  
Energy and carbon dioxide (CO 2) reduction  
SP6.2 The Council will ensure that future development makes the fullest contribution to minimising carbon dioxide emi ssions in accordance 
with the London Plan energy hierarchy (use less energy, supply energy efficiently and use renewable energy), to assist in mee ting local, 
London Plan and national CO 2 reduction targets. The Council will promote the development of distri ct energy networks where opportunities 
exist due to high heat density56 or an increase in heat density brought about by new development. This will be achieved by:  
a) Requiring high density57 residential developments of 20 or more units to incorporate site wide communal heating systems  
b) Requiring major development58 to be enabled for district energy connection59 unless demonstrated not to be feasible or financially 
viable to do so.  
Sustainable design and construction  
SP6.3 The Council will seek high standards of sustaina ble design and construction from new development, conversion and refurbishment to 
assist in meeting local and national CO 2 reduction targets. This will be achieved by:  
a) Requiring new -build residential development of fewer than 10 units to achieve the nation al technical standard for energy efficiency in 
new homes (2015). This is set at a minimum of 19% CO 2 reduction beyond the Building Regulations Part L (2013);  
b) Requiring all major development new-build  residential development of 10 units or  more  to achieve the London Plan requirements  or 
National Technical Standards (2015) for energy performance, whichever the higher standard ;  
                                            
56 55 residential units or 1,000m2 commercial development per hectare 
57 55 residential units per hectare for developments of over 100 homes; 75 units per hectare for developments of 20 or more but under 100 homes 
58 10 or more residential units, a site of 0.5 hectares or more or 1,000m2 commercial development 
59 Enablement for district energy connection which incorporates provision of a communal heating system operating to defined temperatures with a suitable on site space for 
associated heat connection plant and pipe connection to the perimeter of the site.   
 217 c) Requiring all new -build residential development to meet a minimum water efficiency standard of 110 litres/person/day as set out in 
Building Regulations Part G;  
d) Requiring conversions and changes of use of existing buildings providing more than 10 new residential units to achieve a mini mum of 
BREEAM Domestic Refurbishment Very Good rating or equivalent;    
e) Requiring new build non -residen tial development of 500m2 and above to achieve a minimum of BREEAM Excellent standard or 
equivalent;  
f) Requiring conversions and changes of use to non -residential uses with an internal floor area of 500m2 and above to achieve a 
minimum of BREEAM Very Good st andard or equivalent;  
g) Requiring new build, non -residential development of 1000m2 and above to achieve a minimum of 35% CO 2 reduction beyond the 
Building Regulations Part L ( 20136); and 
h) Requiring development to positively contribute to improving air, land,  noise, and water quality by minimising pollution , with detailed 
policies to be included in the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals , and  
i) Taking a bespoke approach to the sustainability of historic buildings and heritage assets, giving con sideration to their particular 
construction, fabric and character.  
 
Flooding, urban blue corridors and water management  
SP6.4 The Council, as a Lead Local Flood Authority, will work in partnership with the Environment Agency, community groups, water a nd 
highway s infrastructure providers, developers and other Lead Local Flood Authorities to reduce flood risk, protect groundwater and a quifers, 
and minimise the impact of all forms of flooding in the borough. This will be achieved by:  
a) Applying the Sequential Test an d Exception Test where required by Policy DM25 ;  
b) Requiring major developments in Flood Zone 1 and all new development within Flood Zones 2 and 3 to provide site specific Floo d 
Risk Assessments proportionate with the degree of flood risk posed to and by the  development, taking account of the advice and 
recommendations within the Council's Strategic Flood Risk Assessment and Surface Water Management Plan;   
 218 c) Requiring all development, including refurbishment and conversions, to utilise sustainable drainage syste ms (SuDs) to reduce surface 
water run -off and provide water treatment on site; and  
d) Requiring development proposals to account for possible groundwater contamination in Source Protection Zones 1 and 2.  
SP6.5 The Council and its partners will promote the implement ation of ‘Urban Blue Corridors’, enabling a network of multifunctional spaces 
and corridors that provide safe routes and storage for flood water within the urban environment. This will be achieved by:  
a) Supporting schemes that make space for water in flood e vents;  
b) Supporting schemes to de -culvert sections of the River Wandle, Norbury Brook and Caterham Bourne;  
c) Preserving and enhancing landscape, heritage and culture through protection and access improvements to the borough’s ponds, 
open water and water heri tage sites; and  
d) Maximising opportunities to establish overland flow paths, surface water ponding areas, urban watercourse buffer areas and mu lti-use 
flood storage areas in locations of high surface water flood risk and critical drainage areas.  
Waste manage ment  
SP6.6  The Council supports the objectives of sustainable waste management set out in the London Plan and national policy. The Counc il 
will identify the necessary capacity in collaboration with the neighbouring boroughs of Merton, Kingston and Sutton t o maximise self -
sufficiency in managing the waste generated within the four boroughs. This will be achieved through the South London Waste Pl an DPD and 
any further revisions.  
Minerals  
SP6.7  The Council will support schemes for aggregate recycling facilitie s within the borough and seek to reduce the environmental impact of 
aggregates by supporting the enhancement and development of aggregate recycling facilities where there is no significant detr iment to local 
amenity (see Policy SP8 regarding freight moveme nt and railheads).

Why we have taken this approach 
Energy and carbon dioxide (CO 2) reduction 
8.2 In 201 62, the London Borough of Croydon was responsible for 
1,124 1,544  kilo tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions60. 
While this level of emissions is eighth highest across the 33 
London Boroughs, total emissions from Croydon’s homes are the 
second highest across the boroughs. The London Plan includes a 
target for London to become a zero carbon city by 2050 to reduce 
CO2 emissions by 60% by 2025  and the Climate Change Act sets 
out that emissions will be reduced by 80% by 2050 (based on 
1990 levels). A Climate and Ecological Emergency was declared 
by the Council in July 2019 with one of the aims for the council to 
be carbon neutral by 2030.  The Croydon Climate Change 
Mitigation Action Plan (Croydon Council “Croydon Climate Change 
Mitigation Action Plan” 2010) sets out targets for reducing borough 
wide CO2 emissions. A key part of this action plan is the 
minimisation of CO2 emissions arising from new and existing 
buildings, through sustainable design and construction and 
low/zero carbon energy generation. This approach is embedded i n 
the ‘We Are Croydon Vision’ (We Are Croydon vision (page 45)61 
Sustainable design and construction 
8.3 The Sustainable Design and Construction Evidence Base62 
and District Energy Feasibility Study63 highlights that t There is 
                                            
 
 
 
 
 
 significant potential, in the form of high heat densities, for district 
energy64. National planning policy and the London Plan support  
tThe development of district energy is recognised as a cost 
effective means of achieving low (and zero) carbon development 
in urban areas. The National Technical standards (2015) for new 
housing and the London Plan set minimum levels for CO 2 
reduction. The London Plan also allows for the offsetting of 
residual CO 2 emissions where it can be demonstrated that it is not 
feasible to achieve the required CO 2 target fully onsite. 
Development applications proposing the utilisation of biomass 
heating systems or biomass combined heat and power systems 
will be required to provide appropriate information to allow 
assessments to be made of the effectiveness of measures to 
minimise the impact on local air quality. 
8.4  Adoption of the National Technical Standards (2015) and 
London Plan requirements will  ensure that new developments 
achieve high standards of environmental performance which 
address: energy/water consumption, environmental impact of 
materials, waste, surface water run-off, pollution, construction 
management, ecology and occupant health and wellbeing. The 
policies seek to ensure that from the start, the design of 
developments should maximise the potential to use innovative 
construction technologies, pre-fabrication elements and 
sustainable materials alongside the use of recycled materials as 
referred to in the Mayor’s SPG on ‘Sustainable Design and 
Construction’ (2014) . A requirement for major refurbishments and 
 
 
 
  
 221 conversions to meet the National Technical Standards (2015) and 
London Plan requirements will ensure that o Opportunities to 
modernise and improve Croydon’s existing buildings through 
development, including refurbishment, should be are maximised. 
These opportunities extend to historic buildings and heritage 
assets however the nature of their construction and the need to 
preserve their character and setting demand special 
consideration65. Before any measures are taken to improve the 
sustainability and energy efficiency of historic buildings, the 
construction of the building should be understood. Evidence 
should set out the current and future energy performance of 
interventions, and take an iterative approach to interventions 
starting with the least invasive.  The beneficial re-use of existing 
buildings is a sustainable approach in its own right.  Overall, this 
approach will help meet the objectives set out in Croydon’s 
Climate Change Mitigation Strategy and Climate Change 
Adaptation Strategy.  
Flooding, urban blue corridors and water management 
8.5  The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment for Croydon, Sutton, 
Merton and Wandsworth (SFRA, 2015) identifies the  main risks of 
fluvial flooding are in the vicinity of the Norbury Brook through 
Thornton Heath and Norbury and through Kenley, Purley and 
Waddon along the Brighton Road and Godstone Road valleys and 
around the culverted River Wandle66. Croydon has been ranked 
the 4th settlement in England most susceptible to surface water 
                                            
 
 
 
 
 
 flooding67. The Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) 
identifies pP arts of the borough to be  are particularly susceptible 
to surface water flooding, including the  Brighton Road through 
Purley up to Central Croydon and the A22 Godstone Road68. 
There have been  SFRA identifies  significant episodes of surface 
water flooding at Purley Cross, Kenley Station, Brighton Road 
Coulsdon, Hamsey Green, Purley Oaks Road, Norbury and 
Thornton Heath69. The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) 
also identifies there are areas in the borough where groundwater 
may occur and  where groundwater may come close to the ground 
surface70. Croydon experienced severe flooding in 2014 
associated with the Caterham Bourne and high groundwater 
levels. 
8.6 The SFRA, SWMP scoping report, Sustainable Design and 
Construction Evidence Base and policies in the London Plan 
recommend the application ofs Sustainable urban drainage 
(SuDs) is recommended by a number of studies for the borough to 
ameliorate flood risk, improve water management and reduce 
surface water run-off. The Council, as the Local Planning Authority 
and the Lead Local Flood Authority, is required to ensure that 
SuDS are implemented in all major developments. The 
requirement to utilise SuDS in all development, including those in 
low risk areas, is in view of the fact that surface water from on e 
area of a catchment may contribute towards enhanced flood risk in 
another area of that catchment. In addition, flood events are 
expected to become more frequent and more significant in the 
 
 
 
 
70 SFRA Appendix A Figure 2.4  
 222 future as the U.K.’s climate changes and this requirement will go 
some way to adapting to this change. The installation of SuDS, 
such as green roofs, can have several additional benefits: 
increasing biodiversity and urban cooling, providing additional 
open space in built-up areas and improvements to water quality. 
Flood Risk Assessments will highlight site specific issues and help 
inform the best solutions to reduce flood risk and improve water 
management. The Level 2 SFRA and SWMP can be used to guide 
which SuDS will be the most suitable based on site specific 
considerations. 
8.7  A Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA) commissioned research report, involving Croydon 
Council, entitled ‘Developing Urban Blue Corridors’ proposes 
tackling pluvial flood risk in a more innovative and strategic 
manner through the establishment of a network of multifunctional 
spaces for water71. It propounds the establishment of safe flood 
corridors and setting development back from natural overland flow 
paths and ponding areas. Establishing a network of multifunctional 
spaces and corridors for flood water provides additional 
opportunities for improving biodiversity, recreation, urban cooling 
and access , commonly called “Blue Corridors”. The Local Plan will 
support development where improvements to ponds and open 
water sites such as South Norwood Lake and Waddon Ponds are 
delivered . The approach is supported by policy within the London 
Plan72.The Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals 
will set detailed policies for establishing Urban Blue Corridors in 
Croydon.. 
8.8  The Environment Agency has defined Source Protection 
Zones (SPZs), for groundwater sources such as wells, boreholes 
                                            
 
 and springs used for public drinking water supply. These zones 
show the risk of contamination from any activities that might cause 
pollution in the area. The closer the activity, the greater the risk.  A 
formation of chalk underlies Croydon. Fractures in the chalk rock 
allow groundwater to collect and flow underground. They also 
allow large quantities of groundwater to be brought to the surface 
through pumping of wells. The water from these wells supplies 
over 70% of Croydon’s drinking water, and should be protected to 
ensure water is available to current and future generations. 
Considerate planning is needed so that development does not 
have a detrime ntal effect on the public’s valuable water resource. 
Through this package of measures Croydon has the potential to 
reduce urban diffuse pollution in its water bodies and help improve 
the ecological status of the borough’s surface waters such as the 
River Wandle, Norbury Brook and Caterham Bourne . The 
Environment Agency has defined Source Protection Zones, for 
groundwater sources such as wells, boreholes and springs used 
for public drinking water supply. These zones show the risk of 
contamination from any activities that might cause pollution in the 
area. The closer the activity, the greater the risk.  
Waste management 
8.9 The Council has developed the South London Waste Plan 
DPD with the neighbouring boroughs of Kingston, Merton and 
Sutton. The Waste Plan forms part of each borough’s Local 
Development Framework and ensures that collectively, the 
boroughs meet the London Plan, national and EU requirements. 
Detailed planning policies for the assessment and delivery of new 
waste management facilities are set out in the South London 
Waste Plan DPD. Policy SI7 5.16 of the London Plan seeks to 
 
  
 223 manage as much of London’s waste within London as practicable; 
working towards managing the equivalent of 100 per cent of 
London’s waste within London by 20 2631 and creating positive 
environmental and economic impacts from waste processing 
working towards zero biodegradable or recyclable waste to landfill 
by 20 2631. Within this context, the London Plan emphasises that 
boroughs should maximise self-sufficiency. The London Plan 
provides updated guidance and revised waste apportionment that 
the South London Waste Plan will seek to meet. 
8.10 When considering planning applications for new waste 
management facilities, the Council will have regard to the policies 
of the South London Waste Plan DPD, the site selection criteria to 
be set out in the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and 
Proposals and the additional location criteria set out in the London 
Plan and national policy. Within Croydon, some Strategic 
Industrial Locations have been identified as potentially suitable for 
waste management facilities and are identified in the South 
London Waste Plan DPD. 
Minerals  
8.11 An aggregates company has access to a rail head at Purley; 
this site is allocated and safeguarded in line with paragraph 204 of 
the National Planning Policy Framework and shown on the 
Policies Map . Whilst the borough has no minerals for extraction 
the levels of growth envisaged over the plan period will require 
sustainable means with which to transport and distribute 
aggregates as well as recycling aggregates. The operations of 
such sites should not be prejudiced by potential development in 
the vicinity, and therefore applications will be assessed in 
accordance with the agent of change principle .

 Policy SP6. 2 
 Policy SP6.3  
Why we need this policy
8.12 As part of its commitment to achieving sustainable 
development and promoting the economic and social wellbeing 
of the borough, the Council needs to ensure that there is 
effective protection of the environment and prudent use of natural resources. To do this the Council needs to assess the 
environmental impacts of development and take action to ensure 
that sustainable development objectives are met. The entire 
borough of Croydon is also an Air Quality Management Area.  
Policy DM23: Development and construction 
The Council will promote high standards of develop ment and construction throughout the borough by:  
a) Ensuring that future development, that may be liable to cause or be affected by pollution through air, noise, dust, or vibrat ion, will not 
be detrimental to the health, safety and amenity of users of the sit e or surrounding land;  
b) Ensuring that developments are air quality neutral and do not lead to further deterioration of existing poor air quality;  
c) Ensuring mitigation measures are put in place to reduce the adverse impacts to acceptable levels. Where neces sary, the Council will 
set planning conditions to reduce the impact on adjacent land uses to acceptable levels, relative to ambient noise levels and  the 
character of the locality ; and   
 225 d) Encourag ing the use of sustainable and innovative construction materials  and techniques  in developments . 
Why we are proposing this approach  
8.13 In Croydon, developments of 10 or more new homes or 
500m2 or more of non-residential floor space are expected to 
meet high sustainable construction standards in accordance with 
the Croydon Local Plan.  
8.14  Developers should seek to minimise the adverse 
environmental impacts of development during construction in line 
with the Sustainable Design and Construction Supplementary 
Planning Guidance 2014 and by considering the following best 
practice measures:  
 Identifying potential sources of dust and other air pollution 
as early as possible from the earliest stages of project design 
and planning;  
 Locating activities likely to generate air pollution or dust 
away from sensitive uses such as hospital s, schools, housing 
and wildlife sites where possible;  
 Minimising dust generation by dampening stockpiles and 
covering skips;  
 Dampening and sweeping construction sites, access roads 
and dust generating activities such as stone cutting as 
required;  
 Accom modating wheel washer facilities as necessary; and  
 Making use of techniques such as framed construction and 
prefabricated components in order to minimise construction 
noise and disruption on site . 
8.15 Solid wall insulation will also be encouraged in existing 
developments where planning permission may be required. Air quality 
8.16 The entire borough of Croydon is an Air Quality 
Management Area (AQMA) and therefore developers should give 
careful consideration to the air quality impacts of their proposed 
development through an Air Quality Assessment. 
8.17 Since very few developments are ‘zero emission’ 
developments, most development will have a negative impact on 
air quality. As Croydon is an AQMA, new developments should 
be at least ‘air quality neutral’.  Developers should consider 
measures to minimise emissions of air pollution at the design 
stage and should incorporate best practice in the design, 
construction and operation of the development. Where a 
development has a negative impact on air quality, developers 
should identify mitigation measures that will minimise or offset 
the emissions from the development. These mitigation measures 
should be implemented on-site. This is especially important 
where provision has been made for a large number of parking 
spaces, where the development will generate a significant 
number of trips, will give rise to other potentially significant 
sources of pollution or will be used by large numbers of those 
particularly vulnerable to poor air quality, such as children or 
older people. Poor air quality is linked to the development of 
chronic diseases and can increase the risk of respiratory illness. 
Tackling poor air quality can improve health problems and 
minimise the impacts on vulnerable groups, especially asthma in 
children and heart and respiratory diseases in older people.  
8.18 The Council has produced an Interim Policy Guidance 
(Standards and Requirements for Improving Local Air Quality) on 
requirements for improving local air quality, which sets out 
situations when an assessment may be required and suggests 
methods of undertaking such an assessment within the Croydon  
 226 area. Developers or architects involved in new residential 
development, new industrial and commercial development, or 
mixed use development with housing should consult the Interim 
Planning Guidance on Improving Local Air Quality and the Mayor 
of London’s Control of Dust and Emissions Supplementary 
Planning Guidance.  
Noise  
8.19 There is a need to ensure that residents and businesses 
are protected from environmental disturbance  during the 
construction of major developments. Proposed developments 
should design out exposure to noise and provide adequate 
sound insulation to minimise the adverse impact of noise from a 
railway or a busy road, aircraft or an industrial activity, in line with 
the Agent of Change Principle.  
8.20 The Council’s Code of Practice has been prepared to help 
developers and their contractors ensure that they undertake their 
works in the most considerate manner, in order to reduce the 
impact of the work on local communities. It also provides 
guidance on a Construction Logistic Plan required for major 
developments and the assessment of traffic movements. 
8.21 Most planning applications received by the Council are 
assessed for the impact of environmental noise on the new 
development. This to ensure that the proposed development has 
adequate sound insulation in order to minimise the adverse 
impact of noise from a railway or a busy road, aircraft or an 
industrial activity. Residential developments close to railways 
and other noise sensitive sites will need a noise assessment.

Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies
 Strategic Objective 9  
 Policy SP6.3  
Why we need this policy
8.22 Whilst a site may contain elevated levels of ‘contaminants’, 
it may or may not be defined in legislation as contaminated land.  
Land contamination is likely to have arisen from the activities of 
past industrial and waste disposal practices. Elevated levels of 
heavy metals, oils, pesticides, and asbestos or landfill gas are a 
few examples of substances or materials which could be 
considered contaminants and which, where not properly 
managed, could cause harm to health or the environment. 
8.23 The legislation defines contaminated land as ‘any land 
which appears to the local authority in whose area it is situated, 
to be in such a condition, by reasons of substances in, on or 
under the land that: 
 Significant harm is being  caused , or there is a significant 
possibility of such harm be ing caused; or  
 Significant p ollution of controlled waters is being or is likely 
to be caused. ’ 
8.24 Land contamination is likely to have arisen from the 
activities of past industrial and waste disposal practices. 
Elevated levels of heavy metals, oils, pesticides, and asbestos or 
landfill gas are a few examples of substances or materials which 
could be considered contaminants and which, where not properly 
managed, could cause harm to health or the environment.  8.25 The planning system aims to ensure that the effects of 
historical contamination do should not cause any harm to the 
future users of a site.  Provisions in the planning process ensure 
that, w  Where  contamination is an issue on a site, development 
is an opportunity for it to be it is cleaned up or remediated before 
or as part of its redevelopment. Contaminated sites can be 
redeveloped into uses such as housing, schools and hospitals.  
8.26 Before the introduction of the Environment al Protection Act 
1990, there were instances where the previous controls dealing 
with contamination were not so effective, and going back further 
in time, controls were limited or non-existent. This may have 
resulted in contamination not being addressed or satisfactorily 
dealt with prior to or during the site’s development. It is these 
sites that the legislation aims to deal with by ensuring that, where 
potentially contaminated sites do exist, they are found and 
cleaned up. 
8.27 It is the responsibility of the Council to determine whether it 
considers the site to be contaminated. Planning controls through 
the imposition of conditions assists in helping to govern these 
sites.  
 228 Policy DM24: Land contamination 
DM24.1 The Council will permit development proposals located on or near potentially contaminated sites, provided that detailed site 
investigation is undertaken pr ior to the start of construction in order to assess:  
a) The nature and extent of contamination; and  
b) The production of landfill gases and the potential risks to human health, adjacent land uses and the local environment.  
DM24.2 Where the assessment identifies unaccep table risks to human health, adjacent land uses or the local environment, site 
remediation and aftercare measures will be agreed or secured by condition to protect the health of future occupants or users.  
DM24.3 All development proposals on contaminated sites sho uld be accompanied by a full risk assessment, which takes into account 
existing site conditions.  
How the policy works 
8.28 In addressing contamination, it is recognised that 
retrospective remedial actions, carried out after a site has been 
developed, will be significantly more expensive and difficult, than 
if the remediation is carried out prior to or as part of a site's 
development. As a consequence of this, when a site is to be 
developed, the Council will seek to ensure that any issues of 
contamination are addressed through the imposition of planning 
conditions prior to its development. The scale of remediation of 
the land should reflect the nature and risk posed by any 
contaminants. The Council’s Contaminated Land Officer will 
advise on remedial measures and that measures are 
successfully implemented.

Why we need this policy
8.29 The National Planning Policy Framework states that 
development should be directed away from areas at a highest 
risk of flooding and that Local Plans should apply a sequential, 
risk-based approach to the location of development. Where 
development is required in areas at risk of flooding, it should be 
safe for the lifetime of development without increasing flood risk 
elsewhere .  8.30 The National Planning Policy Framework and Planning 
Practic e Guidance state that sustainable drainage systems 
should be given priority in major developments unless 
demonstrated to be inappropriate. However, the use of 
sustainable drainage systems in all developments provides the 
opportunity to manage surface water as close to the source as 
possible and provide wider amenity and biodiversity benefits.   
 230 Policy DM25: Sustainable Drainage Systems and reducing flood risk  
DM25.1 The Council will ensure that development in the borough reduces flood risk and minimises the impact of flooding  by: 
a) Steering development to the areas with a lower risk of flooding;  
b) Applying the Sequential Test and Exception Test in accord with Table 8.1;  
c) Taking account of all sources of flooding from fluvial, surface water, groundwater, sewers, reservoirs and ordi nary watercourses ; and  
d) Applying the sequential approach to site layout by locating the most vulnerable uses in parts of th e site at the lowest risk of flooding.  
DM25.2 In areas at risk of flooding development should be safe for the lifetime of development and sho uld incorporate flood resilience 
and resistant measures into the design, layout and form of buildings to reduce the level of flood risk both on site and elsew here.  
DM25.3 Sustainable drainage systems are required in all development and should:  
a) Ensure surface run -off is managed as close to the source as possible;  
b) Accord with the London Plan Sustainable Drainage Hierarchy;  
c) Achieve better than greenfield runoff rates;  
d) Be designed to be multifunctional and incorporate sustainable drainage into landscaping and public realm to provide opportunities to 
improve amenity and biodiversity;  
e) Achieve improvements in water quality through an sustainable drainage system management train; and  
f) Be designed with consideration of future maintenance.

How the policy works 
8.31 When preparing Flood Risk Assessments regard should be 
had to the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, Surface Water 
Management Plan, Local Flood Risk Management Strategy , other local flood history, relevant flood defence asset information 
and Environment Agency flood maps. Flood Risk Assessments 
should assess the risk from all sources of flooding and should be 
informed by the latest evidence on climate change allowances .   
 233 8.32 The Sequential Test and Exception Test are not required 
for sites allocated in this Plan, for minor development74 or 
change of use75. For all other development in Flood Zones 2 and 
3 the Sequential Test and Exception Test should form part of the 
Flood Risk Assessment, having regard to the guidance in the 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. A Sequential Test is required 
for development in Flood Zone 1 if the area has been identified 
at risk from other sources of flooding .  
8.33 For residential development , a Sequential Test may be 
made against the Council’s published five year supply of housing 
land and should demonstrate that the five year supply of housing 
land cannot be met on sites with a lower risk of flooding. For all 
other uses a Sequential Test should be based on the catchment 
of the proposed use.  
8.34  Where a site is at risk of groundwater  flooding , the Council 
will request a Basement Impact Assessment as part of the Flood 
Risk Assessment for any application with basement or lower 
ground floor development . These assessments should be 
informed by ground investigations to help assess the flood risks 
to basement development  and the surrounding area .  
8.35 Croydon has experienced a number of surface water flood 
events and has been ranked by Department of Environmental, 
Food and Rural Affairs as the 4th settlement in England most 
susceptible to surface water flooding76. The Local Flood Risk 
Management Strategy identifies up to 33,614 residential 
                                            
74 In relation to flood risk, minor development means: minor non-residential 
extensions with a footprint less than 250 square metres; alterations that do not 
increase the size of buildings; household development within the curtilage of the 
existing dwelling and physical extensions to the existing dwelling itself. This 
excludes the creation of a separate dwelling within the curtilage of the existing 
dwelling. 
75 This excludes change of use to a caravan, camping or chalet site or to a 
mobile home or park home site.  properties at risk from surface water in the borough77. Extensive 
records are held of surface water flooding across the borough 
with particularly significant episodes at Purley Cross roundabout 
and Brighton Road, Kenley station, Brighton Road (Coulsdon) , 
Hamsey Green, Purley Oaks Road, Norbury and Thornton 
Heath78. Due to the risk posed by surface water flooding in 
Croydon, development should utilise sustainable drainage 
systems to achieve better than greenfield runoff rates from the 
site. Greenfield runoff rates are defined as the runoff rates from a 
site, in its natural stat e, prior to any redevelopment and are 
typically between two and eight litres per second per hectare79. If 
better than greenfield runoff rates cannot be achieved, this 
should be justified to the Local Planning Authority and Lead 
Local Flood Authority as part of a drainage strategy. In these 
instances greenfield runoff rates should be achieved as a 
minimum in line with the London Plan.  
8.36 Sustainable drainage systems should always be considered 
as early in the  design process to inform the design of the 
development. Proposals should demonstrate an understanding 
of how surface water will flow across the site, taking account of 
topography and locating drainage features accordingly. A 
drainage strategy should demonstrate that the site will achieve 
better  than greenfield runoff rates and that sustainable drainage 
systems have been designed in line with the London Plan 
drainage hierarchy. Drainage design should follow the principles 
of water sensitive urban design and demonstrate a sustainable 
drainage management train. A sustainable drainage

water through and across a site, identifying suitable sustainable 
drainage techniques for each stage. For example, a 
management train could consist of a green roof, a soakaway and 
permeable paving used in different parts of a development. The 
drainage strategy should also demonstrate how the drainage 
system will be managed and maintained for the lifetime of the 
development.  
8.37 Sustainable drainage systems provide wider benefits than 
just reducing surface water runoff from a site. They provide 
opportunities to improve water quality by removing pollutants, 
improve the quality and attractiveness of public realm and open 
spaces and enhance biodiversity through the creation of habitats 
such as ponds and wetlands. Sustainable drainage systems 
should be designed to manage water as close to the source as 
possible and include treatment stages which not only manage 
the flow of water but provide wider benefits to the site. The 
contribution of trees in reducing flood risk should be recognised 
in developing sustainable drainage systems and the wider 
benefits that can be realised. Detailed guidance on sustainable 
drainage systems will be produced by the Lead Local Flood 
Authority.  
8.38 Developments which result in the need for off-site upgrades 
to the water or sewerage network, will need to ensure that the 
occupation is aligned with the delivery of necessary infrastructure 
upgrades and where appropriate, phasing of occupation. 
Developers are encouraged to contact the water/waste water 
company as early as possible to discuss their development 
proposals and intended delivery programme to assist with 
identifying any potential water and wastewater network 
reinforcement requirements.  Key supporting documents

 235 9. Green Grid  
Strategic policy
Where we are now 
9.1 The key issues that the borough faces in terms of planning for 
green space up to 2036 are: 
 50% of the borough’s residential areas are located more than 
400m from a local park. 
 Pressure on existing green spaces and play areas are likely to 
increase with the levels of growth planned for urban areas in 
the borough. 
 Croydon lacks areas of open water e.g. lakes, rivers and large 
ponds. 
 Due to limited land availability there are significant gaps in the 
access to nature in the northern parts of the borough. 
 Allotments in the borough are well used and there is a large 
demand for allotments. There is a combined allotment waiting 
list across Croydon of approximately 600 people.  
 There is a need to create and conserve habitats to ensure the 
borough is resilient to pressures like climate change and 
ensures a net gain in biodiversity in order to protect and 
improve Croydon’s ecological health and resilience . 
 The green spaces do not comprehensively offer safe and 
pleasant walking and cycling connections and facilities to serve 
an increasing population.   
Where we want to be 
Strategic Objective 4:  Reduce social, economic and 
environmental deprivation, pa rticularly where it is spatially concentrated, by taking priority measures to reduce 
unemployment, improve skills and education and renew housing, 
community and environmental conditions.  
Strategic Objective 7  Conserve and create spaces and buildings 
that foster safe, healthy and cohesive communities.  
Strategic Objective 8:  Improve accessibility, connectivity, 
sustainability and ease of movement to, from and within the 
borough.  
Strategic Objective 9:  Ensure the responsible use of land and 
natural resource s and management of waste to mitigate and 
adapt to climate change.  
Strategic Objective 10:  Improve the quality and accessibility of 
green space and nature, whilst protecting and enhancing 
biodiversity.  
Strategic Objective 11:  Tackle flood risk by making space for 
water and utilising sustainable urban drainage systems.   
 236 How we are going to get there 
Policy SP7: Green Grid 
SP7.1 In order to deliver new and enhanced green and blue infrastructure commensurate with growth the Council will apply a presumption in 
favour of devel opment provided applications assist in the delivery of a Green Grid and meet the requirements of Policy SP7 and other

 245 Why we have taken this approach 
Green and Blue spaces 
9.2 The Green Grid concept aims to link environmental assets with 
existing and future proposed communities through a connected, 
easily accessible open space network. Croydon’s Green Grid is 
the network of green and blue spaces (rivers and ponds) and 
includes Metropolitan Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land, 
public spaces, pocket parks, roof gardens, productive landscapes 
(such as allotments), railway verges, privately owned public 
spaces and private green spaces (including front and back 
gardens). The Green Grid can include Public Rights of Way, 
Strategic Walking Routes and Cycle Quietways. It also includes 
smaller, but important features such as street trees and green 
roofs. The whole Green Grid is important as it provides a range of 
benefits to animals, plants and people.  The Council will use the 
Green Grid concept to ensure that the access, quality and function 
of the borough's existing green space is maximised, as well as 
attempting to provide new green space via enabling development. 
Croydon’s Green Grid policies support the Green Arc vision of 
"Bringing the Big Outdoors closer to people through the creation of 
an extensive and attractive and valued recreational landscape of 
well-connected and accessible countryside around London, for 
people and wildlife". The Council will ensure that the natural 
signatures  natural characteristics (geology, ecology and landform) 
of the borough are maintained and enhanced in accordance with 
Natural England's ‘London Landscape Framework.’ 
9.3 The Council will protect and safeguard Metropolitan Green Belt 
and Metropolitan Open Land and Special Community Green 
Spaces (Local Green Spaces), and other Important Green 
                                            
81 Open Space Needs Assessment and Open Spaces Assessment Standards 
Report (2009) Spaces, as well as the South London Downs National Nature 
Reserve as per national policy and the policies of the London 
Plan. Local green Other  non-designated open green spaces 
spaces which mak e a contribution to the borough’s heritage value, 
visual character, recreational opportunities, tranquillity, and 
amenity qualities will be protected and safeguarded. Further policy 
detail is set out in the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and 
Propos als detailing a hierarchy of green spaces with subsequent 
designations added to the Proposals Map. These amendments will 
reflect the approach set out in the National Planning Policy 
Framework, London Plan and All London Green Grid 
Supplementary Planning Gu idance.  
9.4 In 2009 an 'Open Space Assessment'81 and 'Outdoor 
Recreation Needs Report' were prepared for the Council and 
identified over 50% of the borough’s residential areas as being 
deficient in access to all forms of open space (as defined by the 
superseded Planning Policy Guidance Note 17). These deficiencies 
are particularly pronounced in the north of the borough, in areas 
such as East Croydon, Thornton Heath and Broad Green. 
Assessments of the quality of Croydon’s existing open spaces 
indicated, that in the south, where large areas of accessible 
countryside is found, they were of higher quality than other areas, 
with the lowest quality spaces located in the central areas of the 
borough. With the existing deficiency in some areas, along with 
limited opportunities to create more open space and a growing 
population, protection of the existing provision of open space and 
maximisation of its benefits will be vitally important.  In 2019, a 
Natural Capital Accounting Report’ found that the borough’s parks 
are predominantly ‘Fair’ or ‘Good’ in relation to quality and health 
outcomes, with just two areas in the borough highlighted as being  
 246 ‘under provided’. One of these areas approximately corresponds to 
Selhurst, Bensham Manor and, South Norwood. A second area lies 
in the south-east of the borough within New Addington North and 
New Addington South Wards..  
9.5 Areas where the public realm is predominantly hard-surfaced 
(e.g. Croydon Opportunity Area and the District Centres) contribute 
to the heat island effect. Methods of cooling and climate change 
adaptation are promoted through the Green Grid policy. Green 
roofs, sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS), street trees and 
green/soft landscaping measures can all contribute to cooling in 
urban areas.   
 247 Biodiversity 
9.6 The policy approach to biodiversity is informed by ‘Climate 
Change Adaptation Manual’ 'Making Space for Nature' and is 
consistent with national planning policy for biodiversity and 
geological conservation and guidance from Natural England the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The policy 
seeks Biodiversity is important to enhance the resilience and 
coherence of Croydon's ecological network . The Greater London 
Authority's 'Access to Nature' mapping shows there is a good 
distribution of natural and semi-natural green space provision in the 
south of the borough where larger sites are located. These policies 
in combination with the borough's Biodiversity and Habitat Action 
Plans and London's Wandle Valley and Downlands Green Grid 
Area Framework will enable biodiversity conservation and 
improvements in access to nature to be more easily and 
consistently integrated into other strategic plans and projects . In the 
north of the borough where there are less green spaces the 
improvement of biodiversity is more of a challenge but it can be 
achieved through the existing parks, back gardens and pockets of 
green in places such as roads. 
Productive landscapes 
9.7 The London Plan includes several strategic policies promoting 
productive landscapes82 and encourages London boroughs to 
identify other potential spaces that could be used for commercial 
food production or for community gardening, including allotments 
and orchards. The concept of productive landscapes goes beyond 
food production to include community gardens, sustainable forestry, 
urban farms and urban agriculture plots, where commodities such 
as flowers can be produced. Productive landscapes encourage 
healthy eating, physical activity outdoors, greater biodiversity, 
                                            
82 London Plan (Policies 2.18, 5.10, 5.11 and 7.22) regeneration of derelict or underused urban spaces (which can 
improve the perceived or actual safety of an area), increased 
community cohesion and the potential for economic development 
through learning new skills and exploring commercial options for 
dealing with surplus produce83.

Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies
 Strategic Objective 9  
 Strategic Objective 10  
 Policy SP7.2  
 
 
Why we need this policy
9.8 Croydon has a strategic objective to ensure the responsible 
use of land and natural resources and also to increase the quality 
of, and access to, green spaces and nature. The borough’s trees 
and green spaces are also important in mitigating higher 
temperatures as a result of climate change. Protecting the 
borough’s Metropolitan Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land and 
local green spaces ensures communities have access to open 
space for physical activity, recreation and play. Policy SP7 seeks  
to protect and safeguard the extent of the borough’s Metropolitan 
Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land and local green spaces. 
 
9.8a National Planning Policy Framework allows communities to 
identify and protect green areas of particular importance to them 
for designation as Local Green Space through local and neighbourhood plans. Policies for managing Local Green Spaces 
should be consistent with those for Metropolitan Green Belt. To 
help differentiate between Local Green Spaces and other 
important open spaces in the borough, this Plan refers to Local 
Green Space as Very Special Community Green Spaces. 
9.8b To be designated as a Very Special Community Green 
Space the green space must be: 
a) In reasonably close proximity to the community it serves; 
b) Demonstrably special to a local community and holds a 
particular local significance such that it is virtually irreplaceable; 
and 
c) Local in character and is not an extensive tract of land.
  
 249 Policy DM26: Metropolitan Green Belt , and Metropolitan Open Land and Very Special Community Green Spaces  
DM26.1 The Council w ill protect and safeguard the extent of the borough’s Metropolitan Green Belt  and Metropolitan Open Land as 
designated on the Policies Map by applying the same level of protection afforded to Metropolitan Green Belt in national plann ing policy to 
Metropoli tan Open Land in the borough.  
DM26.2 Extensions to existing buildings in Metropolitan Green Belt  and Metropolitan Open Land should not be more than 20% of their 
original84 floor space or volume, or 100m2 (whichever is the smaller) unless they are for agricultural use, forestry, or facilities for outdoor 
sport, ou tdoor recreation or cemeteries.  
DM26.3 Extensions to existing buildings in Metropolitan Green Belt  and Metropolitan Open Land that are less  than 20% of the original 
floor space  or volume,  or less than 100m2 in ext ent (whichever is the smaller) and extensions for agricultural use , forestry, or facilities for 
outdoor sport, outdoor recreation or cemeteries may still be  disproportionate. In considering whether they are disproportionate and also 
whether  a new replaceme nt dwelling is materially larger or, if any proposed structure  harm s the  openness  of Metropolitan Green Belt  or 
Metropolitan Open Land  the Council will have regard to:  
a) Changes in the floor space and volume of buildings;  
b) The floor space and volume of all pr evious extensions (since 1948), alterations and developments within the curtilage of the dwelling;  
c) Use of basements and roof spaces as living areas;  
d) Whether there is an increase in the spread of buildings across the site, in particular where visible from p ublic vantage points;  
e) The size of the curtilage and character of the surrounding area; and  
f) Whether ancillary structures have an urbanising effect.  
Very Special Community Green Spaces  
 
DM26.4 The Council will protect and safeguard the extent of the borough’s Very Special Community Green Spaces. Development on 
Very Special Community Green Spaces will be inappropriate except for:  
a) The provision of facilities (in connection with the existing use of the Very Special Community Green Space or a change of use ) for outdo or 
sport, outdoor recreation, cemeteries and burial grounds and allotments; as long as the facilities preserve the openness of t he Very Special

 250 Community Green Space and do not undermine the reasons why the green space was designated as a Very Special Comm unity Green 
Space;  
b) The replacement of an existing building, provided the new building is not materially larger than the one it replaces;  
c) The re -use of buildings provided that the buildings are of permanent and substantial construction; or  
d) The chan ge of use of land to space for outdoor sport and recreation or allotments

How the policy works 
Metropolitan Green Belt 
9.9 Metropolitan Green Belt is a national designation which aims 
to check the unrestricted sprawl of London, prevent Croydon from 
merging with towns in neighbouring local authorities, safeguard 
Croydon’s countryside from encroachment, to preserve the setting 
and special character of Croydon, and to assist in its regeneration 
by encouraging the recycling of derelict and urban land. 
Metropolitan Open Land 
9.10 Metropolitan Open Land is a London designation which aims 
to protect land that either contributes to the physical structure of 
London, includes open air facilities which serve either the whole or 
significant parts of London, contains features or landscapes 
(historic, recreational, biodiversity) of either national or 
metropolitan value, or forms part of a Green Chain or a link in the 
network of green infrastructure. 
Other open space 
9.11 Other undesignated open space is protected by policies 2.18 
and 7.18 of the London Plan in pursuit of paragraph 74 of the 
National Planning Policy Framework.  Paragraph deleted  
National plan ning policy 
9.12 Between them the National Planning Policy Framework and 
London Plan apply the same level of protection to the Metropolitan 
Open Land as is afforded to Metropolitan Green Belt.  
 252 9.13 The National Planning Policy Framework says that new 
buildings in the Green Belt are inappropriate with the exception of: 
a) Buildings for agriculture and forestry; 
b) Provision of appropriate facilities for outdoor sport, outdoor 
recreation and for cemeteries, as long as it preserves the 
openness of the Green Belt and does not conflict with the 
purposes of including land within it; 
c) The extension or alteration of a building provided that it does 
not result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of 
the original building; 
d) The replacement of a building, provided the new building is in 
the same use and not materially larger than the one it replaces; 
e) Limited infilling in villages, and limited affordable housing for 
local community needs under policies set out in the Local Plan; or 
f) Limited infilling or the partial or complete redevelopment of 
previously developed sites (brownfield land), whether redundant or 
in continuing use (excluding temporary buildings), which would not 
have a greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt and the 
purpose of including land within it than the existing development. 
 
9.14 The National Planning Policy Framework also says that the 
following uses are also not inappropriate in the Green Belt 
provided they preserve the openness and do not conflict with the 
purposes of including land within the Green Belt: 
a) Mineral extraction; 
b) Engineering operations; 
c) Local transport infrastructure which can demonstrate a 
requirement for a Green Belt location; 
d) The re-use of buildings provided that the buildings are of 
permanent and substantial construction; and 
e) Development brought forward under a Community Right to 
Build Order. and 
f) Material changes in the use of land (such as changes of use for 
outdoor sport or recreation, or for cemeteries and burial grounds)  9.15 At a local level cemeteries, burial grounds and 
telecommunications development may be acceptable in 
Metropolitan Green Belt and on Metropolitan Open Land if it can 
be demonstrated that there are no other suitable sites and that 
there is no impact on the openness of the Green Belt or the 
reason for the site being designated as Metropolitan Open Land. 
In addition for cemeteries and burial grounds existing levels of 
public access to sites in Metropolitan Green Belt and Metropolitan 
Open Land need to be maintained. Neither cemeteries, burial 
grounds nor telecommunications development are acceptable on 
Local Green Space. 
Extensions and replacement of existing buildings 
9.16 The policy defines disproportionate extensions for 
development proposals which are considered to be inappropriat e 
development in the Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land. Any 
extension of more than 20% of the original floor space or volume, 
or greater than 100m2 in extent (whichever is smaller) of an 
existing building will be considered disproportionate.  
9.17 It does not apply to proposals to extend uses that the 
National Planning Policy Framework considers to be acceptable in 
Green Belt. For these uses, development proposals will still be 
required to preserve the openness of the Green Belt and not 
conflict with the purposes of including land within it.  
9.18 In considering applications for the replacement of existing 
buildings in Metropolitan Green Belt or on Metropolitan Open 
Land, the Council may seek alterations in the position of the 
footprint on the site, or other changes that will reduce the impact 
on the open character of the area. 
9.19 Where a proposed change of use of an existing building in 
Metropolitan Green Belt or on Metropolitan Open Land involves 
extensions or changes to the use of the surrounding land the 
Council will exercise strict control to ensure that the proposal does  
 253 not conflict with openness or the purposes of including land in the 
designation. The form, bulk and general design of any new 
structures should be in keeping with their surroundings. In 
considering such proposals, the Council will have regard to the 
history of the building and will not look favourably on the 
conversion of buildings constructed under permitted development 
rights, if it is considered that there was an intention of early 
conversion to another use. Conditions removing permitted 
development rights and legal agreements may be sought to 
achieve these aims. 
Very Special Community Green Spaces 9.19a  As Croydon’s Very Special Community Green Spaces are 
virtually irreplaceable all uses will need to preserve the green 
space and the way that it is used by the community.  Some 
development may be allowed such as sport or community facilities 
provided that they support the further use and enjoyment of the 
Very Special Community Green Spaces .

Why we need this policy
9.19b  Other green spaces in Croydon are still important even if 
they are not designated as Metropolitan Green Belt, Metropolitan 
Open Land or Very Special Community Green Spaces. Access to 
high quality open spaces and opportunities for sport and physical 
activity are important for the health and well-being of communities 
in Croydon. As such they also need to be protected. 9.19c  The London Plan says that Local Plans should include 
designations and policies for the protection of open space to meet 
needs and address deficiencies. It also says that development 
proposals should not result in the loss of protected open space. 
9.19d Other green spaces can take a variety of different forms, 
sizes and functions. The Local Plan needs to provide clarity as to 
how any proposal that would result in the loss of all or part of each  
 254 different type of Other Important Green Space would be 
considered. 
 
Policy DM26A: Other Important Green Space 
DM26A .1 Other important green spaces are identified in the borough  that add to character and w ellbeing of the residents. These spaces will 
be protected unless  
a. An equivalent green space is reprovided as part of any development that allows for the local community to continue all existi ng lawful 
uses of the Other Important Green Space;  
b. The exist ing Other Important Green Space is no longer used by the local community so is no longer an important open space; or  
c. Other equivalent green space is available for the local community to continue all existing lawful uses of the Other Important  Green Spac e 
within the distances set out in Table 9. 1b. 
 
Table 9.1b Maximum distance to Other Important Open Space for the purpose of assessing equivalent open space 
Type of Other Important Open Space  Function  Maximum distan ce to Other Important 
Open Space for the purposes of 
assessing equivalent open space  
Town parks and natural open spaces  Large areas of open space that provide a 
landscape setting with a variety of natural 
features. They provide a wide range of 
activities,  including outdoor sports facilities 
and playing fields, children’s play for 
different age groups and informal recreation 
pursuits. The category also includes larger 
areas of natural open space. They will 
usually provide recreation for an entire 
Place and can be up to 20ha in size. They 
are shown on the Policies Map.  1.2km   
 255 Type of Other Important Open Space  Function  Maximum distan ce to Other Important 
Open Space for the purposes of 
assessing equivalent open space  
Local parks and natural open spaces  Providing for court games, children’s play, 
sitting out areas and nature conservation 
areas; or they are slightly larger areas of 
natural open space. They serve more than 
the neighbourhood in which they are 
located, but won’t serve an entire Place. 
Usually they will be under 2ha in size. They 
are shown on the Policies Map.  400m  
Neighbourhood parks and natural open 
spaces  Serving the neighbourhood in wh ich they 
are located but will be more formal green 
spaces. They include public gardens, sitting 
out areas, children’s play spaces or other 
areas of a specialist nature, including nature 
conservation areas. Generally they are 
under 1ha in size. Most Neighbo urhood 
Parks are shown the Policies Map.  200m  
Informal green spaces  Small areas of informal open space that 
provide natural surfaces and shaded areas 
for informal play and passive recreation that 
sometimes have seating and small amounts 
of play equipment.  Typically they will serve 
only the neighbourhood in which they are 
located, and are generally under 0.4ha in 
size. They are not shown on the Policies 
Map.  200m   
 256 Type of Other Important Open Space  Function  Maximum distan ce to Other Important 
Open Space for the purposes of 
assessing equivalent open space  
Linear open spaces  Paths, disused railways, nature 
conservation areas and other routes that 
provide opportunities for informal recreation. 
They can often be characterised by 
elements that are not public open space but 
that contribute to the enjoyment of the 
space. They are not shown on the Policies 
Map.  200m

How the policy works 
9.19f  The presumption when considering development proposals 
that would result in the loss of Other Important Green Spaces is 
that they are not appropriate unless there is evidence that 
indicates otherwise.  
 259 9.19g  Evidence to support the loss of Other Important Green 
Space will need to be based on a comprehensive survey of 
residents who might use the green space. In considering which 
residents should be surveyed regard should be given the 
maximum distances set out in Table 9. . These are direct distances 
rather than actual walking distances. The Council will need to be 
satisfied that the survey made all reasonable attempts to establish 
who uses the Other Important Green Space and how they use the 
space. 
9.19h  Any survey should seek to establish how residents use the 
Other Important Green Space in order to establish if the space is 
actually used, if there are alternative spaces within an acceptable 
distance that could be used for the same purposes, or the type of 
open space that will need to be re-provided in any redevelopment. 
9.19i Not every type of Other Important Green Space can be 
shown on the Policies Map. In particular, Informal green spaces 
and Linear open spaces are too small to be individually mapped. 
These types of spaces will often consist of the original amenity 
land in planned housing estates or pockets of semi-natural spaces 
in built up areas. Land leftover by the original developer is unlikely 
to constitute Other Important Green Space unless indicated 
otherwise that it is used by residents for specific purposes that 
cannot be carried out elsewhere. Highway verges and central 
reservations are not considered to be Other Important Green 
Spaces.

Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies
 Strategic Objective 9  
 Strategic Objective 10  
 Policy SP7.4  
 Policy SP7.5  
Why we need this policy
9.20 Croydon has strategic objectives to ensure the responsible 
use of land and natural resources to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change, to increase the quality of and access to green space and 
nature, and to protect and enhance biodiversity. 
9.21 The Review of Sites of Nature Conservation Importance 
identified a nine areas not currently designated as Sites of Nature 
Conservation Importance that are of an equivalent standard to 
those already designated 9.21a  Improved and enhanced green infrastructure can lead to 
better physical health and well-being, improved air quality and 
reduced exposure to air pollution, storm water regulation, more 
resilient biodiversity and enhanced urban cooling. 
9.21b  Developments should achieve biodiversity net gain. In order 
to address this, an approach to measuring the Urban Greening 
Factor of developments. It is recognised that development can 
achieve multiple benefits from incorporating green infrastructure, 
taking opportunities to achieve environmental net gain and 
enhancing the borough’s green grid.
  
 261 Policy DM27: Protecting and enhancing our biodiversity and Urban Greening  
To enhance biodiversity across the borough and improve access to nature, development proposals should:  
a) Incorporate biodiversity  net gain on development sites to enhance local flora and fauna and aid pollination locally;  
b) Incorporate urban greening and  biodiversity measures around, within and on buildings in the form of green roofs, green walls or 
equivalent measures ;  
c) Incorporate productive landscapes in the design and layout of buildings and landscaping of all major developments85;  
d) Have no adverse impact on land with biodiversity or geo -diversity value as designated on the Policies Map;  and 
e) Have no adverse impact on species of animal or plant or their habitat protected under Brit ish or European law, highlighted within a 
local/regional Biodiversity Action Plan, or when the Council is presented with evidence that a protected species would be aff ected.  
f)  Incorporate nature -based, sustainable urban drainage solutions, such as rain g ardens.  
DM27.2 To secure urban greening a borough specific Urban Greening Factor (UGF) set out in Table 9. 1d identifies the appropriate 
amount of urban greening developments required for new build developments with 5 units or more as follows  
a) All residential devel opment of more than one unit 0.40  
b) For commercial business and service uses 0.3, and  
c)  For general industrial and storage or distribution 0.2

How the policy works 
9.22 The borough’s natural wildlife heritage, including individual 
species of particular interest or scarcity, is not confined to the 
designated Sites of Nature Conservation Importance . Small open 
spaces, ponds, streams, back gardens, hedgerows, trees, 
unimproved grassland, heathland or ‘wasteland’ habitats can be 
important support for the borough’s biodiversity and enable people 
to access and enjoy nature. 
9.23 Creating a patchwork of flower-rich meadows, field edges 
and flowery road verges, and extending this into urban gardens, 
parks and open spaces, would assist bees and other pollinating 
insects and could reverse their decline. 
9.24 Development proposals provide opportunities for protecting 
and enhancing existing habitats and incorporating new wildlife 
attracting habitats into landscaping and on buildings. In the built 
environment, 'green roofs' can be a particularly useful way of 
providing a new wildlife habitat as they have a number of other 
benefits. These include absorbing rainfall and reducing storm 
water run-off, helping cool buildings and reducing the 'urban heat 
island' effect. The plants absorb air pollution and dust and green 
roofs provide green oases amongst built-up areas. They can 
provide health benefits, protect the building structure from sunlight 
and temperature fluctuations and they can cut the cost of 
drainage, heating and air conditioning. Carefully chosen plants 
can also provide a habitat and meet the needs of local wildlife.   
 266 9.25 Incorporating productive landscapes into the design and 
layout of buildings and landscapes provides opportunities for local 
food growing, supports the creation of healthy and active 
communities, improves the quality of open spaces and enhances 
biodiversity. Productive landscapes can take the form of 
allotments, community garden & growing spaces, green roofs & 
walls and productive planting.  
9.26 Where there is limited outdoor space, there are opportunities 
for providing productive landscapes in roofs, walls and balconies 
in the form of rooftop allotments or raised beds. Productive 
planting can be incorporated into green roofs & walls through the 
planting of herbs, fruit, vegetables and edible plants. Productive 
planting can also be incorporated in soft landscaping where fruit 
and nut trees could also be used.  
9.27 In major developments where productive landscapes can be 
managed by a school, community group or residents’ 
associations, opportunities for the provision of allotments, and 
community gardens and growing spaces should be explored.  
9.28 Croydon contains many sites of biodiversity or geo-diversity 
value from Sites of Nature Conservation Importance, which are of 
local importance, to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), 
which are of national importance. The borough also contains four 
Local Nature Reserves and one Regionally Important Geological 
site (the Croham Hurst Cemented Blackheath Pebble Beds). 
9.29 The Review of Sites of Nature Conservation Importance 
carried out in 2013 and 2014 provides details on all sites with a 
rating of Grade I and Grade II, and all sites of local importance. 
9.30 Some types of habitats are rare in Croydon compared with 
other parts of London and are therefore particularly valuable here, 
for example open and running water. The size and shape of a site 
is also a consideration. Long, narrow sites, such as railway corridors and 'fingers' of open land, are more valuable than their 
size alone would suggest as they bring wildlife close to a larger 
number of adjacent properties and people. 
9.31 Proposals that might affect such sites will therefore need to 
be carefully assessed. Any assessment should take into account 
both operations during construction and the changes likely to be 
brought about by the new use. 
9.32 Occasionally, protection of nature conservation features may 
be outweighed by the need to provide essential infrastructure to 
support growth in the borough and beyond when there is no other 
suitable site. When assessing whether there are no other suitable 
sites, the cost of site acquisition is not a consideration and 
applicants will need to demonstrate that the proposed 
infrastructure cannot be disaggregated on to smaller sites within 
the borough or elsewhere. In circumstances where it is deemed 
that the need to provide essential infrastructure outweighs the 
protection of nature conservation features, harm may be 
permitted. Compensatory measures of an equivalent nature 
conservation value will be required to offset the harm caused by 
the development. It should be noted that some habitats take 
hundreds of years to become established in their current form and 
therefore it may be impossible to secure a like-for-like 
replacement. 
9.33 Some species of flora and fauna are protected by national 
and international legislation. The habitats of certain wildlife 
species are also specifically protected, although the retention of 
the habitats and adequate foraging areas of all protected species 
are considered essential for their survival. Specially protected 
species can be found throughout the borough and are not 
restricted to designated sites of nature conservation interest. It is 
therefore always necessary to consider the presence of specially 
protected species.   
 267 9.34 An ecological assessment will be required for developments 
which will impact land with biodiversity or geo-diversity value. An 
assessment is also required if a development impacts on species 
or habits protected by British or European law, included within a 
Biodiversity Action Plan or when the Council is presented with 
evidence of protected species.

Why we need this policy
9.35 Croydon has strategic objectives to ensure the responsible 
use of land and natural resources to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change, to increase the quality of and access to green space and 
nature, and to protect and enhance biodiversity. 
9.36 There is now a wealth of evidence on the many benefits of 
planting more trees to increase canopy cover, including improving 
physical and mental health; air quality; water management (reducing flooding); shading; cooling through evapotranspiration; 
as well as the more obvious benefits of improving biodiversity.  
9.37 Increasing tree cover in urban areas can help mitigate the 
urban heat island through direct shading and by reducing ambient 
air temperature through the cooling effect of water evaporation 
from the soil via plant leaves. The shading provided by trees can 
also reduce energy use for heating and cooling buildings.  
Policy DM28: Trees 
The Council will seek to protect and enhance the borough's woodlands, trees and hedgerows by: 
a) Ensuring that all development proposals accord with the recommendations of BS5837 2012 (Trees in relation to design, demoliti on 
and construction) or equivalent;  
b) Not permitting development that results in the  avoidable  loss or the excessive pruning of p reserved trees or retained trees where they 
make a contribution to the character of the area;   
 269 c) Not permitting development that could result in the future avoidable loss or excessive pruning of preserved trees or trees that make a 
contribution to the charact er of the area;  
d) Not permitting development resulting in the avoidable loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats, including ancient woodlan d, 
hedgerows and veteran trees; and  
e) Producing a tree strategy outlining how the local authority will manage its  tree stock and influence the management of those trees 
subject to a Tree Preservation Order.  
How the policy works 
9.38 The London Plan and the London Tree and Woodland 
Framework outline the Right Place Right Tree approach. Available 
space, the relationship to buildings and ultimate mature tree size 
will be taken into account by the Council when 
designing/accepting layouts to avoid causing future relationship 
issues. The presumption should be in favour of larger trees.  
9.39 Examples of types of development that could result in the 
future loss or excessive pruning of preserved trees or trees that 
make a contribution to the character of an area include new 
buildings in close proximity to the tree; or new roads within or 
accessing a development that pass wi thin close proximity to a 
tree. 
9.40 In all cases where the proposed development could result in 
the future loss or excessive pruning of preserved trees or trees 
that make a contribution to the character of an area, an application 
will need to be accompanied by sufficient information in 
accordance with BS5837 Trees in relation to design, demolition 
and construction (2012), or any successor British Standard to 
determine the future impact upon the trees. 
9.41 The loss of preserved trees that make a contribution to the 
character of the area is occasionally unavoidable. In these instances the council will be guided by BS5837: Trees in relation 
to design, demolition and construction, Recommendations, 2012 
when determining which trees can be removed, although, it is 
accepted that trees are only one consideration when addressing 
the competing needs of development. In such cases where trees 
are to be removed, the Council may impose a condition to require 
its replacement either, if practical and acceptable on site, and if 
not possible nor acceptable on site, in another location where it 
might contribute to the amenity and biodiversity of the local area. 
When replacing tree proposals should meet the requirements of 
policy DM10.8 .

 270 10. Transport and Telecommunications  
Strategic policy 
Where we are now 
10.1 The main issues in terms of planning for transport and 
communication up to 2036 are: 
 The population of the borough is expected to rise by 
approximately 78,000 by 2036, with over 10,000 homes being 
proposed for the Croydon Opportunity Area, which  The planned 
growth in the borough to meet housing needs and to support 
economic and social well-being will increase pressure on all 
transport services particularly as there is a major transport hub in 
the Croydon Metropolitan Centre.  
 Croydon is part of the ‘Coast to Capital’ Local Enterprise 
Partnership (LEP), which aims to increase business and 
employment in the area which would put additional pressure on 
transport services. 
 There is an ongoing climate emergency highlighting the There is 
a need to encourage more active and sustainable transport in order 
to reduce road congestion, which contributes to air pollution and is 
a cause of climate change, tackle rising obesity and associated 
conditions and improve both quality of life and quality of place.    
 As well as the many people requiring access, there is a large 
amount of freight movement on Croydon’s road network and hence 
a need to ensure that the efficient movement of people and goods 
is maintained.  Less Fewer people regularly cycle in Croydon than in the rest of 
London and Croydon Metropolitan Centre has been identified as 
the London Metropolitan Centre with the greatest potential for 
cycling.  
 There is the opportunity to improve Wi-Fi and broadban d 
services to increase the attractiveness of Croydon to businesses 
and make it easier to do computer based work from home and thus 
reduce the need to commute to work. 
 As emphasised by the Covid-19 pandemic there is a shift 
towards homeworking for computer based industries. With the shift 
towards homeworking d emand for telecommunications equipment 
will increase. 
Where we want to be 
Strategic Objective 8: Improve accessibility, connectivity, 
sustainability and ease of movement to, from and within the 
borough.  
Strategic Objective 9: Ensure the responsible use of land and 
natural resources and management of waste to mitigate and 
adapt to climate change.  
Strategic Objective 10:  Improve the quality and accessibility of 
green space and nature, whilst protecting a nd enhancing 
biodiversity.  
Strategic Objective 11:  Tackle flood risk by making space for 
water and utilising sustainable urban drainage systems.   
 271 How we are going to get there 
Policy SP8: Transport and Communication 
SP8.1 In order to deliver a transport and communications  network capable of supporting growth over the plan period the Council will apply a 
presumption in favour of development for new transport schemes which meet the requirements of Policy SP8 and other applicable  policies of 
the development plan.  The transpor tation and communication network should support the community, environmental, and economic health 
of the borough by connecting communities, promoting physical activity through transport, reducing vehicle emissions, and crea ting vibrancy 
through foot traffi c in the borough’s centres. A functioning and accessible network is essential to accommodating growth . 
Airport City  
SP8.2 The Council and its partners will enhance the borough's sub -regional transport role to support its position as a major business, hotel 
and c onferencing destination serving London's airports and the Coast to Capital economic area (see Policy SP3.8).  East Croydon station 
and the surrounding area is the borough’s main transport hub. Development should enhance the station’s sub -regional transport  role as a 
major business, hotel and conferencing destination serving London's airports and the Coast to Capital economic area. This enh ancement 
should support the establishment of cycle hubs at East and West Croydon stations, including safeguarding land  
 
Pattern of development and accessibility  
SP8.3  The Council will actively manage the pattern of urban growth and the use of land to make the fullest use of public transport and co -
locate facilities in order to reduce the need to travel . Development will be supported if it improves conditions for active travel and encourage 
modal shift by:  
a) Furthering Healthy Streets principles; and  
b) Reducing the need to own a private car or reduce the number of cars owned in a household and encourage active sustainable mod es 
of travel through design.  
SP8.4 Major development proposals will be required to be supported by transport assessments, travel plans, construction logistics p lans and 
delivery/servicing plans.  Improving public transport within Croydon is a key way to encourage mod al shift. This will help to improve 
Croydon's transport network overall. Development should promote and support public transport improvements, including enhancem ents and 
extensions to the bus and tram networks and related facilities, bus rapid transit rout es and metroisation of rail services . 
Sustainable travel choice and Telecommunication’s   
 272 SP8.5 The Council will support improvement in the borough’s Wi -Fi, fibre optic broadband and mobile broadband in order to reduce the need 
to travel, encourage higher levels  of home working, assist independent living, support inward investment and improve the economic 
competitiveness of Croydon Opportunity Area and the borough's District Centres . The Council will support improvement in the borough's Wi -
Fi, fibre optic broadba nd and mobile broadband in order to reduce the need to travel, encourage higher levels of home working, assist 
independent living, support inward investment and improve the economic competitiveness of Croydon Opportunity Area and the bo rough's 
District Cen tres 
SP8.6 The Council and its partners will improve conditions for walking and enhance the pedestrian experience by:  Croydon’s topography is 
characterised by large hills, particularly to the south of the borough making walking and cycling more difficult and enc ouraging car 
dependence. With the creation of sustainable communities in mind development must consider to the pattern of urban growth and  make the 
fullest use of public transport. Where supported by multi -modal accessibility and within 800m of the Croydon  Opportunity Area or Town 
Centres development density should reflect the sites ability to reduce the need to travel and enable sustainable travel when travel is 
necessary.  
a) Ensuring ‘‘access for a ll’’ principles are adhered to;  
b) Increasing permeability, conn ectivity and legibility of redeveloped sites;  
c) Improving crossings, in particular within Croydon Opportunity Area, District Centres and around schools;  
d) Enhancing footpaths, strategic walking routes and links through green spaces to ensure a coherent pedestr ian network;  
e) Creating pedestrian streets from underused side streets and delivery lanes off main streets in Croydon Opportunity Area and t he 
District Centres;  
f) Improving way finding in the Croydon Opportunity Area, District Centres and on cycle routes (in cluding the implementation of the 
‘Legible London’ scheme);  
g) De-cluttering the streetscape and avoiding unnecessary footway interruptions in new schemes and existing public realm;  
h) Enabling the widening of footways where feasible on overcrowded routes; and   
 273 i) Promoting the identification and implementation of accessible, safe, visible and convenient direct cycle and walking routes t o Croydon 
Opportunity Area, the borough’s District Centres, transport interchanges, schools and community facilities through detail ed policies within 
the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals . Policy deleted  
SP8.7 The Council, its partners and developers will provide new and improved cycle infrastructure by:  
a) Enhancing and expanding the cycle network to deliver a more coherent  network;  
b) The creation of new cycle routes through development sites improving permeability and connectivity;  
c) Promoting the creation of segregated and priority cycle lanes;  
d) Providing clear cycle advance stop lines and other markings at junctions;  
e) Ensuri ng new development and improvements to public transport interchanges include adequate provision for cyclists that meet, or 
exceed, minimum security/design standards;  
f) Enabling the establishment of cycle hubs at East and West Croydon Station, safeguarding l and where necessary;  
g) Improving cycle facilities at the borough’s schools, colleges, District Centres and railway stations; and  
h) Requiring the provision of cycle parking in new developments and at key transport hub stations to encourage multi -modal journeys  
and reduce the need for car use.  Policy deleted   
SP8.8 The Council and its partners will prioritise tram infrastructure provision and network improvements that Centred in Croydon, London 
Trams is currently the city’s only tram network. The tram network supports  good growth, helps tackle the climate emergency and enables 
sustainable movement within the borough. For this reason support will be to development that encourages and supports the prov ision of 
tram infrastructure, network improvements and tram extensions  through : 
a) Provide  Provision of extra capacity to the existing network which serves Croydon Opportunity Area and eases overcrowding on the 
central sections of the network;  
b) Relieve congestion in the tram network overall;   
 274 c) Increase track capacity at pinch po ints to speed up journey times;  
d) Support the Mayor’s and Transport for London's intentions for extension and investment generally in the tram system; Support the 
potential development of a tram depot in New Addington or other locations in the borough;  and  
e) Subject to funding, promote extensions: Streatham, Brixton, Tooting, Bromley, South Wimbledon, Sutton, and Crystal Palace.  
Consideration of opportunities to support extensions to the tram network, both within the borough and with the adjacent autho rities .  
SP8.9 The Council and its partners will encourage rail infrastructure provision and network improvements that:  
a) Provide additional track capacity at East Croydon station, and in the area north thereof, to increase train services and impr ove 
performance on the B righton Main Line railway ; 
b) Enable improved interchange facilities, pedestrian links and increased capacity at the Strategic Interchange s at East and  West 
Croydon railway station s; 
c) Enable access and movement improvements in areas next to rail stations to en courage greater use of the train services ; and 
d) Facilitate ‘Metroisation’ of South London’s rail services; and  
e) Make stations accessible to wheelchair users.  
SP8.10 The Council and its partners will encourage bus infrastructure provision and network improvements th at: 
a) Seek to ease the pressure on West Croydon Bus Station by providing new bus stopping/standing ; Improve bus services in the 
underserved areas in the south of the borough, including Kenley, Selsdon and Sanderstead including demand responsive services  wher e 
appropriate  
b) Seek improvements to orbital bus priority and capacity improvements leading to the Croydon Opportunity Area.  by resolving problems 
along key bus corridors leading to the Croydon Opportunity Area ; 
c) Improve bus interchange in the Croydon Opportu nity Area at peak times including improvements to bus stops and stands; and  
d) Improve bus journey times and reliability.   
 275 SP8.11 Land used for public transport and land required to facilitate future transport operations will be safeguarded unless alterna tive 
facilit ies are provided to enable existing transport operations to be maintained. Land and route alignments to implement transport p roposals 
that have a reasonable prospect of delivery will be incorporated into development proposals.  
Motor vehicle transportation  
SP8.12 The Council and its partners will enable the delivery of electric vehicle charging infrastructure throughout the borough to 
improve air quality and decarbonise private transportation over the plan period.  
SP8.13 New development will be required to contribute to the provision of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, car clubs and car 
sharing schemes.  
SP8.14 The Council will work with developers and all relevant partners to ensure enough space is provided in the Croydon Opportunity  
Area and District Centres for taxi r anks/waiting and coach parking, as well as seeking to improve interchanges at East and West Croydon for 
these modes.  
Parking  
SP8.15 The Council will encourage car free development in Centres,  Car free development will be encouraged in Centres where there 
are high  levels of PTAL86 or when a critical mass of development enables viable alternatives, such as car clubs (while still providing for 
disabled people people with disabilities ). Detailed car parking standards are contained within the Croydon Opportunity Area Pl anning 
Framework and the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Proposals . 
SP8.16 The Council and its partners will seek to limit parking spaces in the borough and aim to reduce the overall amount of surplus  
car parking spaces in the Croydon Opportunity Area  in accordance with the Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework parking 
strategy. The character of streets is a key factor in the perception of pedestrian safety. On street parking blocking sight lines can n egatively 
impact this character. The lack of on-street parking controls should not be a limiting factor for development, street parking availability must 
be taken into account when applying a flexible approach to car parking in town centres. Controlled parking zones should be in troduced in 
areas of t he borough to protect street character and enhance safe travel.  
                                            
 
  
 276 SP8.17 Outside high PTAL areas the Council will apply the standards as set out in the London Plan87. In District Centres where there 
are identified issues of vitality and viability, the need to regene rate such Centres may require a more flexible approach to the provision of 
public car parking. Parking standards for the boroughs District Centres will be assessed based upon the following considerati ons: 
a) The need for regeneration;  
b) Adverse impact on conges tion or air quality;  
c) A lack (now and in future), of public transport;  
d) A lack of existing on or off street parking;  
e) A commitment to provide space for electric and car club vehicles, and parking for disabled people above the minimum threshold s; and  
f) A require ment, via Travel Plans, to reduce provision over time.  Policy deleted  
Efficient and clean movement  
SP8.18 The Council and its partners will seek to improve the efficiency with which people and goods are moved and reduce the 
impacts associated with that movement by: 
a) Addressing pressure points in the street network, including strategic road junctions, by improving conditions for pedestrians , cyclists 
and public transport and maintaining the efficient movement of freight; and  
b) Ensuring travel plans for new and existi ng facilities, address issues with local congestion and promote sustainable travel choices.  
SP8.19 The Council and its partners will promote efficient and sustainable arrangements for the transportation and delivery of freig ht 
by: 
a) Safeguarding existing sites and identifying new sites to enable the transfer of freight to rail;  
b) Safeguarding existing and supporting the provision of new consolidation and ‘break bulk’ facilities through policy to be cont ained 
within the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies and Propos als; and  
                                            
87 London Plan Policy 6.13  
 277 c) Requiring major developments to include transport emission reduction plans to encourage the use of less polluting forms of tr ansport.  
SP8.19A  Croydon is a key business centre and main transport hub in London. Ensuring business as usual despite dev elopment is important 
to support the continued prosperity of these functions. Developments, particularly high rise developments, must be phased to ensure the 
undisrupted movement of the transportation network. Development should seek to avoid disruption to  the successful function of the 
Metropolitan Centre and the borough’s commercial centres taking into account peak business hours .

 280 Why we have taken this approach 
Airport City 
10.2 Croydon is strategically positioned between the Gatwick 
Diamond/south coast and central London. Croydon’s vision 
aspires for the borough to maintain and build on its position as an 
economic hub serving London and the South East region88. 
Croydon’s involvement in the Coast to Capital Local Enterprise 
Partnership reflects this ambition and seeks the creation of 900 
new businesses, 20,000 new jobs and 4,000 additional exporting 
businesses over the next 5 years. The Strategic Policies and its 
associated delivery programmes aim to ensure capacity on the 
transport system, and favour movement of people and goods to 
maintain the borough as a major destination and interchange in 
support of Croydon’s objectives to remain and grow as the 
principal point of business, major retailing, leisure and education in 
South London.  A key focus of the Croydon Local Plan to improve 
the community, environmental, and economic health of the 
borough allo wing for growth. Transportation in the borough 
provides a key opportunity to further health goals in all these 
areas. A modal shift is essential to support growth in homes, jobs 
and associated facilities (major generators of travel demand). 
Active travel i s well known to promote population health, increase 
economic prosperity and improve air quality with reduced car 
travel. This shift in travel modes while addressing current issues 
on the network are essential in enabling growth.  
Pattern of development and accessibility 
10.3 Growth in homes, jobs and associated facilities (major 
generators of travel demand) will be focussed in the Croydon 
Opportunity Area and the District Centres near to areas highly 
accessible by walking and cycling and with high Public Transpor t 
                                            
88 We are Croydon Vision (pages 15- 19) Accessibility Levels, (PTAL), or in areas with development 
opportunities where PTALs or accessibility by walking and cycling 
can be increased by infrastructure improvements. Population in 
the borough is expected to rise by approximately 30,000 by 2031. 
Evidence shows that Croydon Opportunity Area can 
accommodate approximately 10,650 new homes; this will be 
assisted by improved public transport accessibility. Both East and 
West Croydon Stations are designated as Strategic Interchanges 
within the South sub-region of the Mayor’s Transport Strategy. 
The Strategic Interchange concept, in partnership with the Mayor, 
aims to improve orbital public transport travel opportunities, in 
particular linkages between outer London town centres, to ease 
pressure on the central London transport system, and passenger 
dispersal pressures at London’s rail termini. East Croydon has the 
potential for a future link to the High Speed 2 train network via Old 
Oak Common Station, which would also improve access to 
Crossrail; there is also an opportunity to facilitate Gatwick stopping 
services, as well as Thameslink improvements that will provide 
longer and more frequent trains. West Croydon presents 
opportunities for improving interchange between bus, rail, tram 
and Overground services. The Overground East London Line 
already links Croydon with London Underground and the Dockland 
Light Rail and in the future will provide direct services to Crossrail 
via Whitechapel. At present very few people live in Croydon 
Opportunity Area, yet it has the highest public transport 
accessibility levels in the borough with good connectivity to 
London and the wider sub-region. Retention of land used for 
public transport and land required to facilitate future transport 
operations is necessary to enable existing transport operations to 
be maintained and improved, such an approach is in line with the 
London Plan. The Council’s 4 tier employment policy (see Policy 
SP3.2) will assist this process.  Directing the borough ’s growth to  
 281 the Croydon Metropolitan Centre as well as town centres 
decreases residents need to travel and creates sustainable 
transport links between residents the boroughs main employment 
centres and the main transportation hubs for when travel is 
necessary.  
10.4 Directing over a third of the borough's growth up to 2036 to 
Croydon’s Opportunity Area will help to minimise the need to 
travel in order to gain access to services and employment. The 
opportunity for linked trips is maximised by co-location of homes, 
workplaces and other facilities. Croydon Metropolitan Centre is 
rivalled only by the West End and the City of London in terms of 
public transport accessibility and connectivity . As well as focussing 
growth in the Croydon Opportunity Area, it will also be directed to 
those areas and District Centres with high public transport 
accessibility. Improving connectivity assisted by improved way 
finding will also be important to enable a shift to more sustainable 
modes by widening choice and improving alternatives, for example 
the use of car clubs where there is a critical mass of development. 
Improving telecommunications is another measure that would help 
reduce the need to travel; along with more flexible working 
patterns, such as working from home and teleconferencing89. This 
is the borough’s main activity centre and also the main transport 
node, it has high Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL) as 
well as multimodal accessibility. Development should make the 
fullest use of these facilities or take advantage of sites where 
PTALs are high and/or accessible by walking.  90. 
Sustainable travel choice  
                                            
 
 
90 South Sub-regional transport plan (page 28) 
 10.5 Urban realm improvements to increase active travel are 
priorities within the London Plan South sub-regional transport 
plan. TFL’s Healthy Streets Approach provides a framework for 
improving the conditions for active travel on the street. This 
approach provides the 10 Healthy Streets indicators, these 
indicators can be addressed in a variety of ways such as design 
and provision of infrastructure, in many cases the provision of well 
thought through design and infrastructure provision can improve 
more than one of the indicators. Provision of e-bike/e-scooters91, 
racks and charging is one way development can support the 
Healthy Streets Approach. Enabling the use of e-bike/e-scooters 
encourages a shift to active transportation which ties into to 
population health, this also helps to decrease the number of 
private vehicles on the network reducing congestion and 
improving air quality. The provision of sustainable transport in 
developments and micro-mobility hubs and docking stations are 
important ways to reduce the need for the private car and 
encourage active transport across the borough. Issues related to 
walking include concerns about safety, crossing busy roads, and 
indirect/incomplete walking routes to local ameniti es92. Promoting 
high quality places is aided by a complementary public realm 
policy (see Policy SP4). 
10.6 Sites should be designed to include ways to increase public 
access. Where possible sites should enhance green connections 
and integrate lighting to encourage safety and enable 24hour use 
of active transport routes. Improving connectivity assisted by 
improved way finding will also be important to enable a shift to 
more sustainable modes by widening choice and improving 
 
 
  
 282 alternatives, for example the use of car clubs where there is a 
critical mass of development. Other examples include 
improvements to pedestrian and cycle crossings across the 
borough especially at locations identified in the Croydon Vision-
Zero Action Plan . Transport for London’s research indicates that 
the number of residents of Croydon that cycle at least twice a 
week, is among the lowest quartile in London (less than 5%), and 
lower than the neighbouring boroughs to the west. However, the 
level of potential cycle trips is in the highest quartile of Outer 
London boroughs. The trend based on Department for Transport 
monitoring suggests cycling levels will increase to a level 250% 
higher than the 2000 level by 2026. While this is by no means an 
insignificant increase, it is well below the London Mayor’s 
objective of a 400% increase. This implies that to continue doing 
“more of the same” will not lead to sufficiently rapid growth in 
cycling to meet the Mayor’s target. With the expected population 
growth, if new residents behaved in broadly the same way as 
existing residents, an increase in car use would be likely with 
substantially increased pressure on the road network. More 
physically active travel such as walking and cycling will bring 
benefits in terms of individual wellbeing; taking pressure off the 
street and public transport networks; and reducing emissions from 
transport. 
10.7 Parts of the TFL’s London Trams Tramlink are congested 
during peak times, with the network unable to accommodate 
additional trams during peak passenger times . network currentl y 
have passenger congestion . To allow for additional trams to run, 
relieve network congestion and improve journey times pinch points 
in the network at Phipps Bridge and Wandle Park need to be 
addressed. Planned additional trams are predicted to facilitate 
                                            
 
 continued growth in use93. Tramlink extensions could enable a 
further mode shift on a number of corridors in between Croydon 
and elsewhere Bromley, Tooting, Streatham, Brixton, South 
Wimbledon94 and possibly Sutton and Crystal Palace if tram 
extension proposals  these extensions were to come forward. 
10.8 In 2014 Transport for London undertook public consultation 
on the principle of the Dingwall Loop, which proposes extending 
London Tramlink along Dingwall Road and linking to Wellesley 
Road. The proposed loop would allow Tramlink to continue to run 
a reliable service, provide more network capacity and would allow 
more tram services to operate between central Croydon and the 
eastern branches in the future. Tramlink currently operates on a 
oneway loop along George Street, Church Street, Tamworth Road 
and Wellesley Road . In 2020 the Council commissioned the 
Croydon Corridor Improvement Study to assess the suitability of 
the boroughs corridors to accommodate public transport 
improvements with the goal of unlocking housing and jobs. The 
corridors were evaluated as appropriate for supporting a transit 
based solution. The Tier 1 corridors were evaluated as being the 
most suitable for a transit based solution. 
10.9 Transport for London has consulted on three different 
options and undertook a further round of consultation in 2015. 
Subject to the consultation, funding and the proposal being 
endorsed by the Mayor, an application will be made to the 
Department for Transport for a Transport and Works Act Order. 
Construction is anticipated to begin in spring 2018 and be 
complete by autumn 2020. Improving telecommunications is 
another measure that would help reduce the need to travel; along 
  
 283 with more flexible working patterns, such as working from home 
and teleconferencing. 
10.10 In addition to the Dingwall Loop, TfL London Trams 
Tramlink  is currently developing a number of other improvements 
to support frequency and capacity increases on the network 
including ; the Wandle Flyover Doubling proposal involves double-
tracking of the single-track tramway between Wandle Park and 
Reeves Corner tram stops to enable an increase in frequency to 
up to 23 trams per hour. The Old Town Loop/ Reeves Corner 
Turnback proposal involves a turnback facility on the western side 
of Croydon Town Centre to enable proposed services from South 
Wimbledon to turn back without crossing the town centre, allowing 
frequency improvements on the Wimbledon branch. Transport for 
London also has aspirations for Tramlink the tram network to 
connect to the Northern Line at Colliers Wood  South Wimbledon 
and Crossrail 2 at Wimbledon. The Reeves Corner westbound 
tram stop proposal involves the potential introduction of a 
westbound tram stop on Cairo New Road, opposite the existing 
eastbound platform. The Beckenham Junction doubling proposal 
involves double-tracking of part or all of the tramway between 
Harrington Road and Beckenham Junction to enable more reliable 
and higher frequency services. The Elmers End line 
enhancements will provide a second platform, siding and some 
new double-tracki ng; this will reduce reducing  eastbound journey 
times, increase  increasing network resiliency and enable Tramlink 
enabling trams to run a more flexible timetable ; and t here is also 
potential for a Tramlink tram extension beyond New Addington 
tram stop and twin tracking as part of the redevelopment and 
regeneration of New Addington District Centre and other tram 
extensions (and new related facilities) to the current network. 
Further improvements that would improve the trams service would 
be investing in more trams, upgrades to power systems and 
increasing the stabling and maintenance capacity for the trams  10.11 . Improvements to East and West Croydon Stations 
will play an important role in the proposed radial corridor solutions 
for the South London sub-region. Planned/funded improvements 
on the East Croydon-London Bridge/Victoria Corridor are 
predicted to reduce passenger overcrowding through the medium 
term.  
10.12 Network Rail’s proposed Brighton Main Line (BML) 
upgrade seeks to enhance the capacity and performance of the 
BML in Network Rail’s Control Period 6 (2019-2024). It is an 
uncommitted scheme, but the Council supports the BML upgrade. 
Network Rail is currently working up the technical detail to inform 
choices by Government on investment priorities.  
10.13 The major operational constraints on the BML are 
principally in Croydon, and the BML upgrade seeks to alleviate 
these. Specifically in Croydon the proposed work would include: 
 2 extra platforms at East Croydon station, making eight in total; 
 Additional passenger circulation/concourse space in East 
Croydon station to tie in with the above, and also to provide a much 
improved station experience; 
 An additional track or tracks north of East Croydon station, in 
addition to the present five (this is the element that requires land 
outside the existing railway boundary); and 
 Grade separation of numerous flat junction conflicts in the 
Selhurst/Norwood Junction/East Croydon/West Croydon area.  
Paragraph deleted  
10.14 Network Rail’s analysis suggests that at least a third 
more peak trains will be achievable by 2043 through an upgrade

Motor vehicle transportation 
10.17 The requirement for developers to provide a plan (on 
certain developments) to reduce car use and promote low 
emission vehicles and alternative forms of transport originates 
from the need to improve the borough’s air quality, reduce carbon 
emissions and achieve a shift to more sustainable lower impact 
modes of transport in order to improve quality of life in Croydon. In 
locations with high public transport accessibility and good 
connections to walking and cycling routes, housing developments 
that are car free or have low car ownership, or car clubs can 
provide a feasible option. 
10.18 Ensuring adequate coach95 and taxi interchange at 
East and West Croydon96 and other District Centre railways 
stations, such as Purley and Norbury, will be important97 in 
encouraging the reduction of private transportation.

97 Borough wide Transport Study(final draft) (page 272) Parking 
10.19 Parking in the Croydon Opportunity Area requires 
rationalisation98; to ensure car parks are where they need to be to 
serve the business and residential community. Specific details are 
set out in the Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework. Car 
parking must be considered in the context of capacity on the road 
network, particularly the A23 and A232. Pressure on the A23 and 
within the Croydon Opportunity Area will be addressed over the 
plan period through detailed transport feasibility studies, site 
specific proposals contained in the Croydon Opportunity Area 
Planning Framework, Infrastructure Delivery Plan and 
interventions through the Croydon Local Plan’s Detailed Policies 
and Proposals Improving and maintaining the character of the 
borough’s streets is important to improving accessibility. On 
narrow streets cars often park on both sides of the road detracting 
from the multi modal use of the street. Controlled parking zones 
can be used to protect street character in areas where parking 
accommodated on the street would impede the safe use of the 
public highway. Controlled parking zones can be implemented to, 
ensure parking related to development does not impede active 
transport on the street and allows existing residents to park safely 
and effectively. Where this is a requirement the developer will be 
required to wholly or partially fund the CPZ implementation and 
the development will be excluded from obtaining resident parking 
permits . 
Efficient and clean movement 
10.20 Motor transport is the third largest sector contributing 
to CO2 emissions in Croydon. Of these CO2 emissions, up to 66% 
are from car use. Estimated traffic flow in the borough has 
 
  
 285 remained fairly constant with levels in 2008 a little over 1993 
levels. Transport for London studies indicate that about half of all 
car trips here are of less than two kilometres. Segregated cycle 
routes indicate a safe and recommended route for cyclists. 
Providing segregated cycle lanes leading to the Croydon Growth 
Zone encourages a safe, direct and sustainable route to the CMC. 
Segregated cycle routes such as London Road, Mitcham Road, 
Addiscombe/Barclay road and South End/Brighton Road would be 
supported . 
10.21 Parts of the road network across the south sub-region 
operate at capacity, with the inner areas being particularly 
affected. Population and employment growth anticipated in this 
area will lead to an increase in economic activity. Even with 
currently funded public transport improvements it is likely that 
'vehicle kilometres', particularly lorries and vans, will increase. 
Without the right measures in place this will affect the resilience of 
the network, reducing journey time reliability and increased 
journey times99. Croydon is strategically positioned between the 
Gatwick Diamond/south coast and central London. Croydon’s 
vision aspires for the borough to maintain and build on its position 
as an economic hub serving London and the South East region. 
Development is an essential part of growth in Croydon and is 
necessary to furthering the borough’s strategic role  as the premier 
business location in South London. With an increasing number of 
developments proposed in the borough’s centres proximate 
developments will need to be phased in order to ensure freight 
and construction vehicles are not locking up the network in 
multiple locations at the same time.  
10.22 Improving conditions on the A23 for pedestrians, 
cyclists, public transport and freight will be a key priority over the 
                                            
99 Borough Wide Transport Study(final draft) (page 53) plan period, with the aim of reducing congestion along A roads 
and the approach roads which can suffer disproportional delays. 
Approach road delays at the Fiveways junction is a key 
disincentive to orbital movements across the borough. 
Improvements will need to consider the A23 corridor as a whole to 
ensure the needs of street users and improvements of public 
realm are coordinated. Key junctions for consideration include 
Purley Cross gyratory, and Fiveways. The main orbital route 
through Croydon in the east-west direction is the A232, connecting 
Croydon with Bromley and Sutton. The A232 meets the main 
north-south route of A23 from the east at, and just north of the 
Fiveways junction, and from the west at Purley Way/Croydon 
Road. The South London Sub-Regional Transport Plan informed 
the London Plan and supports the levels of growth contained in 
the London Plan and consequently the growth outlined in Policy 
SP2 and SP3. Furthermore the South Sub-Regional Transport 
Plan identifies Croydon Opportunity Area, the A23 Fiveways 
junction and A23 Purley Cross/Godstone Road junction as areas 
with opportunities to improve footways, cycle-ways, lighting, 
crossings and bus lanes that could result in significant 
improvements to the urban realm and the regeneration of central 
Croydon.  Transport for London undertake feasibility studies for all 
proposed transport schemes, such studies look at both the 
financial and engineering considerations. In the case of 
improvements to the A23 and Croydon Opportunity Area, it is 
acknowledged that some interventions may not always be 
deliverable, as such the Strategic Policies proposes to monitor 
conditions for all modes at pressure points in the street network 
and at key junctions (see Appendix 8). This will be carried out 
alongside ensuring that the impact of specific development 
proposals on the network are assessed and mitigated.  As a 
premier business location in London the function of the transport  
 286 network is essential to maintaining business as usual. While 
delivery to and servicing of developments is a necessary function, 
where possible should it take place outside peak hours (i.e. 
avoiding deliveries between 7am-10am, 12pm-2pm and 4pm-7pm 
on weekdays).  
10.23 Transport for London and Croydon announced the 
preferred option on 9 February 2016, to widen the existing A23 
bridge over the railway and Epsom Road, allowing the removal of 
A232 traffic from Fiveways Corner. The preferred option delivers 
traffic benefits and improvements to the local pedestrian and cycle 
facilities. Further design work will be completed ahead of a public 
in Autumn 2016 on the highway design of the preferred option. 
Construction is due to start in winter 2018/19.  Safe and efficient 
movement across the borough is an important factor in 
accommodating growth. Construction and delivery traffic are to 
essential element to enable this growth. Traffic related to 
construction and deliveries can have negative impacts on local 
amenity, air quality and the environment. When proposing 
development, measures to better manage freight and construction 
vehicles must be demonstrated to mitigate adverse the advers e 
effects these vehicles may have on the network. This mitigation 
should limit the risk of damage to existing infrastructure such as 
dram and rail tracks. Where developments are located close to 
train lines further measures should be taken to ensure 
development does not pose any safety issues on the network 
leading to disruption to service.  
10.24 Freight movements form a significant component of 
traffic flows on Croydon’s road network, with demand generated 
from the major retail outlets in the Croydon Metropolitan Centre 
and the extensive retail and business park areas to the west of the 
                                            
100 Borough Wide Transport Study(final draft) (page 267) borough. The borough also has many Local and District Centres 
whose businesses rely on deliveries being made on-street from a 
multitude of suppliers100. The sidings at Purley, currently occupied 
by an aggregates company, is an active rail freight site.

Why we need this policy
10.24A  Croydon has a strategic objective to improve 
accessibility, sustainability and ease of movement to, from and 
within the borough. 
10.24B  Strategic Policy SP11 sets out the framework for 
ensuring business as usual despite development. This policy 
provides the detail to this structure identifying the detailed 
approach to ensuring the continued safe and effective movement 
of the network.  10.24C  To enable growth and the continued functioning of 
the transport network the phasing of development must take into 
account other developments coming forward with regards to 
phasing. 
10.24D  This policy provides further requirements in terms of 
the phasing and managing development so as to ensure the 
continued safe and efficient movement of the network. 
 288 Polic y DM 28A: Ensuring the safe and effective movement of the network 
How the policy works  
10.24E  While growth is a priority for the borough, this growth 
should not interfere with the day- to-day prosperity and function of 
the borough’s centres and transit network. Development deliveries 
contribute to large volumes of congestion caused by servicing and 
deliveries. Innovative solutions such as the implementation of last 
mile deliveries by foot, cycle or zero emission vehicles will be 
supported. Development is encouraged to identify opportunities for 
last mile logics hubs. 
10.24F  With large amounts of development ongoing in the 
borough, appropriate phasing across an area is necessary to ensure to the ongoing safe and secure movement of the transit 
network. This requires development to be sensitive to the context 
in which it is taking place giving consideration to proximate 
schemes coming forward at similar times. Potential impacts on the 
network related to the movement of large construction vehicles 
from multiple sites should be mitigated through planning and 
coordination between schemes. 
10.24G  While on site, major development requires large 
amounts of deliveries and servicing, these activities require the 
use of heavy construction vehicles and often result in disruption on 
the network. Site phasing must be under taken in order to reduce 
the impact of these activities on the network. During construction DM28A .1 To ensure the continued movement of the road network while enabling growth, major development must:  
a) Take into account the development of the overall area;  
b) Be phased while on site; an d, 
c) Support innovative solutions to ensure the lowest amount of disruption during development.  
DM28A .2 The amount of construction associated with growth in the Croydon Opportunity Area and the Purley Way Transformation Area 
needs to be delivered through car eful management and a reduction in the number of deliveries and freight traffic. To support this, 
development should:  
a) Minimise the need for freight trips and seek to manage freight and servicing on an area -wide basis;  
b) Provide for freight consolidation;  
c) Adopt new technologies to enable efficient servicing and deliveries to sites; and  
d) Provide onsite servicing areas to allow all goods and refuse collection vehicles likely to service the development at the sam e time to 
be conveniently loaded and unloaded.   
 289 development can mitigate disruption to existing residents and 
businesses by providing off street servicing space or implementing 
freight reduction measures to ensure that deliveries and servicing 
requirements do not have a negative impact on the road network. 
This is particularly important for high density residential or 
commercial developments in the Croydon Metropolitan Centre or 
town centres that are forecast to generate significant freight and 
deliveries movements.

Report1128Final.pdf  10.28 Croydon suffers from congestion in a number of 
locations identified in the Croydon Opportunity Area Planning 
Framework - Strategic Transport Study. Congestion hinders 
Croydon’s economic regeneration and development. A study 
from Portland, USA has calculated that congestion costs it 
$844m annually101. Congestion and use of private transport also 
leads to increased carbon emissions in the borough. Croydon 
produces 1,660kt of CO 2 a year which puts it at seventh highest 
out of 33 London boroughs. The London Plan includes a target to 
reduce CO 2 emissions by 60% by 2025, the Climate Change Act 
sets out that emissions will be reduced by 80% by 2050 (based 
on 1990 levels). 
  
 291 Policy DM29: Promoting sustainable travel and reducing congestion 
DM29.1 To promote sustainable growth in Croydon and reduce the impac t of traffic congestion development should:  
a. Promote measures to increase the use of public transport, cycling and walking . Create, enhance and promote measures to increase 
active travel and reduce the need to make private vehicle trips;  
b. Have a positive i mpact and must not have a detrimental  impact on highway safety for pedestrians, cyclists, public transport users and 
private vehicles; and 
c. Not result in a severe impact on the transport networks local to the site  which would detract from the economic and e nvironmental 
regeneration of the borough by making Croydon a less accessible and less attractive location in which to develop ; 
d. Reduce the impacts of suburban intensification development in low PTAL areas (PTAL 2 and below) by integrating and providing for 
enhanced active travel measures within the development;  
e. Implement measures that support the Mayor of London’s Healthy Streets Approach, incl uding the design of development and  
f. Ensure that the movement of pedestrians, cycles, public transport and emergency services are not impeded by deliveries and 
servicing requirements.  
 
 
How the policy works 
10.29 All development has an impact on traffic movement 
in the borough. In order to reduce the impact on traffic movement 
the Council will require new development to promote measures 
to increase the use of public transport, cycling and walking. This 
includes ensuring new development has good access to public 
transport and has good links to main pedestrian and cycle routes 
in the borough. Other measures might include bike hire 
schemes, car clubs, other shared transport schemes, bus stop 
infrastructure, bus services, on demand transport services, cycle 
routes, cycle parking, public rights of way, footpaths, pedestrian 
facilities and crossings, tram stops and infrastructure.  The design 
of new developments should prioritise walking and cycling routes into and through developments over routes for cars. Designs 
should also prioritise access to public transport over accessibility 
to private motor cars.   
10.30 Some development would result in an unacceptable 
a severe impact on the local transport networks. Such 
development will not be permitted. Transport for London and 
Network Rail will be consulted on planning applications that 
could result in such an impact on the borough.  
 292 10.31 All major development proposals102 should 
demonstrate by means of a Transport Assessment ; Travel Plan ; 
Construction Logistics Plan; and Delivery & Servicing Plan, or 
equivalents, how they will promote measures to increase the use 
of public transport, cycling and walking and that they will not 
result in a severe impact on the local transport networks. 
10.32 The extent of the local road network will vary 
depending on the location, scale and type of the development 
but will always include the routes from the development site to 
the Strategic Road Network. For developments located on a 
Strategic Road the local road network will include the entire 
Strategic Road Network within and leading into the borough. 
10.33 The extent of the local public transport network 
includes bus routes within a 10 minute walk, tram routes and 
train stations within a 15 minute walk and cycle and walking 
routes within 15 minutes of the development. The exact extent of 
the local transport networks should be considered in the 
Transport Assessment.  
10.34 The Strategic Poli cies require new developments to 
increase the permeability and connectivity for pedestrians and 
cyclists of their sites and to create new cycle routes in their 
developments.

Why we need this policy
10.35 Croydon has strategic objectives to improve 
accessibility, connectivity, sustainability and ease of movement 
to, from and within the borough and to ensure the responsible 
use of land and natural resources and management of waste to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change. 
10.36 Croydon Local Plan Strategic Policy SP8 sets basic 
car parking standards by referring to pan-London standards set 
by the London Plan. These are sufficient for managing the 
overall provision of car parking in new development. However as 
some potential users of car parking have particular requirements 
these need to be covered in a Croydon-specific policy. 
10.37 This policy provides further requirements in terms of 
the quality of provision and how the parking should be provided. 
10.38 Occupiers of affordable housing also require car 
parking spaces although on average car ownership is 30-60% 
less than that of owner occupied homes.  
 294 Policy DM30: Car and cycle parking in new development 
DM30.1 To manage the impact that parking provision has on traffic generation, and the impact of traffic on the climate development 
must ensure that car parking provision is in accordance with the standar ds set out in Table  10.1. 
To promote sustainable growth in Croydon and reduce the impact of car parking new development must:  
a) Reduce the impact of car parking in any development located in areas of good public trans port accessibility103 or areas of existing on -
street parking stress;  
b) Ensure that the movement of pedestrians, cycles, public transport and emergency services is not impeded by the provision of c ar 
parking;  
c) Ensure that highway safety is not compromised  by the  provision of car parking including off street parking where it requires a new 
dropped kerb on the strategic road network and other key roads identified on the Policies Map;  
d) If the development would result in the loss of existing car parking spaces, demons trate that there is no need for these car parking 
spaces  by reference to occupancy rates at peak times ; 
e) Provide car and cycle parking spaces as set out in  table 10.1  
Ensure that cycle parking is designed so that it is secure and can also be used for parkin g for mobility scooters and motor cycles; and 
Provide car parking for affordable homes at an average rate not less than 2/3 that of other tenures . 
DM30.2  Provide parking on -site to ensure that parking generated by the development does not contribute more t han 5% increase in parking 
stress within a 200m catchment of the development; On site parking stress in Croydon is assessed as being at capacity when 85 % of 
parking stress is reached.  
DM30.3  Provide a dedicated area for motorcycle parking with ground anch ors (in any location in the bor ough).  
DM30.4  Ensure that there is not a significant detrimental impact on the movement of pedestrians, cycles, public transport and emerge ncy 
services due t o the provision of car parking.  
                                            
103 Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) rating of 4 or more  
 295 DM30.5  Ensure that highway safety is  not compromised by the provision of new off -street parking where it requires a new drop kerb or cross 
over (including on roads identified on the policies map where planning permission is required for any ne w drop kerb or crossover).  
DM30.6  Ensure that ent rances or vehicle crossovers for new development do not have any detrimental impact on the functioning of bus and 
cycle routes to maintain the effective operation o f sustainable transport routes.  
DM30.7  To support reduced on -site parking provision  in areas  of adequate public transportation and multimodal accessibility major 
developments must provide car club or pool car spaces (which may include on street spaces subject to assessment by the counci l) or use 
existing, local car clubs where the operator confir ms that there is availability for use of the existing car club by the new residents. There will 
be a requirement for the residents to be made members of the car club for 3 years at cost to the developer.  
DM30.8  Reduced provision of car parking, car -lite an d car -free development will be supported in areas of high public transport and active 
travel accessibility where on street parking can be managed through the presence of parking controls.  
DM30.9  Cycle parking provision will be in accordance with the London  Plan standards, including secure, waterproof, enclosed with charging 
provision for electric bicycles and mobility scooters and space for cargo bikes and adapted bikes where necessary.

How the policy works 
10.38A Parking provision must be managed to ensure sustainable 
travel, free and active movement of the network as well as ensure 
that on-street parking is equitably distributed between 
developments to maintain consistent character of development in 
an area. If a development is forecast to have an impact upon on-
street parking then a parking stress survey to determine whether there is sufficient capacity within the existing on-street parking 
bays to accommodate the increased demand will be expected. 
Severe parking stress is considered to be where 85% of capacity 
of the kerbside parking space is met or exceeded. Managing the 
balance between on and off street parking ensures that the 
character of development remains balanced along a street  
 298 minimising the risk of a development taking all the on-street 
parking meaning an adjacent development must accommodate all 
parking on-site. To manage this parking stress attributable to each 
development is limited to a maximum of 5%. In line with industry 
best practice, parking stress surveys should be undertaken in line 
with the Richmond methodology. The survey methodology outlines  
how parking stress should be calculated indicating elements such 
as the time of day and the area of the road to be measured. The 
Richmond methodology uses a 5m car space for the survey, 
calculating stress based on actual number of parked cars and 
available spaces on the night of the survey, rather that the 
theoretical space available. The cumulative impacts of 
development that is permitted or is under construction within the 
parking stress survey area must be taken into account when 
calculating the capacity of on street parking.  
10.39 The London Plan sets out maximum car parking 
standards for residential developments based on public transport 
accessibility levels and local character. In many schemes in 
areas such as Croydon Opportunity Area and District Centres 
where there is a minimum Public Transport Accessibility Level22 
rating of 5 , the Council will consider developments with a 
reduced amount of parking. If a reduced amount of car parking is 
provided then a corresponding proportionate increa se in The 
provision of car club or pool car spaces will be supported in order 
to supplement public transport provision. Provision of other car 
sharing schemes such as peer to peer sharing, a method of 
sharing that facilitates private car rental and car sha ring schemes 
will be supported.  need to be provided to compensate for the 
reduction in private car parking. This will need to be at a rate of 
one car club or pool car space for every twenty private car 
parking spaces that have not been provided . This is to  ensure 
that reduced overall levels of car parking do not result in 
increased pressure on street parking, particularly in those areas 
without Controlled Parking Zones . 10.40 Growth will take place throughout the urban area of 
the borough through development that complements and 
enhances the character of each area. As each area of the 
borough becomes more sustainable through growth it should 
encourage greater provision of public transport in areas that 
currently have a low Public Transport Accessibility Level. 
Therefore, no allowance is proposed for higher levels of car 
parking in residential development in these areas. 
10.41 It is recognised that sustainable growth of the 
suburbs will take place over the whole Plan period and that in the 
early years the public transport infrastructure necessary to 
support that growth may not exist in all areas with a low Public 
Transport Accessibility Level of 0, 1a or 1b. Therefore, in the 
early years of the Plan, it may therefore be acceptable for an 
increased provision of private car parking to be provided in 
developments in areas with a low Public Transport Accessibility 
Level if justified by a Transport Assessment. The Transport 
Assessment needs to demonstrate that the public transport 
provision will not be sufficient to service the development within 
the first three years following granting of planning permission, 
that it is not reasonable to walk or cycle to the nearest railway 
station, and that there is no interest from car clubs in operating 
from the location at the time planning permission is sought. 
10.42 Car parking in new development can be visually 
intrusive and reduce the amount of land available for outdoor 
private amenity space within developments. In areas of good 
public transport accessibility new Where proposed, 
developments must reduce the visual impact of car parking. This 
may include use of underground car parking, reduced provision 
of car parking spaces within the development or should start with 
active promotion of alternatives to private car use including car 
clubs, encouraging use of public transport by residents and 
enhanced provision of covered and secure cycle parking .    
 299 10.43 Car parking, when integrated into new development, 
can enhance the street scene. However, car parking can also be 
a barrier to pedestrians, cycles and emergency services as well 
as detracting from the character of an area. Therefore, it is 
important that car parking provision is considered at the outset of 
a development , including safe segregated pedestrian access to 
the site to encourage walking, and is fully integrated in the 
design  of the development . To encourage safe access to off 
street parking and servicing areas, development should be 
designed to allow for all vehicles to enter and exit in forward gear 
for highway safety reasons . 
10.44 Some areas of the borough already have a street 
parking permit system in operation and existing on-street parking 
is at a premium. In these locations developments will also need 
to promote alternatives to private car use, again including car 
clubs, encouraging use of public transport by residents and 
enhanced provision of covered and secure cycle parking. 
10.45 Not all existing car parking is needed and sometimes 
the redevelopment of an existing car park (either public or 
private) will help to provide much needed homes, social 
infrastructure and employment. In order to ensure that sufficient 
car parking is provided in schemes involving the redevelopment 
of an existing car park, applicants will need to demonstrate that 
there is no need for any car parking spaces that are proposed to 
be lost. Need should be demonstrated through occupancy 
surveys of both the existing car park and other car parks serving 
the same area and must cover a range of times and dates such 
that peak operating times are surveyed. 10.46 It is important that spaces provided for an on-site car 
club or pool car are used by a provider of these vehicles. The 
Council will enter a legal agreement with developers of qualifying 
developments to ensure that the spaces are used for their 
intended purpose. 
10.47 In circumstances where the car club is not 
accessible to the wider community, in low density areas or where 
it is not commercially viable, the Council will expect developers 
to work with a car club operator to find a suitable site from which 
a car club would operate. In these circumstances the developer 
will be expected to fund a Traffic Regulation Order and the lining 
and signing of an on-street parking bay. This will ensure the 
parking space will be used by a car club operator and is 
accessible to both the development and the wider community.  
10.48 Croydon recognises that in many residential 
developments parking spaces are allocated to particular units 
and that electric car charging points may not be provided in the 
correct spaces. Therefore, all spaces in residential developments 
need to be enabled for future use by electric cars by ensuring the 
necessary infrastructure with the exception of actual charging 
points is integrated from the start.  
10.49 Non-residential developments are less likely to have 
a single assigned parking space per unit. Therefore, electric car 
parking spaces should be provided in accord with London Plan 
standards. 
10.50 The Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework 
provides further guidance on provision of car parking within the 
Croydon Opportunity Area.

Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies
 Strategic Objective 1

 Policy SP1.1  
Why we need this policy
10.51 Croydon has strategic objectives to be the premier 
business location in South London and the Gatwick Diamond, to 
ensure that new development is high quality and integrates with 
the borough’s built heritage, and to ensure the responsible use of 
land. Croydon Local Plan Strategic Policy SP1.1 requires all new 
development to contribute to enhancing a sense of place and 
improve the character of an area.  10.52 The Strategic Policies of the Croydon Local Plan 
encourage temporary uses to use under used and vacant spaces 
and buildings in the borough. This approach to the re-use of 
vacant spaces would be undermined if temporary car parks were 
allowed on these spaces as they can be easier to set up 
compared to other temporary uses. Temporary car parks could 
also undermine future car parking strategies for the borough. 
10.53 The Strategic Policies of the Croydon Local Plan 
support the use of vacant buildings and cleared sites by cultural 
and creative industries and community uses. It also supports 
their use for food growing and tree planting. 
Policy DM31: Restricting temporary car parks 
To enhance a sense of place and  to improve the character of an area, permission will only be granted to use empty spaces for temporary 
uses that are not car parks , unless in temporary su bstitution for a nearby permanent car park undergoing redevelopment .  
 301 How the policy works 
 
10.54  Cultural and creative industries and community uses 
are considered preferable to temporary car parks as they are 
likely to bring greater economic and regeneration benefits to the 
borough. Temporary car parks are also less likely to improve the 
character of an area or contribute to enhancing a sense of place. 
10.55 Temporary uses can include both specialist 
organisations such as ACAVA and Acme Studios and community 
groups, along with temporary landscaping or urban agriculture.  
10.56 Where a temporary car park is required because a 
nearby permanent car park is undergoing redevelopment 
(including replacement car parking), the Council may accept a 
proposal for a temporary car park to ensure that there is 
continued provision of car parking in a locality whilst 
redevelopment takes place.  
 302 Facilitating rail and tram improvements 
Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies 
 Strategic Objective 8  
 Policy SP8  
Why we need this policy
10.57 Network Rail, as part of a programme of capacity 
improvements on the Brighton Mainline railway, are proposing to 
construct an additional island platform at East Croydon station 
complete with two additional tracks. In addition, a new track is 
proposed to run from East Croydon station to Windmill Bridge 
Junction (where the routes to London Victoria and London Bridge 
divide) as well as a new grade separated junction. This will mean 
that trains running to and from London Victoria and London 
Bridge will be able to run into and out of East Croydon station 
simultaneously which they cannot do at the moment. 
10.58 The additional platform at East Croydon station, 
additional track to and grade separated junction at Windmill 
Bridge Junction will each require some land currently outside of 
Network Rail’s ownership. To ensure that developments which 
would prevent the upgrading of this section of the Brighton 
Mainline from taking place do not occur in this area, a policy is 
proposed to safeguard the land for works required to upgrade the 
railway line. 
10.59 Network Rail also requires additional land whilst the 
improvement works are underway to support them (such as 
supply sites and access points). Therefore, additional land is 
identified on which Network Rail must be consulted about all proposals for development and safeguard against any 
development which would have a negative impact on the ability 
to upgrade the Brighton Mainline. 
10.60 Tramlink  The Transport for London London Trams is 
currently developing a number of improvements to support 
frequency and capacity increases on the network including: 
 A loop around Dingwall Road; 
 The Wandle Flyover Doubling proposal involving double-
tracking of the single-track tramway between Wandle Park and 
Reeves Corner tram stops; 
 The Old Town Loop/Reeves Corner Turnback proposal; 
 A Reeves Corner westbound tram stop; 
 Double-tracking of part or all of the tramway between 
Harrington Road and Beckenham Junction; 
 Elmers End line enhancements; 
 Tram fleet enhancements; and  
 Potential for a tram Tramlink  extension with a turn around 
facility beyond the current New Addington tram stop and twin 
tracking as part of the redevelopment and regeneration of New 
Addington District. 
  
 303 Policy DM32:  Facilitating rail and tram improvements 
Development wi ll not be supported where it might prejudice104 the implementation of : 
a) Station improvement schemes or other proposals to upgrade train services along the Brighton Main Line corridor; or  
b) Infrastructure e xtensions or other operational improvements to increase capacity of the Tramlink network.  
                                            
104 A prejudicial impact on the upgrading of the Brighton Mainline is defined as any impact which would prevent improvement works taking place including but not limited 
to conflicting construction works or use that would not be compatible with works associated with the construction of the Brighton Mainline. Likewise, a prejudicial impact 
on infrastructure extensions or other operational improvements to increase capacity of the Tramlink network is defined as any impact which would prevent improvement 
works taking place including but not limited to conflicting construction work or use that would not be compatible with Tramlink improvements.  
  
 304 Telecommunications 
Strategic Objectives and related Croydon Local Plan strategic policies 
 Policy SP8  
Why we need this policy
10.61 A policy on telecommunications is proposed as there 
are specific locational criteria regarding telecommunications 
equipment that would not be adequately covered by other 
policies of the Plan. 
Policy DM33:  Telecommunications 
DM33.1  When planning permission is required , proposals for telecommunications development will be permitted provided that:  
a. If proposing a new mast, it has been demonstrated that there are no existing buildings, masts or other structures on which th e proposed 
apparatus can be sited;  
b. If proposing telecommunications development in Metropolitan Green Belt it has been demonstrated  that there are no suitable sites that 
are not in Metropolitan Green Belt and there is no impact on openness;  
c. If proposing telecommunications development on Metropolitan Open Land it has been demonstrated that there are no suitable sit es that 
are not on M etropolitan Open Land and there is no impact on the existing purpose of the site and its reason for it being designated as 
Metropolitan Open Land; and  
d. The siting of the proposed apparatus and associated structures minimises the impact on the operation of o ther electronic devices within 
the surrounding area.  
DM33.2  Telecommunication development on a building or other existing structure should be sited and designed to minimise impact to th e 
external appearance of the host building or structure.   
 305 How the policy works 
10.62 Not all telecommunications development requires 
planning permission. Part 16 of the General Permitted 
Development Order (2015) sets out the circumstances when 
planning permission is required and when this policy will, 
therefore, apply. Under the General Permitted Development 
Order most masts under 10m in height do not require planning 
permission and all masts over 15m will require planning 
permission. 
10.63 Telecommunications equipment should be located 
on existing structures where possible. If locating equipment on 
an existing telecommunications structure then information will 
need to be submitted with any application for prior approval or 
planning permission that the cumulative exposure, when 
operational, will not exceed International Commission on non-
ionising radiation protection guidelines. 
10.64 The National Planning Policy Framework does not 
list telecommunications equipment as being acceptable in Green 
Belt. Proposals for new telecommunications equipment need to 
demonstrate exceptional circumstances before being permitted 
in Metropolitan Green Belt (and by default, Metropolitan Open 
Land). 
10.65 Therefore, new telecommunications equipment will 
only be permitted in Metropolitan Green Belt or Metropolitan 
Open Land if it has first been demonstrated that there are no 
suitable sites outside of Metropolitan Green Belt or Metropolitan 
Open Land. These sites do not have to be within the borough 
boundary of Croydon. Furthermore, any ancillary facilities 
associated with a new telecommunications equipment must be 
kept to a minimum so that there is no impact on openness of 
both Metropolitan Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land and its reason for being designated as Metropolitan Open Land, if it is a 
site on Metropolitan Open Land.

 306  The Places of Croydon  
This section informs Policy SP1 on the Places and provides the visions and frameworks demonstrating how the borough-wide thematic 
policies will shape the Places over the plan period up to 2036. It should be noted that where a policy applies to all the Places, to avoid 
repetition it has not been mentioned in the text. For example Policy SP6 on Climate Change applies to all Places, but only the physical 
attributes, constraints and measures are identified here. 
Furthermore, it is considered the Places provide some context to the possible formulation of Neighbourhood Plans.  The Croydon Local 
Plan 2018 sets out the strategic planning policies that provide the opportunity for the production of Neighbourhood Plans. This will enable 
communities to influence the planning of their Place, in conformity with the Strategy Policies.  All future Development Plan Documents will 
be carefully managed to ensure their content does not unnecessarily trespass on the intended function of Neighbourhood Plans. 
This section also contains the Council’s policies that would specifically apply to a Place and all the Detailed Proposals.

Why we need these policies
11.1 The main objective of these policies will be to provide 
additional Place-specific development management policies to 
provide greater clarity and certainty that proposed developments 
are in line with the objectives of Croydon Local Plan Strategic 
Policy SP4. These policies should be read in conjunction with the 
Borough Character Appraisal including the Character Typology. 
11.2 The aspiration to achieve good design while retaining and 
improving the distinctiveness of each of Croydon’s Places has 
created the need to provide further design detail in the form of 
Place-specific development management policies. These 
additional policies will provide greater clarity and provide management guidelines for proposals within District and Local 
Centres and in locations outside of the masterplan areas, 
Conservation Areas, Local Heritage Areas or the Croydon 
Opportunity Area.  
11.3 An evaluation of local character was conducted to identify 
the locations in each of Croydon’s 16 Places where Place-
specific development management policies would be beneficial.  
11.4 The consistent theme within these Places was the need to 
identify management guidelines for major junctions, District 
Centres and Local Centres. These additional Place-specific  
 308 development management policies will only be applicable within 
the areas identified on the Policies Map. 
Designations shown on the Policies Map 
The Place-specific development management policies identify 
specific locations with less consistent character where the criteria 
of Policies DM34 to DM 49 apply. These designations they will are

 309 Addington 
11.4A Addington has a rich history and varied local character, 
located on the eastern borough boundary and surrounded by 
extensive areas of Metropolitan Green Belt including the North 
Downs, Rowdown Fields, Addington Vale and Milne Park. It has 
two distinct residential areas Addington Village and the New 
Addington and Fieldway estate s.   
11.4B Addington Village has origins dating to at least the 12th 
century and is set in the backdrop of the Grade II* Addington 
Palace and Grade II Registered Park and Garden, collectively 
forming the Addington Village Conservation Area .  The Grade I 
listed church of St. Mary, the Blessed Virgin is at the heart of the 
village, and surrounded by historic farmworker’s cottages, service 
buildings and village amenities, now primarily in residential use. 
There are limited services in the village and no shops. The 
combination of its historical and green setting, along with minimal 
vehicular access and public transportation means that Addington 
Village retains a rural and isolated aspect unlike much of the rest of 
the borough. 
11.4D New Addington and Fieldway estates consist of interwar and 
late twentieth century housing in a landscaped setting with 
interlinked public open space .  New Addington Estate was built 
between 1935 and 1963 with most housing built in a uniform semi-
detached style on a series of crescents radiating out from Central 
Parade. Fieldway Estate was built from 1963 onwards and is 
generally more compact, arranged in small blocks or terraces with 
individual back gardens and communal garage blocks. There is 
also a small centre of local shops and community facilities.    
11.4E New Addington is one of the most deprived areas in Croydon 
and Fieldway also has high levels of deprivation. Tram and bus services run throughout New Addington and Fieldway linking it to 
Croydon Metropolitan centre and beyond. The majority of 
Addington’s retail and community facilities are located along the 
spine of Central Parade and include Addington Library and New 
Addington Community and Leisure Centre .   
 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.5 A self-contained community, Addington comprises the 
distinct Addington Village, New Addington and Fieldway . It will be 
a location for growth, capitalising on good links to  Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre and its concentration of supporting 
infrastructure. Addington  will continue to comprise interwar and 
late 20th Century housing surrounded by Green Belt. Addington 
will be enhanced with appropriate infill development and a 
rejuvenated District Centre, with a mixture of homes, community 
and cultural facilities and a range of retailing, including many 
independent shops. Fieldway Neighbourhood Centre will support  
the existing and future community with services and facilities 
beyond a retail function. Addington Village Conservation Area will 
retain its distinct rural village  character and its setting  within the 
Green Belt. Addington Palace and associated parkland will 
continue to contribute to its character, setting and the historic 
environment of the area .   
Homes 
11.6 With good supporting infrastructure provision, opportunities 
for new development will comprise of mainly infill development, as 
land is physically constrained by the Green Belt. Residential  
 310 development in New Addington and Fieldway  will respect and 
evolve the existing character and distinctiveness of the  local 
areas; whilst protecting, enhancing the historic character and 
setting of Addington Village and its heritage assets . 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities  
11.7 There will be continued protection for industry and 
warehousing in the Vulcan Way Separated Industrial Location. 
This is located within proximity to Biggin Hill Strategic Outer 
London Development Centre (SOLDC), within the neighbouring 
Authority area. The Bromley Local Plan (adopted 2019) has 
allocated this for strategic employment development, which is 
proposed to comprise of a business park, servicing and 
maintenance of aircrafts, a business park, light industrial units, to 
create about 2,300 jobs over the next 15-20 years. New Addington 
District Centre will maintain its support of the local community, 
providing retailing, some employment and services.  The 
conference centre of Addington Palace also provides further local 
employment opportunities , supporting its future preservation and 
public enjoyment . Community facilities will be encouraged to be 
located in or near enough to support the success and vibrancy of 
the centre, focussing on leisure, community and health facilities .   
Character, Heritage and Design   
11.8 New development will respect the existing local character 
and local distinctiveness, referring to the Borough Character 
Appraisal and Addington Village Conservation Area Appraisal and 
Management Plan to inform design quality. Public realm 
improvements will focus on the New Addington District Centre to 
assist in the regeneration of the area and improve community and 
social cohesion, with a rejuvenated designated Village Green 
placed at the centre.  Any build ings and conversions should be of a 
high standard of design to ensure the character of the District 
centre and the Conservation Area are respected. The Historic and Local Historic Parks and Gardens in the area will be retained and 
new links provided where possible to incorporate them into the 
Green Grid network. 
Environment and Climate Change 
 
11.8A Addington is characterised by a steeper topography and 
more rural land. Due to this water drains from it into the tributaries 
of the River Ravensbourne that flo ws northwards into London 
Borough of Bromley, this has historically resulted in sever surface 
water flooding from intense rain flow (e.g. north of Field Way and 
Kent Gatway Road). New development will be required to 
incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems  to manage surface 
water runoff and flooding, taking into account the topography of the 
area and overland flow routes.  
 
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.9 Walking and cycle links to local schools, the District Centre, 
Vulcan Way industrial location and surrounding open space will be 
improved where possible. These will connect to the ancient 
Roman road on the borough boundary with Bromley.  Opportunities 
to provide green grid connections across the Fieldway area and 
around Addington Palace Golf Course will be supporte d. 
Transport  
11.10 The tram, with improved services and investment in 
rolling stock, will continue to provide a valued link to the Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre and connections to Central London and 
Gatwick Airport. The tram line is one of the key assets of 
Addington. This enables easy access to the Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre and connections to Central London and Gatwick Airport. 
The community will enjoy better quality, more frequent and reliable 
bus services connecting with Croydon Metropolitan Centre. Public 
parking provision will be better managed to give priority for local  
 311 residents, visitors to local businesses and community amenities; 
over commuter parking in the vicinity of New Addington Central 
Parade. There are opportunities for direct and safe cycle routes 
linking New Addington with Croydon Metropolitan Centre and 
neighbouring communities as well as the existing National Cycle 
Route 21 which encourages longer distance cycle journeys 
through the area . The public realm can be upgraded and the 
residential streets improved in line with the Healthy Streets 
Approach to encourage higher levels of active travel and reduce 
road danger in the local area which has suffered from a high 
number of collisions involving vulnerable road users.    
 312  Figure 11.1 Addington - graphic updated  
 
 313 General character 
11.11 The character of Addington is defined by extensive 
areas of Metropolitan Green Belt such as Birch Wood, Frith 
Wood, Rowdown Wood and North Downs. These green areas 
provide the setting for the Addington Village; and the 20th 
century housing estates in New Addington which consist of 
‘Local Authority Built Housing With Public Realm’ and ‘Compact 
Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ in Fieldway, both with 
scattered sections ‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated 
Grounds’ and ‘Tower Buildings’.  Paragraph deleted  
11.12 Apart from the historic Addington Village, the Place 
is served by two ‘Suburban Shopping Areas’, Central Parade in 
New Addington (the District Centre) and Wayside in Fieldway. 
Paragraph deleted  11.13 The spine of Central Parade separates the less 
green ‘Suburban Shopping Area’ of New Addington’s District 
Centre from the area containing leisure and community facilities, 
with a character of ‘Institutions With Associated Grounds’. In 
addition to these character types, Addington has a number of 
areas, located to the west and east of Central Parade, with an 
‘Industrial Estate’ character. With the exception of Central 
Parade, these character areas are generally consistent and can 
be successfully managed through the policies of this Plan.  
Paragraph deleted  
11.14 The Addington Village Conservation Area 
incorporates a historic village with medieval origins in a rural 
setting. The village's architecture represents a variety of 
character types from various historical periods. The predominant 
types are: ‘Scattered Houses On Large Plots’ and ‘Detached 
Houses On Relatively Large Plots’.  Paragraph deleted  
Policy DM34: Addington 
DM34.1 Within the New Addington District Centre, to ensure that the District Centre characteristics are  respected and enhanced 
proposals should:  
a) Make use of opportunities to create buildings with a larger footprint to the west of Central Parade  that have a height of up to 8 -11 
storeys ; or 
b) Create buildings with smaller footprints that complement existing pre dominant building heights of 3 storeys up to 12 storeys within 
Central Parade.  
DM34.2 Within Addington allocate sites for development as set out in  Table 11.2. 
How the policy works 
New Addington District Centre 
 
 11.15 The ar ea in which DM34.1  applies is shown on the 
Policies Map. 
11.16  The ‘Suburban Shopping Area’ character on Central 
Parade is characterised by consistent building lines, setbacks  
 314 and rhythm of facades and fenestration. This uniformity can be 
managed through other policies in the Croydon Local Plan 
However, additional policies are required to manage the area to 
the west of Central Parade where there are precedents of large 
and tall buildings. This location  presents opportunities for a 
greater range and mix of services to support growth  through the 
creation of large or tall buildings.

 315 Addiscombe
11.17A  Addiscombe is a suburban residential se ttlement, framed by 
green areas on the eastern side and the high density Croydon 
Opportunity Area to the west. The District Centre is focused on 
Lower Addiscombe Road, which also serves as one of the main 
transport corridors through the area along with Add iscombe Road.  
11.17B Addiscombe has a varied character which has 
evolved historically over time, with development in the area 
encouraged by the opening of East Croydon station in the mid 
1800’s. Two Conservation Areas can be found in Addiscombe; the 
East India Estate Conservation Area which has a distinctive layout 
and architecture for a residential suburb, built on land owned and 
occupied by the former East India Trading Company Military 
Academy, and the St Bernards Conservation Area is a notable 
section of the Park Hill Estate completed in 1971 to an award 
winning international design by Swiss firm Atelier 5. Two Local 
Heritage Areas, Addiscombe College Estate and Bingham Road, 
can also be found in Addiscombe which recognises the specific 
heritage significance of them. 
11.17C Due to the proximity of central Croydon there is a 
relative deficiency in the range of community services in 
Addiscombe. There are good road links east to west and the 
introduction of the Tramlink in 2000 increased public transport 
accessibility for residents . 
 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 11.18 Addiscombe will continue to be centred on the vibrant 
District Centre with an historic Conservation Area, a mixture of 
homes, community and cultural facilities and a range of retailing 
including many independent shops. Ashburton Park and Lower 
Addiscombe Road/Cherry Orchard Road Neighbourhood Centres 
will be supporting the existing and future community with services 
and facilities beyond a retail function. Addiscombe will continue to 
provide for a large residential community with good accessibility to 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre, and through tram and rail networks, 
good connections to London and Bromley. 
Homes 
11.19 Sustainable growth of the suburbs including some 
opportunity for windfall sites, and limited infilling with dispersed 
integration of new homes that respect existing residential 
character and local distinctiveness will be encouraged.   An Area of 
Moderate Intensification has been designated to the south of 
Addiscombe. This is currently a low density residential area, which 
is considered to have good access to tram stops and local 
services within the area’s District Centre. Due to this, it is 
considered a sustainable location for moderate renewal, 
intensification via new residential development that results in a 
reasonable increased in the density of the area.   
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.20 Recognising Addiscombe's retail vitality and potential, 
the central shopping area has been re- is designated as a District  
Centre. Community facilities will be encouraged to locate in close 
proximity to the Centre. The Leslie Arms, a prominent historic 
public house, will be refurbished and incorporate a community 
use, reactivating its important position as an active frontage onto 
the street. A new Integrated Industrial Area has been designated  
 316 on Hastings Road to protect the local industrial and employment 
offer 
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.21 New development will respect the existing local 
character and distinctiveness referring to the Borough Character 
Appraisal to inform design quality. Addiscombe's designated 
heritage assets and landmarks will be protected. Opportunities for 
public realm improvements will primarily focus on the District 
Centre with building and conversion works of a high standard of 
design to ensure the character of the Centre and Conservation 
Areas are respected. 
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.22 Improvements to, and expansion of the Green Grid 
will be sought to promote strategic east-west and north-south links 
through Addiscombe Linear Railway and Ashburton Parks. These 
will connect with the Croydon Metropolitan Centre, Wandle Valley 
Regional Park, Lloyd Park and South Norwood Country Park. 
Transport 
11.23 Addiscombe will continue to be a highly accessible 
Place with its six tram stops and connections to East Croydon, 
Beckenham Junction and Elmers End railway stations. It will 
benefit from improved tram services, from investment in tram 
stock and more frequent services. Travel plans will look to ease 
congestion at peak times by encouraging walking, cycling or public 
transport especially for school journeys. There are opportunities 
for direct and safe cycle routes linking with Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre . The public realm around Cherry Orchard Road and Lower 
Addiscombe Road associated with the retail areas can be 
upgraded and the residential streets improved. This will be in line 
with the Healthy Streets Approach to encourage higher levels of 
active travel and reduce road danger in the local area.

 318 General character 
11.24 Addiscombe is a suburban residential settlement, 
framed by green areas on the eastern side and the high density 
Croydon Opportunity Area to the west. This Place is influenced 
by and evolved as an extension of the Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre. The non-residential character consists of ‘Urban 
Shopping Areas’ (concentrated along the Lower Addiscombe 
Road corridor and the Shirley Road/Bingham Road Junction); 
and ‘Industrial Estates’ within the interiors of blocks, interlaced 
with houses.  Paragraph deleted  
11.25 The residential character consists of a varied yet 
balanced mix of ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ in the north 
west of this Place, mix of ‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated 
Grounds’ and ‘Compact Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ in the 
south west (between East Croydon and the Addiscombe tram 
stop and Lloyd Park, ‘Detached Houses On Relatively Large 
Plots’  in south east and ‘Local Authority Built Housing With 
Public Realm’ in the north. Some isolated residential ‘Tower 
Buildings’ and ‘Large Buildings With Spacing’ are scattered in the 
centre, in the vicinity of Lower Addiscombe Road.  Paragraph 
deleted  11.26 The East India Estate Conservation Area protects 
and preserves the historic character of ‘Large Houses On 
Relatively Small Plots’. The Conservation Area covers a 
distinctive layout and architecture of residential suburb built on 
land owned and occupied by the former East India Trading 
Company Military Academy.  Paragraph deleted  
11.27 The St Bernards Conservation Area contains 
‘Compact Houses On Relatively Small Plots’. It is a notable 
section of the Park Hill Estate completed in 1971 to an award 
winning international design by Swiss firm Atelier 5.  Paragraph 
deleted  
11.28 The Addiscombe College Estate Local Heritage Area 
designation recognises the historical significance of the collection 
of preserved Victorian houses built between 1862 and 1900 on 
the land belonging to East India Trading Company. It represents 
mix of ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages ’ and ‘Large Houses On 
Relatively Small Plots’ . Paragraph deleted  
11.29 Bingham Road Local Heritage Area designation 
recognises the heritage significance of the authentic and 
distinctive architecture of the Edwardian Addiscombe, ‘Planned 
Estates Of Semi -Detached Houses’.  Paragraph deleted
 
Policy DM35: Addiscombe 
DM35.1 Within the Addiscombe District Centre, to ensure that the District Centre characteristics are respected and enhanced proposals 
should:  
a) Complement existing predominant building heights of 2 storeys up to 4 storeys an d a maximum of 5 storeys around the Lower 
Addiscombe Road and Blackhorse Lane  Junction;   
 319 b) Retain the rhythm, size and the continuity of ground floor active frontages105;  
c) Allow flexibility at first floor and above for mixed use;  
d) Retain, enhance and positivel y reference corner features such as the articulation of corner building s and architectural features such 
as domed projecting bays with finials and the projecting double gable ends running at 90 degree angles interrupting the runni ng cornices;  
e) Incorporate or retain traditional shop front elements such as stall risers , fascias and pilasters; and 
f) Incorporate multi -stock brick as the predominant facing materials of the whole building.  Respond to the character of the area including 
the predominance of multi -stock brick . 
DM35.2 In the area between Addiscombe Railway Park & Lower Addiscombe Road (Section between Lesli e Park Road & Grant Road) , 
to ensure changes to the character of this area are carried out in a way that strikes a balance between enhancing the existin g character and 
facilitating growth, proposals should:  
a) Retain the predominant residential building lines and the  open character of front gardens;  
b) Respond to the fine grain106 of the existing residential developments;  
c) Complement the existing predominant buildi ng heights of 3 storeys up to 4 storeys;  
d) Incorporate multi -stock brick and white render as the predominant facing materials  of the whole building  or a material which 
complements multi -stock brick and white render ; and 
e) Enhance existing and provide new dire ct public walking and cycling routes to Addiscombe Railway Park  by working with the Council 
and its partners to incorporate sections of the route as part of schemes.  
 
                                            
105 These buildings have few or no blank facades. At ground floor the buildings contain uses that frame the street or space and active upper floors with little or no 
obscure or frosted glazing. Active frontages encourage visual and/or physical interaction between the private uses inside and the public uses outside. Visual interaction 
is achieved by creating views or glimpses through windows, projecting bays, balconies and doors into or out of a building. Physical interaction encourages people to 
come into a building or has indoor uses that spill out onto the street. 
106 Grain also called urban grain. It describes the pattern of the arrangement and size of buildings within a settlement and the degree by which an area's pattern of 
streets-blocks and junctions are respectively small and frequent (fine grain) or large and infrequent (course grain).  
 320 DM35.2A  An Area of moderate intensification has been designated to the south of Addiscomb e. The sustainable moderate, intensification 
and renewal of areas within this via proposals for new residential development will be supported that results in a reasonable  increase in the 
density. Development will need to be well designed, respect, reflect and help evolve the existing suburban character and local 
distinctiveness of the area . The boundaries of these are shown  on the map . 
DM35.3 Within Addiscombe allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.3. 
How the policy works 
11.30 The areas in which Policies DM35.1 , DM35.2  and 
DM35.2 A apply are shown on the Policies Map. 
Addiscombe District Centre 
11.31 The character of Addiscombe District Centre is 
defined by the predominance of the ‘Urban Shopping Area’ 
character along the northern side of Lower Addiscombe Road. 
The beginning and end of this character is marked by two 
triangular urban spaces , of which the westernmost triangular 
space is within the East India Estate Conservation Area .  
11.32 Addiscombe District Centre has managed to retain 
the village feel that contributes to its distinctive sense of place. 
The fine urban grain and consistent rhythm, frontage widths and 
setback of the buildings reinforce the relationship with the 
architecturally consistent Victorian and Edwardian ‘Terraced 
Houses And Cottages’ sited on the southern side of Lower 
Addiscombe Road.  
11.33 The Lower Addiscombe Road/Inglis Road junction 
area has a distinctive block composition and architectural 
detailing. The junctions are defined by symmetrical buildings with 
consistent heights and strongly defined corners. Detailing, such 
as domed projecting bays with finials and the projecting double 
gable ends running at 90 degree angles interrupting the running 
cornices, contributes  to Addiscombe’s distinctiveness. Additionally, features, such as the articulation of corner buildings 
including ground floor entrances that address corners, are a 
characteristic feature throughout the District Centre and should 
be referenced. 
11.34 The western section of the ‘Urban Shopping Area’ 
has a distinct non-residential appearance. This is reflected in the 
building heights and facing materials which are predominantly 
red multi stock brick. The eastern side mirrors the character of 
the adjacent residential areas. These buildings have ground 
floors that have been converted into commercial premises, whilst 
preserving the residential appearance of the upper floors. The 
treatment of facades of these buildings gradually changes from 
multi stock brick to render. In order to preserve the distinction in 
appearance between the residential areas and the District 
Centre, new development should be encouraged to incorporate 
multi -stock brick or material which is complementary .  
11.35 The Lower Addiscombe Road/Blackhorse Lane 
junction area is a formal, well defined urban public space framed 
on three sides by buildings with a predominant height of two to 
five storeys. 
11.36 The District Centre location and good transport links 
provides opportunities for densification of up to 5 storeys, 
preferably in locations on corner plots. It is considered that the 
retention of small traditional type shop frontages (including stall 
riser’s fascias and pilasters) reinforces the distinctiveness of  
 321 Addiscombe District Centre. Therefore it would not be 
appropriate to incorporate large and tall buildings within this 
location. Policy DM35.1  balances the need to facilitate growth 
and respect the existing character. 
11.37 This policy seeks to retain the continuity of plot 
widths, setbacks and traditional shop frontages (in line with the 
Shop Front Security Addendum to Supplementary Planning 
Guidance No.1 Shop Fronts & Signs). This should not preclude 
growth, as growth may be still be achieved through creative 
design solutions such as amalgamating shop units to create one 
larger unit. 
Area between Addiscombe Railway Park & Lower Addiscombe 
Road (Section between Leslie Park Road & Grant Road) 
11.38 In this area the character of consists of ‘Industrial 
Estates’ , ‘Mixed Flats And Compact Houses’, and sections of 
‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ and ‘Local Authority Built 
Housing with Public Realm’. 
11.39 The character of this area has become fragmented 
as a result of development with an (urban) grain that is not in 
keeping with the character of the neighbouring buildings. This 
area is still undergoing change which will need to be managed . 
Policy DM35.2  will provide guidance to enable this to be carried 
out in a sensitive way.

 322 Broad Green and Selhurst 
11.40A  Broad Green is a heavily urbanised area consisting of 
a variety of local character types including the retail and business 
parks of the Purley Way and the heavily trafficked London Road. 
Selhurst is a residential area with its eastern edge dominated by 
railway infrastructure and associated industrial estates. Broad 
Green and Selhurst lies to the north-west of Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre bordering the London Borough of Sutton with the greenery 
of the adjacent Mitcham Common.  
11.40B  The area is less car dependent than areas further 
south in the borough owing to its good public transport accessibility; 
however the area suffers from congestion on its many busy roads. 
Green open spaces are limited in the area although there is a 
significant amount of other types of open space in the north east of 
the area provided by school playing fields and Mitcham Road 
Cemetery.  
11.40C  Two Local Heritage Areas can be found in Broad 
Green and Selhurst; the London Road Broad Green Area includes 
buildings with unique Arts and Crafts inspired architectural design 
from the beginning of the 20th Century, and the Henderson Road 
area is a distinctive example of well-preserved terraces of small 
Victorian maisonettes adjacent to the Local Historic Park of 
Whitehorse Recreational Ground.  
11.40D  Broad Green and Selhurst includes part of the Purley 
Way Transformation Area.  
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.41 Broad Green and Selhurst comprise three distinct 
areas, characterised by Purley Way, a regenerated London Road 
and Whitehorse Road. As a broad location, growing residential 
areas will be interspersed within a network of busy streets with 
improved connectivity to open spaces and the expanded Green 
Grid network of the borough. Selhurst Road and Sumner 
Road/London Road Neighbourhood Centres will be supporting the 
existing and future community with services and facilities beyond a 
retail function The diversity of employment activity and cultures will 
enliven the area just north of the Croydon Opportunity Area, as 
well as being part of the borough's principal industrial location the 
Place will have a share in the borough’s improving prosperity. 
Homes 
11.42 New residential growth, with opportunities for renewal, 
will focus on London Road and a new Local Centre at Valley Park, 
Ampere Way, as part of the Purley Way Transformation Area. An 
area of Focused Intensification has been designated at the 
London Road Transport Corridor, which is located on the northern 
edge of the Broad Green Local Centre, parts of which cross over 
into Thornton Heath to the north. This is within an accessible 
distance of West Croydon Station, the tram network, as well 
facilities within the Broad Green Local centre. Due to this, it is 
considered a sustainable location, where high density residential 
and renewal will be encouraged. Residential development will 
need to respect the existing residential character and local 
distinctiveness.  The Valley Park Local Centre will accommodate  
 323 residential use within new mixed-use neighbourhoods that are well 
integrated with existing neighbourhoods. Housing investments will 
address the high deprivation and inequality in this Place . 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.43 The three integrated Industrial Locations at Union 
Road, Gloucester Road and Thornton Road will continue to be 
provided with protection for industrial and warehousing activities, 
alongside an allowance for limited new high quality residential 
development provided it does not harm the area's business 
function. Purley Way, a Strategic Industrial Location and industrial 
heartland of the borough, will remain a preferred area for industrial 
and warehousing activity , whilst also accommodating a new Local 
Centre that provides space for leisure and community facilities to 
support new and existing residential communities, and local 
workers and businesses . Local employment is also provided by 
the Place's proximity to Croydon University Hospital. A thriving 
evening economy will be centred on the regenerated London 
Road running from West Croydon to the re-built Local Centre at 
Broad Green. The BRIT School, in Selhurst, will continue to be a 
unique and much valued educational asset to the borough , and 
will be supported to continue to thrive. The Sumner Road/London 
Road Neighbourhood Centre will continue to reflect the local, 
diverse community and provide local employment and services 
with community facilities encouraged to locate in close proximity. 
Improvements to the public realm on the high street will be 
supported through the London Road Corridor scheme .  
Environment and climate Change 
11.44A  Development will be required to incorporate Sustainable 
Drainage Systems (SUDS) measures. Developers will need to liaise 
with the Council Local Lead Flooding Authority team and the 
Environmental Agency, to investigate the suitability of SUDS to manage surface water runoff and flooding issues (where 
necessary), as well as whether other measures may need to be 
implemented due to the geological characteristic, to reduce the risk 
of groundwater flood risk. The Council will continue to work with 
Thames Water (the sewerage undertaken) and other stakeholders, 
to ensure sewerage water flooding events are reduced, to protect 
and enhance the ecological status  of Norbury Brook, in line with the 
Water Framework directive.  
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.44 New development will respect the existing local 
character and distinctiveness of Broad Green and Selhurst, 
referring to the Borough Character Appraisal to inform design 
quality. Opportunities for public realm improvements will primarily 
focus on the re-built Local Centre at Broad Green on London 
Road with any building and conversions of a high standard of 
design to ensure the future vitality of the centre. The former 
Croydon B Power Station chimneys will continue to act as a key 
local landmark.  The Purley Way Transformation Area policies set 
out how development along the Purley Way will draw upon the 
positive characteristics of Broad Green and Selhurst’s area and 
enhance the quality of the built environment.  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.45 New Green Grid links will be sought to improve 
connectivity with the green space of Wandle Park, just south of 
Broad Green, with Croydon Cemetery and Mitcham Common all 
linking to the Wandle Valley Regional Park. Emphasis will be 
placed on improving access to and quality of the local open 
spaces within and adjacent to Broad Green as this is identified as 
an area deprived of access to nature. The Purley Way 
Transformation Area policies set out where additional open 
spaces and improvements to the public realm are planned across 
this area.   
 324 Transport 
11.46 To encourage walking and cycling, high quality 
connections within an attractive environment will be pursued. 
Growth will be further supported by promoting public transport 
improvements along the London Road corridor to Thornton Heath 
and Norbury, and beyond. As the attraction of the Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre increases, the quality, capacity and reliability 
of bus services connecting to it will also be improved. Travel plans 
will look to ease congestion at peak times by encouraging walking, 
cycling or public transport especially for school journeys.  
 325 Figure 11.3 Broad Green and Selhurst -graphic updated  
 
 326 General character 
11.47 Broad Green is a heavily urbanised area consisting 
of a variety of local character types. The south-western edge is 
defined by large ‘Retail Estates & Business & Leisure Parks’ 
along Purley Way and the greenery of Archbishop Lanfranc's 
playing field and Croydon Cemetery. The dominant and high 
density area along London Road corridor identifies the centre of 
this Place. The eastern edge is dominated by the railway and 
associated ‘Industrial Estates’ of the Selhurst area. Smaller scale 
historical industrial estates are often interlaced within the urban 
fabric. The predominant residential character type is ‘Terraced 
Houses And Cottages’, with scattered areas of ‘Local Authority 
Housing With Associated Public Realm’ with sections of 
‘Compact Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ and ‘Medium Rise 
Blocks With Associated Grounds’ scattered in the east and in the vicinity of Whitehorse Road . ‘Large Buildings With Continuous 
Frontage Line’ and ‘Large Buildings With Spacing’ dominate 
along London Road.  Paragraph deleted

c) Address the deficiency in green infrastructure within the area by incorporating tree planting and greenery within t he development; and  
d) Retain the extent and enhance the quality of the existing public realm within the development, including introducing large tr ees and 
other vegetation to balance the impact of large or tall buildings.  
DM36.4 In the area north of  Broad Green Loc al Centre , to ensure that proposals enhance and strengthen the character of the area 
north of the Broad Green Local Centre, and facilitate growth, developments should:  
a) Retain and create glimpses and separation distances between buildings in order to impro ve the openness of London Road;  
b) Incorporate main pedestrian entrances onto London Road;  
c) Complement the existing predominant building heights of 3 storeys up to a maximum of 8 storeys; and  
d) Retain the extent and enhance the quality of the existing public realm within the development, including introducing large trees and 
other vegetation to balance the impact of large and tall buildings  and  
e) Preserve and enhance setting of West Croydon United Reformed Church . 
DM36.5 In the area of the junction of Windmill Road an d Whitehors e Road , to create a sense of place of this area proposals should:  
a) Create building lines and frontages which positively reinforce and respond to the form of the junction  whilst allowing realignment of 
the carriageway widths of the junction to fac ilitate bus priority and provide pedestrian crossing facilities ;  
b) Use tree planting to reinforce the street alignment; and   
 328 c) Complement the existing massing of the immediate area around the Windmill/Whitehorse Road Junction, by ensuring that the over all 
height of the building does not exceed 5 storeys; or complement the existing predominant building heights of 2 storeys up to a ma ximum 
height of 3 storeys; or ensure the ridge line is no taller than those adjacent to it.  
DM36.5A Areas of focused Intensificatio n have been designated at the London Road Transport Corridor , where high density residential 
development and renewal will be supported. The boundaries of these are shown  on the map . 
DM36.6 Within Broad Green and Selhurst (outside of the Purley Way Transformation Area) allocate sites for development as set out in 
Table 11.4. 
 
How the policy works 
11.50 The areas in which Policies DM36.1  to DM36.5 A 
apply are shown on the Policies Map. 
Broad Green Local Centre 
11.51 Broad Green Local Centre is dominated by the 
London Road traffic. It is an area with potential for growth. 
11.52 The edge of the Broad Green Local Centre is 
eroding and is beginning to lose its separate identity and sense 
of place. This could lead to the Local Centre being amalgamated 
into the homogenous urban form of the London Road.  
11.53 The detailed policies in DM36.1  will help to 
strengthen the identity of the Local Centre by setting design 
parameters such as consistent scale, street frontage treatment 
and public realm requirements. 
Potential new Local Centre at Valley Park 
11.54 The area is currently dominated by large scale 
‘Retail Estates & Business & Leisure Parks’ and associated 
parking, separated from the adjoining area by embankments, 
Purley Way and the tram infrastructure. Deleted paragraph  11.55 There is a mix of uses similar to an urban centre. 
However, large amounts of car dominated spaces make this ar ea 
less pedestrian and cycle friendly. Additionally, the presence of 
large undefined spaces has contributed to this area's lack of a 
sense of place . Deleted paragraph 
11.56 There is potential for growth and for transformation 
into a new Local Centre. To enable potential development 
opportunities to be undertaken in a cohesive and coordinated 
manner, a masterplan will be considered. Deleted paragraph  
Lombard Roundabout area 
11.57 This is an area at the edge of two character types 
that contrast in scale. These are ‘Terraced Houses And 
Cottages’ and ‘Large Buildings With Continuous Frontage Line’. 
The area has potential for growth. The Place-specific 
development management policy is required to facilitate growth 
that enhances the distinctive character of the Lombard 
Roundabout Area. Deleted paragraph  
11.58 These policies will encourage new developments to 
establish a transitional zone between the existing uniform low 
rise residential areas and the larger scale structures around the 
Lombard Roundabout.  Deleted paragraph  
 329 Area north of Broad Green Local Centre 
11.59 The area north of Broad Green Local Centre is 
already experiencing growth. A cohesive approach needs to be 
taken to ensure that Local Centre edge is well defined and that 
the buildings along London Road have spacing.  
Area of the junction of Windmill Road and Whitehorse Road 
11.60 There is a poor relationship between the street 
layout and the building frontages at the Windmill 
Road/Whitehorse Road junction area. This has resulted in an 
area lacking a sense of place. The character within this area is a 
mix of low rise ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages ’, ‘Industrial 
Estates’ and ‘Retail Estates & Business & Leisure Parks’. 
11.61 There is a potential for growth and an opportunity for 
improving the definition of frontages and street edge, as well as 
overall quality of urban environment. This could include 
addressing the deficiency in green infrastructure by ensuring tree 
planting and greenery is an intrinsic part of the development.

 331 Coulsdon 
11.62 A Coulsdon is a small suburban settlement surrounded by 
areas of Green Belt. The Green Belt in this area is characterised by 
uninterrupted views of open spaces including Farthing Downs and 
wooded mature tree belts. Coulsdon lies on the southernmost 
boundary of the borough and its built environment is located within 
the valleys alongside railway lines and main roads. 
11.62B  Coulsdon has a significant employment base and many 
shops and services for a town of this size, including a library and 
several schools. It has excellent road and rail links north to London 
and south to Gatwick Airport and Brighton and benefits from a 
bypass to prevent congestion in the District Centre. There is access 
to large tracts of open spaces and the area is framed and 
dominated by the North Downs and Farthing Downs to the south 
and south west with Coulsdon Common and Dollypers Hill to the 
east. 
11.62C There is a rich history in Coulsdon, notably that there 
is evidence of early settlement at Farthing Downs with Neolithic and 
Bronze age finds. Three Local Heritage Areas can be found in 
Coulsdon which reflect a more modern historical significance. The 
Chipstead Valley Road Area recognises the distinctive architecture 
of workers' houses from c.1900 and their layout reveals the location 
of the historic site of the former Surrey Iron Railway. Station 
Approach (Coulsdon) Local Heritage Area contains modest 
Victorian railway cottages with aesthetic style inspired features set 
in the distinctive townscape. The Dutch Village Area around 
Wilhelmina Avenue and The Netherlands Road, form a distinctive 
estate designed by the Dutch architect Wouter Hamdorff as a 
'modern Dutch garden village' in late 1930's. Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.63 Croydon’s southernmost District Centre, with a 
mixture of homes, community and cultural facilities, and a range of 
retailing including many independent shops, will revive its day and 
evening economy with the support of the new residential 
community and associated facilities on the Cane Hill site. The 
Strategic Industrial Location of Marlpit Lane will be retained and 
development to improve or increase capacity will be supported . 
Homes 
11.64 An area of moderate residential Residential growth 
based on available land will be focussed on Coulsdon District 
Centre, and its surrounding area with a new residential 
community, recently delivered in Cane Hill . Area of Focused 
Intensification has been designated to the north of the Coulsdon 
District Centre. These are considered highly sustainable locations, 
where high density residential development and renewal will be 
encouraged due to their proximity to the Railway Station, as well 
as access to/services/facilities within the District Centre.  Further 
Areas of Moderate Intensification have been designated to the 
south and north east of Coulsdon (crossing into Purley). These are 
currently a low density residential areas, which are considered to 
have good access to the Coulsdon Town and South Railway 
Stations, as well as local services the District Centre. Therefore , 
these are considered a sustainable location for moderate renewal, 
intensification via new residential development that results in a 
reasonable increase in the density of area.  Residential 
development will need to be well designed, respect, reflect, evolve 
the existing residential character and local distinctiveness .  
 332 Residential development will respect the existing character and 
local distinctiveness of the area. 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.65 Marlpit Lane, with its close proximity to the M25 and 
good separation from surrounding residential areas will remain an 
important location for employment growth for Croydon and London 
retaining strong protection (as a Strategic Industrial Location). The 
Coulsdon District Centre will continue to support the local 
community, providing retailing, employment and services with 
further opportunities for skilled employment where possible, within 
the Coulsdon Area including Cane Hill. Community facilities will be 
encouraged to locate in close proximity to the District Centre.      
Character, Heritage and Design   
11.66 Coulsdon will remain mainly residential with tree-lined 
streets becoming more urban in character towards the District 
Centre. New development will respect the existing local character 
and distinctiveness of Coulsdon, referring to the Borough 
Character Appraisal to inform design quality.  The Dutch Village 
Local Heritage Area and  Local Historic Parks and Gardens such 
as Coulsdon Memorial Recreation Ground and Chaldon Way 
Gardens   will be retained and new links will be provided (where 
possible) to incorporate them into the Green Grid network. 
Opportunities for public realm improvements will continue to focus 
on enhancements to the Centre, with any new buildings and 
conversions will be of a high design standard to ensure the 
character of the Centre is respected. The Surrey Iron Railway 
embankment Scheduled Monument comprises a former railway 
embankment which is located approximately 130m south-west of 
Lion Green Road. This large earthwork is one of few surviving 
remnants of the first fully independent public railway in the world, 
dating to c.1805. Better interpretation and access to the Surrey 
Railway Embankment Scheduled Monument provided through nearby development will enable it to play a greater role in the local 
heritage context. The Cane Hill Legacy Buildings act as key 
landmarks in the area .  
Environment and Climate Change  
11.67 Coulsdon District Centre and the surrounding area 
may be suitable for a district heat network. Development will be 
required to incorporate Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS) 
measures  (where necessary), to reduce surface water run off 
issues and reduce the risk of surface water flooding  impacts to 
local residents and businesses   
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.68 Opportunities for orbital movements for walking and 
cycling will be sought with way finding and provision of new links 
and connections to the strategic Green Grid . Coulsdon Memorial 
Ground, a Local Historic Park, and links to it, will be improved as 
part of a parks improvement scheme. 
Transport  
11.69 New cycle facilities will be introduced at Coulsdon 
Town railway station. Linkages with the railway stations of 
Coulsdon South and Coulsdon Town and the District Centre will 
be improved to provide links to an expanded Green Grid network 
and to encourage sustainable modes of travel. Accessibility will be 
improved where possible to Coulsdon South, Reedham and 
Woodmansterne stations through step free access improvements. 
As the number of jobs and services in the Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre increase, the capacity and reliability of bus services 
connecting the Coulsdon community to this Centre will be 
improved. Travel plans will look to ease congestion at peak times 
by encouraging walking, cycling or public transport especially for 
school journeys.

Policy DM37: Coulsdon 
DM37.1  Areas of focused Intensification  have been designated to the no rth of Coulsdon District Centre , where high density residential 
development and renewal will be supported. The boundar y of this is shown on the map . 
DM37.2  An Area of moderate intensification has been designated to the south and north east of Coulsdon. The sustainable moderate, 
intensification and renewal of areas within this via proposals for new residential development will be supported, providing they result in a 
reasonable increase in density.  The boundaries of this is shown on the map below.  
DM37.3  Development within these should:  
a) Be well designed to protect, enhance  the suburban character, setting of the settlement, particularly on Marlpit Lane that is a gateway.  
b) Assess and mitigate any potential noise poll ution impacts, near the Station , to create a healthy environment for future residents   
 335 DM37.4  Within Coulsdon al locate sites for development as set out in Table 11.5. 
 
How the policy works 
11.75 Coulsdon has the potential for growth. Much of this 
is concentrated within the Cane Hill area.  
11.76 The District Centre and environs is an area with a 
broad mix of uses. This has resulted in a variety of character 
areas with diverse set of transitions between characters .  
11.77 Coulsdon District Centre is well served by public 
transport. This provides an opportunity for it to function as a 
destination. The sense of place requires strengthening and 
enhancing of its attractiveness to residents and those visiting the 
area.  
11.78 Each of the character areas within Coulsdon is well 
defined and consistent. Future development can be successfully 
guided by general policies and there is no place specific 
development management policy for this area. 
Allocating land for development 
11.79 Table 11.5 below sets out the proposed use on 
specific sites in Coulsdon. The location and boundary of each 
detailed proposal can be found on the Policies Map and further 
details including indicative phasing and indicative number of 
homes (if applicable) can be found in Appendix 7.

 336 Croydon Opportunity Area 
11.79A Croydon Opportunity Area is the urban centre of the 
borough with a very diverse character, a principle location for office, 
retail and cultural and hotel activity. It is the largest public 
transportation hub in the borough with bus, tram and rail 
interchanges and is one of the few areas outside of Central London 
to hold the highest public transport accessibility rating.  
11.79B The centre of Croydon is typically characterised by 
the dominance of the roads (such as the Wellesley Road, Park 
Lane and the Flyover), rail and tram lines which create distinct 
separations between areas. Retail including the Whitgift Centre is 
primarily focused around North End. Offices are clustered in the 
New Town area, around East Croydon station and adjacent to 
Edridge Road, Fell Road and the High Street. Housing in the 
Opportunity Area is typically found at the outer edges where it 
consist of a mix of historical terraced homes; or in modern 
apartment blocks in more central locations.  
11.79C Croydon Opportunity Area has evolved historically 
and its development is intrinsically linked to the railway and East 
Croydon Station. Its role as a major office, retail and culture hub 
does not detract from the historical attributes and heritage assets of 
the area which are protected and enhance this role.  
11.79D The Central Croydon Conservation Area is focused on 
Croydon's historic civic and commercial heart, including a great 
variety of historic Listed and Locally Listed Buildings from several 
centuries, including the Grade I listed Whitgift Almshouses and 
Croydon Town Hall and landmark clocktower. Church Street 
Conservation Area is focused on the historic thoroughfare which 
curves through Croydon's Old Town, linking the High Street with the 
area around the Croydon Minster. The Conservation Area has a number of Listed and Locally Listed Buildings dating from the early 
18th century onwards. Croydon Minster Conservation Area is 
focused on the heart of Croydon's old town, encompassing the 
highly significant medieval and Victorian Croydon Minster (Parish 
Church of St John) and the former Archbishop's Palace, both Grade 
I Listed Buildings. The Chatsworth Road Conservation Area 
contains well-preserved large Victorian and Edwardian houses, in a 
range of notable styles. Wellesley Road (North) Conservation Area 
is a collection of early/mid Victorian houses, which are some of the 
oldest surviving properties in the town centre and a remarkable 
contrast to the redeveloped adjacent modernist areas. The Laud 
Street Local Heritage Area recognises the heritage significance of 
its well-preserved historic architecture and townscape of terraced 
houses and cottages.  
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.80 Croydon Opportunity Area has the greatest potential 
for positive change and will be a focus for growth through flexible 
and pragmatic planning, with its improved public realm and open 
space  delivered through a series of masterplans contributing to 
the centre's economic prosperity and vitality. It will be home to a 
new residential community, a thriving employment and renewed 
mixed use destination with retail, office, arts and culture (including 
a diverse evening/night-time economy), leisure and sports, 
entertainment, learning and workspace activity. Croydon's 
connectivity will have continued as its main strength and 
attraction, being Outer London's largest regional transport hub , 
further improved by the Brighton Main Line improvements . Its 
location at the northern tip of the Gatwick Diamond, alongside its  
 337 access to people, markets and goods will put Croydon Opportunity 
Area at the top of the list of successful centres in the region. 
11.81 The Council has produced an Opportunity Area 
Planning Framework which sets out detailed guidance on how the 
vision for the Croydon Opportunity Area is to be achieved.  The 
Council has also produced a series of masterplans which cover 
the following areas: East Croydon, Old Town, Fair Field, Mid 
Croydon, and West Croydon. A future New Town Masterplan will 
consider the area between the East Croydon, Mid Croydon and 
Fair Field Masterplans. In addition, a Conservation Area Appraisal 
and Management Plan has been produced for each of these 
areas. The North End Quarter Transformation Area chapter sets 
out vision and principles for how new development and public 
realm improvements will transform this.  
11.82 South End/Parker Road/St Peter’s Church 
Neighbourhood Centre will be supporting the existing and future 
community with services and facilities beyond a retail function. 
Homes 
11.83 Residential growth of over 10,650 14,500 homes will 
provide almost one-third of all the new homes in the borough and 
create a new residential community in the centre of Croydon. High 
quality residential development will respect and evolve the existing 
residential character and local distinctiveness. 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.84 With a regenerated and revitalised North End/Retail 
Core at its heart, the Croydon Metropolitan Centre will develop as 
a unique mixed-use destination in the borough and the region, 
with retail, office, arts and culture (including a diverse 
evening/night-time economy), leisure and sports, entertainment, 
learning and workspace activity. It will also be a strategic commercial centre in South London. remain the foremost retail 
location outside of Central London. The Council will adopt a 
flexible approach to leisure, visitor accommodation, and housing 
and community facilities within Croydon Metropolitan Centre.  It will 
be a major office and residential location in London and the South 
East retaining its status as a Strategic Office Location with up to 
92,000m2 of new and refurbished office floor space and an office 
retention area around East Croydon Station and New Town. It will 
have a varied evening economy, including the Restaurant Quarter, 
attracting both new residents of the Croydon Metropolitan Centre 
and existing residents from across South London. Taking 
advantage of good links and location relative to the City, West 
End, Docklands and Gatwick Airport, hotels and conferencing will 
be a growth sector in the Opportunity Area. A renewed Fairfield 
Halls will continue to be a major regional arts facility. A new 
creative industry Enterprise Centre will capitalise on Croydon’s 
local arts scene and Croydon will look to expand upon its existing 
higher and further education facilities. The GP health centre at 
Impact House will continue to provide a healthcare facility for 
Croydon Opportunity Area. The North End Quarter Transformation 
Area chapter sets out detailed principles for how the North End wil l 
enhance and expand upon its existing uses for the ongoing 
resilience and prosperity of the Town Centre   
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.85 The historic Old Town will continue to form an 
important part of Croydon’s medieval core, alongside Central 
Croydon’s prosperous Victorian commercial quarter and mid-
century modernist heritage. Through the masterplanning process 
opportunities to improve the public realm of the Opportunity Area 
will be sought, retaining the best of the existing built environment. 
New development in the area will respect the existing local 
character and heritage referring to the Borough Character 
Appraisal and Conservation Area Appraisal and Management  
 338 Plans to inform design quality, ensuring that the character for the 
Conservation Areas are respected, and enhancing the public 
realm with improved pedestrian connections. The provision of new 
public realm and public spaces within the Croydon Opportunity 
Area will serve the daytime community as well as new and existing 
residents of the area. . Development within the New Town area 
will complement both the distinct mid-Century architecture of the 
wider town centre and any adjacent heritage sites  
Environment and Climate Change 
11.86 By enabling development, potential exists to 
implement flood mitigation and adaptation measures from Old 
Town towards the Brighton Road. There is also the potential for 
carbon reduction from a district energy network within Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre. Development has the potential to enable the 
implementation of flood mitigation and adaptation measures in 
areas such as the Old Town towards the Brighton Road. 
Development in the flood zones will be guided by the policies of 
the Plan, to reduce flood risk to properties, residents and ensure 
safety. Where possible, flood risk will be mitigated through 
naturally based sustainable drainage systems. There is also the 
potential for carbon reduction from a district energy network within 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre. The North End Quarter 
Transformation Area chapter sets out principles for this location, 
which will help tackle climate change  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.87 Proposed improvements to Wellesley Road and 
improved east-west links will provide more access to the three 
major parks on the outskirts of Croydon Opportunity Area, 
(Wandle Park, Park Hill and Duppas Hill), other Local Historic 
Parks and Gardens, and the wider Green Grid through routes 
such the Wandle River Trail. Green Grid improvements will also 
draw on heritage interpretation using key heritage assets and landmarks such as Croydon Clocktower, the Minster and the 
Water Tower at Park Hill Park to facilitate wayfinding. The North 
End Quarter Transformation Area chapter sets out detailed 
principles for how the North End will positively contribute to 
Croydon’s Green Grid network . 
Transport 
11.88 Croydon will remain a major interchange on both the 
National Rail network and London Overground. The masterplans 
at East and West Croydon will seek to further improve the good 
access and transport connections including cycle hubs that 
provide improved facilities. The area will benefit from improved 
tram services, including the Dingwall Loop, with investment in tram 
stock, more frequent services and an expanded network. The 
Council and its partners will seek to improve bus services to and 
from the Places of Croydon and beyond to ensure capacity 
increases as the Metropolitan Centre grows. The passenger 
waiting environment will be enhanced at both East and West 
Croydon Stations as well as elsewhere in the Metropolitan Centre. 
11.88A The Council will work with TfL to explore the feasibility 
of creating a north-south tram extension via Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre. This will improve the reach and capacity of the tram 
network, support good growth and better connectivity, to help 
create a greener, more liveable borough.   
11.88B Pedestrians and cyclists should be able to easily 
traverse the town centre east to west from Wandle Park to East 
Croydon Station. There are barriers and severance created by 
Roman Way, Old Town, Croydon Flyover and Wellesley Road that 
need to be addressed to allow easy access by foot and cycle. 
Pedestrianisation is a key to lowering carbon emissions from this 
area and creating a pedestrian friendly, successful town centre.   
 339 11.88C The future development of the town centre will be 
successful, through the effective management of the volume, timing 
and movement of vehicles (including for deliveries and freight) into 
and out of it via development management processes, as well as 
implementation of parking standards and sustainable transport 
measures. This will help minimise any impacts on the operations of 
existing businesses and the environment.  
11.88D There will be a network of mobility hub centres around 
the edge of the town centre and in proximity to public transport 
hubs to accommodate hire schemes for cycles, e-bikes, e-scooters 
and other micro-mobility modes as well as bays for electric car 
sharing vehicles.  
  
 340 Figure 11.5 Croydon Opportunity Area - graphic updated  
 
 341 General character 
11.89 Croyd on Opportunity Area is an urban area with 
diverse character types. It is the only one of Croydon’s 16 Places 
to contain all nine non-residential character types, each of which 
influences the way in which this Place has developed. The centre 
of Croydon is typically characterised by the dominant intersecting 
‘Linear Infrastructure’ of the roads (such as the Wellesley Road, 
Park Lane and the Flyover) rail and tram lines which create 
distinct separations between the different character types. The 
‘Shopping Centres Precincts & Town Centres’ and ‘Tower 
Buildings’ are located to the west and east of the central spine 
along Wellesley Road. These areas have a larger grain and 
predominantly contain modern and contemporary buildings. The 
character of Wellesley Road has also been influenced by the 
number of ‘Large Buildings With Spacing’ which are 
concentrated to the north and east of this road and in close 
proximity to the ‘Transport Nodes’. There are also a small 
number of ‘Large Buildings With Continuous Frontage Line’ 
located to the south. Radiating southwards from the ‘Shopping 
CentresPrecincts & Town Centres’ are the ‘Urban Shopping 
Area’  character. The urban grain of these areas reflects the 
surrounding residential character with a smaller finer grain. 
Paragraph deleted  
11.90 The residential areas are located around the edge of 
this place and consist of a predominant mix of ‘Large Houses On 
Relatively Small Plots’ , ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ and 
‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated Grounds’. Interspersed 
amongst the residential areas are small pockets of ‘Industrial 
Estates’ , ‘Retail Estates & Business & Leisure Parks’, and 
‘Institutions With Associated Grounds’.  Paragraph deleted

 342 Policy DM38: Croydon Opportunity Area 
DM38.1 To enable development opportunities , including p ublic realm improvements, to be undertaken in a cohesive and coordinated 
manner a Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework complemented by masterplans with elements of design code for Fair Field, Mid 
Croydon, West Croydon,  East Croydon  and Old Town have  been adopted.  
DM38.2 To ensure development opportunities positively transform the local character and include public realm  improvements that  are 
undertaken in a cohesive and coordinated manner, a masterplan  with elements of design code  will be considered for the  area within New 
Town  and the Retail Core107. 
DM38.3 Within the Central area as shown on Figure 11.6 and on the Policies Map proposals for tall buildings  are considered 
appropriate  will be considered on their own merits, in cluding a detailed assessment of building form, treatment, urban design and height 
along with an assessment of the impact on views, heritage assets, shading and environmental impacts .  
DM38.4 Within the Edge Area as shown on Figure 11.6 and on the Policies Map, where it can be demonstrated that there will be limited 
negative impact on sensitive locations and that the form, height, design and treatment of a building are high quality then a tall building may 
be acceptable.  
DM38.5 In the London Road area to ensure that proposals positively enhance and strengthen the local character and setting of Locally 
Listed Buildings , the development should:   
a) Complement the existing maximum height of 4 storeys;  
b) Incorporate multi -stock brick as the predominant facing material;  
c) Retain, enhance and positively reference existing setbacks of the major massing above ground floors; and  
d) Retain, enhance and positively reference architectural detailing on Locally Listed Buildings . 
DM38.6 In the a rea along Syden ham and Lansdowne Road , to facilitate growth and enhance the sense of place, developments should 
retain and create glimpses and separation distances between buildings in order to improve openness within the edge of the tow n centre.  
DM38.7 Within Croydon Opportuni ty Area allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.6.

London Road area 
11.100 London Road is the northern gateway to Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre. Buildings range from Listed Victorian high 
street buildings to large modernist residential and commercial 
buildings along with run down and derelict units. Similarly, there 
is a mixed quality public realm, from the welcoming and colourful 
entrance at West Croydon station to large unused spaces and 
car yards to the north of London Road. West Croydon station , 
the Lidl supermarket and the proximity of the Retail Core and the 
University Hospital are some of the major attractions that draw 
people into the area. The area has been undergoing change due 
to proximity to the town centre and a major transport interchange 
of West Croydon station. Additionally a number of redevelopment 
opportunities have arisen from the civil unrest damages.  11.101 The London Road area has a variety of fine 
examples of architecture which has been recognised by being 
designated as Locally Listed Buildings. Though their articulation 
varies, they have a number of common characteristics such as 
regular rhythm of elevations marked by windows and the way 
they are framed, high quality workmanship and materials. There 
are fine examples of brickwork and render. A number of 
buildings, which were originally set back from the street, have 
been extended on the ground floor. These create a feel of 
openness, more human scale and introduce formal diversity to 
the street. 
11.102 In order to accommodate growth in a way that 
respects and enhances the diversity of the London Road 
character, new development should be informed and inspired by 
these qualities.  
Area along Sydenham and Lansdowne Road 
11.103 Areas along Sydenham and Lansdowne Road have 
a very mixed character due to undergoing densification and 
redevelopment. The original character of ‘Large Buildings on 
Relatively Small Plots’ is being gradually replaced with ‘Mixed 
Type Flats’. Residential buildings of a detached form, with 
spacing between them, set back and forecourts are key features 
of urban pattern in the area. 
11.104 In order to maintain and enhance the distinctive 
character of the residential edge of the town centre, and to 
prevent further erosion of it, a cohesive approach needs to be 
taken to ensure new developments retain and reference this 
urban pattern.

 351 Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood 
11.105A  Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood are historic 
Victorian settlements, located on hills in the north-east of the 
borough bordering the London boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark 
and Bromley. The District Centre is focused in the area known 
locally as the Crystal Palace Triangle, where most employment and 
retail opportunities are found. 
11.105B  A significant landmark is the television mast visible 
from long distances and various locations across London. Crystal 
Palace and Upper Norwood is primarily residential where houses 
are interlaced with large parks such as The Lawns, Beaulieu 
Heights, Stambourne Woodland and Upper Norwood Recreation 
Grounds which were laid out in Victorian and Edwardian times, with 
much of the development prompted by the relocation of Crystal 
Palace to Crystal Palace Park in 1851 and the subsequent 
gentrification of the surrounding areas. In Crystal Palace and Upper 
Norwood there are four Conservation Areas and one Local Heritage 
Area, highlighting the quality of surviving character in this area.  
11.105C  Owing to steep hillsides and limited access to public 
transport which is predominantly confined to main roads, Crystal 
Palace and Upper Norwood is relatively car dependent. Congestion 
occurs on the main road links through the area, particularly in the 
Triangle. There are a number of train stations which provide access 
to central London and beyond  
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.106 The vibrant historic centre, sitting at the apex of four 
London boroughs, will offer a mixture of homes, community, 
cultural and leisure facilities; a range of retailing including many independent shops; an employment hub with a thriving arts and 
creative scene centred on a new Enterprise Centre. The South 
Norwood Hill Neighbourhood Centre will be supporting the existing 
and future community with services and facilities beyond a retail 
function. The good relatively transport links, a unique creative 
atmosphere, its heritage and its links to Crystal Palace Park, will 
continue to attract many visitors. 
Homes 
11.107 Sustainable growth of the suburbs with some 
opportunity for windfall sites, and limited infilling, with dispersed 
integration of new homes will respect and evolve existing 
residential character and local distinctiveness. 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities  
11.108 Alongside the District Centre’s retail offer and evening 
economy, the potential for small scale employment will be 
realised. The established art scene will be strengthened by a 
dedicated Enterprise Centre. Cross borough working will ensure 
links to Crystal Palace Park are made, development is planned 
across the borough boundaries and potential employment 
opportunities, including tourism and related visitor 
accommodation, are captured. Other community facilities will be 
encouraged to locate in close proximity to the District Centre. 
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.109 Heritage assets and landmarks will be protected, 
ensuring that new development respects the local character and 
distinctiveness by referring to the Borough Character Appraisal to 
inform design quality. Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood has 
many high-quality heritage assets and examples of original 
character, many of which have Conservation Area Appraisals and  
 352 Management Plans defining their character and future 
management. This includes the Upper Norwood Triangle Area 
which contains a wide variety of historic buildings and adjoins two 
further Conservation Areas in neighbouring boroughs. The Church 
Road Area represents one of Upper Norwood’s grandest and most 
historic streets in stunning landscape settings. Harold Road 
Conservation Area contains a significant grouping of substantial 
and well-detailed late Victorian Villas laid out on wide sweeping 
roads. Beulah Hill Conservation Area contains a number of 
Georgian and Victorian Villas within the historic affluent Beluah 
Spa. Area. The Auckland Road and Howden Road Local Heritage 
Area contains early vernacular houses with well-preserved original 
features dating from the 1880’s including some bespoke Gothic 
inspired detailing. Opportunities for public realm improvements will 
primarily focus on the District Centre with any buildings and 
conversions of a high standard of design to ensure the character 
of the Centre and Conservation Areas are respected. The Local 
Historic Parks and Gardens in the area will be retained and new 
links provided where possible to incorporate them into the Green 
Grid network. 
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.110 Opportunities for new planting will be sought to 
enhance the character of the wooded hillside. Introduction of a 
new east/west link will be supported with improvements to the 
links between green spaces and way finding connecting to the 
existing Capital Ring alongside drawing on the historic connection 
to the Great North Wood . Working with neighbouring boroughs, 
connectivity to Crystal Palace Park will be improved where 
possible to support opportunities for new cycle route connections 
through green spaces and parks .  
Transport 11.111 Improvements will be sought to create an environment 
more pleasant to walk and cycle through, with better connections 
and permeability for cyclists and pedestrians alike. The community 
will enjoy better quality, more frequent and more reliable bus 
services connecting with Croydon Metropolitan Centre . The tram 
system in Croydon Public Transport  will be further supported by 
promoting a new branch link to  line or other public transport 
improvements serving Crystal Palace. The one way gyratory 
system acts as a barrier to pedestrians and cyclists and is 
dominated by through traffic ways a way to address this would be 
to reverse the gyratory. The residential neighbourhoods in Upper 
Norwood are subject to high volumes of through traffic. The 
Council is intending to introduce measures in this area, to increase 
walking, cycling and reduce car use via making the streets quieter, 
safer, healthier. The community will enjoy better quality, more 
frequent and more reliable bus services connecting with Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre, however this can only be supported by the 
provision of more bus standing capacity in the Triangle area that 
should be delivered alongside any significant development in the 
area. Travel plans will look to ease congestion at peak times by 
encouraging walking, cycling or public transport especially for 
school journeys.

 354 General character 
11.112 Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood are historic 
Victorian settlements, picturesquely located on green hills. It has 
a number of significant landmarks such as the Croydon television 
mast visible from long distances and various locations across 
London. Paragraph deleted  
11.113 Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood is primarily 
residential Place where houses are interlaced with large parks 
such as The Lawns, Beaulieu Heights, Stambourne Woodland 
and Upper Norwood Recreation Grounds which were laid out in 
Victorian and Edwardian times. The original local character 
contained ‘Large Houses On Relatively Small Plots’. Much of the 
historical architecture has been transformed into contemporary 
residential characters types such as ‘Planned Estates Of Semi 
Detached Houses’ and ‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated 
Grounds' and 'Compact Houses On Relatively Small Plots’. 
There are areas where high quality examples of the original 
character have survived. These have been designated as 
Conservations Areas.  Paragraph deleted  
11.114 The Upper Norwood Triangle Conservation Area 
predominantly contains the historic character of ‘Urban Shopping 
Areas’. It is focused around the historic district centre where 
several London boroughs meet. The Upper Norwood Triangle 
Conservation Area adjoins the Crystal Palace Park Conservation 
Area in Bromley and the Westow Hill Conservation Area in 
Lambeth and contains a wide variety of historic buildings.  
Paragraph deleted  
11.115 The Church Road Conservation Area predominantly 
encompasses the character of ‘Large Houses On Relatively 
Small Plots’ mixed with the historic green open areas of Westow 
Park, Stambourne Woodland and Beaulieu Heights. It is focused 
on one of Upper Norwood's grandest and most historic streets in a stunning landscape setting, the area also encompasses 
Beaulieu Heights, Sylvan Hill and Grange Hill as well as several 
Listed and Locally Listed Buildings . Paragraph deleted  
11.116 The Harold Road Conservation Area predominantly 
encompasses the character of ‘Large Houses On Relatively 
Small Plots’. It is an area centred on one of Upper Norwood's 
grandest residential streets with associated Upper Norwood 
Recreation Ground, and formed of large Victorian villas which 
were built for residents drawn to the area in the late 19th century 
by the relocated Crystal Palace. Paragraph deleted  
11.117 The Beulah Hill Conservation Area encompasses the 
mix of ‘Large Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ and ‘Detached 
Houses On Relatively Large Plots’. It is a significant grouping of 
Georgian and Victorian Villas within the historic affluent Beulah 
Spa area, partly located in the woodland setting, including a 
number of Listed and Locally Listed Buildings . Paragraph deleted  
11.118 The Auckland Road and Howden Road Local 
Heritage Area consists of ‘Large Houses On Relatively Small 
Plots’ . It contains early vernacular houses with well-preserved 
original features dating from the 1880’s. These include some 
bespoke Gothic inspired detailing.  Paragraph deleted   
 355 Policy DM39: Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood 
Within Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.7. 
 
How the policy works 
11.119 Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood has a 
predominately consistent character which can be managed by 
other  policies. Additionally, the high concentration of heritage 
assets within this Place will enable its character to be managed 
through Conservation Area Appraisals and Management Plans 
and Croydon’s Conservation Area General Guidance. 
Allocating land for development 
11.120 Table 11.7 below sets out the proposed use on

 356 Kenley and Old Coulsdon 
11.120A  Kenley and Old Coulsdon is a suburban area in the 
south of the borough bordering Surrey with green wooded hillsides 
(Dollypers Hill, Roydons Wood) and green open spaces (Kenley 
Common, Riddlesdown, Kenley Aerodrome) located within and 
around it. There is a strong link between the green infrastructure 
and the built environment. This creates a feeling of spaciousness or 
openness and can be seen in the layout of the built environment.  
11.120B  Kenley’s limited shopping and community facilities are 
concentrated in the area between the Godstone Road and Kenley 
station and on Old Lodge Lane. The area is framed by green space 
of Riddlesdown to the north and railway to the south. In Old 
Coulsdon, shopping and community facilities are concentrated on 
the north side of Coulsdon Road. Nearby Purley provides many 
facilities for residents of this area.  
11.120C  Kenley Aerodrome is one of the most complete fighter 
airfields associated with the Battle of Britain to have survived, 
making it a battlefield site of particular national historic significance. 
The Bradmore Green Conservation Area is the heart of the historic 
Old Coulsdon and preserves the historic rural village character 
made by the green spaces of Bradmore Green and Grange Park. 
11.120D  The Kenley Community Plan (2020) outlines the key 
economic, social and environmental issues facing the area. Based 
on this, it sets out key priorities for investment in facilities, services 
and infrastructure identified by the local community, as this area is 
expected to change and growth in the future. A summary of the key 
issues identified by this are; a need a enhance public transport, 
increasing provision of parking near the station and shopping 
parades, safety of cyclist/pedestrians’; a lack of community spaces 
for residents of all ages; a need to enhance the quality of the public realm and facilities in the Neighbourhood centre and more 
employment opportunities for the young.  This plan is a key piece of 
evidence that has informed the content of the Local Plan and will be 
a material consideration for determining applications 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.121 Kenley and Old Coulsdon, linked by Kenley Common 
will continue to be wooded hillside residential settlements retaining 
their suburban character. Connectivity between Kenley 
Aerodrome, Kenley railway station, Bradmore Green and the 
numerous green spaces will be improved where possible by 
enhanced Green Grid links for walking and cycling. Focused 
enhancements to community hubs will support the vitality of local 
organisations and improve the offer of activities for local residents. 
Upgrades to the public realm, new/enhanced walking, and cycling 
routes will support active and sustainable travel, as well as reduce 
congestion as part of a wider good growth vision for Kenley and 
Old Coulsdon

with some opportunity for windfall sites will see growth mainly by 
infilling with dispersed integration of new homes respecting 
existing residential character and local distinctiveness . Areas  of 
Moder ate Intensification ha ve been designated to the North of 
Kenley, near Kenley Railway Station and North West of Kenley 
with good access to Purley District Centre. These are currently low 
density residential area, which are considered to have good 
access to railway station, as well as local services. Due to this,  
 357 these are considered a sustainable location for moderate 
intensification via new residential development that results in a 
reasonable increase in the density of area.  Development will need 
to be well designed to respect and help evolve the existing 
suburban residential character and local distinctiveness of the 
area. 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.123 The shopping parades in the area provide some jobs 
with Coulsdon Manor Hotel providing further employment 
opportunities. The Old Coulsdon and Kenley (Godstone Road) 
Neighbourhood Centres will be supporting the existing and future 
community with services and facilities beyond a retail function. 
Character, Heritage and Design   
11.124 New development will respect the local character and 
distinctiveness, referring to the Borough Character Appraisal to 
inform design quality. Opportunities for public realm improvements 
will focus on the Conservation Area of Bradmore Green. Any 
buildings and conversions should be of a high standard of design 
to ensure the characters of the Conservation Areas are respected . 
Within the Bradmore Green and Kenley Aerodrome areas, 
development should seek to protect and enhance the character, 
setting and significance of this area and its heritage assets. The 
green spaces and openness of these heritage assets will need to 
be protected and enhanced, with opportunities to link these 
spaces into the green grid. The scheduled monuments on and 
near Kenley Aerodrome will be maintained and restored to 
address their heritage at-risk status. Opportunities for public realm 
improvements will focus on the Conservation Area of Bradmore 
Green, Godstone Road and Old Lodge Lane  Environment and Climate Change 
11.125 Where possible the Caterham Bourne should be de-
culverted to create a more natural environment, whilst 
encouraging biodiversity. Kenley has areas with steep catchments 
and private roads with little or no drainage resulting in regular 
flooding occurrences and as such is especially susceptible to 
climate change. Development in the flood zone , and where 
groundwater flooding is prevalent, such as Kenley Lane,  will be 
guided by the policies of the Plan to reduce flood risk. Wherever 
possible, flood risk will be mitigated through naturally based 
sustainable drainage system including attenuation tanks and 
soakaways .  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.126 Links to existing green spaces and the extensive 
Green Grid network of paths from the residential areas will be 
improved and added to where possible, to provide more 
opportunities for cycling and walking. New/enhanced links will be 
provided to/from the archaeological sites, Local Historic Parks and 
Gardens , and Conservation Areas in the area and where feasible 
these will be incorporated into the Green Grid network.  Green Grid 
links will develop a stronger direct connection to the South London 
Downs National Nature Reserve . 
Transport  
11.127 With its topography of steep hillsides the existing 
transport arteries are likely to remain, with local bus services, 
connections and levels of access maintained. Access will be 
improved where possible to an expanded Green Grid network with 
improved walking and cycling links to Kenley Reedham, and 
Purley  railway stations  and as well as linkage s to Whyteleafe 
railway station in the adjoining Tandridge District. A new cycle and 
bridleway linking Riddlesdown, Kenley Aerodrome, Kenley 
Common, and Coulsdon Common is planned to improve orbital  
 358 movement throughout the area. Improvements to the public realm, 
including safer pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and traffic 
calming measures, will improve the experience of pedestrians and 
cyclists and encourage sustainable travel options, whilst 
addressing vehicular traffic issues. The community will enjoy 
better quality, more frequent and reliable bus services connecting 
to Purley and Croydon Metropolitan Centre. Travel plans will look 
to ease congestion at peak times by encouraging walking, cycling 
or public transport especially for school journeys. Roads in the 
area will need to be improved.  General traffic volumes will need to 
decrease and footpaths will need to be provided (where 
necessary), to ensure that pedestrians and cyclists are prioritised, 
and to accommodate further development sustainably.

 360 General character 
11.128 Kenley and Old Coulsdon is a suburban area with 
green wooded hillsides (Dollypers Hill, Roydons Wood) and 
green open spaces (Kenley Common, Riddlesdown, Kenley 
Aerodrome) located within and around it. There is a strong link 
between the green infrastructure and the built environment. This 
creates a feeling of spaciousness or openness can be seen in 
the layout of the built environment. Paragraph deleted  
11.129 The built areas of Kenley and Old Coulsdon 
predominantly consist of the following residential character types: 
‘Detached Houses On Relatively Large Plots’ and ‘Planned 
Estates Of Semi-Detached Houses’. The residential character is 
reinforced by consistent building lines and setbacks that create 
large green front gardens or (in the case of flatted development) 
grounds and rear gardens with tree planting. Paragraph deleted  
11.130 Kenley and Old Coulsdon's shopping and community 
facilities are concentrated in the area between the Godstone 
Road and Kenley station. The area is framed by green space of 
Riddlesdown to the north and railway to the south.  Paragraph 
deleted  11.131 Kenley’s public realm, with features such as grass 
verges with tree planting, reflects the close coexistence of nature 
and built environment. Narrow lanes with extensive tree canopy 
cover and streets often with one footway and green areas of 
planting on the opposite side are all characteristic features of the 
public realm. Paragraph deleted  
11.132 In areas where there are no grass verges, mature 
trees located within front gardens of residential developments 
provide extensive tree canopy cover, contributing to the 
impression of tree lined streets. Paragraph deleted  
11.133 The Bradmore Green Conservation Area is the heart 
of the historic Old Coulsdon. It preserves the historic village 
character made by the green spaces of Bradmore Green and 
Grange Park mixed with ‘Suburban Shopping Area’ , ‘Detached 
Houses On Relatively Large Plots’ and ‘Planned Estates Of 
Semi-Detached Houses’. The area contains a number of historic 
Listed and Locally Listed Buildings such as the 18th century 
farmhouse and the 13th century Grade I Listed church of St John.  
Paragraph deleted  
11.134 The Kenley Aerodrome Conservation Area is one of 
the most complete fighter airfield associated with the Battle of 
Britain to have survived, making it a battlefield site of particular 
national historic significance. The Conservation Area includes a 
number of scheduled monuments.  Paragraph deleted  
Policy DM40: Kenley and Old Coulsdon 
DM40.1  Area s of Moderate  Intensification have been designat ed to the north  and north west of Kenley and Old Coulsdon. The sustainable 
moderate, intensification and renewal of areas within these via proposals for new residential development will be supported t hat result in a 
reaso nable increase in the density. Development will need to be well designed, respect, reflect and help evolve the existing suburban 
character and local distinctiveness of the area . The boundaries of  these are  shown  on the map . 
DM40.2  Within Kenley and Old Cou lsdon allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.8.

 362 Norbury 
11.136A Norbury is a suburban town in the north-west of the 
borough with its District and Local Centres (Norbury and Pollards 
Hill) located along the long linear and dominant route of London 
Road. Scattered amongst Norbury’s residential areas are the green 
spaces of Norbury Park through which Norbury Brook flows, 
Norwood Grove, Biggin Wood, Norbury Hall Park and Pollards Hill 
Park. 
11.136B There is high accessibility to bus and rail 
transportation which reduces car dependency in the area. The 
London Road is an important thoroughfare between London and 
the south, as well as locally as there are a limited number of roads 
travelling north/south through the area.  
11.136C Two Conservation Areas and three Local Heritage 
Areas can be found in Norbury. Norwood Grove Conservation Area 
is focused around the historic Grade II Listed mansion and Grade II 
registered landscape of Norwood Grove and contains a number of 
well preserved and distinctive Listed and Locally Listed Georgian 
and Edwardian houses. The Norbury Estate Conservation Area is a 
dense development from 1914-1921 and represents a unique 
example of Arts and Crafts terraces and is the first outer Lond on 
cottage estate built by the London County Council. 
11.136D London Road (Norbury) Local Heritage Area is an 
example of an 'Urban Shopping Area' character type. The shopping 
parades represent a high quality cross-section of architectural 
styles from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, with the unified 
form of shopfronts at ground floor level and rhythms of red brick 
facades with decorative brick and sandstone features above. 
Beatrice Avenue Local Heritage Area predominantly consists of 
well-preserved late Victorian suburban houses laid out between 1900 and 1936, with many original and bespoke Arts and Crafts 
inspired features. The Local Heritage Area in part of Pollards hills 
South consists of terraced houses which complement the 
predominant character of the area in a particularly creative way. 
This distinctive grouping represents a unique example of individual 
Arts and Crafts terraces laid out to appear as large U-shaped 
buildings with a number of distinctive architectural features . 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.137 Norbury, the northern gateway to Croydon, will 
continue to be characterised by its numerous open spaces. The 
Norbury District Centre will be home to a wide variety of 
businesses, reflecting the diversity of the local population. With a 
mixture of homes, community and cultural facilities and a range of 
retailing including many independent shops, it will have improved 
links to the railway station and Norbury Park. The Green 
Lane/Upper Northwood Road Neighbourhood Centre will be 
supporting the existing and future community with services and 
facilities beyond a retail function. Improvements to green links 
from and to the District Centre will enhance its unique suburban 
and urban qualities qualities and draw on historic links to the Great 
North Wood . 
Homes 
11.138 Sustainable growth of the suburbs with some 
opportunity for windfall sites and infilling, together with dispersed 
integration of new homes will respect and evolve existing 
residential character and local distinctiveness. 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities  
 363 11.139 The Norbury District Centre will continue to reflect the 
local, diverse community and provide local employment and 
services with community facilities encouraged to locate in close 
proximity. Norbury Trading Estate (Integrated Industrial Location) 
will provide employment work space locally. A refurbished Norbury 
Library will continue to act as a key community support and 
learning hub.  
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.140 New development will respect the local character and 
distinctiveness of Norbury with its open spaces and historic park 
and heritage assets referring to the Borough Character Appraisal 
to inform design quality. The Norbury Estate and Norwood Grove 
Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plans infor m 
design quality. Norwood Grove Registered Historic Park and the 
other Local Historic Parks and Gardens in the area including 
Pollards Hill and the Grounds of Norbury Hall will be preserved 
and enhanced with new links provided (where possible) to 
incorporate them into the Green Grid network. .  
Environment and Climate Change 
11.141 There are parcels of land at particular risk of fluvial 
flooding in Norbury, including areas within the Recreation Ground 
and Norbury Park that are designated Flood Zone 3b Functional 
Floodplain. Areas within Norbury are also at risk of surface water 
flooding and a number of specific episodes of have been recorded 
in the last decade.  Where possible, the Norbury Brook should be 
de-culverted to create a more natural environment, encourage 
biodiversity and increase access to nature. Development in the 
flood zones will be guided by the policies of the Plan to reduce 
flood risk.  
Green Grid and Open Space 11.142 Emphasis will be placed on improving quality and 
access to local open spaces. New and existing Green Grid links to 
Biggin Wood (a remnant of the Great North Wood), Norbury Park 
and other open space in Norbury, will be focussed on, with way 
finding to encourage use. 
Transport 
11.143 Linkages with the District Centre and railway station 
will be improved where possible through an expanded Green Grid  
network, encouraging more sustainable travel. Cycling to Norbury 
railway station will be more attractive as cycle facilities are via 
enhanced facilities . The tram system in Croydon will be further 
supported by promoting a new line to Streatham, Brixton and 
Tooting through Norbury. The quality, frequency and reliability of 
bus services connecting to Croydon Metropolitan Centre, will be 
improved as the attraction of the Metropolitan Centre increases. 
Along the London Road Corridor, walking, cycling and public 
transport will be prioritised by reallocating road space and creating 
safer and more attractive environments for these modes of 
transport. Travel plans will look to ease congestion at peak times 
in the Distri ct Centre by encouraging walking, cycling or public 
transport especially for school journeys.

 365 General character 
11.144 Norbury is a suburban town with its District and 
Local Centres located along the long linear route of London 
Road. The built form of ‘Large Buildings With Continuous 
Frontage Line’ and ‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated 
Grounds’ emphasises this linear route and its dominance on the 
area. Paragraph deleted  
11.145 Norbury has a residential character that 
predominantly consists of ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ , 
‘Large Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ and ‘Local Authority 
Built Housing with Public Realm’, enriched by green spaces of 
Norbury Park through which Norbury Brook flows, Biggin Wood, 
Norbury Hall Park and Pollards Hill Park.  Paragraph deleted  
11.146 The Norwood Grove Conservation Area is focused 
around the historic Grade II registered landscape of Norwood 
Grove predominantly surrounded by ‘Detached Houses On 
Relatively Large Plots’. It contains a number of well preserved 
and distinctive Listed and Locally Listed Georgian and 
Edwardian houses. The Conservation Area adjoins the 
Streatham Common Conservation Area in Lambeth.  Paragraph 
deleted  11.147 The Norbury Estate Conservation Area represents 
the unified and consistent residential character type of ‘Local 
Authority Built Housing With Public Realm’. This dense 
development from 1914-1921 represents a unique example of 
Arts and Crafts terraces and is the first outer London cottage 
estate built by the London County Council.  Paragraph deleted  
11.148 The London Road Norbury Local Heritage Area is an 
example of an ‘Urban Shopping Area’ character type. The 
shopping parades represent a high quality cross-section of

has a good range of well-preserved late Victorian suburban 
houses laid out between 1900 and 1936, with many original and 
bespoke Arts and Crafts inspired features. The prominent St 
Phillip’s Church terminates views from the tree-lined residential 
street.  Paragraph deleted  
11.150 The Pollards Hill South Local Heritage Area consists 
of terraced houses which complement the predominant character 
of the area of ‘Planned Estates Of Semi-Detached Houses’ in a 
particularly creative way. This distinctive grouping represents a 
unique example of individual Arts and Crafts terraces laid out to 
appear as large U-shaped buildings with a number of distinctive 
architectural features. The well preserved and distinctive 1930’s 
townscape is an example of an innovative approach to defining 
street frontages through sequence of courtyards.  Paragraph 
deleted   
 366 Policy DM41: Norbury 
DM41.1  Within Norbury District Centre , to facilitate growth and to enhance the distinctive character, development s should:  
a. Complement the existing predominant building heights of 2 storeys up to a maximum of 5 storeys;  
b. Ensure proposal for large buildings are visually consistent with the predominant urban grain; and  
c. Seek opportunity to provide direct access from the  south of London Road to Norbury railway station.  
DM41.2  Within Poll ards Hill Local Centre , to ensure that proposals positively enhance and strengthen the character developments should:  
a. Retain the edge and separation of Pollards Hill Local Centre from othe r adjoining character areas by limiting the urban grain within its 
boundaries;  
b. Complement the existing predominant building heights of 3 storeys up to a maximum of 4 storeys;  
c. Incorporate multi -stock brick as the predominant facing materials of the whole building  or a material which complements multi -stock 
brick ; and 
d. Retain the extent and enhance the quality of the existing public realm within the development, including reinforcing a consis tent building  
line.

How the policy works 
11.151 The areas in which Policies DM41.1 and DM41.2 
apply are shown on the Policies Map. 
11.152 The areas identified for Place-specific development 
management policies are Norbury District Centre and Pollards 
Hill Local Centre. These Place-specific development 
management policies are required to ensure the distinctions, 
edge and separation between the centres and adjoining areas 
are maintained.  11.153 These areas have potential for growth. There are 
precedents on London Road of large and tall buildings however 
these are mainly located outside designated centres. In order to 
retain the distinctiveness of each of Norbury’s centres and t o 
reinforce the prominence of the scale of built environment within 
these areas policies DM41.1 and DM41.2 identify the maximum 
buildings heights along with key architectural features to enable 
growth and retain local distinctiveness.

 368 Purley  
11.154A  Purley is focused around a District centre. It is located 
to the south west of the borough bordering the London Borough of 
Sutton. Purley’s residential areas are generally located on steep 
partially wooded hillsides, with the District Centre found in the valley 
at the important junction of Brighton Road and Godstone Road. 
11.154B  Despite two train stations and frequent bus services, 
the residential areas of Purley are more car dependent than areas 
further north in the borough, which is typical of its twentieth century 
suburbs. Purley has a high proportion of homes with gardens, as 
well as the Rotary Field Recreation Ground and Foxley Wood open 
spaces within walking distance of the District Centre. The large 
expanse of playing fields of Purley Way lie on the hill and slope to 
the north of Purley. 
11.154C  Purley has a rich heritage, notably there is evidence 
of Bronze Age settlement found on Promenade de Verdun in the 
Webb Estate, and the Brighton Road is a historic thoroughfare with 
Roman origins. One Conservation Area and one Local Heritage 
Area are found in Purley. The Webb Estate and Upper Woodcote 
Village Conservation Area with its consistent character is a notable 
Edwardian garden suburb created by developer William Webb 
based upon his Garden First Principles. Its model village, laid out 
around Woodcote Green, is the focus of the area. Both parts of the 
conservation area are rich in historic buildings which are set amidst 
mature landscaping. The Brighton Road (Purley) Local Heritage 
Area contains a collection of shopping parade buildings from the 
late 19th and 20th century, that demonstrate a variety of styles with 
well-preserved and distinctive architectural features. 
11.154D The Council has produced a Purley Strategic 
Regeneration Framework which sets out how the regeneration of the District Centre and its environs could be achieved and this has 
informed this section of the Local Plan. The overall objective of the 
Framework is influence developers working in the area. It also 
supports the community seeking funding opportunities to benefit the 
wider community for social and physical infrastructure and public 
realm improvements. This contains a number of interlinked 
strategies relating to; place making, frontages, culture, the public 
realm environment, as well as movement and access; in order to 
deliver sustainable development. This Framework will be helpful in 
considering development within the Centre.  
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.155 Purley will be a regenerated District Centre, retaining 
its historic local character with a mixture of homes, community and 
cultural facilities and a range of retailing including many 
independent shops. The Purley South/Brighton Road/Downlands 
Road Neighbourhood Centre will be supporting the existing and 
future community with services and facilities beyond a retail 
function. An enhanced public realm with improved accessibility 
and good links to open space and a new Enterprise Centre will all 
contribute to the regeneration of Purley. A regenerated Purley 
District Centre will provide a vibrant heart for Purley. It will be a 
destination with community and cultural facilities and a range of 
retailing including independent shops, cafes, restaurants and an 
Enterprise Centre, together with new housing. Purley District 
Centre will be an inclusive place to dwell and socialise, with the 
High Street providing space for outdoor sitting, strolling and 
events. Its existing open spaces and Local Heritage Area will be 
safeguarded and new development will help transform hostile 
main roads into urban streets that give less space to traffic and  
 369 more space to people. New locally distinctive buildings and 
additional multi-functional high performing open spaces and routes 
will integrate existing and future residential and business 
communities and strengthen Purley’s unique sense of place within 
the Borough. High quality, safe, direct and active pedestrian 
routes will connect buildings and spaces in the Purley District 
Centre with Purley Station and the growing number of new homes 
in the surrounding hinterland. The Purley South/Brighton 
Road/Downlands Road Neighbourhood Centre will help support 
the existing and future community with services and facilities 
beyond a retail function and a new primary school close to 
Reedham Station will strengthen the nearby Neighbourhood 
Centre and support growth in the Place as a whole.    
Homes 
11.156 As a broad location the main focus of major 
residential growth will be in and around the District Centre with 
high quality residential development that will respect the existing 
residential character and local distinctiveness.   The main focus of 
growth will be in and within 800m of the Purley District Centre and 
station, with a lower level of growth close to/within the 
Neighbourhood Centre. To enable growth, a transportation 
corridor will be promoted along the London Road, Brighton Road 
and Purley Way corridors. This will also be supported by 
improvements in the Croydon Transport Hub transformation area 
that will enable the metroisation of the borough’s suburban rail 
network that connects to Purley. An Area of Focused 
Intensification (AFI) has been designated at Purley District Centre. 
A small part of this AFI falls within the District Centre (.i.e. Site 
347) and a large part of it is located on the edge of this. It is also 
located near Purley and Reedham Railway Stations. This is 
considered a sustainable location, where high density residential 
development and renewal will be encouraged, as well as high 
density mixed use development on Site 347; due to its proximity to the station and services/facilities within the District 
Centre .Further, Areas of Moderate Intensification have been 
designated to the north, east of Purley, as well as to the south 
west (crossing into Coulsdon) and south (crossing into Kenley and 
Old Coulsdon), These are currently a low density residential 
areas, which are considered to have good access to Purley, 
Purley Oaks and Reedham Rail stations, as well as local services 
within Purley District Centre, Brighton Road Sanderstead Local 
Centre (.i.e. areas to north and east). Due to this, it is considered 
a sustainable location for moderate renewal, intensification via 
new residential development that results in a reasonable increase 
in the density of area. Developments will need to respect and 
evolve the existing suburban character and local distinctiveness. 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.157 Realisation of the potential of Purley for creative 
industries through the development of a new Enterprise Centre will 
support the local econom y. A new Enterprise Centre, a multi-
purpose space that facilitates commercial, community and cultural 
activities, will be located as part of a newly provided leisure centre. 
Purley District Centre is also well placed to accommodate 
additional office and shared workspace to cater for businesses 
that chose to establish in or relocate to outer London centres. 
There may be opportunities to re-locate the library to a more 
central location in the Centre, to the north of Godstone Road. 
Independent shops and restaurants will be encouraged in the 
Purley District Centre  with enhanced public realm and open 
spaces and community facilities in close proximity to rejuvenate 
the centre’s daytime and evening economy.  The retail, leisure and 
business offer in the Purley District Centre will complement 
Croydon Metropolitan Town Centre and new Local and 
Neighbourhood Centres along Purley Way. At Purley Station there 
is rail head that distributes aggregates and is safeguarded in the 
South London Waste Plan   
 370 Character, Heritage and Design   
11.158 New development will respect and evolve the existing 
local character and distinctiveness of Purley, referring to the 
Borough Character Appraisal , Suburban Design Guide and the 
Webb Estate Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan 
to inform design quality . Purley is known for its diverse urban and 
suburban areas and its tree-lined streets and gardens. This leafy 
character will be strengthened with opportunities for new Blue and 
Green Infrastructure in the Purley District Centre and along 
Brighton Road to help mitigate flood risk, the urban heat island 
effect and the negative impact of heavy through-traffic. Any 
buildings and conversions should be of a high standard of design 
to ensure the character and significance of the Centre its Local 
Heritage Area; Nationally and Locally Listed Buildings; and the 
nearby Webb Estate and Upper Northcote Village Conservation 
Area and its setting are respected .  New links will be provided 
to/from the Registered Historic and Local Historic Parks and 
Gardens in the area will be retained and new links provided where 
possible, to incorporate them into the Green Grid network. Blue 
and Green infrastructure will be woven in to an enhanced public 
realm in ways which respond positively to and help evolve local 
characte r. 
Environment and Climate Change  
11.159 Through enabling development, potential exists to 
implement flood mitigation and adaptation measures along the 
Brighton Road and south east towards Kenley. Purley District 
Centre and the surrounding area may be suitable for a district heat 
network .  Brighton Road and the Purley Cross roundabout is the 
most frequent area in the borough to be susceptible to surface 
water flooding, with many historic and severe flooding events 
occurring within the last 20 years. Severe groundwater flooding 
                                            
108 London Borough of Croydon SFRA Level 1 (2020)  has also occurred in Purley when sustained periods of heavy 
rainfall raised groundwater to exceptionally high levels. Owing to 
the geology and topography of parts of Purley being Upper Chalk 
bedrock, infiltration Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems should 
not be considered in these locations108. Developers may need to 
liaise with the Council Local Lead Flooding Authority team and the 
Environmental Agency, to investigate the suitability of SUDS in 
certain locations and whether any other measures may need to be 
implemented due to the geological characteristic and topography 
of the area, to reduce flood risk  Purley District  Centre and the 
surrounding area may be suitable for a district heat network.  The 
area’s south facing slopes and suburban charac ter provide 
excellent opportunities for Photo Voltaics, air source heat pumps 
and other renewable energy technologies to be integrated with 
new development.  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.160 Opportunities to improve links to existing open 
spaces, along with way finding around Purley, and to and from the 
District Centre will be sought.  The High Street, Brighton Road, 
Whytecliffe Road, the District Centre’s lanes, public spaces and 
roofscape are all considered to be part of a Blue and Green 
Infrastructure where accessibility, quality will be prioritised.  
Transport  
11.161 New bus route  measures and improvements, will be 
developed where possible along the Brighton Road linking 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre with Purley District Centre. Cycle 
facilities will be expanded at Purley railway station.  Measures to 
improve connectivity for pedestrians in Purley District Centre will 
be explored. Travel plans will look to ease congestion at peak 
times by encouraging walking, cycling or public transport  
 371 especially for school journeys. Realisation of the potential for the 
Warren Road railhead to transfer freight to rail will be supported. 
The Purley Cross gyratory arrangement creates notable 
severance through the centre of Purley and restricts connectivity 
for pedestrians and cyclists. Significant improvements to the 
gyratory will focus on safe pedestrians and cycling routes, as well 
as improvements for buses. These improvements will enhance the 
District centre and allow for a possible extension of the tram 
network (either along Purley Way or from Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre to Coulsdon along Brighton Road). The Council will work 
with TfL and other stakeholders to develop a holistic strategy 
which significantly improves the road network, allows for 
necessary access and servicing, avoids displacing traffic on to 
local streets, reduces severance and transforms the public realm 
by stitching together the District Centre on both sides of a 
reconfigured Godstone Road. This will also include a review of 
local bus routing and standing provision within the Purley District 
Centre to retain bus efficiency and connectivity whilst being able to 
accommodate public realm improvements. Purley station is the 5th 
busiest station in Croydon with over 3 million journeys made each 
year to or from the station109. The Council will work with Network 
Rail, the train operating company and other stakeholders to 
maximise opportunities to improve train frequency and reliability 
(including the Brighton Mainline Upgrade programme). The 
introduction of other storage and delivery collection facilities is 
also proposed for convenience and to reduce delivery vehicle 
trips. A network of mobility hubs will be delivered around the 
District centre, including at Purley station, to accommodate shared 
transport services such as electric car clubs, e-bikes and e-
scooter hire schemes. ‘Mobility Hubs’ will support promotion of

 373 General character 
11.162 Purley is a suburban market town located on 
wooded hillsides and in the valley. Its spatial structure is organised 
along the strong dominant corridor of the Brighton Road and 
Godstone Road where a wide variety of character types coexist. 
These are ‘Urban Shopping Areas’ , ‘Industrial Estates’ , ‘Retail 
Estates & Business & Leisure Parks’ and moderate density 
residential areas such as ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ , 
‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated Grounds’, ‘Compact 
Houses On Relatively Small Plots’, and ‘Planned Estates Of Semi-
Detached Houses’. ‘Large Buildings With Continuous Frontage 
Line’ dominate in the District Centre and its vicinity.  Paragraph 
deleted  11.163 The residential character outside of Brighton Road is 
fairly uniform and consists of large detached houses on relatively 
large plots with minimal public realm and low density scattered 
houses on relatively small plots. Paragraph deleted  
11.164 The Webb Estate and Upper Woodcote Village 
Conservation Area with its consistent character of ‘Scattered 
Houses On Large Plots’ is a notable Edwardian garden suburb 
created by developer William Webb based upon his Garden First 
Principles. The model village, laid out around Woodcote Green, 
is the focus of the area. Both Conservation Areas are rich in 
historic buildings which are set amidst mature landscaping.  
Paragraph deleted  
11.165 The Brighton Road (Purley) Local Heritage Area has 
an ‘Urban Shopping Area’ character. It contains collection of 
shopping parad e buildings from the late 19th and 20th century , 
that demonstrate a variety of styles with well-preserved and 
distinctive architectural features.  Paragraph deleted
Policy DM42: Purley 
DM42.1  Within Purley District Centre and its environs , to ensure that pr oposals positively enhance and strengthen the character and

Aveling Close and Fairbairn Close; and  
d) Enhance the suburban shopping area character o f this section of Brighton Road ; and 
e) Preserve and enhance the listed Purley Town Hall and its setting  
DM42.3  In the area of the junction of Brigh ton Road and Purley Downs Road , to reduce the impact of Brighton Road as a linear route,  
clearly differenti ate the area from Purley District Centr e and Brighton Road (Sanderstead Road) Local Centre  and strengthen the sense of 
place, proposals should:  
a. Retain and create open glimpses and vistas between buildings;  
b. Introduce building with landscapes that respond and reflect the layout of the 1930s bloc ks of Lansdowne Court and Purley Court; and  
c. Complement the existing predominant building heights of 2 storeys up to a maximum of 5 storeys.  
DM42.3a  An Area of focused Intensification has been designated near/within Purley District  Centre. High density res idential development 
and renewal will be supported within this location and the boundaries of these are shown  on the map . Development should:  
(i) Be well designed to protect, enhance the suburban character, setting of this transport corridor into/out of t he settlement ; 
(ii) Include adequate measures to demonstrate development; will minimise and mitigate any flood risk (where necessary), it will be safe for 
future residents a nd not increase risk elsewhere and  
(iii) Assess and mitigate any potential noise po llution impacts, near Purley and Reedham Railway Stations , to create a health en vironment 
for future residents.   
 375  
 DM42.3b  Areas of moderate intensification have been designated to the north, east of Purley, as well as south west of this crossing i nto 
Coulsdon and south ( into Kenley and Old Coulsdon). The sustainable moderate, intensification and renewal of areas within these via 
proposals for new residential development will be supported that result in a reasonable increase in the density. Development will need to be 
well designed, respect, reflect and help evolve the existing suburban character and local distinctiveness of the area . The boundaries of these 
are shown on the map . 
DM42.4  Within Purley allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.10. 
 
How the policy works 
11.166 The areas in which Policies DM42.1 to DM42.3 b 
apply are shown on the Policies Map. 
Purley District Centre and its environs 
11.167 Purley District Centre is a well-defined urban town 
with a high concentration of commercial and community uses. 
The road network and a large scale roundabout divide the 
centre. The vision for Purley Place and Policy DM63 seek to 
ensure that opportunities can be taken to reduce the dominance 
of the Purley Cross gyratory, through lane reduction, cycle lane 
provision, bus priority measures and enlarging and improving the 
public realm in order to significantly improve the function and 
attractiveness of Purley District Centre.  
11.168 This area has a varied topography which presents 
opportunities for tall buildings and the availability of vacant land 
creates the potential for growth. Policy DM42.1 facilitates this 
growth  and identifies architectural features that should be 
referenced in the design of the development to enhance the 
distinctive character of Purley District Centre .  
11.168 A The Purley Regeneration Framework calls for the 
development of Purley-specific guidance on the key architectural 
features that should be referenced in the design of the development to enhance the distinctive character of the District 
Centre and its environs. Proposals for new development within 
District Centre will need to consider the Purley Strategic 
Regeneration Framework and demonstrate how it will help 
achieve the successful delivery of the vision, objectives and 
strategies for delivering sustainable development. Development 
proposals will be supported that make adequate funding, or set 
aside land (if necessary) to deliver local projects, social, physical 
infrastructure and public realm improvements identified within this.     
11.168B  The Policy also encourages the meanwhile 
use/interim frontage treatment of prominent vacant/derelict sites 
in the Purley District Centre, which currently include the Purley 
Baptist Church and Old China sites  
The environs of Reedham station 
11.169 The environs of Reedham station have good public 
transport accessibility and a varied character including ‘Urban 
Shopping Area’ , ‘Large Buildings with Continuous Frontage Line , 
‘Large Buildings With Spacing’, ‘Medium Rise Blocks With 
Associated Grounds’ and ‘Planned Estates Of Semi-Detached 
Houses’ . The environs includes the listed Purley Town Hall.  
11.170 A Place-specific development management policy is 
required to facilitate growth, improve pedestrian and cycle  
 376 permeability across the railway line and to create the sense of 
place. 
The area of the junction of Brighton Road and Purley Downs Road 
11.171 The Brighton Road/Purley Downs Road junction 
area forms the edge between South Croydon and Purley. 
Capella Court forms a visual marker which closes the vistas 
along the Purley and South Croydon sections of Brighton Road. 
The massing of Capella Court dominates the residential and 
industrial buildings within the surrounding area. This area's 
distinct qualities are informed by the landmark building 
surrounded by low rise structures set in greenery. 
11.172 Detailed policies are required to strengthen the 
character of the Brighton Road and Purley Downs Road junction 
area. 
Allocating land for development 
11.173 Table 11.10 below sets out the proposed use on 
specific sites in Purley. The location and boundary of each

 378 Sanderstead 
11.173A  Sanderstead is a suburban residential area located to 
the south east of the borough bordering the district of Tandridge in 
Surrey. The historic settlement is focused on Addington Road, and 
the junction with Limpsfield Road. It is surrounded by large scale 
green open spaces and Green Belt such as Mitchley Wood, 
Riddlesdown and Kings Wood. 
11.173B  Sanderstead is a historic settlement that has evolved 
slowly over time with many significant historical buildings and 
landmarks remaining to this day, including the 13th Century All 
Saints Church. The surrounding Green Belt and golf courses have 
held back outward expansion of Sanderstead helping it to retain a 
rural and village identity.  
11.173C Access to public transport is limited and car 
dependency is high. There are train stations near to Sanderstead 
but they are not in the Local Centres or near the main community 
facilities. At peak times, some of the minor roads towards the valley 
bottom running parallel to Brighton Road are used as alternative 
routes increasing congestion . 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.174 Sanderstead will continue to be a predominantly 
1930s suburb, with an historic  village character focussed on t he 
pond and All Saint’s  church, which includes a number of heritage 
assets, surrounded by substantial green space with improved 
cycle and pedestrian links, served by the Sanderstead and 
Hamsey Green Local Centres. 
Homes 11.175 An area of sustainable growth of the suburbs with 
some opportunity for windfall sites, growth will mainly be of infilling 
with dispersed integration of new homes that respect existing 
residential character and local distinctiveness . An area of 
sustainable growth of the suburbs with some opportunity for 
windfall sites, growth will mainly be of infilling.  This is currently a 
low density residential area, which is considered to have good 
access to Sanderstead, Purley Oaks and South Croydon Railway 
Stations, as well as local services within Purley District Centre and 
Brighton Road (Seldson Road) Local Centre. Due to this, it is 
considered a sustainable location for moderate renewal, 
intensification via new residential development that results in a 
reasonable increase in the density of area.  Residential 
development will need to be well designed, so that it respects and 
evolves existing residential character and local distinctiveness  
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.176 Employment opportunities will be concentrated in the 
two Local Centres of Sanderstead and Hamsley Green with 
predominantly independent shops supporting the local community. 
Character, Heritage and Design   
11.177 New development will respect the character of the 
historic village, including its heritage assets and their settings, and 
the area’s broader  local character and  distinctiveness referring to 
the Borough Character Appraisal to inform design quality. Any 
opportunities for public realm improvements will focus on the two 
Local Centres of Sanderstead and Hamsey Green. Any buildings  
and conversions should be of a high standard of design to ensure 
the characters of the Centres are respected.  The distinct identities 
between the northern and southern ends of Limpsfield Road will  
 379 continue to be defined through differences in the density, of the 
urban grain.  
Environment and Climate Change 
14.177A  There have been a number episodes of surface water 
flooding in Sanderstead, particularly in the Hamsey Green Local 
Centre area and along main roads through the area. 
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.178 As a key link in the east part of the Green Grid 
network of the borough, links to existing green spaces from the 
residential areas will be improved with further connections added 
where possible. The additional green links, with way finding, will 
enable more opportunities for walking and cycling within and 
through the area particularly on orbital routes linking Kenley, 
Hamsey Green and Selsdon . The Local Historic Parks and 
Gardens of Kings Wood and the landscape settings of heritage 
assets including All Saints Church, Sanderstead Pond, and 
Selsdon Park Hotel will be retained and new links will be provided 
where feasible to incorporate them into the Green Grid network .  
Transport  
11.179 With its topography of steep hillsides, the existing 
transport arteries are likely to remain with local bus service 
connections and level of access maintained. Despite having poor 
public transport accessibility, the existing bus services along the 
existing key radial and orbital roads will be improved offering even 
more frequent and reliable service and access into Purley and 
Croydon with their fast train links. With its topography of steep 
hillsides cycling and walking will be difficult for some people. 
Access will be improved where possible to an expanded Green 
Grid network with improved walking and cycling links to 
Sanderstead railway station. The community will enjoy better 
quality, more frequent and reliable bus services connecting with Croydon Metropolitan Centre. The residential area to the north of 
Sanderstead which had no public transport provision will now be 
covered by a demand responsive transit service which covers an 
area focused on Sanderstead and Selsdon. Travel plans will look 
to ease congestion at peak times in the Local Centre by 
encouraging walking, cycling or public transport especially for 
school journeys.   
 380 Figure 11.11 Sanderstead  -graphic updated  
 
 381 General character 
11.180 Sanderstead is a suburban Place located on a 
hilltop, with residential areas of Purley Downs, Riddlesdown, 
Hamsey Green and Sanderstead surrounded by large scale 
green open spaces such as Mitchley Wood, Riddlesdown and 
Kings Wood. Paragraph deleted  11.181 The predominant residential character consists of 
detached ‘Housing on Relatively Large Plots’ on the hillsides 
leading to the Local Centre, ‘Planned Estates Of Semi-Detached 
Houses’  at the top of Sanderstead Hill, and some ‘Local Authority 
Built Housing With Public Realm’’ towards the Local Centre of 
Hamsey Green.  Paragraph deleted  
Policy DM43: Sanderstead 
DM43.1  Within S anderstead Local Centre , to respect and enhance the distinctive qualities proposals should:  
 Reinforce the suburban shopping area character;  
 Reference, respect and enhance architectural features such as the consistent rhythm of pairs of buildings with identical frontages and 
the articulation of openings;  
 Retain features such as the projecting bay windows;  
 Retain wide vistas and strengthen visual connections to green open spaces ; and  including the village character of open spaces to the 
north ; 
 Improve walking and cycling connec tivity and access to open space  and 
 Respect the setting of nationally and locally listed buildings.  
DM43.2 Within Ha msey Green Local Centre , to respect and enhance the distinctive ‘Suburban Shopping Area ’ character of Hamsey Green, 
proposals should:  
a. Reinforce the suburban shopping area character;  
b. Positively reference, respect and enhance architectural features such as the consistent rhythm and articulation of window and  doors;  
c. Ensure the extent of the public realm within the vicinity of the development is retained and improved; and  
d. Incorporate multi -stock brick or white render as the predominant facing material , or a material which is complementary to multi -stock brick 
or white render  
DM4 3.2A An area of moderate intensificati on has been designated to the north east of Sanderstead. The sustainable moderate, 
intensification and renewal of areas within this via proposals for new residential development will be supported that result in a reasonable  
 382 increase in the density. Develop ment will need to be well designed, respect, reflect and help evolve the existing suburban character and 
local distinctiveness of the area . The boundaries of these are shown on the map .  
DM43.3 Within Sanderstead allocate sites for development as set out i n Table 11.11.  
 383 How the policy works 
11.182 The areas in which Policies DM43.1 and DM43.2 A 
apply are shown on the Policies Map. 
Sanderstead Local Centre 
11.183 Sanderstead Local Centre has visual and physical 
links onto neighbouring green areas to the west. It has a 
consistent building line to the east. The character of the low rise 
‘Urban Shopping Area’ is enriched by ‘Institutions With 
Associated Grounds’ , ‘Retail Estates’ and ‘Terraced Houses And 
Cottages’. 
11.184 The ‘Urban Shopping Area’ contains distinctive 
architectural features such a consistent rhythm created by pairs 
of multi-stock brick buildings with matching facades containing 
windows and doors identically articulated. Within this area 
detailed policies are required to strengthen the identity of the 
Local Centre. 
Hamsey Green Local Centre 
11.185 Hamsey Green is defined by its ‘Suburban Shopping 
Area’  character with Green verges and tree planting. Sections of 
the Local Centre have a consistent character. This can be seen 
through elements such as the rhythm and articulation of window 
and doors. In areas where the character is inconsistent the 
Place-specific development management policy in 0 will help 
enhance Hamsey Green's local identity and encourage growth. 
Allocating land for development 
11.186 Table 11.11 below sets out the proposed use on 
specific sites in Sanderstead. The location and boundary of each 
detailed proposal can be found on the Policies Map and further

 384 Selsdon 
11.186A  Selsdon is a suburban residential area situated in the 
south east of the borough bordering the district of Tandridge in 
Surrey. The area is focused on Addington Road and Selsdon Park 
Road with a well-defined District Centre, surrounded by large scale 
green open spaces such as Selsdon Wood, Heathfield and 
Littleheath Woods. 
11.186B  Car dependency is high in Selsdon due to the lack of 
public transport and convenient rail stations, as well as the hilly 
nature of the area. The landscape character of Selsdon is one of 
being on the edge of suburbia next to the countryside, and the area 
has a number of local and longer distance views of adjacent 
countryside and Croydon Metropolitan Centre.   
11.186C The Selsdon Community Plan (2020) outlines the key 
economic, social and environmental issues facing the area; as well 
as sets out the key priorities for investment in facilities, services and 
infrastructure identified by the local community, as this area is 
expected to change and grow in the future. A summary of the key 
issues identified by this are; a need to protect, enhance promote 
use of green spaces (including children’s play areas); a need a 
enhance public transport and provide bus shelters, increasing 
provision of parking near shopping areas, a need to provide 
new/enhanced community facilities for all ages and sports facilities, 
a need to limit fast food places and increase variety of other uses to 
promote viability, vitality of the District centre. The Community Plan 
is a key piece of evidence that has informed the content of the 
Local Plan.  
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 11.187 Selsdon District Centre will continue to provide a 
range of services for the residential population in a suburban 
setting with good links to its green open spaces and countryside. 
Selsdon Park Road/Featherbed Lane Neighbourhood Centre will 
be supporting the existing and future community with services and 
facilities beyond a retail function.  
Homes 
11.188 An area of sustainable growth of the suburbs with 
some opportunity for windfall sites will see growth mainly confined 
to infilling . with dispersed integration of new homes respecting 
existing residential character and local distinctiveness.  An area of 
Focused Intensification has been designated to the east of 
Selsdon, near Gravel Hill Tram Stop, which is also located within 
proximity to Selsdon District Centre. This is considered a highly 
sustainable location, where high density residential development 
and renewal will be encouraged. This is due to its proximity to the 
tram network and services/facilities within the District Centre.     
Further an Area of Moderate Intensification has been designated 
to the North of Selsdon. This is currently a low density residential 
area, which is considered to have good access to the tram 
network (via Coombe Lane Stop) and well as local services within 
Seldom District Centre. Due to this, it is considered a sustainable 
location for moderate renewal, intensification via new residential 
development that results in a reasonable increase in the density of 
area. The more dense eastern and more suburban western areas 
will continue to be distinct characteristics of the areas  
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.189 Selsdon District Centre will continue to be the main 
focus for employment, with the adjacent Selsdon Park Hotel also  
 385 providing local job opportunities. Community facilities will be 
focused on the District Centre.  
Character, Heritage and Design   
11.190 New development will respect the existing local 
character and distinctiveness referring to the Borough Character 
Appraisal to inform design quality. Any public realm improvements 
should primarily focus on the District Centre. Any building and 
conversions should be of a high standard of design to ensure the 
character of the Centre is respected.  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.191 Links to existing green spaces from the residential 
areas will be improved where possible with additional connections 
to strategic green links enabling more opportunities for walking 
and cycling in the area.  
Transport  
11.192 With a tram stop to the north edge of Selsdon, local 
bus services, connections and access will be maintained, but with 
improved walking and cycling routes where possible via 
improvements to the Green Grid. The community will enjoy better 
quality, more frequent and reliable bus services connecting with 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre. Travel plans will look to ease 
congestion at peak times in the District Centres by encouraging 
walking, cycling or public transport especially for school journeys. 
Selsdon’s steep topography makes walking, cycling challenging 
and, with generally poor public transport accessibility this makes it 
difficult to promote active transport. With a single tram stop to the 
north edge of Selsdon, public transport users are currently reliant 
on local bus services. Any road segregated cycle routes proposals 
for Selsdon Park Road will need to create a link to Addington 
Village and these routes will be complimented by further tram 
routes towards the District Centre. These enhanced connections  combined with the uptake of new technology such as e-bikes are 
necessary to reduce car dependence in Selsdon   
 386 Figure 11.12 Selsdon – graphic updated  
 
 387 General character 
11.193 Selsdon is a suburban residential Place with a well-
defined District Centre, surrounded by large scale green open 
spaces such as Selsdon Wood, Heathfield and Littleheath 
Woods. The predominant residential character types consist of 
‘Planned Estates Of Semi-Detached Houses’, some ‘Local 
Authority Built Housing with Public Realm’ , ‘Compact Houses On 
Relatively Small Plots’ and ‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated 
Grounds’.  Paragraph deleted  
Policy DM44: Selsdon 
DM44.1  Within Selsdon Distric t Centre,  to enhance the character of Selsdon District Centre proposals should:  
a. Complement the existing predominant bui lding heights of 3 storeys up to a maximum of 4 storeys;  
b. Ensure large buildings are sensitively located an d of a massing no larger than buildings within this area;  
c. Ensure that the front elevation of large buildings are broken down to respect the architectural rhythm of the existing street  frontages; 
and  
d. Should incorporate red multi -stock brick as t he predomi nant facing material.  
DM44.1 A To address the future housing needs of Selsdon and support sustainable growth of this, the following broad locations have bee n 
designated;  
a) An Area of focused Intensification is iden tified to the east of this , within close pr oximity to Gravel Hill Tram Stop and the District 
Centre. High density residential and renewal will be supported within this.  
b) An Area of moderate intensification identified to north of this (close to Coombes Lane Tram Stop). The sustainable moderate, 
intensification and renewal of areas within this via proposals for new residential development will be supported that result in a n 
reasonable increase in the density . 
c) Development within the  intensification areas should  be well designed to protect, enhance the suburban character, setting of this 
settlement. The boundaries of these is shown on the map .

Shopping Area’ character. Both ends of which are marked by 
retail outlets, creating a well-defined edge and a distinct start and 
finish to this character area. 
11.196 There are two intermingled and competing 
architectural styles of buildings. The mock Tudor facades pays 
reference to the residential surroundings, however these are of a 
low quality and have aged visibly. The second, modernist style 
buildings have red multi-stock brick facades. These are of a 
slightly higher quality and better express the distinctiveness of 
the District Centre and are therefore, more appropriate for this 
location. Detailed policy is required to strengthen the sense of 
place. 
11.197 In the western part of the centre the public realm is 
fragmented and dominated by the overwhelming scale of the 
Addington Road and Old Farleigh Road junction. There is an 
opportunity to improve the walking and cycling experience in this 
area.

 389 Shirley  
11.197A  Shirley is predominantly a suburban residential 
settlement surrounded by areas of open land, countryside and 
Green Belt, situated to the east of Croydon borough and bordering 
the London Borough of Bromley. This place is defined by the tree 
lined streets, the regular rhythm of well-spaced buildings with well-
kept landscaped areas to the front, that allow oblique long range 
views beyond the rear gardens. 
11.197B  Shirley's built environment creates an open varied and 
interesting skyline and roofscape. The character varies to the north 
and south of Shirley Church Road, with the southern part 
dominated by detached homes including Bishops Walk Local 
Heritage Area and surrounded by expansive areas of greenery, 
including woodland of Addington Hills and Addington Palace 
Registered Historic Park and Garden. 
11.197C  Shirley has many heritage assets including three 
Local Heritage Areas; the Upper Shirley Road Area represents a 
range of styles and architectural forms dating from the 18th century, 
with well-preserved original features; the Stuart Crescent Area lies 
in the heart of the Spring Farm area with the layout arranged 
around the remnants of a circular historic copse; and the Bishops 
Walk Area represents a distinctive high quality historic landscape 
and townscape with the southern section’s mature landscaping 
revealing the historic design of Addington Park which allows for 
scenic views within and outside of the area. 
11.197D Connectivity is generally low in Shirley with high car 
dependency, which also can result in congestion at peak times on 
main roads such as Wickham Road. There is a tram stop at 
Coombe Lane however it is not conveniently close to the main residential area and bus services are predominantly found on main 
roads. 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.199 Shirley will continue to be a suburb surrounded by 
substantial green space with improved cycle and pedestrian links. 
The vibrant Local Centre, with a range of retailing and 
independent shops will continue to serve the local community. A 
mature and rejuvenated Shrublands will be served by both local 
shops as well as those on Wickham Road. Shirley Road and 
Spring Park/Bridle Road Neighbourhood Centres will be 
supporting the existing and future community with services and 
facilities beyond a retail function. 
Homes 
11.200 An area of sustainable growth of the suburbs with 
some opportunity for windfall sites will see growth mainly confined 
to infilling with dispersed integration of new homes respecting 
existing through infilling respecting existing and evolving 
residential character and local distinctiveness. 
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.201 Some small scale employment will be provided in the 
Local Centre with predominantly independent shops supporting 
the local community. 
Character, Heritage and Design   
11.202 New development will be sensitive to the existing 
residential character and the wooded hillsides of the Place 
referring to the Borough Character Appraisal to inform design  
 390 quality. Public realm improvements will focus on the Local Centre. 
Any building and conversions should be of a high standard of 
design to ensure the character of the Centre is respected.  The 
grade II listed Shirley Windmill is one of only four windmills open 
to the public in Greater London, and is a key landmark and key 
contributor to Shirley's special character  
Environment and Climate Change 
11.203 Development in the flood zones will be guided by the 
policies of the Plan to reduce flood risk.  The risk of surface water 
flooding is prevalent throughout Shirley and Spring Park, 
predominantly on or near main roads. A number of recorded 
surface water flooding events have occurred along Shirley Road 
and in Spring Park. Therefore measures to reduce food risk 
through sustainable drainage measures should be implemented.  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.204 Shirley will continue to be well served by open space 
with improved connections to the Green Grid,  along with way 
finding, enabling increased walking and cycling. The Registered 
Historic and Local Historic Parks and Gardens in the area will be 
retained and new links provided where possible to incorporate 
them into the Green Grid network. New links will be provided to 
Addington Palace Registered Historic Park and Local Historic 
Parks and Gardens in the area including Millers Pond and the 
grounds of Hall Grange. These will incorporated into the Green 
Grid network, where possible.  
Transport  
11.205 With improved access and links where possible, the 
existing connectivity and good public transport of Shirley will be 
maintained. The community will enjoy better quality, more frequent 
and reliable bus services connecting with Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre. Travel plans will look to ease congestion at peak times in the Local Centres by encouraging walking, cycling or public 
transport especially for school journeys.

 392 General character 
11.206 Shirley is predominantly a suburban residential 
settlement surrounded by natural areas of Green Belt. This place 
is defined by the tree lined streets, the regular rhythm of well -
spaced buildings with well-kept landscaped areas to the front, 
that allow oblique long range views beyond the rear gardens. 
Paragraph deleted  
11.207 Shirley’s residential character predominantly 
consists of ‘Planned Estates Of Semi-Detached Houses’ wit h 
garages and ‘Compact Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ set in 
large green spaces. This combination creates an open varied 
and interesting skyline and roofscape. The southern part is 
dominated by ‘Scattered Houses On Large Plots’ surrounded by 
expansive areas of greenery, including woodland of Addington 
Hills. Paragraph deleted  
11.208 Shirley has three urban and one suburban shopping 
area characters along Wickham and Shirley Roads. The 
suburban feel of these shopping areas are strengthened by tree 
lined streets, green verges with planting and small green spaces 
and parking accommodated in slip roads. These features play a 
vital role in creating Shirley’s sense of place.  Paragraph deleted  11.209 The Upper Shirley Road Local Heritage Area 
predominantly consists of the ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ 
character type. Buildings represent a range of styles and 
architectural forms dating from the 18th century, with well-
preserved original features. The grouping, its design and layout 
are a record of the local history of building design and 
development in this area.  Paragraph deleted  
11.210 The Stuart Crescent Local Heritage Area lies in the 
heart of the Spring Farm area which has a consistent character 
of ‘Planned Estates Of Semi-Detached Houses’. The layout is 
arranged around the remnants of a circular historic copse. The 
mature landscaping reveals the historic character of the 
landscape which pre-dates development.  Paragraph deleted  
11.211 The Bishops Walk Local Heritage Area represents a 
distinctive high quality historic landscape and townscape with a 
‘Scattered Houses On Large Plots’ residential character. The 
southern section of Bishops Walk’s mature landscaping reveals 
the historic design of Addington Park which pre-dated and allows 
for scenic views within and outside of the area. The distinctive 
design of the northern section creates a well-integrated 
topography, planting and built environment. Paragraph deleted  
Policy DM45: Shirley  
DM45.1  Within Shirley Local Centre,  to retain the unique qualities development should:  
a) Retain the continuity of ground fl oor active frontages and allow flexibility at first floor and above for mixed use;  
b) Reference, respect and enhance architectural features such as the consistent rhythm and articulation of fenestration and reta in 
features such as the triangular bay windows;   
c) Complement the existing predominant building heights of 2 store ys up to a maximum of 4 storeys ; and    
 393 d) Incorporate or retain traditional shop front elements such as fascias , pilasters and stall risers . and 
e) Respect the setting of locally listed buildings wi thin the area.  
DM45.2  In the area between 518 and 568 Wickham Road , to improve the character proposals should reference the ‘Suburban Shopping 
Area ’ character type.  
DM45.3 In the area of the Wickham Road  Shopping Parade,  to retain the d istinctive character of the  794-850 Wickham Road proposals 
should:  
a) Complement the existing predominant building heights up to a maximum of 2 storeys; and   
b) Retain the ‘Suburban Shopping Area ’ character.  
DM45.3A To retain the distinctive character of this part of Shirley Road Shopping  Parade, proposals should:  
 Complement the existing predominant building heights of 2 storeys up to a maximum of 3 storeys along Shirley Road, and a heig ht of 
2 storeys up to a maximum of 4 stor eys directly behind the parade and  
 Reference, respect and enh ance architectural features such as the consistent rhythm and articulation of windows and doors.  
DM45.4 Within Shirley allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.13. 
 
How the policy works 
11.212 The areas in which Policies DM45.1 to DM45.3 A 
apply are shown on the Policies Map. 
Shirley Local Centre 
11.213 Shirley Local Centre consists of the combination of 
three different character types an ‘Urban Shopping Area’ , 
‘Scattered Houses On Large Plots’ and a ‘Suburban Shopping 
Area’ . The northern side of the Local Centre is more tightly built-
up, while the southern more is spacious with green verges, tree 
lined streets and parking within slip roads. In this area the 
potential for growth is limited. The area includes a number of locally listed buildings. The setting, heights and other 
characteristics of these buildings should be respected.  
Shirley Road and Wickham Road 
11.214 Each of Shirley’s shopping areas has a distinct 
character which should be enhanced and strengthened. This 
character is informed by the layout, scale, urban grain and, 
architectural features such as the brick work, fascias and stall 
rises. In order to ensure that the distinctive elements that 
contribute to Shirley’s sense of place are not lost, these features 
have been included in the detailed policies.  
 394 Allocating land for development 
11.215 Table 11.13 below sets out the proposed use on 
specific sites in Shirley. The location and boundary of each

 395 South Croydon 
11.214A  South Croydon lies immediately south of Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre and is organised in a south to north alignment 
along the Brighton Road. Its fragmented character can be attributed 
to the Brighton Road and railway infrastructure. The areas to the 
east are rich in green open spaces including areas of Green Belt 
such as Lloyd Park.  
11.214B  South Croydon has a rich heritage which is protected 
through the designation of a Conservation Area and three Local 
Heritage areas. Croham Manor Road Conservation Area is a 
notable collection of early 20th century Locally Listed houses with a 
wealth of well-preserved arts and crafts features. The South End 
Local Heritage Area represents an early vernacular architectural 
style from late 19th with a wide range of well-preserved highly 
decorative architectural features. Its historic townscape composition 
consists of the street frontage and a triangular square with the 
prominent locally listed Swan and Sugarloaf former public house 
terminating vistas along Brighton Road. St Peter's Road Local 
Heritage Area is focused around the Grade II Listed St Peter's 
Church with its high quality historic landscape that enables long 
vistas over South Croydon and reveals a panorama of the Croydon 
Opportunity Area and glimpses across the area. Birdhurst Road 
Local Heritage Area represents a collective value of high quality, 
well-designed and well -preserved Victorian Villas dating from 
before 1890. There is a distinctive relationship between the mature 
landscape of the street scene, the design of the buildings and the 
plan layout. 
11.214C South Croydon due to its proximity is well-connected 
to Croydon Metropolitan Centre and the wider area through rail and 
bus links as well as cycling and walking routes. As a result of this, 
there is a relative deficiency in the range of community services available. The area continues to have a high car dependency, but 
relatively less so than places further south, and congestion can 
occur at peak times on Brighton Road.  
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
Vision 
11.216 South Croydon will continue to be a highly accessible 
Place with good connections to open space providing an 
introduction to the suburban south. The character of the area will 
be improved through support for the wide range of independent 
shops and restaurants along South End and its two Local Centres. 
South End/Parker Road/St Peter’s Church Neighbourhood Centre 
will be supporting the existing and future community with services 
and facilities beyond a retail function. 
Homes 
11.217 The main focus for sustainable growth of the suburbs 
will be in the Brighton Road area with a mix of windfall and infill 
development that respects the existing residential character and 
local distinctiveness and includes flood mitigation measures.  
through focussed intensification, with a mix of windfall and infill 
development in the wider Place. Areas of Focused Intensification 
have been designated at the Brighton Road Transport corridor and 
Sanderstead Road within close proximity to Purley Oaks and 
Sanderstead Railway Stations. These are considered sustainable 
locations, where high density residential and renewal will be 
encouraged due to their proximity to the stations, as well as 
services/facilities within the two Local Centres. An Area of 
Moderate Intensification has been designated to the south , which 
is currently a low density residential area, with good access to  
 396 Sanderstead Railway station. Due to this, it is considered a 
sustainable location for moderate renewal, intensification via new 
residential development that results in a reasonable increase in 
the density of the area.  Residential development will need to be 
well designed, respect, reflect, evolve the existing residential 
character and local distinctiveness.  
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.218 Selsdon Road (including Carlton Road), will remain an 
important Separated Industrial Location for the borough and will 
continue to be protected. Elsewhere employment will be 
concentrated in the two Local Centres and along the Brighton 
Road.   
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.219 New development will be sensitive to the existing local 
character and the wooded hillsides of  South Croydon taking into 
consideration the Place referring to the Borough Character 
Appraisal and Croham Manor Road Conservation Area Appraisal 
and Management Plan to inform design quality. Opportunities for 
public realm improvements will be primarily focused on the two 
Local Centres with any building and conversions of a high 
standard of design to ensure the character of surrounding areas 
the Centres and Conservation Areas are respected. There are 
opportunities for new links to be provided to Croham Manor Road 
Conservation Area, the Local Historic Parks and Gardens and 
Local Heritage Areas in the area including those around St Peter’s 
Church, South End and the Birdhurst Estate, which will be 
incorporated into the Green Grid network  The Local Historic Parks 
and Gardens in the area will be retained and new links provided 
where possible to incorporate them into the Green Grid network .  
Environment and Climate Change 11.220 Through enabling development, potential exists to 
implement flood mitigation and adaptation measures along the 
Brighton Road. Flood risk will be mitigated through naturally based 
sustainable drainage solutions (where necessary), particularly 
through enhancement measures along the Brighton Road  that is 
susceptible to surface water flood risk  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.221 Improved connections to the Green Grid will be 
sought to increase opportunities for walking and cycling in the 
area. St. Peter’s Church, South Croydon – a key landmark, Local 
Heritage Area and Local Historic Park and Garden – will be 
integrated into this expanding network (where possible)  
Transport 
11.222 The existing connectivity and good public transport of 
South Croydon will be maintained and enhanced where possible, 
with the quality, capacity and reliability of bus services improved. 
Travel plans will look to ease congestion at peak times by 
encouraging walking, cycling or public transport especially for 
school journeys. The potential of Selsdon Road Industrial Location 
to act as a railhead to transfer freight to rail will be supported. 
Along the Brighton Road Corridor, walking, cycling and public 
transport will be encouraged by creating safer and more attractive 
environments for these modes of transport including in road 
segregated cycle lanes. There will also be in road segregate d 
cycle lanes on Coombe Road. The Council will work with TfL to 
explore the feasibility of public transport improvements (such as 
metroisation, a new tram line or bus rapid transit) from Croydon 
Metropolitan centre to this area Purley and Coulsdon. This wi ll 
help to improve the reach and capacity of the tram network to 
support good growth.

 398 General character 
11.223 South Croydon is organised in a south to north 
alignment along the Brighton Road. Its fragmented character can 
be attributed to the Brighton Road and railway infrastructure. The 
areas to the east are rich in green open spaces including areas 
of Green Belt such as Lloyd Park. The ‘Industrial Estates’ are 
primarily concentrated along the railway. Small pockets of 
‘Industrial Estates’ are also scattered amongst residential blocks.  
Paragraph deleted  
11.224 The predominant residential character consists of 
‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’, located within the central strip, 
with the mix of ‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated Grounds 
and ‘Compact Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ to the west and 
north. The areas to the east contain ‘Detached Houses On 
Relatively Large Plots’ and ‘Large Houses On Relatively Small 
Plots’, a number of which have been Locally Listed.  Paragraph

architecture and landmark buildings that serve as focal points 
and close the vistas at the apexes of Brighton Road and South 
End. 
11.232 The street frontages in the area are active and

 401 South Norwood and Woodside 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
14.234A  South Norwood lies to the north of Croydon borough 
between Upper Norwood and Addiscombe, and has retained its 
Victorian urban centre. Portland Road, one of the two historic high 
streets in South Norwood, links the District Centre with Woodside 
Green which contains some of the few remaining parts of the 
historic medieval village. The surrounding street pattern radiates 
from this open area. Larger green spaces such as South Norwood 
Country Park and South Norwood Lake are located along the 
northern edge and form a boundary between this Place and 
neighbouring boroughs. Small green open spaces are scattered 
throughout South Norwood and Woodside.  
14.234B  South Norwood and Woodside has a rich heritage and 
includes a Conservation Area and two Local Heritage Areas. 
Following the development of the railway station, the District centre 
grew quickly during Victorian times resulting in fine buildings on the 
High Street and grand residences at its perimeter, which form the 
South Norwood Conservation Area. The Grade II Listed Stanley 
Halls is one of the area’s most significant historic assets. The South 
Norwood Clocktower continues to act as a key landmark for the 
Station approach and Clocktower Market area. The Portland Road 
Terraces, Portland Road Mission Hall and The Market Parade Local 
Heritage Areas contain distinctive collections of mid-19th to early 
20th century shopping parades, with bespoke Arts and Crafts and 
gothic inspired features that record the gradual historic 
development of the area. Ingatestone Road Local Heritage Area 
represents a fine example of high density Edwardian development 
with unique features such as balconies with ornate ironwork, 
exposed red brick cladding with elaborate white stucco decorations. 14.234C  South Norwood has relatively high public transport 
accessibility with tram stops at Woodside and Arena, as well as 
extensive bus routes north and south. Rail infrastructure prevents 
frequent east to west movement across the area, however a 
number of stations help residents move locally and further afield 
such as Central London.  
The South Norwood Community Plan (2018) outlines the key 
economic, social and environmental issues facing the District 
Centre. Based on this, it sets out key priorities for investment in 
facilities, services and infrastructure identified by the local 
community, as this area is expected to change and growth in the 
future. A summary of the key issues identified by this are; need to 
reduce vacant commercial units, a need to improve the public 
realm, a need for more independent shops, a need for community 
space for all age groups and a need for space to support 
community projects/groups. The Community Plan is a key piece of 
evidence that has informed the content of the Local Plan.  
Vision 
11.235 South Norwood and Woodside will be a revitalised 
residential neighbourhood, benefiting from London Overground 
services to Docklands, the City, and a good connection to 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre. A revived, enhanced District Centre 
will be enhanced through heritage-led enhancements, and will 
offer a mixture of homes, community and cultural facilities and a 
range of retailing, including many independent shops. South 
Norwood and Woodside, with their good transport connections will 
grow in popularity as a residential area and share in the borough’s 
improving prosperity. Woodside Green and Portland Road 
(Watcombe Road/Woodside Avenue) Neighbourhood Centres will  
 402 be supporting the existing and future community with services and 
facilities beyond a retail function. 
Homes, Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.236 Sustainable growth of the suburbs with predominantly 
windfall sites and dispersed integration of new homes will respect 
existing residential character and local distinctiveness.  
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.236A  Selhurst Park is currently the home of Crystal Palace 
Football Club. The District Centre, and Portland Road and 
Woodside Green Neighbourhood Centres will continue to provide 
employment and services for the local community. Other 
community facilities will be encouraged to locate in close proximity 
to the District Centre and opportunities to provide an Enterprise 
Centre, which could be creative industry based, will be sought in 
the vicinity of Portland Road.  Stanley Halls will become one of 
South London’s premiere arts and performing centres, supporting 
creative enterprise, music, and art. An improved route connecting 
the Halls to Norwood Junction station, will be achieved through 
public realm and building enhancements. The new library will 
support a growing community, and alternative uses for the old 
library and other vacant assets will focus on building resilient 
businesses, local knowledge and cultural development. The Council 
will actively support meanwhile uses, where they enhance the 
character and vitality of the area.  
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.237 Heritage assets and landmarks will be protected, 
ensuring that new development respects and enhances the local 
character and distinctiveness of South Norwood and Woodside. It 
will need to take into consideration th e South Norwood 
Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan, and Borough Character Appraisal to inform design quality. Opportunities for 
public realm improvements will focus  on the South Norwood 
District  Centre , and South Norwood Conservation Area and 
Portland Road and Woodside Green neighbourhood centres any 
new building and conversions will need to be completed to a high 
standard of design, to ensure the character of the Centres and the 
Conservation Area are respected. Heritage-led enhancements will 
be a particular focus within the boundary area of the High Streets 
Heritage Action Zone. Public realm improvements will include 
improved wayfinding/legibility, restoring shopfronts and uppers, 
enhancing public realm and wayfinding for key community hubs 
and other local assets. Heritage at risk assets will be repaired and 
brought back into use. The Elmer’s End Moated Site within South 
Norwood Country Park is a scheduled ancient monument and will 
continue to be protected. The provision of interpretation to raise 
awareness of the monument would assist in its protection . 
Environment, Climate Change 
11.237A There are a number of areas in South Norwood and 
Woodside that are at risk of surface water flooding and a number of 
surface water flooding episodes have occurred in the vicinity of 
Norwood Junction station.  Development should incorporate 
sustainable drainage measures to help reduce this risk.  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.238 The Place’s diverse open spaces include South 
Norwood Lake and Country Park. Links will be provided, where 
possible to the Croydon Metropolitan Centre and Waterlink Way 
as part of the National Cycle Network. New Green Grid links will 
improve connectivity with the Local Historic Parks and Gardens 
and other green spaces to incorporate them into the Green Grid 
network. Development in the flood zones will be guided by the 
policies of the Plan to reduce flood risk.  
 403 Transport 
11.239 As part of the wider Brighton Main Line rail 
improvement works, Norwood Junction Station will undergo 
improvements for access and capacity. Opportunities for walking 
and cycling improvements in South Norwood will be explored, 
including cycle connections from South Norwood to Crystal 
Palace, providing a connection with the proposed Green Grid 
through the creation of low traffic neighbourhoods. Cycle facilities will be enhanced at Norwood Junction railway station, benefiting 
the local population who live within walking and cycling distance of 
this. The tram system in Croydon will be supported by promoting 
new tram extensions or other public transport improvements 
serving Crystal Palace and Bromley through South Norwood and 
Woodside. Measures to provide better quality, more frequent and 
reliable bus services along Whitehorse Road, Whitehorse Lane 
and Selhurst Road (A213) will be promoted.

 405 General character 
11.240 South Norwood has retained its Victorian urban 
centre, which has been recognised in its Conservation Area 
designation. It is predominantly a residential Place with a 
character of ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ with some patches 
of ‘Medium Rise Blocks With Associated Grounds and ‘Compact 
Houses On Relatively Small Plots’ . Some larger buildings 
including residential ‘Tower Buildings’ and ‘Large Buildings With 
Spacing’ are scattered in the District Centre, in the vicinity of the 
railway line. Larger ‘Industrial Estates’ are located along the 
railways and scattered within smaller residential blocks. The 
Place’s only ‘Retail Estate & Business & Leisure Park’ lies on the 
western edge next to Selhurst Park football stadium.  Paragraph 
deleted  
11.241 Portland Road, one of the two historic high streets in 
South Norwood, links the District Centre with Woodside Green. It 
has a predominant ‘Urban Shopping Area’ character interlaced 
with residential developments, predominantly ‘Medium Rise 
Blocks With Associated Grounds’ and ‘Large Buildings With 
Continuous Frontage Line’.  Paragraph deleted  
11.242 Woodside Green contains some of the few 
remaining parts of the historic medieval village. The surrounding 
street pattern radiates from this open area. Larger green spaces 
such as South Norwood Country Park and South Norwood Lake 
are located along the northern edge and form a boundary 
between this Place and neighbouring boroughs. The small green 
open spaces are scattered throughout South Norwood and 
Woodside.  Paragraph deleted  
11.243 The South Norwood Conservation Area 
predominantly consists of an ‘Urban Shopping Area’ character 
mixed with ‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’. Following the 
development of railway station, the district centre grew quickly during Victorian times resulting in fine buildings on the High 
Street and grand residences at its perimeter. The Grade II Listed 
Stanley Halls is one of the area's most significant historic assets.  
Paragraph deleted  
11.244 The Portland Road Terraces, Portland Road Mission 
Hall and The Market Parade Local Heritage Areas have an 
‘Urban Shopping Area’ character. These areas contain distinctive 
collections of mid- 19th to early 20th century shopping parades, 
with bespoke Arts and Crafts and gothic inspired features that 
record the gradual historic development of the area.  Paragraph 
deleted  
11.245 Ingatestone Road Local Heritage Area has a 
‘Terraced Houses And Cottages’ character. It represents a fine 
example of high density Edwardian development with unique 
features such as balconies with ornate ironwork, exposed red 
brick cladding with elaborate white stucco decorations.

 408 Thornton Heath 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
11.251A  Thornton Heath is a densely built up settlement that is 
situated to the north of Croydon Metropolitan Centre and between 
Broad Green and Norbury. The area is focused along Brigstock 
Road and Thornton Heath High Street between London Road to t he 
west and the slopes of the Upper Norwood to the north east. 
Thornton Heath is a predominantly residential area with small green 
open spaces scattered throughout.  
11.251B  Thornton Heath’s history is recognised through the 
High Street Local Heritage Area which contains distinctive classical 
Georgian, perpendicular and Queen Anne architectural styles 
dating from late 19th to 20th century with a wide range of well-
preserved highly decorative historic features. The District Centre 
also contains a number of distinctive taller buildings constructed in 
the 20th Century, of mixed design quality, which create a more 
urban character and skyline in places.  
11.251C  Thornton Heath is less car dependent than other 
areas of the borough and has a good level of access to public 
transportation, including a railway station in the District Centre. A 
number of small open spaces including Grangewood Park and 
recreation grounds help to break up the dominating terraced 
housing and road infrastructure of Thornton Heath. 
 
Vision 
11.252 Thornton Heath’s District Centre will be a mix of 
homes, community and cultural facilities reflecting the local 
diversity of the population and a range of retailing including many 
independent shops. The Local Centres at Thornton Heath Pond and Beulah Road w ill continue to have a strong evening economy. 
Brigstock Road Neighbourhood Centre will be supporting the 
existing and future community with services and facilities beyond a 
retail function. The Thornton Heath District Centre will be firmly 
connected with Green Grid links that follow the Norbury Brook 
through Thornton Heath Recreation Ground together with further 
green links to Grangewood Park and west onto Mitcham Common. 
The Place will share in the borough’s improving prosperity. 
11.252A  The Council has produced a Thornton Heath Strategic 
Regeneration Framework which sets out how the regeneration of 
the District Centre and its environs could be achieved and this has 
informed this section of the Local Plan This consists of two 
documents called Shaping Thornton Heath: High Street Plan and A 
Manual for Shaping Thornton Heath. These set out the key social, 
physical and environmental issues facing the area and how the 
future development could help address these, as well as help the 
delivery of new, enhance social, physical infrastructure and public 
realm improvements to promote sustainable development. These 
documents will be a material consideration for assessing 
applications within this place. 
Homes 
11.253 Moderate residential growth with some opportunity for 
windfall sites, limited infilling , and dispersed integration of new 
homes will respect existing residential character and local 
distinctiveness . An Area of Focused Intensification has been 
designated at the London Road Transport corridor. This largely 
covers the b oundary of Thornton Heath Pond Local Centre and a 
larger area slightly to the south of it, the boundary of which 
partially crosses over into Broad Heath and Selhurst. This is 
located within a Local Centre and close proximity to Pollards Hill  
 409 Local Centre to the north. This is considered a relatively 
sustainable location, where high density development/renewal will 
encouraged within these, comprising of mixed use residential and 
retail/town centre use (on ground floor) will be encouraged within 
Town centre and residential in areas outside of these. 
Development will need to respect and evolve existing residential 
character and local distinctiveness. Where possible, existing 
homes (privately owned and council-owned homes) should be 
improved or retrofitted to create higher-quality and more energy 
efficient homes.  
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.254 Croydon University Hospital will evolve and, as the 
borough’s principal health centre, will remain Thornton Heath’s 
largest employer. Thornton Heath District Centre,  Thornton Heath 
Ponds and  Beluah Road Local Centres  will continue to support the 
community, providing employment and services. Community 
facilities will be encouraged to locate in close proximity  the former 
Centres and light industrial sites are important to the local 
community and economy, supporting SMEs and providing key 
local services. Development should aim to continue to provide a 
mix of uses in well-designed spaces, which provide a range of 
local employment opportunities .  
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.255 Heritage assets and landmarks will be protected and 
enhanced and the Place will be improved with high quality new 
development that respects the local character and distinctiveness, 
referring to the Borough Character Appraisal to inform design 
quality. Public realm improvements will primarily be focussed on 
the District and Local Centres with any buildings and conversions 
of a high standard of design to ensure the character of the Centres 
are respected. Public realm improvements will be primarily 
focussed on the District, Local Centres and Neighbourhood Centres. The character of the Thornton Heath High Street Local 
Heritage Area will be protected. Developments in the Thornton 
Heath District Centre and within its setting will respond to this 
character. The landmark Clock Tower and its setting will be 
protected and it will continue to act as a key wayfinding element in 
the public realm. Local Historic Parks and Gardens such as 
Grangewood Park and Thornton Heath Recreation Ground will be 
enhanced, and linked in to the green grid network  
Environment and Climate Change 
11.256 Development will be directed away from the functional 
flood plain of the Norbury Brook. Development in flood zones will 
be guided by the policies of the Plan to reduce flood risk. Norbury 
Brook runs through the area and whilst this is a natural asset, it is 
a source of flooding risk. Its de-culverting can help contribute to 
sustainable urban drainage and rainwater management. Episodes 
of surface water flooding have also been recorded historically in 
Thornton Heath .  As there are areas of flood risk and the water 
flows into an area of limited capacity, utilising natural sustainable 
drainage should be provided (where necessary, to reduce the risk 
of surface water flood risk. Existing mature planting, street trees 
should be protected (where possible).  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.257 Norbury Brook provides an opportunity to enhance the 
character of the Place, celebrate local topography, and create 
more biodiverse habitats. To improve access to nature and the 
quality of the local open spaces, opportunities to de-culvert 
Norbury Brook in Thornton Heath Recreation Ground will be 
considered as part of a parks improvement project, but will need to 
be assessed against the need to provide space for sport and 
recreation. A Green Grid link with green spaces along the Norbury 
Brook will be established where possible. Way finding and 
improvements to the Local Historic Grangewood Park and  
 410 Whitehorse Meadow will help to encourage more use of existing 
green spaces. 
Transport 
11.258 Cycling to Thornton Heath railway station will be more 
attractive with additional and better quality cycle facilities provided 
where possible. The tram system in Croydon  Public Transport will 
be further supported by promoting a new tram line , bus rapid 
transit or other public transport improvements   to Streatham, 
Brixton and Tooting following the London Road through the 
Thornton Heath Pond Local Centre. The community will enjoy 
better quality, more frequent and more reliable bus services 
connecting with Croydon Metropolitan Centre. A network of safe 
and marked cycle routes and junctions will be supported to 
connect to local areas and more distant destinations . Travel plans 
will look to ease congestion at peak times by encouraging walking, 
cycling or public transport especially for school journeys.

Policy DM48: Thornton Heath 
DM48.1 Within the Thornton Heath District Centre and its environs,  to ensure a balance is struck between strengthening and enhancing 
the character and enabling growth, proposals should:  
a) Complement the exi sting predominant building heights of 3 storeys up to a maximum of 4 storeys  except in the vicinity of Thornton 
Heath railway station where any tall or large buildings proposed should not exceed 9 storeys ;  
b) Retain the continuity of ground floor active fron tages and allow flexibility at first floor and above for mixed use;  
c) Promote the expansion and enhancement of the shared public realm within the curtilage of the development;  
d) Ensure that the setting of Thornton Heath’s local landmark , the Clock Tower , is respected; and  
e) Incorporate red multi -stock brick as the predominant facing material  Ensure development to the east of the Town Centre responds to 
the character of the Thornton Heath High Street Local Heritage Area .  
DM48.2 Within the Thornton Heath Pond Local Centre and its environs,  to ensure a balance is struck between strengthening and 
enhancing the character and facilitating growth, proposals should:  
a) Ensure building lines and frontages positively reference and respond to the form of the Thornton Heath Pond j unction;  
b) Incorporate red multi -stock brick as the predominant facing material;  
c) Retain the extent and enhance the quality of the existing public realm;  
d) Complement the existing predominant building heights of 3 storeys up to a maximum of 6 storeys; and    
 413 e) Ensure transitions between buildings of different sizes create sense of continuity at the street level.  
DM48.2A An area of focused Intensification has been designated on London Road transport corridor, large comprising the same boundary 
of Thornton Heath Po nd Local Centre.  Proposals for high density schemes will be supported within this, comprising of mixed use residential 
and retail/other town centre uses (on ground floor) development, renewal will be supported within the town centre boundary. H igh density 
residential development will be supported in areas outside of the Town Centre. The boundaries of these are shown  on the map .  
DM48.3 Within Thornton Heath allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.16. 
 
How the policy works 
11.262 The areas in which these Policies DM48.1  and to 
DM48.2 A apply are shown on the Policies Map. 
Thornton Heath District Centre and environs 
11.263 The character of Thornton High Street is defined by 
elements such as red multi -stock brick with white detailing 
around windows, a consistent scale of three storey buildings with 
active frontages and strong tree lines and the local landmark 
clock tower. 
11.264 The character around the railway station is less 
consistent changing from smaller scale buildings (up to three 
storeys) with narrow footways to tall and large buildings (up to 
nine storeys) with wider footways. The building lines within this 
area step back and forward resulting in inconsistent street 
frontages. 
11.265 There are opportunities for growth within this area. 
To facilitate growth, manage spatial quality and enhance and 
strengthen the character of the District Centre a Place-specific 
development management policy is required. 
Thornton Pond Local Centre and environs  11.266 The edge of the Thornton Pond Local Centre is 
beginning to lose its separate identity and sense of place. This 
could result in the Local Centre being absorbed into the 
homogenous urban form of the London Road.  The Thornton 
Heath Pond has been covered over since the 1970’s, but it 
should be celebrated as the heart of the area. This could be 
achieved by introducing a water feature and mitigating the 
negative impacts of traffic, helping to deliver outdoor community 
facilities for residents.  
11.267 Densities in areas around of Thornton Pond Local 
Centre are beginning to increase. A cohesive approach needs to 
be taken to ensure that edge of the Local Centre remains well 
defined and that the Local Centre has a distinct sense of place.

 415 Waddon 
Vision, opportunities, constraints and change up to 2036 
11.268A  Waddon is situated to the west of Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre and borders neighbouring London Borough of 
Sutton. It has a fragmented and inconsistent character, consisting 
of big box retailers and industrial premises along the Purley Way, 
residential areas such as the Waddon Estate and the large green 
open spaces of Duppas Hill, Wandle Park, Purley Way Playing 
Field, Roundshaw and the former international airport, WWI RFC 
and WWII RAF airfield.  
11.268B  Located on east edge of Waddon towards Central 
Croydon, The Waldrons Conservation Area, one of Croydon's firs t 
Conservation Areas, contains fine Victorian houses around the 
Waldons and a number of large high quality buildings on Bramley 
Hill and Bramley Close. 
11.268C  Waddon is relatively deficient in local facilities, with 
most being within the Purley Way Transformation Area. This 
includes the shops on Central Parade at the Fiveways junction. The 
large retail outlets along Purley Way serve a wide area, which leads 
to congestion on the main roads at and outside of peak times. 
There are two tram stops and a railway station in Waddon (all of 
which lie within the Purley Way Transformation Area) linking 
residents to the Metropolitan Centre and beyond. 
 
Vision 
11.269 Waddon will comprise both a growing residential 
community and a principle industrial location. In addition to 
Waddon Road/Abbey Road Neighbourhood Centre new Local 
Centres at Waddon Marsh and Fiveways and a new Neighbourhood Centre at Waddon Way; will be supporting the 
existing and future community with services and facilities beyond a 
retail function. It will, therefore, remain central to the borough’s 
economic prosperity including continuing employment, inward 
investment, training and innovation. Waddon will share in the 
borough’s improving prosperity and retain its high levels of 
accessibility, both for the residents and industrial and commercial 
traffic. Simultaneously the area will benefit from improved 
community provision for walking and cycling routes with an 
expanded Green Grid network connecting the Wandle Valley 
Regional Park with Croydon Metropolitan Centre. The 
Transforming the Purley Way chapter outlines how the retail areas 
along Purley Way, A23, will evolve into a series of interconnected 
mixed-use developments well-integrated sustainable mixed-use 
neighbourhoods, the nature of which will be determined by a 
masterplan and delivery strategy . 
Homes 
11.270 As set out in the transforming the Purley Way Area 
chapter a n area of major new high quality residential development 
based on available land will be concentrated around two new 
Local Centres at Waddon Marsh and Fiveways and a new 
Neighbourhood Centre at Waddon Way, as part of new mixed-use 
neighbourhoods along the Purley Way . on Purley Way, and a 
possible Local Centre at Five Ways. Residential development will 
respect the existing residential character and local distinctiveness. 
Further an Area of Moderate Intensification has been designated 
to the south of Waddon, This is currently a low density residential 
area, which is considered to have good access to Waddon and 
South Croydon Railway Stations, as well as local services within 
Brighton Road (Selsdon Road) Local Centre and the future new  
 416 Five ways Local Centre. Due to this, it is considered a sustainable 
location for moderate renewal, intensification via new residential 
development that results in a reasonable increase in the density of 
the area.  Residential development will need to be well designed, 
respect, reflect, evolve the existing residential character and local 
distinctiveness Residential development will respect and evolve 
the existing residential character and local distinctiveness.  
Employment, Skills and Community Facilities 
11.271 Purley Way, a Strategic Industrial Location, and the 
industrial heartland of the borough, will remain an important centre 
of employment activity. The borough will continue to invest in 
community facilities and education and training facilities, within the 
new Local Centres and Neighbourhood Centre such as the 
Waylands Leisure Centre, to meet the needs of the existing and 
new population. 
Character, Heritage and Design 
11.272 New development will respect the existing local 
character and distinctiveness of Waddon referring to the Borough 
Character Appraisal to inform design quality. Opportunities for 
public realm improvements will focus on Five Ways, where a 
possible Local Centre could be located. Waddon’s heritage 
assets, including Croydon Airport House and the classic view of 
Croydon from the Purley Way playing fields, will be protected. The 
Local Historic parks in the area will be retained with new links 
provided where possible to incorporate them into the Green Grid 
network.  
Environment and Climate Change 
11.273 The River Wandle will continue to be de-culverted 
where possible to create a more natural environment whilst 
encouraging biodiversity. Development that does take place in the flood zones will be guided by the policies of the Plan to reduce 
flood risk.  
Green Grid and Open Space 
11.274 Improved connections to the Croydon Metropolitan 
Centre and Wandle Valley Regional Park via Wandle Park and 
Waddon Ponds will be sought, improving and expanding the 
Green Grid to promote strategic east/west and north/south links. 
Transport 
11.275  Opportunities to improve the functioning of the A23 
and junction improvements at Five Ways will be taken. To 
encourage walking and cycling, high quality connections within an 
attractive environment will be sought to reduce the severance 
effect of the Purley Way road, railway and tram lines. There is a 
particular need to improve walking and cycling connections 
between Purley Way and Croydon Metropolitan Centre and 
reduce the severance caused by road flyover infrastructure such 
as Roman Way and Old Town roundabout.  Waddon will benefit 
from improved rail and tram services with investment in tram stock 
and more frequent services once infrastructure improvements to 
overcome bottlenecks such as Wandle Flyover and the Brighton 
Mainline upgrade works have been delivered . As the attraction of 
the Croydon Metropolitan Centre increases, the quality, capacity 
and reliability of bus services connecting to it will be improved. 
Travel plans will look to ease congestion at peak times by 
encouraging walking, cycling or public transport especially for 
school journeys. Waddon will also benefit from new and improved 
bus services to Croydon Metropolitan Town Centre, Purley, and 
Kenley and further afield supported by dedicated bus priority 
facilities on Purley Way. Demand management tools and 
behaviour change measures including new parking controls will  
 417 aim to ease traffic congestion by encouraging walking, cycling or 
use of public transport especially for school and work journeys . 
11.275A  The industrial and commercial areas of Waddon are 
becoming an increasingly popular base for freight distribution, 
warehouses and delivery centres. Whilst there may be benefits in 
terms of new employment, there are potentially very significant 
cumulative impacts on the local road networks.  
11.275B  The council will work with Transport for London to 
explore the feasibility of a tram extension to this area (and related 
facilities) to improve the reach and capacity of the tram network to 
support good growth. 
11.275C  The Transforming the Purley Way chapter sets out the 
priorities for creating safe and attractive green links across the 
Purley Way area along with, upgrades to transport infrastructure 
required to support developments .

Public Realm’ on the Waddon Estate, the large green open 
spaces of Duppas Hill, Wandle Park, Purley Way Playing Field, 
Roundshaw and the former international airport, WWI RFC and

and eastern edges of Waddon.  Paragraph deleted  
11.277 Located on east edge of Waddon, The Waldrons 
Conservation Area, one of Croydon’s first Conservation Areas , 
has a residential character of ‘Large Houses On Relatively Small

around the Waldons and a number of large high quality buildings 
on Bramley Hill and Bramley Close.  Paragraph deleted
Policy DM49: Waddon 
DM49.1 To enable development o pportunities including public realm improvements to be undertaken in a cohesive and coordinated 
manner, a masterplan with elements of design code  will be considered for the area within Waddon's potential new Local Centre.  An Area of 
moderate intensificatio n has been designated to the south of Waddon. The sustainable moderate, intensification and renewal of areas within 
this via proposals for new residential development will be supported that results in a reasonable increase in the density. De velopment will 
need to be well designed, respect, reflect and help evolve the existing suburban character and local distinctiveness of the area . The 
boundaries of these are shown on the map .   
DM49.2 Within Waddon allocate sites for development as set out in Table 11.17. 
 
How the policy works 
Waddon's potential new Local Centre 
11.278 The area in which DM49.1 applies , is shown on the 
Policies Map. 
11.279 The proposed new Local Centre and environs has a 
mix of conflicting uses. This has resulted in insensitive transitions 
between character areas. Additionally the area lacks a sense of 
place and does not function as a destination for residents, 
despite being well served by public transport, therefore a Place-
specific development management policy is required. 11.280 Waddon's potential to accommodate significant 
growth may lead to the designation of a new Local Centre. This 
opportunity provides additional impetus to ensure a balance is 
struck between retaining Waddon’s sense of place while 
strengthening and enhancing the positive elements of Waddon’s 
character. Additionally there is a need to create opportunities to 
reduce the dominant effect of the Purley Way and Fiveways road 
infrastructure and use the full potential of Waddon station as a 
catalyst for growth.  
11.281 Due to the complexity of these issues and the 
number of development opportunities in Waddon’s potential 
Local Centre, a detailed masterplan would help coordinate  
 420 development within this area is undertaken in a coordinated and 
cohesive way while retaining Waddon’s sense of place.

12. The Brighton Main Line and East Croydon Transformation Corridor  
Transforming East Croydon Station and corridor through the Brighton Main Line Upgrade Programme
Where we are now 
12.1 The key issues that the borough faces in terms of the East 
Croydon Station and corridor through the Brighton Main Line 
Upgrade Programme are as follows;  
 Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic more than 300,000 
passengers and 1,700 trains pass through the Croydon area each 
weekday, making it the busiest part of the country’s rail network. 
 The complex railway through the area means the Croydon 
bottleneck is widely considered to be one of the most operationally 
challenging railway junctions in the UK, regularly causing delays on 
the Brighton Main Line, its branches and the wider network. 
 Until the outbreak of COVID-19 passenger numbers at stations 
in Croydon had been rising, from 42.4m in 2010/11 to 52.9m in 
2018/19110.  Overall there are now twice as many journeys made to or from 
stations in Croydon compared to 2000-2001. 
 East Croydon station is the 17th busiest station in the UK in 
terms of passenger numbers. 
 Govia Thameslink (and its predecessors), the principal operator 
of passenger trains through East and West Croydon stations saw a 
41% increase in passenger numbers from April 2011 to December 
2019111. 
 The London Plan 2021 states the importance of the Brighton 
Main Line by referencing the project in the title of Croydon’s 
Opportunity Area and identified in the Plan as a Strategic 
Infrastructure Priority.  
Vision - Croydon Area Remodelling Scheme (CARS) 
 The step-change transport improvements that could be brought about through the Croydon Area Remodelling Scheme (CARS) as part 
of the Brighton Main Line Upgrade Programme, should it be funded, could be a once in a generation opportunity for Croydon, London 
and the wider South East. They would establish the East Croydon station area as a destination and transport hub of regional 
connectivity, and a civic place of exemplar design quality and sustainability, one that can service a diverse and growing population 
(residents, visitors and workers) for generations to come. This would be facilitated by significant and sensitive infrastructure delivery at 
Selhurst Triangle to address rail operations constraints and enable metroisation of the borough’s suburban rail network. 
 The transformation brought about by the Croydon Area Remodelling Scheme would bring significant opportunities for Croydon’s 
residents, its existing and future communities, businesses, visitors, developers and investors. This would be achieved through co-

ordinated development planning, attracting substantial inward investment, a high quality and inclusive station, Station Square and wider 
public realm, which enhances East Croydon’s heritage and character, an integrated and intuitive transport interchange and significant 
new green infrastructure to enhance the borough's Green Grid. It would encompass substantial enhancement in the rail infrastructure 
and surrounding environment at East Croydon, Selhurst Triangle and Windmill Bridge. It would strengthen, celebrate and enhance 
Croydon’s unique heritage – physical, social and cultural, whilst improving the amenity of the town centre and wider catchment. It would 
significantly improve one of London’s key stations through a high quality and intuitive transport interchange at East Croydon and 
investment in an exemplary public realm will deliver a more attractive, destination experience that connects into the wider Opportunity 
Area and complement the core functions of these locations. The Croydon Area Remodelling Scheme would be an exemplar of 
sustainability, enhance and promote health and wellbeing for passengers, residents and visitors and integrate and encourage active 
travel. 
 The further development of CARS has been affected by issues such as the significant uncertainty about future passenger behaviou r 
and demand following the COVID-19 pandemic and funding constraints following the Government’s 2020 spending review. 
 Given the significant investment required to deliver this scheme, Network Rail will now need to take the time to consider how the 
pandemic may affect passenger behaviour and travel patterns in the future, and how any such changes should be reflected in 
infrastructure investments such as this. 
 At this time, it is not known when CARS may proceed.  However, it is appropriate to set the planning framework for the Brighton Main 
Line and East Corridor Transformation Corridor to provide development plan clarity given the uncertainties outlined.     
 Network Rail recognises the significant positive changes that CARS could bring to a heavily used and constrained route and wi ll 
continue to develop the case for CARS in a way that responds to the wider uncertainties. This will help build a stronger business case 
and ultimately improve the chances of securing a positive decision and move the project to the next stage of the Government’s 
investment pipeline. 
 The following detailed sections of this chapter are reflective of Network Rail’s existing scheme designs and seek to support delivery of 
CARS.  However, given the current uncertainty over the final scheme and the constrained funding environment, in the future the chapter 
may need to be, as appropriate, applied to a future scheme.  It could be supplementary guidance might be required to respond to a 
future scheme.

Where we want to be 
Strategic Objective 1 : Establish Croydon as the premier business 
location in South London and the Gatwick Diamond.  
Strategic Objective 2:  Foster an environment where both existing, 
and new, innovative, cultural and creative enterprises can prosper.  
Strategic Objective 4:  Reduce social, economic and 
environmental deprivation, part icularly where it is spatially 
concentrated, by taking priority measures to reduce unemployment, 
improve skills and education and renew housing, community and 
environmental conditions.  
Strategic Objective 7:  Conserve , enhance  and create spaces and 
buildin gs that foster safe, healthy and cohesive communities.  
Strategic Objective 8:  Improve accessibility, connectivity, 
sustainability and ease of movement to, from and within the 
borough.  
Why this area will be transformed 
12.2 The opportunity to create a vibrant and exemplary front door 
to the town centre will bring significant opportunities for Croydon’s 
existing and future communities, businesses, visitors, developers 
and investors. It represents the key physical piece of infrastructure 
which will bring people to the business heart of the borough 
including the transformed destination of the North End Quarter.  
12.3 Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic more than 300,000 
passengers and 1,700 trains typically pass through the Croydon 
area each weekday, making it the busiest part of the country’s rail 
network. The complexity of the track layouts and railway junctions 
directly to the north of East Croydon Station mean that Network 
Rail consider it to be one of the most operationally challenging 
railway junctions in the UK. 12.4 East Croydon station and the immediate surrounding area 
has been a focus for development since the East Croydon 
Masterplan of 2011, the principles and objectives of which remain 
valid. This has seen notable developments reach consent, 
commencement and completion adjacent to East Croydon Station. 
The allocations and policies of this plan for the sites adjacent to 
the Brighton Main Line will continue to facilitate these growth and 
development opportunities. The area also remains Croydon’s core 
office location and the office retention area remains part of the 
development plan. East Croydon, for many, is the gateway for 
those that live, work and visit the borough.  
12.5 Alongside the rail infrastructure CARS presents an 
opportunity to strengthen biodiversity along the corridor, particularly 
through the new public realm and a station square, enhancing the 
Croydon Green Grid.  
 
 OFFICIAL  
12.6 The final form of the station square, particularly whether the 
station square includes a void or not, should be determined prior to 
submission of the Transport and Works Act Order application after 
a joint Council / Network Rail assessment of the options. A robust 
assessment process means that reasonable options have been 
considered using agreed evaluation criteria to select the preferred 
option.  The policies of this plan relating to the station square and 
public realm are to be applied to the station square whether a void 
exists or not.   
What is the Croydon Area Remodelling Scheme? 
12.7 The Croydon Area Remodelling Scheme (CARS) 
encompasses the range of interventions that are being taken 
forward by Network Rail, sponsored by the Department for 
Transport, to address the current issues in this area. CARS forms 
part of Network Rail’s extensive Brighton Main Line Upgrade 
Programme providing significant capacity and reliability 
improvements to this important railway corridor.  
12.8 The benefits of CARS go beyond technical improvements to 
the tracks, stations and operational arrangements. From the 
passenger experience and for the people of Croydon this 
promises to be an exciting and refreshing improvement to a busy 
place which many residents pass through regularly. It is also a 
major gateway to the borough and is many people’s first 
experience of Croydon as a place. Once CARS is completed 
anyone travelling to, through or from East Croydon station will 
have a better experience through technical improvements that 
make their journey more reliable and physical improvements to the 
station’s architecture, facilities and surroundings.  
12.9 The full transformation of East Croydon station, including 
relocating the main station building approximately 150m to the north of its current location, an increase in the number of platforms 
from 6 to 8, and the creation of a new station square are integral 
components of CARS. 
12.10 Network Rail will seek approval for the CARS main 
interventions through the Transport and Works Act Order process. 
This includes approval for the infrastructure, deemed planning 
permission for the elements requiring planning consent and land 
acquisition powers for the physical and construction land 
requirement. As a consequence, this chapter of the Local Plan will 
be the council’s development plan position to the Transport and 
Works Act Order process, particularly any Public Inquiry. At the 
Public Inquiry the Local Plan will be material to the consideration 
and determination of Network Rail’s proposals. Network Rail will 
also be engaging their permitted development rights to support 
delivery of CARS.

How we are going to get there 
Policy BML SP1: Transforming East Croydon Station and corridor through the Brighton Main Line Upgrade Programme 
BML SP1 .1 The Brighton Main Line and East Croydon Transformation Corridor  will provide a high quality station and transport interchange 
enabling the increased use of public transport to, fro m and through East Croydon station, and via Windmill Junction and the Selhurst 
Triangle. To ensure this development proposals in the Brighton Main Line and East Croydon Transformation Corridor area will b e expected 
to: 
a) Enable the delivery of the Brighton M ain Line Upgrade Project;  
b) Provide for efficient and effective transport interchange which facilitates transfers between different modes of transport;  
c) Include innovative measures to improve passenger transfer and integrate digital and smart city infrastruc ture; 
d) Enable the ongoing effectiveness of the existing transport network during the Brighton Main Line Upgrade delivery;  
e) Outside of the remit of the TWAO, but within the Brighton Main Line and East Croydon Transformation Corridor area, deliver a mix of 
uses, which contribute to the development of the borough as a significant commercial centre alongside associated services and fa cilities 
and residential development.  
BML SP 1.2 to deliver an effective transport hub integrating all modes of transport the redeve lopment must:  
a) Provide for an effective accessible, inclusive and legible network integrating all modes of transport focussed on East Croydo n Station;  
b) Establish new or integrated connections to the wider transport network through the borough and to the sout h east; and  
c) Connect and enhance the accessibility of to the Croydon Metropolitan centre including the retail core.  
BML SP 1.3 Enhancements to public transport facilities should incorporate:  
a) Significant improvements to East Croydon Station for rail and tram passengers;

 OFFICIAL  
 
Why we have taken this approach 
12.11 The station building, station square, rail systems, 
highways, bridges and construction planning associated with 
CARS will form part of a Transport and Works Act Order (TWAO) 
application to secure the parliamentary powers required for the 
scheme’s development. 
12.12 It will encompass substantial enhancement in the rail 
infrastructure and surrounding environment at East Croydon, 
Selhurst Triangle, Windmill Bridge and all other works within the 
TWAO boundary. CARS will build on strengthen, celebrate and 
enhance Croydon’s unique heritage – physical, social and cultural , 
whilst improving the amenity of the town centre and wider 
catchment. It will significantly improve one of London’s key 
stations through a high quality and user centred transport 
interchange at East Croydon and investment in a high-quality 
public realm will deliver a more attractive, destination experience 
that connects into the wider Opportunity Area and complement the 
core functions of these locations. The CARS scheme will meet the 
highest possible standards of holistic sustainability and seek to 
enhance Croydon’s Green Grid, walking a cycling connections and 
biodiversity.  
12.13 Given the considerable change CARS brings to 
Croydon it is critical the council has a development plan 
framework for the project. This is to guide and influence the 
development management and Transport and Works Act Order 
process.  Should the Brighton Main Line Upgrade Programme be 
delayed, the policies and allocations will still be engaged to 
determine proposals in the Brighton Main Line and East Croydon 
Transformation Corridor area, unless directly related to the CARS 
end state, such as the Station Building and Station Square.    12.14 Notwithstanding the anticipated change, the project 
also presents significant growth and development opportunities for 
the London Borough of Croydon (LBC), which the Local Plan is 
looking to capture through the vision, policies and allocations of 
the Local Plan.  
12.15 The ambition is to create a high quality station and 
transport interchange at East Croydon, which responds to its new 
geographical context, general development in the area and 
passenger growth. To achieve this the new station will be 
expected to be a high quality civic hub and transport interchange 
and have a spacious and inclusive design. 
12.16 Central to the urban design objectives for a relocated 
East Croydon Station is the opportunity to realise a high quality 
transport interchange, enabling easy, intuitive and efficient transfer 
between modes of transport integrated within the local context and 
routes. 
12.17 The character of the east Croydon area will evolve in 
the coming years. A busier town centre with more residents, 
people coming to Croydon for work and leisure, a future station 
and adjoining public realm will need to serve a multitude of new 
residents and continue to improve perceptions. The station re-
location presents the opportunity to create a user centred 
transport environment that celebrates and enhances Croydon’s 
diverse heritage, character and communities, integrates public 
facilities, social infrastructure and activities. To do so, the streets 
and spaces connecting the station to its surrounding environment 
will need to enable an uplift in the levels of walking and cycling 
and provide the opportunity for seamless interchange with other 
modes of transport. Significant opportunity exists to set this 
interchange function within an exemplary station environment, with  
 
 OFFICIAL  
an exceptional public realm integrated with its surrounding street 
and open space network. 
12.18 An overarching urban design ambition for East 
Croydon is to deliver an environment where pedestrians do not 
feel secondary or negatively impacted by their environment. This 
means re-prioritising space for people within the urban realm and 
ensuring that this space is attractive, safe and welcoming. This 
also means that facilitating sustainable modes of transport should 
be prioritised over private transport, with through-traffic on the 
streets around the station removed and rat-running deterred. 
Additionally, it means that where buildings and developments 
meet the public realm, care should be taken to improve the 
experience of being in the street. 
12.19 A successful Brighton Main Line Upgrade Programme and 
development around the new East Croydon Station and station 
square will be of exemplary quality, well integrated in placemaking 
terms with the surrounding streets and contribute to sustainable 
transport and a transport interchange. To guide the project and 
development a Strategic Regeneration Framework has been 
prepared. The Framework expresses how the new East Croydon 
Station and associated public realm can best integrate and link with 
the wider Croydon Opportunity Area and Addiscombe through the 
street network. 
12.20 An upgraded pedestrian environment around the station will 
include require the creation of a legible street network, wider 
footways, together with safe and conveniently located crossing 
facilities and new direct east-west walking and cycling routes 
across the rail corridor. New pedestrian and cycle routes should be 
facilitated by developments  in the streets around the station. 12.21 As part of the Station Square proposals and the 
reconfiguration of bus stopping arrangements around the station, 
there is an opportunity to create a high quality Tram Station 
interchange at East Croydon. 
12.22 To enable increased capacity within the wider Tram 
network, in order to meet the service level increases set out in the 
Mayor’s Transport Strategy, an additional platform has been 
proposed at East Croydon Station. The removal of the existing 
Train Station building fronting George Street enables a fourth 
Tram platform to be located adjacent to existing platforms. This 
proposal will require further technical feasibility studies to ensure 
the bridge structure can support an additional platform and Trams. 
However, it is expected the TWAO submission will provide 
provision for this additional platform opportunity. 
12.23 The provision of bus facilities, including a relocation of 
services to fully integrate the bus network with the new station, 
new bus stops, high quality passenger waiting facilities, along with 
standing and turning space for terminating services, will be 
required in order to meet increased future passenger demand and 
operational requirements. The design of the bus facilities needs 
careful consideration, in order to ensure that passengers benefit 
from safe, welcoming and direct interchange between modes, they 
enhance the public realm environment, and contribute positively to 
the image and attractiveness of East Croydon. 
12.24 Options for bus stopping and standing will be subject 
to further testing through RailPlan with Transport for London 
ahead of the TWAO submission to determine the end state bus 
stopping and standing arrangements within the Croydon Area 
Remodelling Scheme area.   
 
 OFFICIAL  
12.25 The new provision for buses should meet the requirements 
of bus passengers whilst also providing a permeable, safe and 
attractive environment for pedestrians and cyclists. The new bus 
network arrangements will be designed to be of similar scale to the 
surrounding street network, and to feel like a part of an attractive 
London streetscape. 
12.26 Taxis play an important role at the station, being the first or 
final component of many journeys via East Croydon station. It is, 
therefore, important to make provision of taxis. At the same time 
taxis can have an impact on neighbouring areas through queuing 
and the often impenetrable public realm around taxi ranks. To 
mitigate these issues whilst still meeting the needs of users of East 
Croydon station consideration will be given to promoting alternative 
modes such as walking and cycling. Provision will ensure that 
ranking and pick up/drop off areas are carefully managed, making 
the most efficient use of space, enhancing the public realm and 
paying due regard to access arrangement for those within mobility 
issues. Opportunities will be explored for a larger feeder rank that 
could be located outside of the immediate station area, with use of 
apps / cameras to indicate available space at the pick-up location. 
12.27 These proposals are subject to TWAO approval and scheme 
funding being secured from the Department of Transport. A key 
component of the TWAO application stage will be the full 
consideration by the Department for Transport of the Outline 
Business Case for the scheme. 
12.28 The transformation provides a huge opportunity, but will 
cause significant disruption to existing residents, businesses and 
development proposals. This is needed to cement the borough’s 
position as an outer London strategic economic location to the benefit of Croydon, London and wider south east. Disruption 
caused by the transformation includes: 
 Network Rail taking control of land that is not currently 
railway land in order to carry out the works – some land will 
need to be taken over permanently and other areas can be 
returned to non -rail use when the project is completed;  
 Delaying the development of some existing Local Pla n 
allocations, which will need to be implemented later than 
originally planned in order to allow the upgrade works to take 
place; and  
 The loss of some commercial and industrial area  
12.29 Network Rail will be acquiring land to facilitate the 
physical delivery and construction of CARS. Post construction, the 
land that was required for construction will become available for 
development. Any proposals will be assessed on their merits 
against the development plan policies and development need in 
place at the time of pre application engagement and planning 
application determination. However, if the land to be acquired and 
made available post construction is currently either a Tier 1, 2 or 3 
employment site, as defined in Policy SP3.2 Employment, this will 
be the land use designation at the point the land becomes 
available post CARS construction.

Detailed policies 
 BML DM1  Station building and Square  
BML DM1.1  The Station and Station Square will serve as a key gateway to the town centre for the millions of travellers using the rail, bus, 
tram and taxi that pass through. To enab le this both the new station building and the square should:  
a) Integrate built in digital infrastructure in the design and as a means to enable passengers of all mobility capabilities to e fficiently move 
around the different transport modes;  
b) Provide enhanced  provision for cyclists and pedestrians in order to support an increase in the mode share of cycling and walking to 
and from East Croydon Station;  
c) Meet an Urban Greening Factor threshold of 0.3;  
d) Use the opportunity to create increased green infrastructure that is lacking in the area;  
e) Integrate significant biodiversity measures to achieve Biodiversity Net Gain; and  
f) Land uses proposals that are outside of the remit of the TWAO, but within the Station and Station Square area, should be 
commensurate to the func tion of the station and complement the core function of other areas within the Croydon Opportunity Area.  
BML DM1.2   Development proposals for the new station building should:  
a) Be high quality place specific, with a strong identity fitting of being the borou gh’s gateway and reflective of  Croydon’s unique 
heritage, local character and diverse communities and users ; 
b) Frame views towards and enhance the setting of the NLA Tower as well as compliment other unique architectural assets in the a rea, 
existing and eme rging;   
 
 OFFICIAL  
c) Respond to new geographical location by respecting sensitive boundaries with adjacent developments and respond to the emergin g 
scale of the surrounding developments;  
d) Be clearly identifiable through its architectural forms, materials and details. In particular, all entrances should be clearly articulated 
and visible through their placement and design;  
e) Have a clear physical connection to George Street and its approaches to aide wayfinding and interchange with trams and buses;  
f) Be visually and physically  permeable;  
g) Sensitively integrate security measures into the design of the station and associated public realm; and,  
h) Ensure arrangements for delivery & servicing are accommodated in off -street locations or away from the key streets and movement 
corridors where with minimal disruption to public realm.  
BML DM1.3   As a consequence of the station building shifting north there is the opportunity to create a high quality public space betwee n 
the new station site and George Street, acting as a catalyst and point of orientation for wider regeneration and development for the benefit of 
residents and visitors. A new Station Square and associated public realm should:  
a) Establish a new vibrant space and focal point for the east Croydon area enhancing its sense of place a nd identity;  
b) Frame and enhance the setting of the NLA Tower;  
c) Accommodate the demands of a diverse communities and users through being a welcoming, safe, accessible and inclusive 
environment for all including provision for the needs of young people, older residents and visitors and those with mobility challenges;  
d) Given the size and significance to Croydon should include integrated public art;  
e) Be integrated with the station building itself;  
f) Integrate active frontages facing onto the square from adjacent dev elopments.  
g) Provide a programme of  a variety of activation throughout the week which complement the daytime and evening economy uses 
within Croydon Town Centre.   
 
 OFFICIAL  
h) Create a micro -climate environment that allows for short and long stays.  
 
i)  Outside of the remit  of the TWAO, but with the Station and Station Square area, include a provision of non -rail ancillary land uses 
that are commensurate to the function of the station and complement the core function of other areas within the Croydon Oppor tunity 
Area.   
 
BML DM1.4 A significant enhancement within the streets, public realm network and frontages around the new East Croydon station is vital ly 
important to ensure the station integrates with the wider Opportunity Area and will greatly improve the quality of experi ence for all users, 
particularly pedestrians. These improvements should:  
 
a) Integrate significant green infrastructure increases;  
b) Widen footways at locations of high footfall to accommodate expected increase in footfall;  
c) Locate crossing points intuitively al ong anticipated desire lines;  
d) Development should actively address the street and contribute to a high quality arrival experience;  
e) Enhance the setting of heritage assets and their role as wayfinding markers within the street network; and  
f) Streamline street f urniture to make sure key views and routes are not obstructed.  
How the policy works 
12.30 The station re-location presents the opportunity to create a 
high quality transport interchange that is uniquely ‘Croydon’ in 
character and that creates strong connections to surrounding areas 
and local communities. To do so, the streets and spaces 
connecting the station to its surrounding environment will need to 
encourage more people walking and cycling and provide the 
opportunity for seamless interchange with other modes of transport.  
Significant opportunity exists to set this interchange function within an exemplary station environment, with a high quality public realm 
integrated with its surrounding street and open space network. 
12.31 The Station and Station Square will serve as a key gateway 
to the town centre for the millions of travellers using the rail, bus, 
tram, taxi and bicycle services that pass through. 
12.32 The station site should provide enhanced provision for 
cyclists in order to support an increase in the mode share of cycling 
to and from East Croydon Station. Cycle parking will be expected to  
 
 OFFICIAL  
integrate well with the new cycle routes and desire lines around the 
station, to help encourage cycling as a convenient way to travel to 
and from the station. All cycle parking would be expected to include 
a multiple of services to support the cyclist, including cycle parking, 
bike repair facilities, electric charging points and cycling 
information. 
12.33 The station building will shift approximately 150 metres north 
along the rail tracks north and will be located north of George 
Street. It is necessary for way finding and to serve as a gateway to  
Croydon Town Centre for the building as seen from George Street 
and beyond to be able to have a clear physical presence. 
12.34 There will be a secondary entrance onto Lansdowne Road 
(north of Caithness Walk) which will unlock the development 
potential in this area. The creation of a new station in a different 
location will enable the existing station to continue to function and 
eventually to be decommissioned without disruption to services.  It 
should be a high quality, sustainable and place specific destination, 
with a strong identity which is contextual and celebrates central 
Croydon’s unique heritage, local character, and diversity. 
12.35 The Station and square will integrate with the surrounding 
public realm to create a civilised transport interchange uniting 
different forms of mobility and be focused on passengers through 
excellent connectivity and legible routes. The policies seek to 
ensure that the square is a new vibrant space and focal point for 
the east Croydon area enhancing its sense of place and identity 
and which compliments local community facilities. Through careful 
design using innovative new integrated technologies the space will 
serve to help passengers move smoothly and efficiently between 
trains, busses, trams and other sustainable forms of transport.   12.36 The station square would be created above the existing train 
lines on an elevated deck at the existing level of George Street and 
would be defined by the proposed East Croydon station to the 
north, proposed developments along Cherry Orchard Road, 
including a redeveloped Royal Mail site to the east, tram 
interchange and George street to the south and the existing HMRC 
building and Ruskin Square proposed developments to the west. 
12.37 The final form of the station square, particularly whether the 
station square includes a void or not, should be determined prior to 
submission of the Transport and Works Act Order application after 
a joint Council / Network Rail assessment of the options. A robust 
assessment process means that reasonable options have been 
considered using agreed evaluation criteria to select the preferred 
option.  The policies of this plan relating to the station square and 
public realm are to be applied to the station square whether a void 
exists or not.   
12.38 Station Square will cohesively integrate with the wider 
network of public spaces and walking and cycling routes both 
existing and proposed across the Opportunity Area, both existing 
and proposed, that would begin to set a new development context 
for East Croydon, re-prioritising pedestrians and cyclists and 
providing a spatial anchor for this part of Croydon. 
12.39 In addition to being an area for passenger transport 
movements the square will act as a notable gateway to the 
metropolitan centre. It will provide an immediately recognisable 
signature view for passengers arriving in Croydon. However, 
recognising the large numbers of people living nearby it will need to 
function as a local meeting and recreation space. There should be 
generous green infrastructure as there is a lack of natural  
 
 OFFICIAL  
landscapes in the metropolitan centre. The square should meet the 
Urban Greening Factor threshold of 0.3. 
12.40 The character of the area and sense of identity can be 
created in the square through integrated public art. To be most 
effective this should be collaboratively designed delivered with the 
community. 
12.41 The station square should offer a rich variety of activity 
throughout the week providing amenity opportunities and social 
infrastructure for all diverse communities and users of the square. It 
is envisaged this will require activation strategies to be put in place, 
which address ongoing management and maintenance, varied 
programming, and interim use strategies to test.

How the policy works 
12.42 Beyond the improvements around East Croydon station 
there are other improvements which contribute to the improvement 
project. Some of these improvements are unseen engineering 
improvements that may be carried out as part of the permitted 
development enjoyed by the rail infrastructure providers. However, 
where the project leads to development covered by the local plan 
these polices seek to ensure that the project adds benefit to the 
residents and the environment. 
The Selhurst Triangle 
12.43 The Selhurst Triangle is the heart of the rail infrastructure 
requirements of the Brighton Main Line project where the core 
causes of the Croydon Bottleneck will be addressed in rail 
operation and infrastructure terms. Network Rail’s current proposals 
outline a complex arrangement of rail infrastructure including rail 
realignment, grade separation and a series of under passes and 
flyovers. The Council acknowledge the infrastructure importance of 
the Selhurst Triangle. However, there are measures that can 
mitigate any impact where they take place outside the railway. 
12.44 The policies seek to mitigate the impact of the infrastructure 
on surrounding properties, especially neighbouring residential 
areas, and is a key policy requirement.  12.45 Given part of the Selhurst Triangle is a Site of Nature 
Conservation Importance, the approach to the landscape has to be 
holistic to work alongside the necessary physical infrastructure. The 
Brighton Main Line Project presents a unique opportunity to 
produce an innovative and unique landscape intervention that 
works with the proposed structures to produce a unique natural and 
man-made urban intervention. A high quality landscape solution will 
contribute to an enhanced first impression to rail users arriving or 
passing through Croydon. 
Windmill Bridge 
12.46 The Windmill Bridge improvements should ensure that 
walking and cycling connections across the railway line in this 
location are retained when reasonable during the construction 
phase, and any road closures to traffic are minimised via the use of 
innovative construction methods.

13. Transformation Area - The North End Quarter  
 Introduction  
The North End Quarter includes the land bound by Wellesley Road, George Street, Frith Street, Tamworth Road and Poplar Walk, and it includes North 
End running along its central spine and the largest retail centre in the borough (see fig 13.1, Site Plan).  
 
It sits within the Croydon Opportunity Area and is surrounded by five town centre masterplan areas including the adjacent Old Town masterplan, West 
Croydon masterplan, Mid Croydon masterplan, Fairfield masterplan and East Croydon masterplan. Part of it also sits within the Central Croydon 
Conservation Area and has an array of listed and locally listed buildings.    
 
Transforming the North End Quarter
Where we are now 
13.1 The key issues that the borough faces in terms of the North End 
Quarter are as follows; 
 Croydon Town Centre, and the North End Quarter in particular (see fig 
13.1 site plan), has an ambitious development and vibrant retail history. It 
rose fast and successfully in a period of post war boom and 550,000m2 of 
commercial floor space was built between 1963 and 1973. The Whitgift 
Centre opened in this period. It was originally based around a network of 
streets and public spaces, and became one of the most well-known 
attractions of Croydon t own centre. This shopping focused area, like 
many others, has been undergoing a period of decline over recent 
decades.  
 Altogether Croydon town centre has more retail floor space than any 
other Metropolitan Centre in London, with 30,000m2 more floor space 
                                            
112 Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study  than Stratford. However it also has the highest vacancy rate among 
London’s Metropolitan Centres (at 27%)112. And whilst Croydon town 
centre has the 5th highest rate of spending on comparison goods 
amongst Metropolitan Centres in London, when this is converted to how 
much is spent per square metre of floor space, Croydon falls to the lowest 
rate of spend in London. 
  
 Neighbouring competition from other outer London retail centres along 
with Bluewater and Lakeside in the 1990’s, led to a period of sustained 
challenges for this previously thriving centre. Investment has previously 
been proposed by large scale redevelopment proposals which have not 
been realised and in the meantime a number of its department stores 
have now closed and the quality of the public realm has declined. These 
challenges have continued to the present day.  
 The once iconic department store in distinctive buildings of Grants and 
Allders are now gone.   
444 
  The other major shopping centre in central Croydon is Centrale on the 
western side of North End, which opened in 2004. Although relatively 
modern in its quality of offer, the draw of Croydon shopping is no longer 
strong enough and even this centre is now challenged like many centres. 
 Developers continue to be interested in taking on the challenge of the 
redevelopment evidenced by planning permission being granted three 
times over recent decades for new shopping centres in the town centre 
(including the associated Compulsory Purchase Orders being approved) 
but no permission has been implemented. 
 Whilst High Streets have declined greatly over the past 20 years, with 
the increase in online shopping and changing trends in the retail industry; 
COVID-19 has accelerated these pre-existing challenges. Today, primary 
retail zone (Zone A) rents are now half of what they were in 2018113 and in 
Croydon they are still declining. 
 Today North End remains Croydon’s principal shopping street. 
However, much of the retail offer – including the types of businesses and 
quality of space - is tired and does not live up to its potential or have the 
ability to respond to future trends and demand. It offers neither occupiers 
nor shoppers the type of quality retail experience or accommodation that 
is required or expected. Further, there has been a reliance on retail as the 
primary town centre land use, but this is no longer sustainable or resilient. 
 
 Alongside the post war boom as a retail centre, Croydon was also a 
planned ‘out of centre’ area for offices including some large organisational 
headquarters that moved from central London. Between 1963 and 1973, 
20% of offices and 30% of jobs moved out of Central London to Croydon. 
Until recently, Croydon was experiencing 30 years of continued decline as 
a location for offices, however recently the demand for new offices has 
begun to increase again and there is a need for follow on space for 
SMEs114. Some of this can be well integrated in the North End Quarter. 
 
 North End and George Street retain many 19th century buildings 
reflecting Croydon’s past commercial prosperity. Several frontages are of 
high quality and protected as part of Central Croydon Conservation Area. 
                                            
113 Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study A number are also listed and locally listed with significant heritage value 
such as the Grade I listed Whitgift Almshouses (over 400 years old) and 
the Grade II listed Electric House. The relationship between the Victorian 
shopping streets and post-war modernist development is important to its 
character and developments will need to build on and enhance this. 
 The issues that the North End Quarter faces need to be addressed, 
and an updated overarching spatial planning strategy and guidance is 
required for the area – one that is sustainable, flexible and responds to 
the local context of Croydon as well as broader consumer trends. This will 
ensure the North End Quarter is a vibrant and resilient metropolitan 
centre for those who live, work and visit Croydon. This transformation 
chapter sets out an overarching framework for how it should be shaped to 
address the challenges it faces and to ensure its vitality for years to come.

 Vision for the North End Quarter 
 The North End Quarter will be a sustainable, resilient and safe 24 
hour destination for all. It will revive central Croydon’s bold and 
visionary heritage with innovation, social value and wellbeing at its 
heart. It will be a vibrant biodiverse, high quality neighbourhood 
that complements and supports the surrounding masterplan areas 
in the town centre, and includes retail as a balanced part of a more 
diverse mix of uses that safeguard its future vitality and viability.  
 The North End Quarter will build on its history as an education, 
commercial and social hub, to be an attractive visitor destination 
with a vibrant public and cultural offer alongside retail. The 
anticipated growth will be sustainable, design led and guided by 
good growth principles. It will be an inclusive destination for all, 
including an exemplary physical network of streets, public spaces 
and facilities that improves connectivity, celebrates its heritage 
and a unique local character with a strong green infrastructure that 
connects to the wider green and blue grid, digital infrastructure 
and sustainable transport embedded throughout. This will attract 
new audiences with diverse new activities and uses.  
 The area will support lifelong learning and celebrate local 
knowledge, services and production. It will provide opportunities 
and infrastructure for all local communities and include a minimum 
of 600 new homes and many new residents. Given the expanded 
area, it is expected to accommodate a greater number of homes 
than previously envisaged and enable a thriving neighbourhood.  
 Complemented by the other transformation areas of Purley Way 
and Brighton Main Line Corridor and East Croydon Transformation 
Corridor, North End Quarter will be a highly productive area that 
helps tackle climate change, improves public health and wellbeing, 
celebrates diversity and fosters social and community cohesion

an area for public and social life, retail, office/workspace, arts and 
creative industries (including a diverse evening/night-time 
economy), leisure and sports, entertainment, learning and 
innovation activity alongside residential. It will also be a strategic 
commercial centre in South London.

resources and management of waste to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change.  
Why this area will be transformed 
13.2 The heart of Croydon’s town centre was most recently developed 
in the 1960s when urban theory favoured the segregation of different 
uses and this has resulted in the provision of an area containing 
predominantly retail uses. This is still mirrored on both sides of North 
End. 
13.3 The pedestrianised North End has the appearance of a traditional 
high street occupied with a value offer and retail chains whilst the two 
large shopping centres are composed of mainly comparison retail with 
significant voids, particularly at the upper floors. The town’s department 
stores have been badly affected by changing trends in the last two 
decades.  The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have accelerated and 
exacerbated these challenges. There is very little in the way of other 
uses or social infrastructure in the North End area, with most of these 
activities taking place to the south of the retail core. The Quarter also 
lacks quality open and green public space and suffers from poor 
                                            
116 Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study connectivity and permeability. This segregation of uses, whilst typical of 
many town centres in the UK, has not aided their future resilience. 
13.4 Town centres are increasingly becoming places where people live 
as well as work, shop, visit and socialise. The Croydon Opportunity Area 
will accommodate approximately one quarter of new homes needed by 
2039. Surveys have shown that access to public transport and being 
close to where you work, cafes and restaurants, local services, leisure, 
public space and cultural facilities are more important to those who 
choose to live in town centres than being close to shops116. There is a 
projected rise in need for ‘15 minute’, 24 hour and circular economies as 
well as green infrastructure117. Furthermore, those town centres that 
have invested in attracting a balanced diversity of uses, residents and 
high skilled jobs have been more resilient over the last ten years through 
the changing retail market. The diversification of the North End Quarter 
with a mix of residential, retail, knowledge & innovation, arts  & culture, 
food & drink, leisure & entertainment, offices and homes alongside high 
quality streets and public spaces and community and social 
infrastructure will enable it to develop with resilience over the lifetime of 
this Local Plan. This change will generate greater levels of footfall and 
117 See case studies in Croydon Future of Destination Retail Study   
448 
 spending power, supporting the town centre economy. The 
redevelopment of the area with a new mix of uses that complements a 
renewed retail offer along with public open space will encourage multi-
purpose trips, in the heart of the town centre.  
13.5 With the proportion of retailing conducted online likely to continue 
to increase, Croydon’s town centre will need to provide a unique 
experience and a more diverse offer if it is to maintain its position as a 
major destination and centre in south London. Creative, cultural, evening 
and night time uses, and spaces for making and production to facilitate a 
circular ecosystem will be needed to achieve a sustainable ‘destination.’  
13.6 Bricks and mortar retail will still remain an important component. 
Towns and cities grew up around the activities of ‘exchange’, with a 
shop’s physical presence being an important attractor for consumers, 
but their role is changing. On average, retailers record a 12% increase in 
online sales in the catchment area after opening a store118. Shops will 
become less about in store sales and more about building their brand 
and connecting with their customers; a focus on experience, a curated 
offer and service rather than actually buying a product. This, in turn, will 
drive demand for higher quality, and in some cases, larger, shop units, 
as well as the need for higher quality public realm with green spaces in 
Croydon’s town centre. This will create a much more pleasant 
environment in which to shop, a generous and attractive destination to 
socialise and enhance the area to support its economy while having 
environmental benefits.119 A more diverse mix of uses and infrastructure 
will also be needed to support a growing residential community in the 
town centre.  
13.7 Croydon’s history of innovation will be a useful starting point to 
promote local businesses, and take advantage of and support the 
creativity of the borough. Transformation will not be effective if is not 
uniquely Croydon grounded in Croydon’s heritage. Any future 
                                            
118 Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study 
119 See case studies in the Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study  development, whether short, medium or long term, must build on and 
celebrate the unique heritage and character of the area, meaningfully 
benefitting the borough’s diverse communities and needs. Furthermore, 
transformation will need to be sustainable, and be neighbourhood 
based; with the town centre’s role for public good at its core. Rich 
biodiverse and productive landscapes within a strong green grid and 
social infrastructure that replace the dominance of cars will be the new 
draw for this part of the town centre. This in turn will lead to an attractive 
destination and drive up footfall.  
13.8 The urban form of Croydon town centre, and in particular the 
Whitgift Centre, has poor permeability and accessibility issues. East to 
west routes across the heart of the town centre and through the North 
End Quarter are limited, poor quality and difficult to navigate during t he 
day. At night it is impossible to travel east to west through the shopping 
centres, and North End becomes one, long north to south canyon across 
the town centre. Wellesley Road is a dual carriageway with tram lines 
and with no surface crossing points for pedestrians. Redevelopment will 
need to ensure that the existing significant barriers for pedestrians are 
addressed. It should be possible to easily and safely travel north to 
south and east to west 24hours a day in the future. The poor relationship 
that the shopping centres have with the surrounding townscape, with the 
inactive back entrance to the Whitgift Centre, servicing for redundant 
office space, and entrances to the centre’s car parks will be improved. 
Wellesley Road will need to function as more than just as a car 
dominated route cutting through the metropolitan heart of the borough. 
13.9 The significant heritage value of the area in particular within the 
Central Croydon Conservation Area, the corner of North End and 
George Street with the Grade I listed Whitgift Almshouses, the Grade I 
listed St Michael and All Angels Church and a number of other listed and 
locally listed buildings lie in the area will inform development proposals 
that will need to enhance their settings. The current refurbishment of t he 
Grade II listed Electric House to house an educational use is a welcome 
  
449 
 step forward in improving the townscape and providing an exciting reuse 
that will attract new footfall to the area.   Future development will use the 
area’s rich heritage and evolving surrounding townscape as a positive 
foundation to build on and further enhance its special history and 
character, while improving the setting of these heritage assets with high 
quality public realm. 
13.10 Post war development was predicated on car use and has 
been a root cause of the poor pedestrian connectivity, accessibility and 
inclusivity in the public realm and built environment. Surrounding recent 
town centre masterplans have set out objectives and guidelines to 
transform and improve connectivity in the wider town centre and these 
principles will also be placed at the heart of the revival of the North End 
Quarter.  
13.11 This transformation of the North End Quarter will need to 
be different to what has taken place before, and been attempted so far 
this century. Previous approaches and proposals have not worked due to factors including the dominance of retail, and not being built on the 
positive assets and heritage of the area. Future development will likely 
be phased over time, part of a flexible yet coordinated spatial 
framework, and involve the re-use of existing spaces and buildings as 
well as the construction of new relatively denser and more robust 
development, which can be reused and adapted over time.120 
13.12 It will be a diverse and resilient central neighbourhood with 
the area providing for a mix of commercial uses, social infrastructure 
and supporting a new residential community. This will include affordable 
commercial and community spaces that help celebrate and showcase 
local organisations whilst supporting Croydon’s diverse demographics. It 
will complement the rich and distinctive character of the adjacent Old 
Town and West Croydon areas;  
 
 
 
How we are going to get there 
Strategic Policy NEQ SP1 : Transforming the North End Quarter  
NEQ SP1 The North End Quar ter forming part of the Croydon Metropolitan Centre and Croydon Opportunity Area, will be an important public destination 
in the borough, with a productive and diverse range of uses within a green and sustainable framework, where revitalisation an d develop ment will include 
a resilient and diverse mix of uses, including a renewed retail offer alongside a new residential community and supported by a programme of 
infrastructure investment maintaining its status as the commercial heart of the borough.  Developm ent proposals will be expected to reflect and be 
delivered through a collection of strategic principles for change :  
a) The North End street frontage between George Street and Poplar Walk will serve as the main retail and commercial frontage for the town cent re;  
                                            
120 See Croydon Future of Destination Retail Study for examples   
450 
 b) Sustainable development which is adaptable and future -proofed including provision of retail spaces according to identified and evidenced need, where 
evidence responds to emerging consumer behaviour trends, environmental benefits, hyper -local and  circ ular economy principles;  
c) Provide a diverse and balanced mix of uses alongside renewed retail, new homes, local services and social infrastructure. Thi s can include offices 
and workspaces, arts and creative industries, a diverse evening/night -time economy,  leisure, sports and play, entertainment, learning and innovation 
activity, and promote new forms of innovative ventures that provide public benefit and support local organisations. Retail is to be focused along North 
End with the wider Quarter including a  balanced and  complementary mix of uses;  
d) An integrated Northern area that supports and complements West Croydon becoming a civilised  and rationalised  transport interchange and 
celebrating diverse local businesses and convenience shops of London Road;  
e) Wellesley Road will become more welcoming approach to the North End Quarter with enhanced public realm, green infrastructure and become a 
healthy street;  
f) A green network  - an inclusive quarter for public life stitched together through a generous high quality accessible public realm, a strong green grid 
and new network of streets and public spaces; it will improve permeability, connectivity and include a central anchor space a nd a series of pocket 
parks throughout121;  
g) Our heritage will be revealed, conserved and  enhanced alongside complementary and respectful development . Development s seek to celebrate and 
enhance the area’s distinct existing local character and heritage. They will be expected to have regard to historical assets alongside surrounding 
public realm  improvements to elevate their setting and provide complementary new adjacent developments;  
NEQ SP2 The Council will work with landowners and stakeholders to bring forward and facilitate a spatial framework and guidance that further enables 
the execution o f core principles and objectives set out in this chapter. To ensure redevelopment within the North End Quarter is coordinated , sustainable 
and resilient to changing trends, redevelopment s will be expected to:  
a)  Demonstrate how they contribute towards achiev ing a joined up spatial vision  that builds on the overarching principles of this chapter;  
b) Where possible, bring forward public realm improvements, to improve activity, perception, footfall and begin reviving the Qua rter;  
c) Demonstrate that they contribute  toward the creation of an accessible, inclusive and legible network of high quality streets and public spaces 
(including a new anchor public space, pocket parks, squares and roof gardens) across the Quarter, which shall include safe 24  hour public 
spaces,  new 24 hour east -west and north -south routes to improve permeability and connectivity including a key east – west route connecting 
Wellesley Road to North End and beyond;  
                                            
121 See Spatial Vision diagram below + figure 13.3   
451 
 d) Contribute to a balanced mix of town centre uses including residential, commercial,  and community uses including affordable commercial and 
community spaces alongside wider social infrastructure.  
e) Proposals for higher education uses (along with identified necessary supporting facilities) within the North End Quarter will  be supported wher e 
they are of high quality sustainable design and complement surrounding uses and institutions;  
f) Support the creation of a residential community with a minimum of 600 new homes, including a mix of tenures and types of hous ing. There is an 
expectation that w here robustly justified, a greater number of homes will be accommodated across the Quarter;  
g) Make the best use of land through a sustainable design led approach that optimises site capacity and promotes appropriate den sity, sustainable 
development that ben efits from proximity to jobs, services and public transport facilities while contributing to the vitality and resilience of t he town 
centre.  
NEQ SP3 Development shall  improve the public realm within Croydon Metropolitan Centre and to reduce barriers to pe destrian movement across the 
town centre by:  
a) Contributing to the delivery of an accessible, inclusive and legible network of high quality streets and public spaces incorp orating a new safe linked 
network of 24 hour east -west routes  
i. from Wellesley Road thro ugh North End,  
ii. North End to Tamworth Road/Frith Road  
iii. a new north -south route between Poplar Walk and George Street, and  
iv. Other  secondary streets to improve permeability and connectivity through the Quarter;  
b) Contribute toward the establishment of a new anch or public space and a network of pocket parks, squares and roof gardens, and part of the wider 
green grid;  
c) Embed public art within the public realm including interventions that showcase and celebrate the heritage and diversity of th e area;  
d) Create a high qu ality, safe, accessible and inclusive environment for all including step free access across the Quarter which resolves any is sues 
caused by land level changes, servicing and car parking;   
452 
 e) Following a hierarchy of street networks122 , where North End is the ma in town centre retail frontage, with other active frontages on Wellesley Road, 
George Street and Poplar Walk. These will include a mix of sustainable town centre uses that complement a renewed retail offe r that is focused along 
North End. Other streets wil l include a combination of active and positive frontages to ensure vitality and safety;  
f) All frontages are to be developed as a holistic part of the public realm that promote permeability and vibrancy, passive surv eillance, safety and 
sustainable service ar rangements.  
NEQ SP4 To ensure the North End Quarter positively contributes to Croydon’s environmental improvements and a more sustainable centre,  
development should integrate urban greening, sustainable transport and public realm improvements through the f ollowing:  
a) An inclusive, high quality public realm that enhances the area’s civic function and attractiveness, and improves connectivity  for pedestrians and 
cyclists to locations beyond the North End Quarter including West Croydon and East Croydon stations,   Fairfield Cultural Quarter, Mid Croydon, 
Old Town, Park Hill recreation park and Wandle Park, and the Purley Way area;  
b) Encouraging sustainable transport routes and landscaping through the integration of green and blue infrastructure within stre ets and op en 
spaces;  
c) Improved biodiversity such as ecological corridors;  
d) Social spaces and play spaces that welcome and support the borough’s diverse communities;  
e) Improved walking and cycling connections to wards  existing green and blue spaces;  
f) Joined up servicing a nd delivery access ; 
g) Significantly reduced provision of car parking within the North End Quarter  and  
h) Contributing towards making land uses in the quarter car -free.  
NEQ SP5 Restoration, and re -use of existing buildings will be supported where:  
a) An existing building, its retention, restoration and re -use makes a positive contribution to the Central Croydon Conservation Area as set out in the 
Appraisal and Management Plan;  
                                            
122 See figure 13.2; ‘Spatial Vision Diagrams’   
453 
 b) the existing building is a statutorily Listed Building or a Locally Listed Building; and  
c) It is supporting interim uses of buildings and land to avoid long periods of inactivity in the town centre, and seeks to addr ess the vision and 
objectives for the North End Quarter.

Why we have taken this approach 
A resilient town centre 
 
13.14 Since 1945 Croydon has relied heavily on large scale, 
comprehensive developments within the town centre to deliver change. 
These schemes are massively challenging and expensive to deliver so 
the policies enable development to be delivered in a phased, flexible 
and simpler form, allowing for viable developments to evolve.  
13.15 The world of retail has changed substantially since 
Centrale opened in 2004. Online retailing was in its infancy then. ONS 
statistics show that in 2008 online retailing accounted for just 5% of all 
sales. Ten years later (in 2017) it had risen to 16% of all sales. In the 
same period in-store sales rose in total by 13% compared to a 326% 
rise in online sales125. For comparison the total UK economy grew by 
just over 10% in the same time frame126 meaning that in-store sales 
barely kept up with general economic growth whereas growth in online 
sales outstripped overall growth by a factor of over 30.  
13.16 Retailing has declined and less floor space is required and 
is used differently to this end, proposals which propose a net loss of 
retail floor space (particularly comparison goods) will be considered. 
Should a proposal seek an increase in retail floor space that would result 
in a significant increase overall across the district centre the council 
would need evidence to be satisfied that the proposal is both resilient to 
future changes in retailing, is sustainable and deliverable, will enable a 
circular economy with substantial public benefits and will not cause 
substantial harm to competing town centres (which include other 
Metropolitan and Major Centres in neighbouring boroughs, and 
designated principal Town Centres in Tandridge and Reigate & 
                                            
125 Comparing “bricks and mortar” store sales with online retail sales: August 
2018 (ONS)  Banstead). Where focused on one part of the area, proposals must also 
demonstrate cumulative impact to ensure it does not harm viability and 
potential of the wider Quarter. 
13.17 Further, new macro challenges have arisen that any future 
development of the area will need to positively address – this includes 
the environmental challenges and the climate emergency; public health 
and quality of life (exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis), systemic social 
and cultural inequality,  economic uncertainty and the housing crisis. 
Development should work to address issues such as community safety, 
diversity and inclusion arising from and exacerbated by rising 
inequalities and economic uncertainty, as well as the delivery of the 
Mayor’s Transport Strategy.  
13.18 A new approach to transforming and future proofing North 
End Quarter and making it a resilient Metropolitan Centre serving 
Croydon and south London is required. The transformation will need to 
address the challenge left by the decline of large scale retail led 
development which is no longer commercially, economically or socially 
viable. 
13.19 Research into the impacts of the 2008 economic crisis has 
shown that the town centres that were more likely to have sustained 
their economic vitality and viability were those that were more orientated 
towards local services than traditional destination retail, and those with a 
more diversified portfolio of high quality retail units and higher proportion 
of smaller independent specialist stores showcasing local products and 
organisations. Within Croydon itself this is best exemplified by a number 
of the district centres which exhibit these features, notably Crystal 
Palace. Therefore, proposals for development in the North End Quarter 
will need to plan for a more resilient mix of uses that creates a new 
neighbourhood. It should not be focussed on being led by large scale 
retail floors that have not proven viable, and instead be guided by 15 
126 Gross Domestic Product: chained volume measures: Seasonally adjusted £m 
(2008Q1 – 2017Q4) (ONS)   
459 
 minute and circular economy principles that encourage local production 
and services. Part of this may include some smaller retail development 
in appropriate locations and guided by the principles in this chapter. This 
is of particular importance given the rapidly growing residential 
community throughout the town centre.  
13.20 Experiential and specialist local products and services will 
be important to a local placemaking response. The North End Quarter 
along with the Purley Way area will need to evolve and adapt in a 
manner that can be responsive to future changes in market demand, as 
well as also complementing other town centre masterplan areas. 
Diversification of uses and how they are designed in will need to ensure 
that the heritage and character of the local area and that of the 
conservation area is preserved and enhanced  
13.21 A resilient town centre will also be a place that caters for a 
range of users from families with young children, through to younger 
people, and the borough’s older residents. It will be an inclusive centre 
with facilities that cater for the borough’s diverse communities; and be 
accessible to users with a variety of mobility needs.  
13.22 Providing a range of sizes of public spaces is proven to 
support a diversity of uses127. A central anchor space in the North End 
Quarter can function as a natural meeting place, large enough for events 
and activities, whilst networked smaller areas can accommodate more 
intimate occupations such as contemplation, reflection and play and 
support active travel connections to and through the North End Quarter. 
A variety of generous and adaptable public spaces within a sustainable, 
biodiverse green and blue framework will serve the diverse communities 
and needs of the borough; improving public health, climate change and 
inequalities. Development will contribute to this provision either by 
delivering it through the development where appropriate or through 
financial contribution towards shared spaces. The green and blue 
framework will connect to the wider green and blue grid in the borough 
                                            
127 See findings and case studies in Croydon Future of Destination Retail Study  to help facilitate a positive response to climate challenges, improving 
biodiversity and greening throughout the borough along with wider 
benefits captured in the Green Grid chapter. Blue infrastructure in this 
case refers to integrated interventions such as Sustainable Urban 
Drainage systems (SUDs), sustainable urban irrigation systems, rain 
gardens amongst others that enable a thriving green and blue grid with 
circular benefits to the public realm and environmental qualities ; however, if 
proposed and appropriate it does not preclude decorative or play based 
water features such as water fountains 
Phasing of developme nt 
 
13.23 The Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework, 
adopted as a Supplementary Planning Document to the Croydon Local 
Plan: Strategic Policies in April 2013, set out that the preferred approach 
to redevelopment of the Whitgift and Centrale areas of Croydon town 
centre, was through a comprehensive approach as part of a large 
redevelopment and renewal approach. This would preferably be carried 
out as part of a single, or complementary phased programme of 
redevelopment proposals and works. 
13.24 In the changing landscape of retail that Croydon town 
centre now faces in the 2020s, it is unlikely that such a single phase 
comprehensive approach would either be placed before the council to 
consider, or be delivered if it were required by the council, nor would it 
be a sustainable approach. However, it is still critical to the success and 
transformation of the town centre for there to be a joined up, coordinated 
spatial framework that guides the coordinated redevelopment and 
revival of the North End Quarter across multiple phases. Without a 
strategic overview there is always a risk that the transformation would be 
piecemeal and/or include large periods of vacancy. Any individual 
smaller development proposals that come forward would therefore need  
460 
 to reflect and support the principles and objectives of this chapter and 
contribute to achieving its vision. 
13.25 There are a number of acceptable routes to achieving a 
strategic overview and coordinated transformation of the North End 
Quarter. The first is for the council to agree a phased programme of 
works and interventions with stakeholders within a joined up spatial 
framework. Alongside meaningful public engagement, the council will 
work with landowners and stakeholders to bring forward and facilitate a 
spatial framework that sees the execution of the principles and 
objectives set out in this chapter128. This will create a foundation for the 
North End Quarter to continue to provide the town centre with resilient 
retail and other destination services commensurate with its status as 
part of a Metropolitan Centre and new residential neighbourhood. This 
phased programme would where appropriate set out interim uses of 
existing spaces as well as precursors and early wins which may also 
retrofit and reuse existing buildings during the transformation period, and 
beyond. To secure this phased programme of works, a Hybrid Planning 
Consent could also be an appropriate route covering the whole area of 
potential works and renewal (including reuse of existing buildings), and a 
more detailed early phase and interim use plan. 
13.26 The second approach to securing a strategic overview is to 
prepare a high level masterplan setting out the parameters for any 
redevelopment or re-use of different elements of the North End Quarter. 
Any masterplan should ensure the execution of the principles set out in 
this chapter, and focus on deliverability, design principles and phasing 
with guidance on uses based on the vision for the area. Any masterplan 
for the area will need to be inherently flexible in regards to building uses, 
phasing, and include a robust public realm strategy. This can be council 
led where funding can be secured and developed in close collaboration 
with key stakeholders; or stakeholder / lead developer led with close 
collaboration with the council, both with in- depth public engagement. 
                                            
128  See figure 13.2; ‘Spatial Vision Diagrams’ The latter could also be developed as the first part of an extended pre-
app process or through coordination between multiple applicants.  
13.27 Whichever approach is taken it will need to consider all 
stages of phasing including short term, interim and precursors uses, 
infrastructure capacity and dependencies with other development 
schemes to ensure deliverability and the cumulative impact is 
understood. Interim uses will be encouraged and welcomed for 
individual sites that are unlikely to be developed in the short term. The 
phasing will need to be agile and responsive to changing consumer and 
public needs, behaviours, technological advances, and other macro 
issues set out in the vision and kept under regular review. In the case of 
a masterplan this can be through monitoring of the masterplan phases 
and reviewing and refreshing any detailed guidance that may form part 
of it. Any masterplan approach will need to ensure longevity and avoid 
being an elongated process to ensure it catalyses rejuvenation of the 
area. The preferred approach would be a phased, flexible masterplan, 
however this does not preclude other approaches being acceptable 
where justified such as a high level spatial framework alongside a 
phased programme of works including(including short, medium and long 
term phases); or a hybrid planning application. All approaches will need 
to demonstrate they can successfully execute the objectives and 
principles of the North End Quarter chapter.  In a scenario where 
phasing is secured through an Outline or Hybrid Planning Consent, the 
regular review of phasing plans, design guidelines and codes would be 
recommended to ensure it is suitably adapting to changing policy or 
market conditions.  
 
Re-use of existing buildings 
 
13.28 A large proportion of the North End Quarter is located in 
the Central Croydon Conservation Area and retains significant heritage 
assets and a distinct local character. The transformation of the North  
461 
 End Quarter therefore does not mean the complete demolition of 
rebuilding of the area. Many buildings can and should be retained and 
revived to a high standard, particularly considering the heritage context 
and contribution to that area’s particular sense of place. Furthermore, in 
the context of tackling the causes of climate change, and the carbon 
emissions of construction materials, in some cases re-use of existing 
buildings can be more sustainable, producing less carbon than 
demolishing and rebuilding. They can also be equally transformative129. 
To enable this the re-use of existing buildings will be supported where 
the existing buildings (of any size) are to be retrofitted to achieve a 
minimum of BREEAM Very Good standard or equivalent. In all cases 
where buildings are to be re-used, the highest standards of design, 
quality, sustainability and carbon reduction will be sought. 
13.29 Other buildings within the North End Quarter will make a 
positive contribution to the Central Croydon Conservation Area. Where a 
building does make a positive contribution the council will favour its 
retention and high quality restoration. If an alternative development 
approach is proposed, it will need to be justified through the pre-
application process in order to assess if it an appropriate approach and 
ensure it enhances the setting of the conservation area and surrounding 
heritage assets. As with other buildings of that meet the area threshold, 
if it involves over 500m2 in floor space then Policy SP6.3 of the Croydon 
Local Plan will apply and the works will need to achieve a minimum of 
BREEAM Very Good standard or equivalent.  
13.30 Reuse and retrofit of buildings with possible impact on 
heritage assets or where it falls within the conservation area, will be of 
the highest quality and enhance the setting of the heritage asset(s) and 
provide wider public benefits such as new public spaces and social and 
community facilities. 
13.31 Interim uses and precursors uses where sites of various 
scales are unlikely to be redeveloped in the short term will be welcomed 
                                            
129 Croydon Future of Destination Retail Study  and encouraged whilst following the principles and objectives of this 
chapter. Short term phases of development will also play an important 
role in the revival of North End Quarter as it undergoes transformation. 
They will ensure that the town centre does not suffer from decline as 
elements of the North End Quarter undergo redevelopment or renewal 
by helping to attract residents and visitors to the town centre at all times. 
Building and maintaining footfall, public life and supporting existing 
businesses in the town centre will be critical for ensuring the long term 
success and resilience of transformation as those businesses will be the 
bedrock of the development of North End Quarter. Early public realm 
improvements as a precursor to long term development and delivery of 
high quality public spaces as part of development proposals will play an 
equally important role. Therefore, the council will support the 
improvement and re-use of existing buildings, spaces and land where 
they support the creation and operation of a viable interim/meanwhile 
uses or early phase/early win transformations as part of the holistic 
phased framework including precursor and long term phases will also 
encourage and support early public realm improvements where both 
help to prevent decline occurring in Croydon town centre and improve 
vitality. 
Homes 
 
13.32 The North End Quarter will include a rich tapestry of uses 
within a green, civic framework to ensure its resilience and vitality as a 
town centre destination. Integrating a minimum of 600 new homes, 
including affordable homes and a balanced range of housing typologies 
will be an important part of developing a thriving new neighbourhood. 
New homes will be an important part of the mixed use quarter and will 
be maximised alongside provision of town centre retail, however in a 
sustainable, balanced and appropriate manner. The North End Quarter 
has potential to accommodate a significant number of homes. There is 
also opportunity for the area bound by Frith Road, North End, Tamworth 
Road/Poplar Walk and George Street/Church Street to provide further  
462 
 new homes in the future.  Any proposal will also need to incorporate 
suitable and quality infrastructure (physical, social and cultural) and 
inclusive of public facilities. 
Education 
 
13.33 It is a long standing objective to create a new university 
campus in Croydon. Electric House, a Grade II listed building on 
Wellesley Road, will be used as a new university centre in Croydon. 
Further, additional learning, creative industries and innovation uses with 
related services and infrastructure within the North End Quarter would 
complement this anchor use. 
 
East-West routes and the Wellesley Road frontage 
 
13.34 It is an objective to secure a 24-hour east-west route 
across the North End Quarter as part of any redevelopment proposals. 
This is set out in the Croydon Opportunity Area Planning Framework 
and was included as part of the two outline planning permissions for 
redevelopment of the Whitgift Centre. It is critical to the success of the 
Quarter’s transformation that longstanding barriers to pedestrian and 
cycle movement are removed and replaced with a new legible pattern of 
streets and public spaces across the area. The east-west route will need 
to connect the Old Town area of the town centre with the New Town 
area and on towards East Croydon station. 
13.35 Pedestrian safety on these routes will be of paramount 
concern so it is important that they benefit from active frontages during 
the day and evening, and passive surveillance at night from overlooking 
residential properties. 
 
Local character, townscape and public realm  
 13.36 Development proposals should seek to celebrate the 
history and heritage of the North End Quarter. The North End Quarter 
features a rich history of social and commercial innovation and high-
quality buildings of diverse architectural styles that can contribute to its 
distinct destination offer. North End itself is Croydon’s principal shopping 
street; formed as a result of the late Victorian commercial expansion of 
the Town Centre. It is part of the historic north-south route that connects 
through to central London and south to Brighton.  
13.37 Building heights on North End range from the modest 
domestic scale of two-three storeys in some of the oldest buildings, 
including the Grade I listed Whitgift Almshouses, to a maximum of four 
storeys in the later 19th century commercial buildings. Many buildings 
have pitched roofs and gable fronts.  
13.38 Two large shopping centres, the Whitgift Centre and 
Centrale, occupy most of the built-up area behind the older buildings on 
North End. The Centrale shopping centre has a modern frontage on 
North End.  
13.39 The Allders Department Store, on North End and George 
Street, was the flagship store for Croydon entrepreneur Joshua Allder in 
1862 and grew over time to be the third largest retail unit in the UK in 
early 2000’s. Apart from the Allders building itself, buildings on George 
Street are at a consistent height of three to four storeys, with four storey 
buildings concentrated at the north-east corner with Wellesley Road. 
13.40 Building heights and density across North End Quarter will 
need to be carefully designed to preserve or where possible enhance 
the setting of Central Croydon Conservation Area, surrounding heritage 
assets and other sensitive locations. Proposals for taller forms will need 
to be robustly tested for their townscape and heritage impacts and 
sustainability, whilst also helping determine the suitability of locations. 
They will also need to ensure a positive and welcoming microclimate is 
created throughout the Quarter, wind tunnels prevented and air quality 
improved.   
463 
 13.41 Improving the public realm, permeability and connectivity of 
the North End Quarter is critical to its successful transformation. An 
active and inclusive high quality public realm with exemplary public 
spaces at all levels of development will contribute to the usability and 
appeal of the destination offer. It should accommodate active lifestyles 
(walking and cycling in particular), and the demands of the borough’s 
diverse communities from play space for children, the needs of young 
people and elderly residents; and be a safe, accessible and inclusive 
environment for all. 
13.42 Enhancing and increasing green infrastructure connected 
to Croydon’s green grid and integrating blue infrastructure where 
appropriate will also contribute to the sustainability, biodiversity, usability 
and appeal of the destination offer of the North End Quarter. 
Incorporating productive landscapes (e.g. indoor and outdoor urban 
farming where appropriate will be welcomed), green spaces and 
landscaping, sustainable urban drainage systems, sustainable urban 
irrigation systems , active travel networks into the transformation of the 
Quarter will help to reduce carbon emissions from the area, improve air 
quality, help to create a net biodiversity gain and help facilitate a circular 
ecosystem in the area. It will in turn improve the appeal and long term 
vitality of the area.  
Transport and servicing 
 
13.43 The North End Quarter lies in the heart of Croydon town 
centre between East and West Croydon stations. Bus routes surround 
the Quarter serving Tamworth Road, West Croydon Bus Station, Poplar 
Walk and Wellesley Road. There are also tram stops serving the 
Quarter on Tamworth Road, at West Croydon station, on Wellesley 
Road and on George Street. Together these combine to give the entire 
Quarter a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 6b, the highest possible 
level. To take advantage of this, accessibility objectives for the North 
                                            
130 Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study  End focus on creating permeability on the street for safe an effective 
active travel connection. 
13.44 As the Quarter lies in the most accessible location in the 
borough any transformation should be based around maximising car-
free destination retailing and leisure to reduce the carbon footprint of 
development, and to improve air quality in the town centre. Guided by 
the Mayor’s Transport Strategy, part of this will include significantly 
reducing the provision of car parking in the Quarter. Currently Croydon 
town centre has in excess of 8,500 car parking spaces which is more 
than 2,000 spaces more than any other Metropolitan Centre in 
London130. 
13.45 Limited shared coach parking may be supported 
depending on the mix of destination uses that would attract large group 
visits – the need for this will need to be demonstrated through robust 
evidence.  
13.46 Innovative servicing and delivery and logistics plans that 
minimise the need for vehicles will be embedded. For example the use 
of sustainable methods such as cargo bikes alongside centralised 
distribution centres in locations away from the town centre will be 
encouraged for appropriate uses e.g. residential deliveries. 
13.47 Generous and robust civic infrastructure including public 
spaces, social and community infrastructure and inclusive public and 
cultural facilities will need to be integrated throughout the Quarter to 
improve quality and attractiveness of the environment, improve 
wellbeing, increase footfall and draw in new audiences to the 
neighbourhood. This in turn will increase the value and opportunities in 
the area. 
13.48 Provision will need to be made for uses facilitating and 
supporting a knowledge economy, education uses and an innovation  
464 
 hub within the North End Quarter. This will include enhancing training 
infrastructure and career pathways for young people and for life-long 
learning.  
13.49 Given the potential for considerable residential 
development in the Quarter, any redevelopment within the area bounded 
by North End, Poplar Walk, Wellesley Road and George Street should 
provide a minimum of 600 new homes to support the creation of a 
resilient and vibrant town centre. This will contribute to significant 
placemaking benefits and will require high quality public facilities and 
social infrastructure to support it. In addition to this, there is potential 
opportunity for some student accommodation to support the educational 
uses in the Quarter.

Detailed policies 
 Policy NEQ DM1 North End: Town centre retail focal point 
NEQ DM1.1 Serving as the central ‘civic’ spine of the area, and key pedestrian thoroughfare from West Croydon Station to the Mid -Croydon quarter, area 
development should:  
a) Be designed with active frontages at ground floor level;  
b) Be designed to create a vibrant social space with a safe, high quality public realm;   
465 
 c) Where appropriate be designed to integrate provision for larger markets, temporary activities, spill out space an d events;  
d) Provide for evening business presence; including outside food and beverage spaces, restaurants and cafes; experiential retail ; civic, creative and 
cultural uses; and  
e) Integrate a well -designed cycle route and walking routes.  
NEQ DM1.2 Along North  End, to facilitate growth and to enhance the distinctive character, development should:  
a) Be designed and laid out in  response to  the constraints and opportunities of the distinctive heritage of the area;  
b) Seek to address the need to contribute positively to street frontages  to ensure a high quality and coherent streetscape,  whilst preserving and 
enhancing the setting of heritage assets;  
c) Complement the existing predominant building heights of 3 storeys along the North End frontage , respecting and responding  appropriately to 
sensitive locations;  
d) Celebrate the designated view of the Town Hall Complex and Clocktower from North End, and respect the setting of St Michael a nd All Angels 
Church whilst improving connectivity to these key assets;  
 
How the policy works 
13.50 North End is a key pedestrianised artery and civic centre in 
this Quarter and broader town centre. Provision of high quality public 
realm along North End complemented by a key public space in the wider 
quarter and connected pocket parks will encourage varieties of informal 
and formal activities that complement other parts of the town centre  
13.51 The provision of programmable spaces for markets, 
activities, spill out space and events, alongside provision for evening as 
well as daytime activity will attract audiences over the 24 hour life of the 
area. Families with young children will be encouraged to visit with the 
provision of integrated internal and external play space. Evening activity 
will help to increase passive surveillance and the safety of the space at 
night.  13.52 Providing a cycle route and cycle parking along North End 
will encourage active travel and its associate health and economic 
benefits, increasing car-free access along North End, and through to 
West Croydon Station.  
13.53 North End is lined by many high quality buildings, the 
majority relating to the area's prosperity in the late 19th century and 
early 20th century and displaying well-detailed frontages (surviving to 
the upper floors in particular). In addition to the predominant Victorian 
architecture, particularly notable buildings include the former Allders 
store and medieval Whitgift Almshouses (Grade I listed). The buildings 
are largely individually-designed but their height, quality and overall 
character provide a cohesive streetscape which underpins the area's  
466 
 distinctive character131. The view south towards Croydon Clocktower 
(grade II listed, designated landmark) further enhances the 
distinctiveness of the area and contributes to wayfinding through the 
area. Ensuring growth in the area responds to this distinctive character, preserves and enhances heritage assets and their settings and ensures 
that they remain the dominant feature, will provide a unique identity to 
the destination, contributing greatly to the attractiveness of the North 
End Quarter as a place to spend time. 
Policy NEQ DM 2: Central Neighbourhood   
To ensure that development is well designed and laid out in the area bounded by North End, Poplar Walk, Wellesley Road and George Street  and to 
enable the development of a diverse centra l neighbourhood with public life at its heart it, it should :  
a) Seek to improved safety, access, inclusivity and legibility;  
b) Be laid out to improve north – south and east – west permeability and connectivity throughout the quarter, including a key 24 hour e ast-west route  
c) Provide for a vibrant mixture of uses along the route within a public and sustainable green framework including comparison an d convenience 
retail and local services. As part of a mixed use development; office and affordable work space, food and drink, finance and commercial, education 
and knowledge economies, leisure and entertainment, community uses and social infrastructure, creative industries including a  variety of affordable 
creative production spaces; arts & cultural uses, and wider civ ic functions could be provided with residential use being focused above ground floor 
level;  
d) Deliver future proofed  retail development on the ground floor with complementary active uses such that there is a balanced mix that ensures 
resilience and vitality ; 
e) Incorporate public open spaces and pocket parks, including an anchor public space;  
f) Maximise amenity spaces for residents and visitors at all levels including upper levels and roof tops;  
g) Complement the existing predominant building heights of 3 storeys a long the western (Centrale) part of the quarter; and  
h) Focus taller buildings towards the eastern side of the block to protect the setting of the Central Croydon Conservation Area and to protect the 
most sensitive locations in terms of privacy, heritage asse ts, security, overshadowing and wind.

 How the policy works 
13.54 This is the relatively new and functioning retail area which 
will transition to include a more resilient mix of units. It will benefit from 
including a variety of types of units that are adaptable, including for 
smaller, independent organisations at rents affordable to local 
businesses, and public uses whilst complementing the offer within other 
parts of the town centre. They will also make provision for a move 
towards an experiential and curated town centre offer where a mix of 
scale of spaces including larger spaces are needed for larger 
businesses and organisations.  
13.55 The rental levels for affordable rented units will be 
benchmarked against the prevailing rents for independent stores and 
other appropriate uses outlined previously elsewhere in Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre (along designated Main Frontages on George 
Street, Church Street, Surrey Street, High Street and food & beverage 
businesses and other local services along streets such as South End) exclusive of service charges. The proportion of affordable rented units 
should be maximised and will be secured in perpetuity through planning 
obligations. Further guidance is provided in the Employment section.  
13.56 To further enhance the resilience of the North End Quarter , 
where appropriate development proposals will need to make provision 
for small and medium sized local Croydon businesses in the form of 
studio space, production spaces, innovation hubs and managed 
workspaces. All managed workspaces will need to be managed by 
vetted providers of managed workspaces and incubators. 
13.57 Provision will also need to be made for the arts, creative 
and cultural industries at affordable rents.  
13.58 Provision of public and community facilities at affordable 
rents should also be maximised, particularly in order to support a diverse 
demographic of visitors, a growing residential  
community and workers in the area. 
Policy NEQ DM 3: Northern Boundary - Poplar Walk and Station Road 
Reflecting that this area acts as the northern  boundary  and northern entrance  of the North End Quarter, featuring a diverse range of uses such as office, 
a grade I listed church, retail, a rationalised transport interchange with the West Croydon rail, bus stations  and a  cycle hub, and an array of con venience 
shops serving Croydon’s diverse communities that continues into London Road; development in this area should support and enha nce current uses and 
be designed to reflect  the distinctive character of the northern part of the quarter by.:  
a) Incorporat ing new active frontages that complement existing mixed use;  
b) work with land level changes in the area to ensure step free and active access through all parts of the public realm and into  buildings;  
c) Complement the existing predominant building heights, ens uring the setting of heritage assets is respected and enhanced including, in particular 
St Michael and All Angels Church;  
d) Contribute to creating a safe, legible and welcoming forecourt to the North End Quarter with enhanced public realm that suppo rts the d elivery of a 
rationalised transport interchange and cycle hub facility at West Croydon;   
468 
 e) Integrating a strategic cycle route; and  
f) Building on the diverse and bustling character of the area at the edge of London Road.  
 
How the policy works 
13.59 Poplar Walk and Station Road are close to the West 
Croydon Station, the ‘new doorway to Croydon’132 and a primary arrival 
point into the North End Quarter for Croydon residents and visitors. 
Introducing active and positive frontages along Poplar Walk will help 
create a cohesive and legible northern entrance to the North End 
Quarter that is safe and welcoming to all users. As part of this, 
consideration will need to be given to reducing the impact of servicing 
and carpark access on the pedestrian environment and the road 
network. The impact of these access points will need to be addressed as 
part of the overall transformation of the North End Quarter. 
Consideration will also need to be given to improvements being provided 
through emerging developments in the area such as London Square 
development and its enhanced public realm.  
13.60 The area features a vibrant collection of uses and building 
scales which contributes to its distinctive character, varying from 
affordable fine grain shopfronts to large office buildings and carparks.  
Innovative new uses on Poplar Walk should be explored, building upon 
the existing range of uses and range of building sizes. Large existing 
buildings and carparks have the capacity for a diverse range of 
alternative uses including play space, street sports, growing and 
community gardens133. Smaller buildings should support finer grain local 
businesses and creative enterprises. The varied historic character 
includes Grade 1 Listed St Michael and All Angels Church, post war 
                                            
132 West Croydon Masterplan  office blocks, and historic shopfront at 10 Station Road. Development 
should respect and enhance this varied character.  
13.61 Views of St Michael and All Angels Church are long-
standing landmarks and key to informal wayfinding into the North End 
Quarter, therefore the scale and massing of developments should 
respond to existing variation in heights to respect and maintain this. 
Other important views in and around the Quarter must be preserved and 
enhanced. Development proposals will need to be tested in views to 
assess the suitability of scale, massing and height. 
13.62 Public realm improvements such as the provision of green 
infrastructure including sustainable blue infrastructure where 
appropriate, improved wayfinding, lighting and seating will help support 
the existing and future access needs on Poplar Walk and help mediate 
between the different needs of service access vehicles, buses, cyclists 
and pedestrians.  
13.63 Contributing to and supporting improved permeability 
between Station Road and Poplar Walk, will help improve pedestrian 
accessibility and also support active travel into the Quarter. Existing 
pedestrian flows into North End Quarter from West Croydon Station are 
focussed on the busy junction of Station Road and North End where 
pedestrian space and crossings are severely restricted.  
13.64 As part of the public realm improvements there is potential 
to expand and further distribute existing pockets of green spaces 
133 Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study   
469 
 adjacent and parallel to St Michael’s Church. The existing car parking on 
the north side of Poplar Walk and hard-landscaped square on the south 
side, have the opportunity to provide generous and connected spill out 
space for local office workers, local businesses, temporary and long-
term community use such as markets, play space and events. This can 
be done by producing a variety of spaces, some which are unfurnished 
providing space for programming and others that provide street 
furnishings that can be used for multiple purposes.  
470 
 Policy NEQ DM 4: Wellesley Road – Croydon’s front path 
This is the main highly trafficked route into Croydon town cent re through all modes of travel. Experienced as the “ front path” of the metropolitan centre, 
development should contribute to reducing the dominance of the road infrastructure by appropriate design facing the road , and where appropriate 
providing for and i ntegrating enhanced public realm that will create pedestrian and cycle links, a green artery with enhanced biodiversity and a  series of 
pocket parks . To do this, development should:   
a) Address the deficiency in sustainable green infrastructure within the are a by maximising tree planting, greening, SUDs, sustainable landscapes 
that create a thriving ecological corridor and improve the environmental qualities of the area, whilst integrating and connecting with t he green grid 
network and balancing the impact of existing and proposed high density developments;  
b) Complement and build on the character of the historic modernist architecture of the area so that it feels like you are passin g through a point in 
time in Croydon’s past;  
c) Ensure tall buildings complement the existing surrounding townscape, respect and enhance the setting of heritage assets through rigorous testing 
for impact and create a cohesive townscape; and  
d) Ensure buildings fronting the eastern and western sides of Wellesley Road enhance and connect to the  public realm around them and 
appropriately announce themselves with active forecourts and ground floor frontages, integrated wayfinding and public access.    
471 
 How the policy works 
13.65 Passive surveillance, active frontages and widening of 
footways are critical to improving the public realm and pedestrian 
experience along the western side of Wellesley Road. As part of this, 
consideration will need to be given to reducing the impact of servicing of 
commercial developments on the pedestrian environment and the ro ad 
network. Access to public car parking has the same detrimental impact, 
notably providing some difficult road crossings for the pedestrians 
walking along the western side of Wellesley Road. A reconnected urban 
realm will serve as a public backbone for future developments134. 
13.66 Generous green infrastructure that is informed and 
supported by Green Grid and Healthy Streets principles will be essential 
to reducing the severance caused by the road network, improving the environmental quality of the area, and creating an attractive public 
welcome to the North End Quarter to draw in more visitors. Noise and 
air pollution, traffic dominance and poor accessibility create a confusing 
and hostile environment, which will need to be repaired as part of its 
transformation. Using existing infrastructures to support new forms of 
public life has been proven as a successful model135. 
13.67 Historic landmarks such as St Michaels & All Angels 
Church to the north, and Electric House to the south are important 
informal wayfinding signposts and contribute to the overarching 
destination offer of the North End Quarter. The landmarks can be part of 
a wider wayfinding strategy that connects through to Fairfield Halls, 
setting up a series of historic building signposts along Wellesley Road. 
 
Policy NEQ DM5: George Street (to the west of Wellesley Road) – Historic Southern Edge 
Development in this area should be informed by its rich  heritage assets and how these form the southern boundary of the Nort h End Quarter by:  
 Creating  for a distinctive hi storical entrance and forecourt on the southern edge of the quarter and along a key east -west route through the town 
centre, and creating a strong building line;  
 Uplift and enhance the public realm and pedestrian environment around the tramline and Listed  Whitgift Almshouses;  
 Improve shopfronts and building facades along the George Street, ensuring attractive and active frontages are created ; 
 Provide for interim and precursor use of the former Allders building and arcade where connected to a long term str ategy and plan or where the 
activity compliments and doesn’t compromise the delivery of the long term vision and objectives for the North End Quarter; an d 
 Retaining and enhancing the existing façade of the former Allders Department Store.

472 
 How the policy works 
13.68 George Street is an important artery of the Central 
Croydon Conservation Area, and respecting and enhancing its historic 
character will contribute to the distinctive destination offer in the North 
End Quarter136. The medieval street pattern is distinct to the area and 
includes a series of high quality Victorian commercial buildings with 
prominent dormers and gables Grade I Listed Whitgift Almshouses sited 
on the corner of George St and North End. Design proposals that reflect 
and enhance this character with the aim of preserving and strengthening 
a clear building line and the streetscape will be supported 
13.69 Pedestrian routes lead to several major destinations in the 
Quarter through Fairfield Halls, the Clocktower and Town Hall complex, 
the Minster and Surrey Street Markets through to the tramline which 
connects beyond to East Croydon Station and Purley Way. Public realm 
improvements should seek to enable improved connection to the historic 
Thomas Turner Path and to enhance pedestrian access through to Park 
Street.  
13.70 The street is named after the ancient medieval inn, The 
George that stood on the south-west corner opposite the Whitgift 
Almshouses. Given its central location, improving active frontages to 
bring out this history will help attract pedestrians into the North End 
Quarter, and improve passive surveillance.   
13.71 The internal arcade in the former Allders building 
previously provided a pedestrian through-route to George Street 
proposals for interim or early phase use of the building that re-utilises it 
and/or improves permeability and connectivity from George Street – 
northwards in a different manner will be welcomed and encouraged.  
                                            
136 As evidenced in Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study – Kings Cross 
London   13.72 The provision of interim and short-term uses are proven to 
be successful ways to test new activities and uses for existing 
buildings137. The former Allders building has a rich history of incremental 
development and innovation which should be celebrated and enhanced 
as part of new phased development of the building. This can include a 
medium term precursor phase that in turn informs longer term use and 
development proposal for the building.  
137 As evidenced in Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study – Renew 
Newcastle, Australia and The Department Store, Brixton, the Meanwhile 
Programme programme in Croydon Town Centre.  
473 
 Policy NEQ DM6 : Public realm in the North End Quarter 
To improve the function of the North End Quarter as a shared social and cultural platform  with healthy streets and public spaces , develop ment should 
increase the extent and quality of public realm by:  
a) Delivering public value and facilities for the borough’s diverse communities, demographics and needs, including but not limit ed to introducing play 
areas for families, public toilets and prov iding spaces and facilities for young people and the elderly;  
b) Include well designed streets, high quality and public spaces (indoor and outdoor)  incorporating  digital and smart city infrastructure that are 
inclusive; improve health and wellbeing; contribut e public facilities for the borough’s diverse communities, and provide opportunities for social and 
cultural life to thrive;  
c) Introduce a cohesive, welcoming and unique North End Quarter identity that responds to and enhances the heritage of the area throug h high 
quality hard and soft landscaping, green and blue grid infrastructure, street furniture, walking and cycling routes including cycle parking, lighting, 
seating and signage;  
d) Ensure ground floor uses are developed as an holistic part of the public real m that maximise active frontages, ensuring permeability and vibrancy, 
passive surveillance, safety and consolidated sustainable service arrangements;  
e) Deliver legible, safe and open east -west and north -south 24 hour public routes and connections through th e North End Quarter;  including new 
east-west routes (from Frith Road, North End through to Wellesley Road and beyond towards East Croydon to the east and Wandle Park  and Purley 
Way to the west); new north -south routes from the West Croydon area and Poplar  Walk to George Street; supporting further connectivity through the 
New Town Quarter to East Croydon Station and Fairfield Halls including safe 24 hour pedestrian routes linking the western sid e of Wellesley Road 
with Lansdowne Road and beyond; and  
f) Where p ossible, bringing forward public realm improvements in the short term to improve footfall and vitality.  
How the policy works 
13.73 The North End Quarter is the principal destination centre in 
Croydon, and its public realm needs to function as a shared social and 
cultural platform for all who work, visit and live in the borough and attract 
visitors from across Croydon and beyond. As such, the public realm of 
the North End Quarter needs to be exemplary; improving health and wellbeing, addressing the climate change emergency, and accessible to 
all. 
13.74 Due to the increase of housing in the North End Quarter, 
the public realm must also accommodate the diverse needs of the 
growing residential community with the provision of play areas for 
families with small children, spaces for neighbourly exchange and 
accessible outdoor space and seating for older populations.   
474 
 13.75 A generous and high quality public realm encourages 
people to stop, sit and socialise giving the space character and vibrancy. 
Providing a multi-layered public realm helps to create a space that 
supports diverse uses reflective of the culturally rich and varied 
population in Croydon.  
13.76 Early interventions and early delivery of public realm has 
proven to unlock opportunities for growth, development and further 
investments, building footfall and improving perception of an area. 
Further, it provides a mechanism and platform for meaningful public 
engagement which in turn leads to public buy in, sense of ownership 
and therefore the success and vibrancy of the area138. Public realm 
improvements can be considered as part of a new public-private 
partnership model. A high quality public realm supports active travel 
which is proven to be of health and economic benefit, increasing 
visitation and social exchange139. Understanding that both the public and 
private sector have much to gain from improved public realm with 
walkable sustainable places that add real value. There should be a 
compelling logic to pursue improvements through innovative public-
private partnership routes to unlock the Quarter. Early improvements to 
the public realm can take place in phases as parts of the quarter come 
forward for development. It can also include interim and precursor 
interventions within the Whitgift Centre to open up the urban block and 
iteratively build up a network of streets and public spaces. Examples of 
interventions that can be tested and will create a positive impact include 
but are not limited to removal of parts of the retrofitted roof structure, 
ground level creative interventions to create new social spaces.i  
13.77 The provision of digital and smart city infrastructure will 
ensure the area is future proofed and resilient; improving connectivity 
and flexibility of the public realm, addressing climate change and 
increasing its destination appeal. It can also help to address existing 
digital inequality within the borough and will support a knowledge 
                                            
138 There are good examples locally and from further afield that demonstrate 
these benefits and public value, e.g. Ruskin Square; Luchtsingel/Luchtpark in 
Rotterdam; Kings Cross; and more - Croydon Future Destination of Retail Study economy, education uses and an innovation hub within the North End 
Quarter.  
13.78 A cohesive public realm that stitches together the varied 
history of the North End Quarter will improve the general legibility and 
accessibility of the area for visitors. Historic buildings and sites of 
interest can be highlighted as unique landmarks through the area, 
through the introduction of signage and wayfinding, lighting, seating, 
public art, hard and soft-landscaping.  
13.79 A holistic ground floor strategy across internal and external 
spaces within the North End Quarter, will ensure the area is accessible 
and safe for all visitors, with an established front and back- of-house. 24-
hour active frontages will support pedestrian use and create natural 
passive surveillance, whilst coordinated service arrangements will 
ensure service vehicles and delivery services are efficient and discreet.  
13.80 Improved public routes to and through the North End 
Quarter will increase the safety and usability of the area as a 24 hour 
destination.  Night time uses are known to be diversifying, supporting the 
demand for a variety of night time uses such as sports and leisure 
facilities encourages active lifestyles while creating all hours activity that 
reinforces the areas role as the boroughs Metropolitan Centre. 
13.81 The North End Quarter has the best access to public 
transport links in the borough, and providing sustainable connections to 
transport links in the North End Quarter will improve car-free access 
across the borough. Enhancing the pedestrian link between the North 
End and the Eastern side of Wellesley Road will reconnect the areas 
severed by the road, connecting the Old Town and the New Town areas. 
Enhancing this connection to ensure the safe 24 hour movement 
139 http://content.tfl.gov.uk/street-appeal.pdf   
475 
 between these areas will help to improve access and increase vibrancy 
in the North End Quarter. 
13.82 The integration of materials and style that reflects the 
heritage of the area can be achieved through high quality hard and soft 
landscaping, street furniture, including lighting, seating and signage. 
Materials used should reflect the built environment as well as integrating 
native plantings. 
Policy NEQ DM7: Green and blue infrastructure  
As the are a is  deficient in green and blue infrastructure development should::  
a) Through innovative green and blue landscapes and interventions at all levels of developments, including streets and public sp aces, green roofs, 
green walls; productive landscapes and urb an agriculture, deliver enhanced biodiversity;  
e) Integrate sustainable urban drainage and permeable paving throughout the North End Quarter;  
f) Include urban farming in external and internal spaces where appropriate;  
g) Mitigate the impact of development through t he provision of tree planting and other green and blue infrastructure as part of an urban greening 
strategy and proportionate to its impact;  
h) Ensure maintenance of green and blue infrastructure is minimised in design;  
i) Ensure all walking and cycling interv entions include accessible and inclusive public amenity and facilities to cater to the borough’s diverse 
communities, demographics and needs; and  
j) Include walking and cycling links that connect people to the wider strategic routes, blue and green infrastruc ture through the town centre and 
beyond in a sustainable manner, improving health and wellbeing.   
476 
 How the policy works 
13.83 The North End Quarter is an urban setting currently 
characterised by large amount of concrete hardscaping and asphalt. 
Introducing green and blue infrastructure into the North End Quarter will 
provide multiple proven environmental benefits, reducing flood risk and 
improving storm water filtration as well as reducing the urban heat island 
effect, improving air quality and biodiversity. Measures like tree planting 
will reduce the ambient temperature at the ground level, improving 
thermal comfort.  
13.84 Green and blue infrastructure will enhance and connect to the 
wider green and blue grid in the borough to help facilitate a positive 
response to climate challenges, improving biodiversity and greening 
throughout the borough along with wider benefits captured in the Green 
Grid chapter. Blue infrastructure in this case refers to integrated 
interventions such as Sustainable Urban Drainage systems (SUDs), 
sustainable urban irrigation systems, rain gardens amongst others that 
enable a thriving sustainable green grid with circular benefits to the public 
realm and environmental qualities; however if proposed and appropriate it 
does not preclude decorative water features such as water fountains. 
Where interventions like decorative or play based water features are 
proposed as part of a high quality public realm design alongside a robust 
management and maintenance plan, these will considered and assessed on 
their own merit.  
13.85 Integrating sustainable green and blue infrastructure into 
the public realm will also have wider social and economic benefits, 
improving the attractiveness and amenity of active travel routes, 
shopfronts, restaurants and residential buildings. It is proven to have 
significant health and wellbeing benefits, increasing levels of physical 
activity and perceptions of safety. Additionally, this infrastructure will help support economic resilience and circular economy principles in the 
form of productive landscapes, efficient management of resources, 
reuse of buildings and supporting community-led initiatives.  
13.86 Green and blue infrastructure can be provided as part of 
existing building refurbishment as well as new development. It is proven 
to be an effective tool in regenerating buildings and connecting and 
creating new communities.  
13.87 Sustainable urban drainage (SUDs) is proven to be an 
effective way of reducing surface flooding and should be incorporated 
into all area proposals. Proposals that integrate these and restorative 
redevelopment such as daylighting former historic ponds where 
appropriate for public amenity would be supported.  
13.88 Existing trees have significant value and should be 
maintained and relocated if required, alongside new planting. A tree plan 
will be used to ensure development does not result in a loss of green 
amenity space. A robust tree plan encourages urban greening to help 
offset the environmental and social impacts of development. To support 
and improve biodiversity, plants should include species that are native to 
the area and be chosen in relation wider ecological corridors that 
connect to  nearby green grid assets such as Wandle Park, Queens 
Gardens and Park Hill Recreation Park. 
13.89 Maintenance of green grid infrastructure is essential to 
maximise its benefits. Overgrown green spaces, for example, can 
negatively contribute to perceptions of safety and sense of belonging. 
Consideration of ongoing upkeep costs should be included as part of the 
initial design process to ensure the sustainability and ongoing viability of 
the project.

 14. Transforming the Purley Way  
 
Where we are now 
 
 
14.1 The key issues that the borough faces in terms of the Purley 
Way are as follows;  
 With a long industrial heritage Purley Way remains the industrial 
and warehousing heartland of the borough and is strategically 
important for London as a whole. The area is home to around 600 
businesses and 115 artists, occupying nearly 706,000m2 of 
employment floor space and providing approx.10, 000 jobs.  
 The majority of businesses are Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs) comprising 0-9 employees. There is also an emerging 
cluster of creative industries and, given its strategic location relative 
to central London and Gatwick Airport and road connections, a 
growing number of logistics, storage and distribution businesses.   
 The area is a significant out- of-town shopping and leisure 
destination and includes a large number of ‘big box’ low-rise retail 
buildings. Shopping habits and how people consume leisure and 
cultural experiences is changing rapidly, accelerated by the COVID-
19 pandemic in 2020, and this is likely to affect demand for the 
mainly ‘big box’ shops, leisure and cultural infrastructure in the Area 
in the future.  
 The area includes established residential communities which 
has increased by about 7% over the last five years, more than 
double the rate of the borough as a whole.  
 There has been limited commercial development in recent 
years, yet demand for space was outstripping supply. Demand is also changing, as witnessed by the proposed Amazon distribution 
centre on a non-SIL designated site at Trojan Way.  
 The Purley Way (A23) corridor itself currently dominates and 
divides the area. It consistently has heavy traffic and relatively poor 
public transport along the corridor. It also has an unpleasant street 
environment, is noisy and suffers from poor air quality. This means 
walking and cycling are not attractive options at present.  
 The area has little tree cover, and the quality of buildings is 
generally poor. However, there are pleasant green oases and 
hidden gems including Wandle Park, Waddon Ponds and the River 
Wandle.  
 The area’s important industrial and social heritage is revealed 
through several listed and locally listed buildings. Buildings such as 
the locally listed power station chimneys and the Grade II listed 
Water Palace diving boards were operational in their original uses 
within living memory and as such hold particular local significance 
amongst older people.  
 Local engagement has revealed that the retail and leisure offer 
of areas such as Valley Park and the Colonnades have specific 
resonance for local young people, who enjoy socialising in these 
areas.  
  
478 
 Vision for the Purley Way 
The Purley Way (A23) will be transformed from a hostile and 
divisive road in to a green city street. It will integrate developments 
with important retail and industrial areas and existing communities 
in Broad Green & Selhurst and Waddon. Transformation will be 
organised around a cluster of three, new district centres and one 
neighbourhood centre, each with a clear purpose and character 
which responds and enhances positive elements of local character 
and the setting of heritage assets, and complements Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre, Purley Town Centre, the Beddington Lane 
industrial area and other places in Croydon and Sutton. 
 
Enhanced public transport links and services, including an 
improved Waddon Station and enhanced tram services, and 
additional health, child care, education and other community 
facilities will support new homes in these centres. The important 
economic role of the area and its thriving business community will be further strengthened and celebrated as an integral part of these 
mixed-use neighbourhoods. 
 
The road environment will be enhanced to encompass welcoming, 
high-quality public spaces, stitched together by a network of green 
and blue walking and cycling routes and opened-up sections of the 
River Wandle these will connect existing green spaces, central 
Croydon and the wider Wandle Valley. Together, these 
interventions will reinvent the area as a desirable, sustainable, 
healthy and attractive place to work, live and play and one which 
rises to the challenge of climate change and incorporating the 
highest environmental standards.

wellbeing.  
Strategic Objective 9:  Ensure the responsible use of land and 
natural resources and management of waste to mi tigate and adapt 
to climate change.  
 
Why this area will be transformed 
14.2 The potential to strengthen Purley Way transformation area’s 
role as a strategically important industrial location between central 
London and Gatwick, consolidate and reshape its retail offer and 
provide additional high-quality homes makes it a key component of 
the overall borough-wide spatial strategy. There is the opportunity 
to transform the area by giving it a coherent structure by breaking 
down the traffic corridor into a series distinctive centres which 
accommodate a range of uses to complement and better integrate 
existing residential and businesses areas.  
14.3 In terms of planning policy, the area has been divided in to 
‘areas for transformational change’ and ‘areas of urban evolution’.  
   
480 
 Figure14 .1 Areas for transformational change and areas of urban evolution 
   
 
481 
 ‘Areas for transformational change’ 
14.4 The following six areas will be the focus of growth and 
intensification where wholesale changes will take place in terms of 
land use mix, density and character.  
Table 14: Areas for transformational change 
Area of transformation  Strategic opportunities  
1. Valley Park Local 
Centre and environs  Valley Park is a gateway into 
Beddington industrial zone, and 
curre ntly accommodates a hub for 
leisure and big box retail. There is 
potential to consolidate these uses and 
mitigate large areas of car parking which 
currently make this area less pedestrian 
and cycle friendly. The area benefits 
from existing connectivity wit h Croydon 
Town Centre via tram links and has 
capacity to accommodate a variety of 
innovative housing models including 
self-build, custom -build, 
intergenerational, and community -led 
housing, along with intensification of 
industrial sites. The area’s industr ial 
heritage, including the Ikea chimneys 
(Local Designated Landmarks) are key 
contributors to its sense of place.  
  Area of transformation  Strategic opportunities  
2. Waddon Marsh Local 
Centre and environs  Waddon Marsh is primarily 
characterised by big box retail plots with 
large car parks which flank  both sides of 
the Purley Way (A23). The area benefits 
from existing connectivity with Croydon 
Town Centre via tram links as well as 
proximity to two historically rich and high 
quality green spaces – Wandle Park and 
Waddon Ponds. There is opportunity to 
strengthen the retail and employment 
offer by consolidating into a local centre 
which replaces car parking with active 
frontages, and accommodates new 
community uses, high quality public 
realm, and a variety of innovative 
housing models, co -located with reta il, 
leisure and industrial uses.   
482 
 Area of transformation  Strategic opportunities  
3. Fiveways Local  Centre 
and environs  Fiveways is currently dominated by a 
convergence of main vehicle routes 
which has resulted in insensitive 
transitions between character areas, 
and a lack of sense of place. The area 
does benefit from its proximity to 
Waddon Station which gives opportunity 
for increased density, as part of a 
newlocal centre for both existing and 
new residential communities. The centre 
could include the co -location of a variety 
of innovative housing model s with re -
provided retail, community and leisure 
uses, whilst celebrating the Waddon 
Hotel and Old Tithe Barn heritage 
assets.  
4. Waddon Way 
Neighbourhood Centre  Waddon Way is the southern gateway 
into Purley Way transformation area 
which accommodates a  range industrial, 
residential, leisure and recreational 
uses, including key local assets such as 
Croydon Airport and Purley Way Playing 
Fields. The convergence of multiple 
uses within the area presents a prime 
opportunity to provide a retail/leisure 
desti nation, co -located with family 
housing. The existing historical 
landmarks in this area should be 
celebrated and enhanced.  Area of transformation  Strategic opportunities  
5. Purley Way Corridor  The main road is currently noisy, dirty 
and harsh – with parts of it being 
identified as an Air Quality Focus Area. 
There is the opportunity to transform the 
quality of this space by turning the road 
in to a sustainable green urban street 
that unites rather than divides the Purley 
Way transformation area and 
encourages walking and cycling by 
reducing the impacts o f traffic.  
6. Strategic Industrial 
Land  The Purley Way transformation area 
contains three distinct sub -areas of SIL 
which provide vital employment space 
for the borough and the wider region. 
There is an opportunity to deliver 
intensification of employment  uses in 
these areas and better integrate them 
with other uses, whilst ensuring new 
adjacent uses do not prejudice the 
functionality of the SIL.  
 
‘Areas of urban evolution’  
14.5 The areas of urban evolution are the established mainly 
residential neighbourhoods around Euston Road, Waddon Road 
and Denning Avenue. The emphasis here will be on making sure 
that existing communities are integrated with and benefit from 
growth in the transformation area. Any change here will comprise 
relatively small-scale development and interventions that respond 
positively to and help evolve the existing character of these areas.  
  
483 
 How we are going to get there  
Policy PW SP1:Transforming the Purley Way 
PW SP1.1 The Purley Way transformation area will be transformed through developm ent opportunities, as well as, and including, public 
realm improvements, to be undertaken in a cohesive and coordinated manner, in accordance with the design principles set out i n the Purley 
Way Masterplan and Delivery Strategy SPD.  
Homes  
The Purley Way t ransformation area forms a significant part of the strategy to meet the housing needs of the borough so the Areas for 
Transformational Change should deliver up to 7,515 homes. This will be achieved by:  
a) Co-locating housing with other uses to make the best use of land, create vibrant mixed -use developments, improve personal safety, 
reduce the need to travel and help vitality and delivery;  
b) Ensuring that new housing is located and designed in ways which responds positively to existing and expected future envir onmental 
qualities of the area; and  
c) Ensuring that new housing does not compromise the integrity, operation, economic viability and effectiveness of industrial an d waste 
uses by requiring new housing to adopt the Agent of Change principles when designing development s. 
 
PW SP1.2 To ensure that public transport capacity in the area is sufficient to accommodate growth:  
a) From 2019 no more than 4,000 additional homes shall be consented in the Purley Way Transformation area in advance of detailed  
transport modellin g being completed to objectively assess the highway and sustainable transport measures needed to accommodate 
more than 4,000 homes and the implementation of associated further improvements to highway and sustainable transport capacity . 
 
Employment  
PW SP1.3 Development should strengthen the important role that the area plays in terms of business and enterprise, support Croydon 
Metropolitan Town Centre and other town centres in Croydon and Sutton and ensure no net loss of industrial and warehousing/di stributi on 
floorspace (B2/B8) and non -Town Centre Class employment generating E uses (light industrial, R&D within Strategic Industrial Land (SIL) 
over the plan period. This will be achieved by:  
a) Consolidating and safeguarding Strategic Industrial Land (SIL) for in dustrial, warehousing/distribution and non – Town Centre 
employment generating E Class uses (.i.e. light industrial, R & D)  as part of the 4 tier approach;  
  
484 
 b) Protecting existing industrial and warehousing/distribution floorspace and facilities, ensuring tha t businesses can operate on a 24 -
hour basis and ensuring that on land adjacent to SIL any permitted non industrial and warehousing/distribution uses/buildings  are located 
and designed accordingly to ensure industrial floorspace is not compromised;  
 
c) Encoura ging the intensification of all industrial stock and poor -quality industrial and warehousing/distribution floorspace and facilities;  
 
d) Supporting the retention, intensification and re -provision of cultural production space’ (industrial, warehousing, small -scale office use 
occupied by Creative Industries) in the streets around Wandle Park;  
 
e) Proposals will improve the environmental quality and safety of streets and public spaces within SIL, bringing forward public realm 
enhancements, improved streets and intro ducing more street trees and better lighting to connect the areas of SIL with the proposed 
Local and Neighbourhood Centres;  
 
f) Ensuring that there is a better range of small -scale ‘walk to’ services for industrial occupiers that support enterprise, such as 
workplace crèches and cafés;  
 
g) Encouraging the consolidation of retail and leisure uses at Valley Park, Waddon Marsh and Fiveways through permitting new Local  
Centres, convenience shopping, services and leisure that are small in scale and which focus on sup porting businesses, workers, and 
residents. These may have the potential to form new Local Centres during the life of the Local Plan in line with Policy DM 9. 
 
h) Adopting a ‘town centre first’ approach to all other town centre uses, encouraging comparison sho pping, large -scale commercial, 
leisure floorspace and offices to re -locate to Croydon Metropolitan Town Centre and District Centres;  
 
i) Creating a Waddon Way Neighbourhood Centre and allowing new small -scale convenience shopping and community uses to suppor t 
nearby business and residential communities.  
 
Urban design and local character  
PW SP1.4 The creation of distinctive Local and Neighbourhood Centres will help provide a stronger structure and sense of place for the  
area. This will be achieved by:   
485 
 a) Focusin g development and taller buildings in proposed Local and Neighbourhood Centres;  
b) Integrating these Centres with their environs, including existing industrial/warehousing, open spaces and residential areas, by new 
attractive green streets and routes that wil l enable the creation of more viable frontages;  
c) Transforming Purley Way (A23) into a pleasant, new city street which balances its important movement function with a sense of  place 
in the Local and Neighbourhood Centres it passes through and is fronted by high-quality buildings, spaces and trees which create 
attractive places and help improve air quality;  
d) Safeguarding and revealing the significance of existing landmarks, views and heritage assets (and their settings) and drawing  upon 
these assets to develo p attractive devel opment that responds to and is  integrated with the character of Broad Green & Selhurst and 
Waddon Places to enhance the identity of places along Purley Way (A23);  
e) Ensuring that development has a positive relationship with and provides na tural surveillance of streets, routes and spaces and that 
high-quality tree planting and landscaping helps ensure an attractive walking and cycling environment along heavily trafficked rou tes. 
 
PW SP1.5  To create a stronger structure and sense of place alo ng the Purley Way (A23) corridor (as defined within the masterplan)the 
following six design principles will be applied:  
a) Provide a street -based frontage for new buildings;  
b) Frame the street with buildings that establish a rhythm of rising and falling height along its length and avoid creating canyons where 
poor air quality could get trapped;  
c) Create separate perpendicular streets for residential access and service for employment areas either side;  
d) Establish parallel ‘quietways’ that provide priority for pedest rians  and cyclists, stitch together  development with existing 
neighbourhoods and provide high -quality amenity space; and  
e) Respond positively to adjacent development by ensuring back -to back, scale -to-scale and use -to-use relationships that support the 
succe ssful integration of uses and built form;  
f) Ensure developments  have a positive relationship with, and provides natural surveillance of, streets, routes and spaces  
 
Community facilities  
PW SP1.6 The council will ensure that additional homes and new business es and the good growth of the area incorporates sufficient 
additional social infrastructure to meet additional demands and integrate existing and new communities, especially earlier in  the plan period. 
This will be achieved by:  
a) Identifying the current need  and likely need for additional childcare, school places, community spaces, health and sports facilities for 
the Purley Way transformation area and borough wide, and allocating land accordingly and establishing appropriate monitoring and 
delivery mechanism s to ensure that provision keeps pace with population growth; and   
486 
 b) Locating additional facilities in Local and Neighbourhood Centres and improving connections so that they can be used by exist ing as 
well as future residents, businesses and visitors, whilst complementing and integrating with existing facilities and networks.   
 
Environment and Climate Change  
PW SP1.7 Growth within the transformation area will be expected to take advantage of the area’s proximity to the Beddington Energy 
Recovery Facility to al low the use of a low carbon heat source to its future residents and commercial users. To maximise opportunities to 
make a positive contribution to tackling climate change and to improve air quality, new major development will be required to  : 
a) Incorporate a  communal heating system powered by an appropriately located energy centre with sufficient space for a district heat 
substation  
b) Explore opportunities to include an appropriately sited soft wall to allow a connection to a future Beddington -Central Croydon District 
Energy Network (DEN).  
c) Ensure any green renewable energy technologies incorporated in developments  are compatible with a future connection to the DEN  
Green and Blue Grid & Open Space  
PW SP1.8 Transform the area into a much greener, more attractive  and better -connected place to support the expected levels of growth by 
requiring developments  to provide or otherwise contribute towards:  
a) The development of the Wandle Valley Regional Park;  
b) De-culverting the River Wandle and integrating the open river wit h developments , routes and spaces;  
c) Improving the attractiveness of green spaces and their ability to accommodate increased levels of activity;  
d) The provision of additional green space and public realm, particularly in that part of the area to the north of M ill Lane/Waddon Road, 
includ ing pocket parks and squares and  
e) Tree planting along Purley Way (A23) and other public highways, Innovative and generous landscaping and other green and blue 
features including rain gardens, living roofs, green walls and product ive landscapes that results in a net gain in biodiversity;  
 
Transport and Communication  
PW SP1.9 Working with landowners, developers, Transport for London, Network Rail and other stakeholders and securing provision and/or 
financial contributions towards i mproving the area’s walking and cycling, public transport, highway and parking infrastructure to ensure that 
the Purley Way transformation area has sufficient capacity to support the level of proposed growth and that it maximises the use of 
sustainable mod es of transport. This will be achieved by:   
487 
 a) Creating a network of attractive and safe walking and cycling routes that safely and conveniently connect developments  with shops, 
services and open spaces and reduce the severance effect of Purley Way (A23), the tramline, the railway and other roads;  
 
b) Enhancing public transport nodes (bus stops, tram stops and Waddon Station);  
 
c) Facilitating enhanced rail services and metroisation  at an improved Waddon Station;  
 
d) Facilitating additional tram capacity on the Wimbled on branch;  
 
e) Establishing Purley Way (A23) as a sustainable transport corridor by reducing ‘pinch points’ to secure wider footways, better  cycle 
lanes and better bus priority measures and enabling a potentia l extension of the tram network;  
 
f) Facilitating enh anced and/or new bus services along the Purley Way (A23) corridor;  
 
g) Supporting TfL with implementing improvements to the Fiveways junction and other improvements to other priority road junction s; 
 
h) Requiring development sites to make use of existing junctio ns to avoid adding additional turning movements and increasing 
congestion on the network;  
 
i) Improving and reducing the impact of deliveries and servicing by using Delivery and Servicing Plans to designate traffic rout es for 
new industrial, warehousing/distr ibution and retail developments;  
 
j) Incorporating Smart City and digital infrastructure to make networks and ser vices as efficient as possible; and  
 
k) Manage construction activities to minimise adverse impacts on traffic, business operations and residential a menity.  
 
Car parking standards  
PW SP1.10 In order to promote lower carbon forms of transport, decrease congestion on the borough’s highways and reduce the impact and 
level of car parking in development s, the following will be implemented:  
a) Existing and pro posed new (subject to consultation) Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs) across the whole Purley Way transformation 
area;   
488 
 b) All developments  on sites marked as ‘Short -term’ in Table 14.5 will be required to comply with the borough -wide car parking 
standards;  
c) All developments  on sites marked as ‘Medium -term’ in Table 14.5 will be required to comply with Purley Way Car Parking Standards 
1, as set out in  table 14.1, subject to CPZ's are existing or being implemented; and  
d) All developments  on sites marked as ‘Long -term’ in Table 14.5 will be required to comply with Purley Way Car Parking Standards 2, 
as set out in  table 14.2 , subject to CPZ's are existing or being implemented.  
Areas of urban evolution  
PW SP1.11   Growth in the ‘areas for transformational change’ will be  well integrated (physically, socially and economically) with existing 
residential and business communities in ‘areas of urban evolution’ by ensuring that:  
a) New employment space provides additional high -quality job and training opportunities for local peopl e and helps support the 
sustainability of the local centres;  
 
b) New community facilities are in locations that are convenient for existing communities;  
 
c) Improved and new walking and cycling routes connect neighbourhoods with improved public transport nodes a nd Local and 
Neighbourhood Centres;  
 
d) Proactive measures are taken to prevent additional traffic and overspill car parking;  
 
e) A secondary school on the Heath Clarke site is provided; and  
 
f) Improvements to Canterbury Road Recreation Ground, Wandle Park, Duppa s Hill Park, Waddon Ponds, Purley Playing Fields and 
Purley Way West are supported.

1. Character: A clear 
hierarchy of centres  
 Create new Local  
Centres and a 
Neighbourhood Centre to 
define new ‘places’  2. Use: Transitioning 
between uses  
 Gradual transition 
between uses  
 Introduce new mixed 
residential and 3. Form: Shaping the 
transformation area  
 Subdivide the area 
into a series of segments, 
rather than one 4. Connectivity: A 
connective tissue  
 Focus on public 
transport nodes  5. Environment: Green & 
Blue grid  
 Expand a nd improve 
the green and blue grid

  Define a distinctive 
hierarchy between the 
proposed Local and 
Neighbourhood Centres 
and the wider area  
 Embed new centres  
into existing communities  
 Enhance and draw 
upon positive elements of 
local character and 
heritage to define 
character of new centres  
 Ensure that the area is 
well connected with 
Croydon and Purley Town

and centres  
 Increase biodiversity 
and create habitat 
corridors  
 Improve existing green 
spaces, increase green 
space provision and high 
quality public o pen 
spaces  
 Introduce planting and 
trees along streets and 
boundaries to industrial 
areas.  
 
Why we have taken this approach  
Homes 
14.7  Based on a number of assumptions, capacity testing work 
carried out as part of preparing the Purley Way Masterplan SPD 
identified the potential to successfully accommodate up to 7,515 homes over the plan period. This housing is expected to be 
delivered over time and phased as follows:  
 Short-term – 1,288  
 Medium-term – 2,653  
 Long -term – 3,574  
  
494 
 14.8  The above expected level of growth is likely to increase the 
number of people living in the area over the plan period by between 
about 11,640 and 17,420. The need to make additional provision of 
physical, social, cultural, and green infrastructure to serve this 
bigger population and integrate with existing residential and 
business communities is addressed under a number of headings 
below.  
14.9 The co-location of housing with other uses will be required to 
make the best use of land, incorporate necessary additional social 
infrastructure, create vibrant mixed-use developments, improve 
personal safety, reduce the need to travel and help financial viability 
and delivery.  
 
14.10 The Agent of Change principle, as set out in London Plan 
Policy D13, will be applied to SIL and waste sites safeguarded in 
the South London Waste Plan (including those that are in Sutton) 
and ensure that new housing does not compromise the integrity 
and effectiveness of industrial and waste uses. 
14.11 The detailed location and design of new housing will have to 
respond positively to the existing poor conditions. For example, 
housing at ground floor next to Purley Way (A23) itself is very 
unlikely to be acceptable and single-aspect homes facing Purley 
Way or other noisy streets with poor air quality will be resisted and 
communal open space and play space will be expected to be 
carefully located in sheltered areas of developments.  
14.12 Developments will consider the existing Gypsy and Traveller 
site at Latham’s Way to ensure that the site integrates with the area 
                                            
140 Analysis of Census 2011 journey to work data 
2 22nd November 2021  as it changes and that residents living on the site feel part of and 
benefit from growth and investment.   
14.13 The Purley Way Masterplan SPD found that most residents 
travelling in the peak hour for work head towards central Croydon 
(either to destinations within central Croydon or travelling onward to 
central London)140. A smaller proportion travel west towards 
Wimbledon. Given this, TfL has estimated that there is sufficient 
capacity on the Wimbledon branch of the existing tram network to 
support 2,000 additional homes in the area141.  
14.14 Beyond this number, capacity on the existing tram network 
would need to be increased, either by longer trams or greater 
frequency, or both.  
14.15 Growth beyond 4,000 homes may require a range of 
additional improvements to highway and sustainable transport 
capacity, subject to modelling. Based on current housing delivery 
assumptions, the above infrastructure/frequency improvements 
would be needed in about 2032 (two years in to the long term). 
Whilst a specific package of measures to support the additional 
homes has not been identified, there is sufficient time for the 
council to work with developers, TfL, Network Rail and other 
partners to identify what is needed, how much it would cost and 
how this would be funded. To address these issues, the council, 
GLA and TfL are underway with the following during the short term 
(2022-2027): 
 Undertake detailed transport modelling (LBC/TfL/GLA and 
development partners) to objectively assess the highway and 
sustainable transport measures needed to accommodate more 
  
495 
 than 4,000 homes and taking account of delivery and viability, 
alongside the delivery of development across the borough, 
especially the Opportunity Area, and alongside the tram corridor 
and bus network across boroughs.   
14.16 Table 14.3 under the Delivery Strategy sets out an approach 
to prioritising the transport measures outlined above over the plan 
period. 
Employment 
14.17 There are three distinct sub-areas of SIL in the Purley Way 
transformation area:  
The Beddington Farm / Commerce Way SIL area currently 
accommodates around 115 businesses in around 160,000m2 of 
employment space. There is a greater proportion of manufacturing 
businesses in this sub-area, and a notable concentration of 
pharmaceutical activity. Sites are typically larger, and suited to 
stand alone warehouses and larger scale operators of logistics and 
distribution.  
The Factory Lane/ Whitestone Way SIL area includes the former 
gas works and Stubbs Mead Depot. Once the gasholders have 
been demolished, both of these areas have potential for 
intensification of employment floorspace to significantly increase 
employment and economic activity supported on the sites. The area 
also accommodates smaller-scale construction retail and over 100 
‘artists’ studios in the Grafton Quarter development.  
The Imperial Way sub-area includes particularly dense 
employment, accommodating 41% of all businesses in the 
transformation area, including 72% of all creative businesses. There is a higher proportion of small and light industrial floorspace 
here, which may be suited to multi-level and stacked industrial 
provision. Existing businesses and new arrivals will benefit from the 
amenity of the Waddon Way Neighbourhood Centre.  
 
14.18 It should be noted that the existing SGN gasholders site on 
Factory Lane (approx. 1.45ha) is designated as SIL, although the 
land is not currently used for industrial or warehousing/ distribution 
purposes. The planned demolition of the gasholders and levelling of 
the site will increase the amount of developable SIL. Assuming a 
plot ratio of between 50 and 65%, this site could accommodate 
between 7,250 and 9,430m2 of Business floorspace.  
 
14.19 The Purley Way Masterplan SPD estimates that potential 
intensification of SIL and new mixed-use development focused on 
Local and Neighbourhood Centres could result in around 1,750 
additional Full Time Equivalent (FTE) jobs over the plan period. 
Construction work will also generate additional temporary 
employment opportunities. The land use policies set out in this 
chapter should ensure that there is a diverse range of job 
opportunities, including jobs that drive up skills. The council will 
secure in-kind and financial contributions from developers in 
accordance with Local Plan policies SP3 to help maximise training 
and job opportunities for local people.  
 
14.20  The Purley Way Masterplan SPD sets out how potential 
changes to the SIL boundaries within the Purley Way can take 
place, in order to efficiently consolidate land uses, and increase 
opportunity for industrial intensification.
 
   
496 
 14.21 The proposed changes in the Purley Way Masterplan SPD 
are in accordance with London Plan Policies E5 and E7 and the 
Mayor of London’s guidance ‘Industrial intensification and co-
location through plan-led and masterplan approaches (November 
2018)’. Capacity testing undertaken through the Purley Way 
Masterplan SPD was based on an assumed no net loss of 
industrial, warehousing and distribution floorspace across the area 
based on a combination of the compensatory SIL intensification and 
co-location. 
14.22 The council will develop further evidence to support any 
release or designation of SIL, including viability testing and 
landowner engagement, at the next review of the Local Plan. 
14.23 The area currently provides relatively affordable rents for 
workspace and part of the Area is within Croydon’s Creative 
Enterprise Zone (CEZ) and there is a developing cluster of ‘cultural 
production space’ (industrial, warehousing, small-scale office use 
occupied by Creative Industries) in the streets around Wandle Park. 
In order to increase variety and economic resilience, the retention, 
intensification and re-provision of these uses will be supported. 
14.24 In order for the area to be successful and sustainable a 
series of New Local Centres in the area will be a focus for ‘main 
town centre uses142’ as part of consolidating and focusing high-
quality mixed-use development that ensures that the area is 
supported by Centres which are vibrant and attractive hubs for 
people to shop, socialise, work, live, go to school and access 
services. As the new Local Centres are not yet defined on the 
                                            
142 NPPF ‘main town centre’ uses definition: Retail development (including 
warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres), Leisure, entertainment facilities and 
the more intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, Policies Map (as their extent cannot be determined before they are 
built) a material consideration needs to be made to the Plan’s 
policies on out of centre development to allow the new Local 
Centres to develop. As the Local Centres are intended to provide 
essential services to new residents it is necessary to remove the 
restrictions on out of centre development for convenience retailing, 
services and leisure that is small in scale and commensurate to 
local needs when it is proposed in the broad area of one of the new 
Local Centres. For other town centre uses including larger scale 
convenience and comparison retailing Town centre first principles 
will be applied to the New Local Centres to prevent direct 
competition with Croydon Metropolitan Town Centre. The wider 
‘environs’ of these Centres will successfully link with their 
residential and industrial hinterlands. Here, appropriate and diverse 
business and residential uses will be the primary uses and 
attractive streets will help integrate existing and new residential and 
business communities.  
14.25 The new Neighbourhood Centre at Waddon Way will provide 
small-scale (less than 280m2) day- to-day shopping and services for 
the localised business and residential communities. This could 
include small-scale 24-hour shops and cafes to support shift 
workers and users of the Purley Way Playing Fields. 
14.26 The Policies Map identifies the wider ‘environs’ for the 
proposed Local and Neighbourhood Centres. The proposed 
Centres themselves will be defined in the next Local Plan, following 
discussions with land owners and prospective developers at pre-
application stage, as part of shaping specific proposals. As such, 
drive-through restaurants, bars and pubs, night-clubs, casinos, health and fitness 
centres, indoor bowling centres, and bingo halls); Arts, culture and tourism 
development (including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels 
and conference facilities).   
497 
 the policy shall not apply until detailed boundaries have been 
confirmed as part of a Local Plan review process.  
14.27 SIL and the new Local and Neighbourhood Centres will be 
well connected to support industrial intensification and ensure that 
people working in and visiting the area for business purposes have 
sufficient access to cafes, restaurants and other day- to-day 
services. 
Urban Design and Local Character 
14.28 Developments will safeguard the setting of designated and 
non-designated heritage assets in the area and in neighbouring 
areas of Croydon and Sutton including Croydon Airport, River 
Wandle and the IKEA Towers Local Designated Landmark. It will 
also frame and make a positive contribution to the designated 
Croydon Panorama from Purley Way Playing Field to Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre (landmarks NTL mast, the Town Hall Clock 
Tower in Katharine Street, No.1 Croydon and the Park Hill Water 
Tower).  
14.29 New buildings and open and public realm spaces will draw 
on the positive characteristics of Broad Green & Selhurst and 
Waddon Places and transform the quality of the built environment 
by adopting the five principles included in Policy SP2.6. Guidance 
for implementing this is set out in the Purley Way Masterplan SPD.  
 
14.30 In areas for transformational change, new buildings are 
expected to make the best use of urban land and optimise density. 
The four Local and Neighbourhood Centres will accommodate the 
taller buildings in the area, to reinforce and mark their role as the 
focus of use and activity and to aid wayfinding. Buildings that are 
adjacent to, and are in ‘areas of urban evolution’ should respect 
and respond positively to the height of existing buildings, ensuring 
development positively mediates transitions with lower density areas and responds to predominant height, in line with relevant 
borough-wide policies.  
 
Community facilities 
14.31 The Purley Way transformation area includes Kingsley 
Primary and Harris Primary Academy Schools and the Haling 
Manor High School and (just outside the area) the former St 
Andrew’s Secondary School. Planning permission has been 
granted for an additional 3-FE primary school at 91-93 Canterbury 
Road (18/03408/FUL, February 2019). The area also has a number 
of children nurseries and play groups. It is also home to Broad 
Green Library, Waddon Leisure Centre and commercial leisure and 
entertainment uses at the Colonnades, Valley Park (including VUE 
Cinema) and other locations. However, there are relatively few 
community, youth, and sports facilities and places of worship.  
14.32 The additional housing and population growth outlined under 
Homes above is predicted to result in between 730 and 1,090* 
additional Primary-aged children over the plan period (0 in the 
short-term, 170-260 in the medium-term and a further 540-830 in 
the long-term). In the medium-term, any projected increase in 
demand for primary school places is likely to be absorbed using the 
existing capacity within local schools. In the long-term, depending 
on actual levels of growth, there may be the need for additional 
primary school places in the area. This will be monitored by the 
proposed Growth Delivery Updates identified in the Infrastructure 
Delivery Strategy below.  If additional provision does prove 
necessary, a new 2FE primary school could form part of a new 
mixed-use development in the Waddon Marsh centre and environs, 
as identified in Site Allocation 332 (Superstores, Drury Crescent).  
 
  
498 
 14.33 The expected level of demand for secondary school places 
should be capable of being absorbed by the existing secondary 
schools, including the possible re-use of the site where St Andrews 
CE School that’s is located just outside the area (subject to 
agreement from the Southwark Diocesan Board of Education ), and 
the proposed additional secondary school on Heath Clark Duppas 
Hill (Site Allocation 16).  
 
14.34 Based on the Council’s adopted benchmark ratio of 1GP per 
1,800 people, the expected growth is likely to generate the need for 
an additional 6.5-9.7 Full Time Equivalent GPs. Given this, it is 
proposed to make provision for two health hubs of about 1,200m2 
each to cater for around 12 FTE GPs in total and associated 
services. The proposed mixed-use development in the new Local 
Centres and environs and Waddon Way Neighbourhood Centre 
provide a number of opportunities to incorporate health facilities 
and are detailed in specific site allocations (25, 125, 314, 316, 332, 
334, 349, 351 and 355).  
 
14.35 Additional facilities will generally be directed to the new Local 
and Neighbourhood Centres, where existing and new residents can 
best access them to help foster a united local community based on 
shared local facilities and experiences. 
 
Environment and Climate Change 
14.36 The orientation, layout and design of developments , 
particularly housing, should take account of the existing 
environmental constraints of the area, including noise and poor air 
quality. The Purley Way Masterplan SPD includes guidance on how 
developments could respond to and improve existing air quality 
conditions.  
14.37 The Council is investigating bringing forward a District 
Energy Network (DEN) to supply heating and hot water to the Croydon Growth Zone and the Purley Way transformation area. 
This would connect Purley Way and the Growth Zone with the 
Beddington Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) in nearby Beddington 
Lane, via a central energy centre in the Wandle Road car park site.  
 
14.38 Once established, a connection route for the supply and 
return pipes would provide opportunities for developments in Purley 
Way transformation area to connect with the DEN, either directly 
from one of the primary routes or via a secondary network, and to 
access low-carbon heat. To keep  this option open, the Council will 
require all ‘major’ development in the area to incorporate a 
communal heating system powered by an appropriately located 
energy centre, with sufficient space for a district heat substation 
(heat exchanger), with the energy centre incorporating an 
appropriately located ‘soft’ wall to allow for a connection to a future 
DEN.  
 
14.39 In addition to making provision for ‘clean’ energy in this way, 
developments will be expected to incorporate appropriate ‘low 
carbon communal or dis trict heating systems which are compatible 
with future connection to the proposed DEN. The River Wandle 
provides particular opportunities for developments that are near to it 
to use Water Source Heat Pumps.  
 
Green and Blue Grid & Open Space 
14.40 The area is particularly harsh, with very little tree cover or 
greenery. If its full potential is to be realised, it needs to be 
transformed into a more attractive, greener, more biodiverse place.  
14.41 The council supports the continued development of the 
Regional Park concept and will work with the Trust, the 
Environment Agency and other stakeholders to play its part in 
delivering the Wandle Valley Area Green Grid Framework  
499 
 developing a connected, cross-borough network of green spaces. 
As part of this commitment, the council will manage Wandle Park 
and Waddon Ponds and look for opportunities to connect these with 
other open spaces and de-c ulvert stretches of the River Wandle as 
and when development opportunities arise to secure connectivity, 
flood risk and biodiversity enhancements.  
 
14.42 Canterbury Recreation Ground, Duppas Hill Park and Purley 
Way Playing Fields provide much needed open space within the 
Purley Way transformation area, and are all in need of 
enhancement to increase their attractiveness and ability to 
accommodate increased levels of activity associated with the 
expected increase in residential population. The council will seek to 
improve these spaces, including incorporating additional habitats, 
and implement the Parklife project so that the Playing Fields 
become a high-quality sports-hub (Site Allocaton152). 
 
14.43 The council will seek to secure additional high-quality 
publicly accessible green open spaces and areas of public realm as 
part of development schemes wherever possible, particularly in that 
part of the area to the north of Mill Lane/Waddon Road where there 
is a current lack of open space.  
 
14.44 In accordance with London Plan Policy G5 (Urban Greening 
Factor) and borough-wide policies, the Council will ensure that 
developments maximise opportunities to include green 
infrastructure to help reduce water run-off and the heat island 
effect, improve air quality, deliver a net gain in biodiversity, offer 
opportunities to grow food, improve the attractiveness of the area 
and contribute to the health and well-being of people living, working 
and visiting the area. 
 14.45 The Council will invest in public realm and lighting 
improvements across the Purley Way Transformation Area 
potentially through planning obligation receipts and beyond site 
specific requirements of schemes to create attractive and safe 
green links. These may include:  
a) Providing additional local connections to support Areas for 
Transformational Change and linking these with existing and 
proposed community facilities and green spaces.  
b) Providing a network of high-quality pedestrian routes connecting 
Local and Neighbourhood Centres and their environs to public 
transport nodes and destinations in neighbouring areas.  
c) Using de-culverted and naturalised sections of the River Wandle 
to provide walking and cycling routes. 
 
14.46 Key priorities for the green links will include:  
a) Additional north-south connections to provide alternative routes 
to Purley Way (A23) and east-west connections in the northern 
part of the area to provide quieter walking/cycle routes.  
b) Improved pedestrian infrastructure along strategic east-west 
connections with Stafford Road/Denning Avenue, Mill 
Lane/Waddon Road to provide better connections with Croydon 
Local Centre.  
c) Additional and improved crossings on Purley Way (A23) at key 
locations, located and designed to reduce severance and 
support public transport nodes and cycling connections.  
d) Improved, signed local links to promote active travel choices to 
access health, education, green spaces etc.  
e) Site specific routes in collaboration with landowners and 
developers to include new /improved footways and footpaths 
through development sites, plus upgraded areas of public realm 
on Purley Way and other key roads around development sites 
and more broadly within Local/Neighbourhood Centres.  
   
500 
 Transport and communication  
14.47 The Purley Way Masterplan SPD includes detailed strategies 
and guidance for improving walking and cycling infrastructure in the 
area. The Council will use the Development Management process 
to ensure that developments have a positive relationship with and 
provides natural surveillance of streets, routes and spaces and that 
high-quality tree planting and landscaping helps ensure an 
attractive walking and cycling environment along heavily trafficked 
routes.  
14.48 A series of interventions will be made to make public 
transport the easy choice for getting to, from and around the area, 
including a combination of the following:  
a) Creating a sustainable transport corridor, with a spine formed of 
a major new high-quality public transport route,  
b) Promoting the role of public transport nodes (bus stops, tram 
stops and Waddon Station) as mobility hubs and special places, 
located to support efforts to create or strengthen 
Local/Neighbourhood Centres  
c) Reducing walking times from across the area to public transport 
nodes  
 
14.49 The above measures coupled with improvements to enhance 
walking catchments for rail, tram and bus aim to ensure that all 
‘areas for transformation’ are within a maximum five-minute walk to 
a bus and/or a ten-minute walk from a tram stop or Waddon 
Station.  
 
14.50 At Waddon station the existing poor-quality station building is 
set back from Purley Way (A23), accessed by poor quality public 
realm and only provides step-free access for the westbound 
platform. The council will work with Network Rail/TfL and 
landowners to improve accessibility with a strong presence on the Purley Way (A23) either in advance of or as part of redeveloping 
the low-density retail/restaurant uses around it. This is addressed 
further in Site Allocation 110 (Old Waddon Goods Yard).  
 
14.51 The Brighton Main Line and East Croydon Transformation 
Corridor chapter explains the current context regarding the Croydon 
Area Remodelling Scheme (CARS). The Council will also work with 
TfL to support bringing forward the proposed ‘metroisation’ of rail 
services in South and South East London.  
 
14.52 The Council will work with TfL and landowners/developers to 
turn Waddon Marsh in to a key public transport hub, including 
improving the link from Purley Way and interchange with buses, 
creating a sense of entrance and arrival at the tram stop with a 
public space, integrating micro mobility and drop-off space into the 
area so that it becomes a mobility hub and redesigning the 
forecourt area as a distinctive and welcoming station plaza.  
 
14.53 As a first step to creating a high-quality public transport 
corridor – and as an alternative should a tram extension not come 
forward in the foreseeable future, the Council could support the 
creation of a rapid bus corridor subject to modelling, with a series of 
bus ‘superstops’ at the same locations as the tram stops. The 
Council supports the provision of demand responsive bus services.  
14.54 There are a number of relatively narrow sections of Purley 
Way (A23) which act as ‘pinch points’ that create congestion for 
traffic and poor-quality conditions for pedestrians, cyclists and 
buses. These are identified in Figure 14.4 below.  
14.55 The council will seek to explore possible widening of the 
carriageway and/or footway of Purley Way (A23) to secure 
improvements for sustainable modes of transport – including wider  
501 
 footways/shared walking/cycling routes, designated cycle lanes for 
cycling, bus lanes and/or space for a future a possible tram 
extension. The council will proactively work to identify and secure 
opportunities to remove these pinch points and widening the corridor whilst maintaining strategic traffic movement. These 
include entering in in to Section 106 and/or Highway Agreements to 
secure additional land and financial contributions towards the costs 
of implementing schemes.
   
502 
 Figure14 .4 Purley Way Pinch Points 
 
503 
 14.56 The council will continue to work with TfL and other 
stakeholders to explore the aspiration and need for a new tram 
extension along Purley Way (A23) to Purley and Coulsdon, with a 
series of stops located to support the proposed Local and 
Neighbourhood Centres in the area linked to the level of Croydon is 
expected by the Mayor to accommodate.  
14.57 Traffic congestion and capacity is a key issue in the area. 
The strategic nature of the Purley Way (A23) means that the vast 
majority of trips are longer distance [1], and the road is vital for 
serving the many industrial and retail businesses in the area. The 
potential on-street public transport improvement and better 
pedestrian and cycle crossing facilities called for above are likely to 
introduce additional capacity constraints.  
 
14.58 Whilst the land use strategy outlined above and 
implementation of borough-wide transport and Purley Wa y 
transformation area parking policies and standards will help reduce 
additional car trips, the transformational change called for in the 
vision for the area will, unavoidably, create some additional 
highways trips. Focussed highways improvements, subject to 
modelling,  on the following key junctions and links where capacity 
is most constrained, while integrating healthy streets measures to 
better accommodate walking and cycling, as well as urban realm 
that supports enhanced place amenity and character:  
(a) Fiveways area improvements (including the junctions of 
Croydon Road/Purley Way and Epsom Road/Duppas Hill 
Road/Stafford Road)  
(b) Duppas Hill and Croydon Way junction  
(c) Mill Lane/Waddon Road/Purley Way  
(d) Drury Crescent/Commerce Way  
 14.59 The council could also bring forward traffic management and 
calming measures to reduce any displacement of traffic from Purley 
Way (A23) on to other streets in the area, surrounding Places and 
neighbouring Sutton. These include investigating the potential to 
reducing some or all of the area to 20mph, and designing the local 
road network in accordance with the aim to create low-speed, safer 
and more attractive streets that support the Mayor’s Vision Zero 
goal which aims to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries on 
London’s transport network by 2041. 
 
14.60 There are already many LGV/HGV trips along the Purley 
Way Corridor (A23) due to existing uses, and these will only 
increase with the anticipated growth and committed development in 
the adjoining Beddington Lane Industrial Area. An area-wide 
strategy for servicing will be developed and implemented by 
Delivery and Service Plans secured as part of granting planning 
permissions for new ‘major’ development.  
Car parking standards 
 
14.61 In order to promote lower carbon forms of transport, not 
increase congestion on the borough’s highways and reduce the 
impact of car parking in developments, the council could, subject to 
consultation, implement Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs) across 
the whole area. When a Controlled Parking Zone is in place s.106 
Agreements will be used to prevent residents/business in 
developments from parking on nearby streets, the council intends to 
carry out consultation and design work in the short term and 
implement approved CPZs in the short and medium terms, 
prioritising those areas.  
 
14.62 In tandem with implementation of improvements to the 
walking and cycling network and public transport capacity, set out 
under Transport Infrastructure below, on-site car parking standards  
504 
 will need to become increasingly restrictive over time. They will 
reduce relative to the implementation of associated improvements 
to public transport capacity, the proposed PTAL of different parts of 
the area and the implementation of on street car parking controls. 
This will help to reduce the impact of car trips in the area.  
 
14.63 The council will apply borough-wide cycle parking standards 
to developments in the area and ensure that short and long-term 
cycle parking is located in convenient locations and that other 
facilities (including lockers and showers) are provided as part of 
new major employment/mixed-use developments.  
 
14.64 In line with government policy and practice guidance, the 
Purley Way Transformation Area provides an opportunity to identify 
the short, medium and long-term transport proposals across all 
modes that are needed to ensure sustainable travel behaviour. It is 
important that walking and cycling infrastructure, public transport 
and highway capacity serving the area is sufficient to accommodate 
the proposed level of growth and that it is available when it is 
expected to be needed. This is to ensure that growth is carried out 
in a sustainable way and does not lead to the existing public 
transport and/or highway networks being overwhelmed and unable 
to cope.  
 
14.65 The council will work with developers, TfL and other partners 
to secure funding to implement the walking and cycle route 
priorities identified in Figure 1 4.3 above, focusing in the short and 
medium term on improving connections to and from existing trams 
stops.  
 
14.66 The Council will work with land owners, developers and 
other stakeholders to seize the opportunity to integrate smart city technology, where digital communication is maximised to make 
networks and services more efficient. This includes:  
 Shared mobility – the Council working with car club providers 
and others to include provision Car Club spaces and facilities for 
bike and scooter sharing, taxi and private hire services and 
micro -transit services;  
 Electrification of vehicles - the Council requiring the provision of 
Electric Vehicle Charging Points in a ll ‘major’ developments, in 
accordance with the policy and also making provision for on -
street charging for car club cars, taxis etc.;  
 Mobility hubs – the Council working with TfL and others to 
enhance existing and proposed public transport nodes so that 
they become hubs, with enhanced facilities and information;  
 Connected and autonomous vehicles – build flexibility in to the 
design of parking and public spaces so that they are able to 
accommodate these vehicles in the future  
 Cycle freight – make provision for storage of e -cargo bikes in

 Encouragement of Drop -off Boxes for internet deliveries and 
allowing for future drone and autonomous deliveries; and  
 Integrating Smart City and digital infrastructure within the wider 
publi c realm.  
Infrastructure Delivery Strategy  
14.67 The anticipated level of growth in the Purley Way 
transformation area over the plan period is indicative only. The 
degree of certainty over the level of growth diminishes over the 
short, medium and long-terms. Growth in the first five-years is 
‘deliverable’ as defined by the NPPF. However, growth in the 
following years is ‘developable’ as defined by the NPPF. In addition, 
whilst all of the identified transport and open space and green grid 
measures are needed for the expected indicative growth scenario  
505 
 of up to 4,000 homes in the short to medium term, and further 3,515 
homes in the long term (a total of 7,515 homes over Local Plan 
period), social infrastructure and local services will respond to 
demand thresholds in the population growth.  
 
14.68 In addition, public sector delivery agencies (including the 
council, TfL, Network Rail and NHS) operate on three to five-year 
planning cycles and it would be misleading to pretend that 
infrastructure can be mapped out over a 20-year period with any 
degree of certainty.  
 
14.69 Such updates can feed in to the council’s Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan and Local Plan reviews, to inform future policy 
development. Table 14.3 seeks to summarise the proposed 
approach.

 Detailed policies
Policy PW DM1 : Area around Lombard Roundabout  
PW DM1.1 In the area of the Lombard Roundabout, to facilitate growth and to enhance the distinctive character of the Lombard Roundabou t 
area proposals should:  
a) Complement the existing predominant bui lding heights of 3 storeys up to a maximum of 6 storeys;   
b) Create a sense of continuity by setting back buildings from the street and create building lines and frontages which positive ly 
reference and respond to the junction;   
c) Address the deficiency in gree n infrastructure within the area by incorporating tree planting and greenery within the development; and   
d) Retain the extent and enhance the quality of the existing public realm within the development, including introducing large tr ees and 
other vegetation to balance the impact of large or tall buildings.  
 
How the policy works 
14.70 This is an area at the edge of two character types that 
contrast in scale. These are ‘Terraced Houses and Cottages’ and 
‘Large Buildings with Continuous Frontage Line’. The area has 
potential for growth. The Place-specific development management 
policy is required to facilitate growth that enhances the distinctive 
character of the Lombard Roundabout Area.  14.71 These policies will encourage developments to 
establish a transitional zone between the existing uniform low-rise 
residential areas and the larger scale structures around the 
Lombard Roundabout. 
Polic y PW DM2: Potential new Local Centre at Valley Park  
PW DM2.1 Proposals that promote the potential creation of a new Local Centre at V alley Park will be supported during the life of the Plan in 
line with the Purley Way Master Plan, if the following requirements are met:   
508 
 a) The new centre should straddle Ampere Road and provide a focus around Ampere Road tram stop (precise boundaries to be 
determined);  
b) The new centre explores opportunities to consolidate, enhance existing retail and leisure uses with additional housing and th e wider 
environs should provide scope for and intensification of industrial, warehousing and distribution uses;  
 
c) Building heights of development within the Centre and environs should generally be in the order of 3 -8 storeys, with focal point 
accents at gateway locations;   
 
d) Proposal should enhance the setting of the IKEA chimneys by delivering high quality development an d public realm interventions; and  
 
e) Development opportunities including public realm improvements should be e undertaken in a cohesive and coordinated manner and  
create a new Local Centre with a sense of place and distinct character. The Purley Way Masterpl an SPD provides guidance on the 
creation of a new Centre and a wider area of focused change (its environs).    
How the policy works 
14.72 The mix of uses in the Valley Park area presents an 
opportunity to improve public realm connections, densify uses, 
and encourage a 24/7 economy inviting a mix of participants. The 
popularity of Ikea/Valley Park as a retail and leisure heart of the 
wider region should be preserved, albeit with a radical re-thinking 
of the car-centric land use pattern.  
14.73 Attractive public realm and densified retail/leisure 
uses with active frontages will create a walkable retail centre and 
encourage use of sustainable modes of transport. Connectivity to 
Ampere Way tram station on both sides will be seamless, safe and 
clearly signposted to also encourage use.  
 
14.74 The area has been identified as having capacity for 
new housing, which would intensify use across the site and mitigate the negative impact of large areas of car parking. To 
ensure co-location of other uses with residential is successful, 
privacy and well-designed amenity for residents in the area, 
notably the northern neighbourhood, is a priority. The twin IKEA 
chimneys, as important markers of character for Croydon, must be 
retained and celebrated to enhance sense of place.  
 
14.75 Towards the south of this area, larger sites offer the 
opportunity to accommodate industrial employment uses adjacent 
to the SIL in Beddington, and to offset de-designation SIL 
elsewhere in the wider Purley Way transformation area. This is 
essential to improving cohesion between uses and character 
across the Purley Way transformation area, whilst also 
strengthening the attractiveness of the area for businesses to 
locate there.  
  
509 
 Policy PW DM3: Potential new Local Centre at Waddon Marsh  
PW DM3.1 Proposals that promote the  potential creation of a new Local Centre at Waddon Marsh will be supported in line with the Purley 
Way Master Plan, if the following requirements are met:  
a) Excellent transit connectivity and proximity to amenity and industry locations are opportunities to create an attractive locality to live, 
work, shop and socialise;   
b) The new centre should be located on the east side of Purley Way and be focussed around Purley Way itself and the Waddon Marsh  
tram stop (precise boundaries to be determined);  
c) The new centre  should consolidate and enhance existing retail uses and include new housing, social infrastructure and green open 
space; and  
d) Buildings heights of development in the Centre and environs should generally be in the order of 3 -8 storeys, with focal point acce nts 
at gateway locations.   
 
How the policy works 
14.76  A new local centre around Waddon Marsh tram 
station, with high quality public realm interventions, will create an 
attractive locality to live, work and shop. This opportunity arises 
from excellent transit connectivity, emerging local centre 
characteristics surrounding the Sainsbury’s store, and proximity to 
amenity and industry.  
14.77 In tandem with envisioned reduced car use and 
increased density, there is an opportunity to replace large tracts of 
parking with active retail frontage and public amenity which will 
improve the environment for both pedestrians and cyclists. Mid- to 
high-rise residential uses, co-located with retail, industry and 
leisure, especially in the immediate vicinity of Waddon Marsh 
station, will help to establish the character of the local centre.  14.78 High-quality industrial zones with well-utilised land 
area and sensible servicing routes will strengthen the area as an 
attractive destination for businesses to locate. Green spaces are 
to be enhanced through interventions such as the deculverting of 
Wandle River and the creation of pocket parks. Interventions to 
enhance the network of green spaces, will be needed to 
accommodate increased activity in the area, and improve 
connectivity as part of the wider Green Grid. 
  
510 
  
Policy PW DM4: Potential new Local Centre at Fiveways  
 Proposals that promote the potential creation of a new Local Centre at Fiveways will be supported during the life of the Plan  in line with the 
Purley Way Master Plan, if the fo llowing requirements are met:  
a) The convergence of multiple uses within the area presents a prime opportunity to provide a retail/leisure destination, with a  
substantial user catchment at all times of the day;  
b) The new centre should be focused around the Five ways junction and include the existing Waddon Leisure Centre and Waddon 
Station (precise boundaries to be determined);  
c) The new centre could consolidate and enhance existing retail and leisure uses and include new housing, social infrastructure and 
green op en space;  
d) Building heights of developments  in the Centre and environs should generally be in the order of 3 -8 storeys, with focal point accents 
at gateway locations; and  
e) Proposals should seek to enhance the setting of the Grade II listed Old Tithe Barn by delivering high quality development and public 
realm interventions adjacent to it.  
How the policy works 
14.79 Fiveways junction is crucial to characterise the local 
centre. The high transport connectivity gives the opportunity for an 
increased density, specifically by co-locating mixed-use buildings 
with mid-to high-rise residential elements with re-provided retail, 
community and leisure uses. In tandem with improvements to the 
road layout, which will alleviate congestion and encourage 
walking, public realm improvements to the area has the potential 
to create a bustling local centre. Attractive public realm, such as public furniture and an unobstructed station forecourt would form 
the basis for street activity.  
14.80 Given the high transport connectivity, there is latent 
potential to increase density of development, specifically by co-
locating mid- to high-rise residential uses with reprovided retail, 
community and leisure functions.  
14.81 Developments must be stitched in with the public 
realm and existing green amenity, with attention to fostering  
511 
 community, forming a network of active and green spaces 
surrounding Fiveways.  
14.82 Due to the complexity of these issues and the number 
of development opportunities the Purley Way Masterplan SPD 
helps to coordinate development within this area to ensure it is 
undertaken in a coordinated and cohesive way while retaining 
Waddon’s sense of place.  
Policy PW DM5: Potential new Neighbourhood Centre at Waddon Way  
Proposals that promote the potential creation of a new Neighbourhood Centre at  Waddon Way will be supported during the life of the Plan in 
line with the Purley Way Master Plan, if the following requirements are met:  
a) The new centre should be on both sides of Purley Way;  
b) A Development should seek to  consolidate and enhance the existin g retail and leisure uses within this centre, with particular 
emphasis on serving the business community, and include new housing and green open space;  
c) The building heights of developments  in the Centre and environs should generally be in the order of 3 -8 storeys, with focal point 
accents at gateway locations; and  
d) Proposals should seek to enhance the setting of heritage assets including Croydon Airport and the former lido diving board by  
delivering high quality development and public realm interventions  
How the policy works 
14.83 The convergence of multiple uses in the Waddon Way 
area presents a ripe opportunity to provide a congregation of live, 
play and work functions on both sides of the Purley Way, with a 
substantial user catchment at all times of day.  14.84 Improvements to the Imperial Way business district 
and reprovision of existing hotels will cement Waddon Way as a 
centre for business and gateway into industries along Purley Way. 
Due to the smaller size of the plots the area is considered suitable 
for SMEs, innovation clusters and creative industries.  
  
512 
 14.85 Public transport improvements and increasing density 
are expected to be mutually supportive moving forward, freeing up 
car parking space and consolidation of retail and leisure uses, 
enabling increased density.  14.86 The concentration of historical landmarks in the area 
including Croydon Airport significantly contribute to its character. 
Therefore, it is vital that high quality development and public realm 
interventions celebrate and enhance these local heritage assets.  
Policy PW DM6: Purley Way Corridor  
 The existing harsh and unattractive road corridor will be transformed by:  
a) Taking opportunities to remove pinch points (identified in Figure 14.4) to provide space for sustainable modes of travel – walking, 
cycling, bu ses and a possible tram;  
b) Incorporating high -quality pedestrian and cycle crossing points at key locations to reduce severance and increase connectivity;  
c) locating and designing buildings and spaces in ways which provide active frontages to the street;  
d) locat ing and designing buildings and spaces that include measures to improve  air quality, reduce creation of wind corridors and rough 
urban surfaces, break down any street canyon, orientate street canyons parallel to wind, promote air circulation around base buildings,  
e)  prevent local inversions and locate sensitive uses away and upwind from emissions and away from the pollution source; and  
f) Building heights along the corridor, outside of Town and Neighbourhood Centres and their environs, should be 3 to 8 storeys.  
How the policy works 
14.87 There is a great opportunity to transform the Purley 
Way into a green, pleasant city street and sustainable transport 
corridor. The street should mark a positive relationship with the 
Local and Neighbourhood Centres that it passes through, making 
sure it is fronted by high-quality buildings, spaces and trees which 
create attractive places and help improve air quality.  14.88 New pedestrian connections and public space 
improvements will reduce the severance between both sides of 
the Purley Way. The new city street will accommodate enhanced 
bus services, pedestrian and cycle routes and potentially a future 
tram route, all of which will encourage the use of more sustainable 
modes of transport and alleviate pressure from the road network.  
14.89 The retention of Purley Way as a strategic transport 
and servicing route is vital for serving the many industrial, 
warehousing and distribution and retail businesses in the area.   
513 
 Policy PW DM7: Strategic Industrial Locations  
The areas of SIL are strategically important industrial, warehousing and distribution areas which must be used and developed in the most 
efficient way. Developments  should:  
a) Support the intensification  and overall uplift  of industrial, warehousing and distribution floorspace to maximise t he economic contribution 
to the area, safeguard these functions by taking account of new housing being introduced in to the wider area and mitigate ad verse impacts 
on the area’s road network from additional traffic;  
 
b) Deliver active frontages on to route s, to make active travel and use of public transport as attractive as possible for employees;  
 
c) If creating internal routes these should facilitate good connections with Town and Neighbourhood Centres and their environs, in order to 
integrate industrial,  warehousing and distribution uses with the uses and services that these areas provide; and  
 
d) Facilitate a step -change in quality of public spaces and street frontages throughout the SIL by following urban design principles outlined in 
the Purley Way Mas terplan.  
How the policy works 
14.90 The SIL along Purley Way must be supported and 
nurtured so that they can thrive as dynamic business locations. 
Key physical measures will include making streets safer and more 
attractive to use, so that more people working in and visiting 
business settings choose to walk, cycle and use public transport. It 
is also important that these business areas are integrated with 
nearby Local and Neighbourhood Centres, so that employees and 
visitors can take advantage of services that they offer.  
14.91 Opportunities to intensify use of the SIL areas by 
increasing industrial floorspace and potentially introducing multi-
level accommodation will allow the area to support new jobs as 
the town centres and their environs evolve.   
514 
 Policy PW DM8: Site allocations  
PW DM8.1 Within the Purley Way transformation area allocate sites for development as set out in Table 14.5. 
PW DM8.2  To ensure that public transport capacity in the area is sufficient to accommodate growth:  
a) Only sites marked as ‘Short -term’ or ‘Medium -term’ in Table 14.5 shall be built and occupied in the area in advance of detailed 
transport modelling to objectively assess the highway and sustainable transport measures needed to accommodate more than 4,00 0 
homes and the implementation of ass ociated further improvements to public transport capacity  
How the policy works 
14.92 Table 14.5 below sets out the proposed use on 
specific sites in Purley Way transformation area. The location and 
boundary of each detailed proposal can be found on the Policies 
Map and further details including indicative phasing and indicative 
number of homes (if applicable) can be found in Appendix 7. 
These site allocations sit alongside those for the wider Broad 
Green & Selhurst and Waddon Places and the safeguarded waste 
sites in the South London Waste Plan (September 2020).  
14.93 Table 14.5 also sets out the phasing for each sites. It 
is common ground with TfL that there is sufficient overall 
sustainable transport capacity to support 4,000 additional homes 
in the area. These sites are marked as short-term in Table 14.5.  
14.94 Growth beyond 4,000 homes could require a range of 
additional improvements to highway and public transport capacity. 
Any site marked as long-term in Table 14.5 is dependent, subject 
to modelling, on these additional improvements taking place 
before it can be developed.  14.95 The phasing of sites has been determined having 
regard to their capacity, and the need to create the new Local and 
Neighbourhood Centres in order to enable to creation of new 
communities in the area.

15. Delivering and Monitoring the Croydon Local Plan 2018
How we are going to deliver the Croydon Local Plan 2018  
15.1 The Croydon Local Plan 2018 has four main strands for its delivery:  
 Policy – national, regional and local planning policy 
 Legal – section 106 agreements, Compulsory Purchase Orders etc. 
 Partners – delivery via partnership projects 
 Resources – Council staff resources, capital spending by the Council or its partners, lottery funding etc. 
15.2 An Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) setting out the key locations, sites and infrastructure, which are essential for the successful 
implementation of the Strategic Policies forms part of the supporting evidence. 
15.3 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan is not repeated as a document in the Croydon Local Plan. The full infrastructure schedule within the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan is part and parcel of the Local Plan’s delivery and is a critical supporting document.  
15.4 Appendix 8 to this Plan sets out the full delivery matrix showing how each of the Strategic Policies will be delivered. The infrastructure 
required for the delivery matrix is set out in the full Infrastructure Delivery Plan report. 
How we will know if the Croydon Local Plan 2018 is being delivered 
15.5 It is important to know if and when any policy of the Plan is not being delivered as anticipated. Each Strategic Policy has a set of 
monitoring indicators setting out what the expected outcomes of the policy are. 
15.6 The indicators will be monitored on an annual basis and included in a Monitoring Report looking at the implementation of the Strategic 
Policies. Each indicator is set out in Appendix 9 to this Plan. 
15.7 A further series of indicators are contained within the Sustainability Appraisal report which accompanies the Strategic Policies. These 
indicators do not monitor specific policies but instead monitor the Plan as a whole by outlining areas in which it is expected to have an effect.  
521 
 Former Saved Unitary Development Plan policies 
15.8 Appendix 10 to this Croydon Local Plan 2018 sets out the policies in the former Unitary Development Plan (UDP) that were replaced by 
the Croydon Local Plan 2018.

 Appendix 1 – Glossary  
Accessibility 
How easy it is to enter or reach physically, including ease of use for 
disabled persons. See also Public Transport Accessibility Level. 
Affordable Housing 
Affordable housing is housing that is provided to meet the housing 
needs of households whose needs are not met by the private 
market. It can either be social rented housing, affordable rent ed 
housing or intermediate affordable housing. 
Social rented housing is rented housing owned and managed by 
local authorities and registered providers of social housing, for 
which guideline target rents are determined through the national 
rent regime, and which is made available to eligible households 
nominated by the Council. 
Affordable rented housing is rented housing provided by registered 
providers of social housing which is similar to social rented housing 
except that it is outside the national rent regime, but is subject to 
other rent controls that require it to be offered to eligible households 
at a rent of up to 80 per cent of local market rents.  
Intermediate affordable housing is housing at prices and rents 
above those of social rent but below market price or rents, and 
which meet the needs of eligible households including availability at 
a cost low enough for them to afford, determined with regard to 
local incomes and local house prices and include provisions for the 
home to be retained for future eligible households or for any 
subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision. 
These can include shared equity and shared ownership homes for sale, and intermediate rent, but does not include affordable rented 
housing. 
Starter homes are homes for which 100% of the equity is sold at 
first point of sale but which are discounted so that the maximum 
price is the lower of 80% of the market value of the property or 
£450,000. They are not affordable in perpetuity and after a number 
of years may be sold at full market value. Potential purchasers must 
be first time buyers and meet other pre-defined criteria. 
Affordable Workspace  
Is workspace that is provided at rents maintained below the market 
rate for that space for a specific social, cultural, or economic 
development purpose. 
Airport City 
This seeks to promote businesses and employment opportunities 
which capitalise on Croydon’s proximity to Gatwick, Heathrow, 
London City and Biggin Hill Airport s and central London. 
Amenity 
The experience of a place as pleasant or attractive, which 
contributes  to its overall character and to the enjoyment of residents 
or visitors; or something that contributes to an area’s 
environmental, social, economic or cultural needs. 
Archaeological Priority Areas 
Areas that are known to be of archaeological importance because 
of past finds, excavations or historical evidence. 
Biodiversity 
The variety of species of flora and fauna.  
524 
 Biodiversity Action Plan 
A plan of action for protecting, conserving and enhancing wildlife at 
a local level. The UK signed up to the Biodiversity Convention at 
the 1992 Rio ‘Earth Summit’. This confirms the UK’s commitment to 
protecting and enhancing wildlife. The UK Biodiversity Steering 
Group has emphasised the importance of Local Biodiversity Action 
plans. In 2013 Croydon’s Biodiversity Action Plan consisted of four 
Habitat Action Plans. 
Borough Character Appraisal  
An analysis and assessment of every residential neighbourhood in 
the borough to determine the predominant type of housing and 
architectural form, together with other physical and natural features 
that give each area its distinct character. 
Brownfield  
Land that has been previously developed (excluding agricultural 
land or buildings, gardens, mineral works and temporary uses). 
Car Club 
An organisation that owns cars that are available for use by its 
members. People arrange to use the car in advance and pay 
according to how much they use it. The advantage is that people 
have cars available for use, but avoid many of the costs of runnin g 
a car as they only pay when they need to use it. 
Climate Change 
Long term alterations in weather patterns, in particular to 
temperature and precipitation. Anthropogenic climate change refers 
to a warming climate across the globe caused by the increase of 
levels of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere as a result of 
human activities. BREEAM 
Building Research Establishment’s Environmental Assessment 
Methodology (BREEAM) is used to measure the sustainability 
performance of commercial buildings. 
Cohesive Communities 
A society in which there is a common vision and sense of belonging 
by all communities. 
Combined Heat and Power system 
The generation of electricity by burning fossil or renewable fuels is 
relatively inefficient and produces a large amount of heat as a by-
product. Combined heat and power (or CHP) makes much better 
use of the original energy source (gas, diesel, coal, biomass, 
waste) as it captures the heat produced during electricity generation 
and supplies it via small or large networks for commercial or 
domestic recipients. This is because CHP generation makes 
efficient use of the original energy source by utilising two forms of 
energy output, therefore its product is considered low in carbon 
dioxide.  
Compulsory Purchase Order 
An order issued by the government of a local authority to acquire 
land or buildings for public interest purposes. For example, for the 
construction of a major road or the redevelopment of certain 
brownfield sites. 
Community Infrastructure Levy 
The Community Infrastructure Levy is a levy that local authorities 
can choose to charge on new developments in their area. The 
money can be used to support development by funding 
infrastructure that the Council, local community and 
neighbourhoods need to enable growth.  
525 
 Community Facilities 
Facilities providing for the health and wellbeing (excluding care 
homes, residential homes and nursing homes), social, educational, 
spiritual, recreational, leisure and cultural needs of the community, 
including public houses and post offices. 
Connectivity  
The degree to which a place is connected by routes to other places 
and its own parts are connected with each other. 
Conservation Area  
Areas designated by the Council under Section 69(1) of the 
Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as 
being of special architectural or historic interest, the character of 
which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. Conservation Area 
Consent is required for the demolition of unlisted buildings in 
Conservation Areas. 
Creative and Cultural Industries 
A sector of the economy characterised by businesses and 
organisations associated with higher levels of creativity and cultural 
activity, such as designers, artists, theatres and architects. 
Detailed Policies and Proposals 
The Detailed Policies and Proposals contribute towards delivering 
the Croydon Local Plan 2018’s Strategic Policies and its objectives 
by setting out detailed planning policies that the Council will use 
when determining applications for planning permission in the 
borough. They also allocate land for future development to help 
deliver the development requirements of the Plan and set out 
proposals for major development sites in the borough and other 
site-specific/designation policies as appropriate. 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre (CMC) A metropolitan centre serves a wide catchment which can extend 
over several boroughs and into parts of the wider south east region. 
Typically they contain at least 100,000m2 of retail floor space with a 
significant proportion of high-order comparison goods relative to 
convenience goods. These centres generally have very good 
accessibility and significant employment, service and leisure 
functions. 
Croydon Monitoring Report 
The Croydon Monitoring Report (formerly the Annual Monitoring 
Report), assesses the implementation of the Local Development 
Scheme (LDS – essentially the timetable for the production of the 
Local Development Framework), the extent to which policies in the 
Local Development Framework are being successfully 
implemented, and the need for possible changes to policy. 
Croydon Opportunity Area 
Opportunity Areas are designated by the London Plan and are 
London's principal opportunities for accommodating large scale 
development to provide substantial numbers of new employment 
and housing with a mixed and intensive use of land and assisted by 
good public transport accessibility. The Mayor has designated an 
Opportunity Area in central Croydon known as Croydon Opportunity 
Area.  
526 
 Croydon Panoramas  
The criteria applied for identification includes the following: 
 The viewpoint must be in a publicly accessible location in a 
major public area or the viewpoint is located in an area or on 
routes identified in Figure 6.1 ; 
 The viewpoint selected is where the widest panorama can be 
viewed; 
 The viewpoint selected is also the one that gives the clearest 
view, has the least obstructions of the subject matter; and 
 The view is of substantial parts of the borough of Croydon 
(views looking outside of Croydon are not included as the 
subject matter is outside the remit of the Council). 
Cycle Hub 
A point for collecting or returning bicycles available for hire. 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 
The UK government department responsible for policy and 
regulations on the environment, food and rural affairs. 
Development Management 
The process of managing development from design through 
applying for planning permission to implementation whilst ensuring 
that it achieves planning objectives. 
Development Plan 
This contains the policies and guidance which manage 
development in a Local Authority area. Under the present planning 
system the Development Plan comprises the London Plan, the 
Local Development Framework and saved policies in the existing 
Unitary Development Plan. 
Development Plan Document (DPD) A policy document in the Local Development Framework, which is 
subject to public consultation and an independent examination. 
District Energy Networks 
The connection of a series of buildings via a pipe network in order 
to receive heat and potentially other energy services including 
cooling and electricity. The network incorporates a single or multiple 
energy centres usually based on combined heat and power 
generation plant. District energy networks are most suitable for 
areas of high urban density like Croydon Opportunity Area because 
of the demand and relatively short distances for the heat or energy 
to be distributed. 
District Centre 
Distributed more widely than the metropolitan centres, providing 
convenience goods and services for more local communities and 
accessible by public transport, walking and cycling. Typically they 
contain 10,000 – 50,000m2 of retail floor space. Some District 
centres have developed specialist shopping functions. 
Enterprise Centre  
This refers to a facility which promotes the start up and 
development of small and medium sized businesses in the area 
through the provision of business information and support services. 
Equalities Analysis  
Equalities Analysis has been developed as a tool for ensuring that 
equality, social inclusion and community cohesion issues can be 
considered when drawing up policies or proposals which affect the 
delivery of services, the carrying out of the Council’s functions and 
the employment practice of the authority. 
  
527 
 Evidence Base 
The NPPF paragraph 158 states e ach local planning authority 
should ensure that the Local Plan is based on adequate, up -to-date 
and relevant evidence about the economic, social and 
environmental characteristics and prospects of the area. Local 
planning authorities  should ensure that their assessment of and 
strategies for housing, employment and other uses are integrated, 
and that they take full account of relevant market and economic 
signals.   
Flood Risk Zone 
These zones comprise land assessed as having vulnerability to 
flooding from river, sea and other sources and the potential to 
increase flood risk elsewhere through the addition of hard surfaces 
and the effect of the new development on surface water run-off. 
Fluvial Flooding 
Flooding resulting from water levels exceeding the bank level of a 
main river or watercourse. 
Grade A Office floor space 
Grade A Office floor space is the most sought after space on the 
market. It will usually contain a number of the following features: 
 Be a new, redeveloped, or totally refurbished property. 
 Be in a prime, prestigious location.  
 Have been furnished to an extremely high specification. 
 Have state- of-the-art facilities. 
 Have excellent accessibility. 
 Have quality building management and maintenance 
arrangement.  
Green Belt Green Belt is a national policy designation that helps to contain 
development, protect the countryside and promote brownfield 
development, and assists in urban regeneration. There is a general 
presumption against inappropriate development in the Green Belt. 
Green Grid 
This is a network which will link open spaces with a network of 
walking and cycling routes  and is being planned alongside the 
development of other infrastructure. 
Green Infrastructure  
The open environment within urban areas, the urban fringe and the 
countryside, which forms a network of connected, high quality, 
multi-functional open spaces, corridors and the links in between 
that provide multiple benefits for people and wildlife. 
Green Arc Vision 
Bringing the Big Outdoors closer to people through the creation of 
an extensive and attractive and valued recreational landscape of 
well-connected and accessible countryside around London, for 
people and wildlife. 
Groundwater Flooding 
Flooding that occurs when water levels in the ground rise above 
surface elevations. 
Heat Island Effect 
Refers to the tendency for a city or town to remain warmer than its 
surroundings, by as much as 5.5ºC or more. This effect is caused 
mostly by the lack of vegetation and soil moisture, which would 
normally use the absorbed sunlight to evaporate water as part of 
photosynthesis. 
Heritage Assets  
528 
 A building, monument, site, place, area or landscape positively 
identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration 
in planning decisions. 
Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance 
The Mayor of London’s Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance 
incorporates the standards previously set out in the London 
Housing Design Guide. This sets a new benchmark for housing in 
the capital and aims to provide consistency and clarity about wha t 
is expected in London from the outset of a development. The 
standards are anticipated to be taken forward across all tenures. 
Housing Typologies Study 
A piece of evidence base which tested how different types and 
sizes of dwellings might be accommodated within Croydon 
Opportunity Area and how such development might be phased. 
Imagine Croydon  
A project which sought to define a long term vision for Croydon; the 
vision seeks to explain how Croydon may be shaped, how it will 
function and what it will look like in 2040, based on local community 
needs and the aspirations and views of local residents, businesses 
and organisations. 
Inclusive Communities 
A community, whereby each person is respected as a citizen who 
can fully exercise his or her rights and responsibilities.  
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) 
The delivery of a sound Local Development Framework, including 
the Croydon Local Plan 2018, and other development plan 
documents, will depend on an IDP. An IDP usually consists of a 
delivery strategy, an infrastructure delivery schedule of projects 
likely to be funded and a schedule of required infrastructure. Innovation 
Whilst there are many forms of innovation, references in this 
document relate to the practice where academic specialists work 
closely with businesses to cultivate ideas, identify and transform 
important technological discoveries into commercial ventures.  
Legibility 
Legibility describes how easily people can find their way around a 
place. 
Local Centre 
Typically serves a localised catchment often mostly accessible by 
walking and cycling and may comprise a local parade and small 
clusters of shops, mostly for convenience goods and other services. 
This may include a small supermarket (less than 2,000m2), sub-
post office, pharmacy, launderette and other useful local services. 
Together with District Centres they can play a key role in 
addressing areas deficient in local retail and other services. 
Local Designated Landmark 
The criteria used to identify landmarks are:  
 It is a prominent building/structure 
 It is easily recognisable close up 
 It is easily recognisable from a distance and in a Local 
Designated View and 
 It positively contributes to the built environment of Croydon, and 
local distinctiveness and may provide an orientation point/way 
finding. 
Local Designated Views 
The criteria applied for identification includes the following:  
529 
  The viewpoint must be in a publicly accessible location in a 
major public area or the viewpoint is located in an area or on routes 
identified in Figure 6.1 ; 
 It must contribute positively to the local character; 
 Key landmarks (Local Designated Landmarks) are seen or it is a 
unique view; and  
 It must be substantially of a part of the borough. 
Local Development Framework (LDF) 
The LDF is a suite of planning policy documents consisting of 
Development Plan Documents (DPDs) and Supplementary 
Planning Documents (SPDs). DPDs and SPDs must conform to the 
Strategic Policies of the Croydon Local Plan 2018. Once adopted, 
LDF documents will replace the saved policies contained within the 
old style Unitary Development Plan (The Croydon Plan, July 2006). 
Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) 
A partnership, that brings together businesses, Councils and 
universities to develop a growth strategy and bid for funding. 
Local Green Space 
Open space that is demonstrably special to the local community 
and holds a particular local significance because of its beauty, 
historic importance, recreational value, tranquillity or richness of its 
wildlife. It does not include Green Belt and must be local in 
character and not cover extensive tracts of land. 
Local Heritage Areas 
Local Heritage Areas (LHAs) are distinctive locally significant 
heritage assets that have been designated as a result of their 
heritage and architectural or townscape or landscape value. LHAs 
are characterised by their locally recognised, distinctive and 
particularly high quality examples of more familiar types of local 
historic development. They are areas of a recognised local heritage significance which additionally meets one or more of the following 
three criteria: 
 Architecture: The architecture in the area must be of a high 
quality, distinctive and well preserved. The collective value of a 
group of historic buildings has a consistent architectural form, style, 
features, detailing or materials; and the group will often, but not 
always, have been built as a single development over a short 
period of time. 
 Townscape: The townscape of the area must be of a high 
quality, distinctive and well preserved. This is because of the 
attractive and historic composition of the urban form; and the area 
will often, but not always, have been planned. 
 Landscape: The landscape of the area must be of a high quality, 
distinctive and well preserved. This is because of the distinguishing 
quality, extent or features of its historic landscape; and it will often, 
but not always, have been planned.  
 
Localism Act 2011 
The Localism Act 2011 was given Royal Assent on 15 November 
2011. This Act shifts power from central government back into the 
hands of individuals, communities and Councils and includes five 
key measures that underpin the Government's approach to 
decentralisation; Community rights, Neighbourhood planning, 
Housing, General power of competence and Empowering cities and 
other local areas. 
Local Listed Buildings 
The locally listed buildings and structures within Croydon are 
considered by the public and the Council as having special local 
architectural or historic interest, to be of significance to the local 
community and to contribute to the environmental and cultural  
530 
 heritage of the borough. All locally listed buildings should satisfy at 
least two of the following criteria:  
 Authenticity: Buildings and groups selected for the local list 
should be substantially unaltered and retain the majority of their 
original features; 
 Architectural significance: Buildings which are of good 
architectural quality or are good examples of a particular building 
type; 
 Historical significance: Buildings which represent specific 
architectural and social building periods or which are associated 
with, local historical events, the development of Croydon, well 
known people or noted designers; 
 Technical significance: Buildings that display exceptional 
innovation and craftsmanship; 
 Townscape Value: Buildi ngs and/or groups of buildings which 
due to their form, massing, appearance and positive role in the 
streetscene, such as key corner buildings, local landmarks, 
uniformly designed terraces.  
Locally Listed Historic Parks and Gardens 
The criteria for the local list of historic parks and gardens are set by 
Historic England along with the London Parks and Gardens Trust. 
This stipulates that the site have at least one of the following:  
 evident historic features or design  
 buried archaeology  
 connections with famous designers or nurserymen  
 connections with nationally or locally famous individuals  
 a design typical of a landscape style.  
Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) 
An LSP is a non-statutory body that brings together the different 
parts of the public, private, voluntary and community sectors, working at a local level. The lead player in the LSP is the local 
Council. Other players will include the police and NHS Croydon. 
Masterplan 
This term is used here to describe a ‘spatial masterplan’, which sets 
out proposals for buildings, spaces, movement strategy and land 
use in three dimensions and matches these proposals to a delivery 
strategy. 
Mayor's Supplementary Planning Guidance 
The Mayor of London produces Supplementary Planning Guidance 
to provide further detail on particular policies in the London Plan. 
Supplementary guidance is used to support statutory development 
plans. 
Metropolitan Green Belt (MGB) 
See Green Belt 
Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) 
Areas of predominantly open land within the built- up area with 
significance beyond one borough. 
Mixed-use development  
Development for a variety of activities on single sites or across 
wider areas, such as town centres. 
Multiversity 
A university-level organisation with many constituent and affiliated 
institutions and campuses. 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 
Published in March 2012, the National Planning Policy Framework 
is a key part of Government reforms to make the planning system 
less complex and more accessible, and to promote sustainable  
531 
 growth. The NPPF replaces all existing Planning Policy Statements 
and Planning Policy Guidance. 
Natural Signatures 
Guidance produced by Natural England to re-establish the 
relationship between the built and natural aspects of London. 
National Technical Standards (2015) 
The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) 
has enacted a package of deregulatory changes  (announced March 
2015) to the building regulations in 2012.  
 
Natural Surveillance 
Informal or natural surveillance aims limit the opportunity for crime 
by increasing the perception that people can be seen by those 
living, working or passing through an area. Natural surveillance can 
be achieved by ensuring doors and windows look onto public 
spaces, parking areas and streets, encouraging a diversity of uses, 
encouraging pedestrian use, incorporating low landscaping, street 
lights and removing hiding and lurking places. 
Neighbourhood Centres  
These offer the opportunity for clusters of uses, in particular 
community uses, to emerge with support through planning policy. 
The identification of Neighbourhood Centres recognises the wider 
role the centres play in supporting the local community as well as 
their retail function.  
Neighbourhood Forum 
An organisation established for the express purpose of furthering 
the social, economic and environmental well-being of individuals 
living, or wanting to live, in an area that consist of or includes the 
neighbourhood area concerned. There are other criteria the organisation has to meet, and if met/recognised by the local 
planning authority, the designation lasts for five years. 
Neighbourhood Planning 
The government is creating a new Neighbourhood Planning tier that 
will be led by the community rather than the Council. The Localism 
Bill, which recently became an Act, embeds Neighbourhood 
Planning in the formal planning system. The purpose of the 
legislation is to allow community groups to become involved in 
enabling and shaping and promoting growth and development that 
takes place in their local area.  
532 
 Neighbourhood Development Plan 
Neighbourhood Forums will be able to write a Neighbourhood 
Development Plan (NDP) to set out policies and plans for their 
area. They should only cover land use planning issues, and not 
broader local concerns. Nor will an NDP cover strategic issues such 
as major development or major public transport infrastructure, but it 
will be able to guide local issues. The NDP will form part of the 
Development Plan which comprises the London-wide policy in the 
London Plan, the Council’s planning policies and any other adopted 
NDPs. The NDP will need to conform with the Development Plan 
and the relevant national policies. The NDP will be able to be 
adopted as a formal part of the Development Plan (thereby gaining 
the status of a ‘Development Plan Document’). This means that 
planning decisions will have to be made in accordance with the 
Neighbourhood Plan, (and other parts of the overall Development 
Plan), unless there are good planning reasons not to. 
Night-Time Economy 
The provision of a range of leisure and cultural facilities which 
provide jobs and entertainment for visitors and residents, including 
bars, clubs, music venues, restaurants, cinema, and theatres. 
Together these support and strengthen the town centre’s economic 
standing and attraction beyond its function as a day-time workplace 
and shopping centre. 
Opportunity Area Planning Framework (OAPF) 
A non-statutory planning document issued by the Mayor of London. 
It is consistent with and is derived from the London Plan and other 
Mayoral strategies. Its purpose is to assist with the delivery of 
cross- borough projects, provide clarity to developers and investors, 
and guide borough planning decisions and policies. 
Partners  Partners are any organisation that the Council works with to deliver 
a service or achieve an objective. A list of partner organisations can 
be found in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 
Permeability 
Permeability is about movement and connection and the ease with 
which people are able to get to and move through places. A 
permeable place avoids severance by providing a clear choice of 
routes connecting to existing roads and facilities. 
Planning Obligations 
New development often creates a need for additional infrastructure 
or improved community services and facilities, without which there 
could be a detrimental effect on local amenity and the quality of the 
environment. Planning Obligations are the mechanism used to 
secure these measures. Planning obligations are intended to make 
acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in 
planning terms. Planning Obligations are secured pursuant to 
Section 106 of the 1990 Town and Country Planning Act  (as 
amended) and the Planning & Compulsory Purchase Act 2004  and 
are often private agreements negotiated, usually in the context of 
planning applications, between the Council and persons with an 
interest in the land (Section 106 Agreement). Planning Obligations 
can also be given unilaterally to the Council by the persons with an 
interest in the land (Unilateral Undertaking).Planning obligations 
secured by way of a Section 106 agreement or Unilateral 
Undertaking (also called a Unilateral Obligation), are binding on the 
land and are therefore enforceable against all successors in title. 
Pluvial Flooding  
Flooding from water flowing over the surface of the ground; often 
occurs when the soil is saturated and natural drainage channels or 
artificial drainage systems have insufficient capacity to cope with 
additional flow.  
533 
 Public Realm  
The parts of a village, town or city (whether publicly or privately 
owned) that are available, without charge, for everyone to see, use 
and enjoy, including streets, squares and parks; all land to which 
everyone has ready, free and legal access 24 hours a day. 
Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) 
A measure of the extent and ease of access by public transport, or 
the degree of access to the public transport network. 
Registered Provider 
All providers of social housing are listed on a register as a 
"Registered Provider" (RP). 
Renewable energy  
Energy derived from a source that is continually replenished, such 
as wind, waves, solar, hydroelectric and energy from plant material, 
but not fossil fuels or nuclear energy. Although not strictly 
renewable, geothermal energy is generally included. 
Sewer Flooding 
Flooding caused by a blockage or overflowing in a sewer or urban 
drainage system. 
Soundness 
Soundness is the essential measure of a Development Plan 
Document, especially a Local Plan, which is tested at a public 
examination. For a DPD to be “sound”, it must be positively 
prepared, justified, effective and consistent with national policy. 
“Positively prepared” means the strategy meets objectively 
assessed development requirements. “Justified” means that a 
document must be founded on a robust and credible evidence base 
and the most appropriate strategy when considered against the reasonable alternatives. “Effective” means that it must be 
deliverable, flexible and able to be monitored. 
Source Protection Zone 
These zones show the risk of contamination to groundwater, which 
supplies up to 80% of the drinking water in some parts of the South 
East, from any activities that might cause pollution in the area. The 
closer the activity, the greater the risk. There a three main zones 
(inner, outer and total catchment). In some instances nationwide 
there is a fourth zone of special interest. The Environment Agency 
use the zones in conjunction with their Groundwater Protection 
Policy to set up pollution prevention measures in areas which are at 
a higher risk, and to monitor the activities of potential polluters 
nearby. 
Source Protection Zone 1 – Inner protection zone  
Defined as the 50 day travel time from any point below the water 
table to the source. This zone has a minimum radius of 50 metres. 
Source Protection Zone 2 – Outer protection zone 
Defined by a 400 day travel time from a point below the water table. 
This zone has a minimum radius of 250 or 500 metres around the 
source, depending on the size of the abstraction. 
Source Protection Zone 3 – Source catchment protection zone  
Defined as the area around a source within which all groundwater 
recharge is presumed to be discharged at the source. In confined 
aquifers, the source catchment may be displaced some distance 
from the source. For heavily exploited aquifers, the final Source 
Catchment Protection Zone can be defined as the whole aquifer 
recharge area where the ratio of groundwater abstraction to aquifer 
recharge (average recharge multiplied by outcrop area) is >0.75.  
534 
 There is still the need to define individual source protection areas to 
assist operators in catchment management. 
Stakeholder  
A person or organisation with an interest in or concern for a 
particular place; one who affects or is affected by the processes of 
urban change.  
Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) 
Sets out when, with whom and how consultation will be undertaken 
in connection with all documents to be prepared by the Council as 
part of the LDF and in the consideration of planning applications. 
Statutory Listed Building 
The national list of buildings of special architectural or historic 
interest maintained by Historic England on behalf of the 
government.  
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPD)  
Documents produced by the Council as part of its LDF. These are 
not subject to independent examination but provide further 
explanation of policies or proposals in a DPD.  
Sustainable Communities 
Places where people want to live and work, now and in the future; 
that meet the diverse needs of existing and future residents, are 
sensitive to their environment and contribute to a high quality life. 
They are safe and inclusive, well planned, built, or modified to 
promote sustainable living. 
Sustainability/Sustainable Development  
Development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs. Sustainable development has three elements: environmental, economic and social sustainability. More generally, 
it is used as a benchmark for a range of economic, social, political, 
and environmental initiatives that contribute to the quality of life.  
Sustainability Appraisal (SA) 
The SA is a process of appraising DPD and SPD policies to ensure 
that an LDF is economically, socially and environmentally 
sustainable. The Council must carry out an SA process that runs 
alongside the formulation of all its planning documents.  
Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) 
The Local Strategic Partnership creates a long-term vision for the 
area to tackle local needs. The vision is set out in the SCS. The 
Local Area Agreement is the mechanism for making the vision a 
reality. All the SCS outcomes and targets are designed to deliver 
the vision set out in the SCS. The SCS is the ‘plan of plans’ in the 
area. It sits above all the other plans and should be based on 
evidence and consultation. The SCS should also set out the key 
tasks that the partners in the area need to achieve to improve its 
wellbeing. The Local Development Framework, particularly the 
Croydon Local Plan 2018 needs to demonstrate how it is delivering 
the SCS. 
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)  
Drainage systems that seek to control and treat surface water run-
off from a site to reduce risk of flooding and pollution by mimicking 
the processes performed by natural drainage systems such as 
wetlands 
Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment 
The primary role of the SHLAA is to identify sites with potential for 
housing development, assess their housing potential and estimate 
when they are likely to be developed. Although the Assessment is 
an important evidence source to inform plan-making, it does not, in  
535 
 itself, determine whether a site should be allocated for housing 
development. 
Transport for London (TfL) 
Transport for London (TfL) is the organisation responsible for 
London's transport system. Its role is to implement the Mayor’s 
Transport Strategy and manage transport services in London, for 
which the Mayor has ultimate responsibility.  
Transport Assessments 
An impartial assessment of the transport impacts of a proposed 
development  
Travel Plan 
A general term for a package of travel measures tailored to suit the 
needs of a business, school or other organisation at a given 
location or site. The aim is to promote greener, cleaner travel 
choices and reduced reliance on the car. 
Urban Blue Corridors 
A network of multifunctional spaces and corridors that provide safe 
routes and storage for flood water within the urban environment. 
We are Croydon 
This is the title given to the vision for Croydon contained in the 
Sustainable Community Strategy. 
Windfall sites 
These are sites which are developed for housing or another use, 
which were not known to be development sites at the time the 
development plan was prepared and therefore were not included as 
allocations in a development plan.

 565 Appendix 6 – About the proposal sites  
The Croydon Local Plan 2018 sets out Croydon Council’s proposed sites for new homes, new primary and secondary schools, new 
healthcare facilities, new Gypsy and Traveller pitches and Creative and Cultural Industries Enterprise Centres and also land to be 
safeguarded for transport improvements in the borough. 
This appendix explains the factors that were taken into consideration when assessing possible proposal sites in the borough. The proposal 
sites were identified from the following sources: 
 The Call for Sites that took place in February 2012 and February 2014 ; 
 The Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment prepared by the Mayor of London  in 2013 ; 
 Planning permissions and records of pre-application advice; and 
 Sites identified by Council officers as having potential for development. 
Each site was considered for different uses. As each different land use has different needs the factors that were taken into consideration are 
looked at in turn starting below with housing. 
New homes 
In assessing each site the basic criteria that were considered were as follows: 
 Is the site big enough for 10 or more new homes;  
 Are there any existing or proposed policy constraints that would prevent the development of the site altogether;  
 Is the existing land use protected from developm ent unless certain criteria are met (such as demonstrating lack of demand for an 
industrial premises or community use);  
 Are there any factors that would prevent the site being developed (such as legal covenants or viability issues); and  
 Could better use be  made of the site for another use such as a new school based on the criteria in the following paragraphs?  
New primary schools 
There were five principal criteria when assessing whether or not a site was suitable for a new primary school. These were: 
 The sit e must be big enough (with 0.25ha being the smallest site a new primary school could be built on);  
 The site must be in an area with an identified need for new primary school classes;  
 The existing land use is not protected;  
 There are no policy constraints t hat would prevent the development of the site altogether; and   
 566 
 There are no known factors that prevent the site being developed.  
Not every area of the borough has a need for new primary school classes beyond 2017. Only the North West, Centre and South West have 
been identified as needing more classrooms that will require the construction of a new primary school. The remaining areas of the borough 
(the North East, the East and the South East), either do not have any need for new classrooms or the need is small enough to be 
accommodated through the expansion of existing primary schools.

The assessment criteria for secondary schools were similar to primary schools, the main differences being the size of the site required and 
that secondary school places are required across the borough. The minimum site size for a new secondary school is 1.1ha. 
New healthcare facilities 
The Council has worked with NHS England, the Croydon Commissioning Group, the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, the Croyd on 
University Hospital NHS Trust, the London Healthy Urban Development Unit and NHS Property Services to identify sites that would be 
suitable for new healthcare facilities and are in areas of demand. 
Sites for Gypsy and Traveller pitches 
Gypsy and Traveller pitches are initially considered in the same way as a site for housing as in planning terms it is the same use of land. 
However, new Gypsy and Traveller pitches have their own specific requirements as well which were: 
 The site must be big enough for thr ee pitches (with 0.15ha being the minimum site size required for three new pitches); and  
 The site should have no existing buildings (on the grounds that it would not be viable to demolish existing buildings and rep lace them 
with Gypsy and Traveller pitches ), or the existing building could be used to provide an amenity block for new pitches.  
Creative and Cultural Industries Enterprise Centres 
The Croydon Local Plan 2018 sets out in Policy SP3.3 that it will create a network of Creative and Cultural Industries Enterprise Centres 
with one each in Croydon Metropolitan Centre, Crystal Palace, Purley and South Norwood/Portland Road. Sites in these locations have 
been considered as potential locations for a Creative and Cultural Industries Centre where there is an existing policy designation protecting 
the existing use, but where the site could be realistically used to support creative and cultural industries in the borough.

Secondary School and 
residential development 
subject to acce ss from 
Stafford Road  
 The site is of a suitable size for a secondary 
school, is in an area that has a high demand for 
school places and can make a significant 
contribution to meeting this demand. The site is 
also large enough to accommodate new homes as 
well as a secondary school. Residential 
development will help to meet the need for new 
homes in the borough. Access to this site is 
currently an issue and development is dependent 
upon the reconfiguration of the Fiveways junction 
as currently it is not pos sible to provide access on 
to Stafford Road or Duppas Hill Road because of 
the volume of traffic on these roads. The 
Sustainability Appraisal recommends the loss of 
open space is mitigated by the development. 
School buildings and residential development 
should be located away from areas at risk from 
surface water ponding. The site is located within 
the boundary of the Purley Way Transformation 
Area and development proposals should broadly 
align with the detailed Masterplan.  
  
2022/23 -2026  
 The southern pa rt of 
the site has planning 
permission for

site forms part of 
Educational Estate 
Strategy and its 
delivery is 
anticipated to come 
forward in the 
medium to long term

 Proximity to East Croydon station means the  site is well

forms part of the Brighton Mainline and East Croydon

The site has planning permission for a retail use having 
passed the sequential test. Should the planning 
permission expire retail use would cease to be an 
acceptable use on this site unless a new sequential test 
demonstrates that there are no sequentially preferable 
sites available that are suitable for t he type of retail use 
proposed. A cycling hub is required to improve the 
sustainability of the site, the development of which has 
some negative environmental impacts, although partly 
mitigated by the provision of housing and employment .

Residential development  
 As part of the Croydon Local Plan   any town centre 
or scattered employment site that has been vacant for 
more than 18 months is being proposed for 
redevelopment if it could accommodate 10 or more 
new homes. Policy SP3.2 of the Croydon Local Plan   
requires that evidence of lack of demand for the 
existing premises or site for an employment use be 
provided before other uses can be considered. 
However, the need for new homes in the borough is 
so great that, as a plan -making process, a plan -led 
release of vacant town centre and scattered 
employment sites is proposed to help meet the need 
for new homes.

Residential (with healthcare fac ility 
if required by NHS). It is 
recommended that basements are 
not considered at this site. Further 
ground investigations would be 
required at this site to confirm the 
likelihood of groundwater 
occurrence. There is one historic 
record of surface water flo oding 
held by the Council in this 
location.  
 Existing office building is not protected from 
development. The site's location away from East 
Croydon station means it is less suited to hotel or 
office use and because it is outside of the Primary 
Shopping Ar ea it is not suitable for retail use. 
Residential development will help to meet the need 
for new homes in the borough. The site has been 
identified by the NHS as being in an area with a 
need for additional healthcare facilities. The 
inclusion of healthcare  facilities should be explored 
with the NHS before development takes place. 
Acoustic measures will need to be incorporated in 
the design to assist sustainability of the 
development.  Development should ensure the 
setting of the Wellesley Road (North) Conser vation 
Area and locally listed buildings is preserved and 
enhanced.

This site does not meet the criteria for de signation as 
Metropolitan Open Land as it does not contribute to 
the physical structure of London, it does not include 
open air facilities which serve whole or significant 
parts of London and it does not contain features or 
landscapes of national or metrop olitan importance. 
For this reason it has been assessed by the same 
criteria as other non -Metropolitan Open Land sites 
and is considered acceptable for development. 
Residential development will help to meet the need 
for new homes in the borough.

Redevelopment fo r mixed use

 Potential for a new Town Centre in the Fiveways area 
is identified in the Purley Way Transformation Area 
and Croydon Local Plan. Over the lifetime of the 
Croydon Local Plan reconfiguration of out of town 
retail warehous es in the borough will provide an 
opportunity for redevelopment with a mix of 
residential, community uses and retail. The site is 
located within the boundary of the Purley Way 
Transformation Area and development proposals 
should broadly align with the deta iled Masterplan. 
The setting of the Listed Building should be positively 
integrated into the development.

It should be noted that ordinary 
watercourses have not have 
been included in the f luvial 
modelling of the River Wandle 
and therefore a fluvial flood risk 
from this watercourse may be 
present. As set out in Section 
11.3.2 of the Level 1 SFRA, 
applicants considering 
development of this site may 
need to prepare a simple 
hydraulic model to enable a more 
accurate assessment of the 
probability of flooding associated 
with this ordinary watercourse to 
inform the site specific FRA. This 
should be carried out in line with 
industry standards and in 
agreement with the LLFA

 Residential development will help to meet the need

offices as it is too far from East Croydon station and 
outside of the Primary Shopping Area so retail use i s 
not acceptable or suitable. The previous employment 
use of the site is protected by Policy SP3 of the 
Croydon Local Plan 2018 and the current community 
use is temporary so not protected. The Sustainability 
Appraisal recommends that the impact of the

cultural uses if required (with town 
centres uses considered if there is 
no interest in delivery of culture 
facility)  
 Existing office building is not protected from 
development The site lies within the Primary 
Shopping  Area of Croydon Town Centre so it is 
suited to retail but is situated at a distance from 
East Croydon station so it less suitable for 
office use. Residential development will help to 
meet the need for new homes in the borough. 
The Civic Space is a require ment of the Mid 
Croydon Masterplan. Many of the 
retail/catering units in St Georges Walk house 
independent businesses that provide low cost 
options and measures should be taken to 
enable these to continue in Croydon either 
within the development or elsewhe re. As The 
site is partly  within the Central Croydon 
Conservation Area and the setting of listed 
buildings including the Town Hall and Whitgift 
Almshouses. The development should respond 
to the character of the area, to preserve or 
enhance the significance  of heritage assets . 
The Council's relevant  Conservation Area 
Guidance and Management Plans will need to 
be adhered to. The conversion of the existing 
Listed Building (Segas House) on this site 
could help to meet the need for new homes in 
the borough. The existing office use is not 
protected. Delivery of a cultural  facility on the 
ground floor in this location would be 
appropriate to meet demand with residential or 
office uses on upper floors.  The Sustainability 
Appraisal recommends that the impact of the 
proposal on the conservation area is mitigated 
through the heritage and townscape 
assessment.

therefore a fluvial flood risk from

Self-contained residential

in areas that have ‘potential for

 Existing office building is not protected from 
development. Site is too far from East Croydon 
station to be suited to continued use as an office 
building in its entirety so conversion to res idential or 
residential and office is preferred option for this site. 
The area is not suited to more tall buildings or 
buildings taller than Leon House which means that 
redevelopment of the site is unlikely as a 
redevelopment would not be viable because of  
restrictions on height and the cost of demolishing 
Leon House. Site is outside of the Primary Shopping 
Area so is not suitable for retail use although the 
existing retail floor space can be retained or replaced. 
Conversion would need to adhere to Local Pl an and 
London Plan Standards to improve the sustainability 
of the development.

Remodelling of station and 
redevelopment to provide an 
improved transport interchange, 
cycle hub, retail & office units with 
residential development above. In 
the surrounding area, surface 
water flood risk is generally low. 
However, Station Road and the 
A212 have areas shown to be at 
high risk from surface water 
flooding. There are two historic 
records of surface water flooding 
held by Croydon Council in this 
location.  
 
 Existing station building is a low density development 
and use of the site ( as identified in the West Croydon 
Masterplan) could be increased to include residential 
use. Improvements to the station as a transport 
interchange including a cycle hub is a policy 
aspiration of the Croydon Local Plan Policy SP8 and 
will assist in the sus tainability of the development. 
Acoustic measures will need to be incorporated in the 
design to assist sustainability of the development and 
measures to alleviate surface water flooding taken, 
especially if current areas along train tracks are 
developed, r educing natural drainage capacity.

 Office use is not protected in this location which is 
within the Primary Shopping Area (so retail is a 
preferred use at ground floor level). The community 
use in Ambassador House is protected by Policy 
SP5. The site has been identified by the NHS as 
being in an area with a need for additional healthcare 
facilities. The inclusion of healthcare facilities should 
be explored with the NHS before development takes 
place. Residential development would help to m eet 
the need for homes in the borough. The building is 
built above the London to Brighton railway line and so 
conversion is likely to be preferable to new build 
because of cost of building above Network Rail 
infrastructure. To assist sustainability the 
development must incorporate acoustic measures to 
reduce noise impact of the development. Conversion 
would need to adhere to Local Plan and London Plan 
Standards to improve the sustainability of the 
development.  
The site is located in Flood Zone 1, low proba bility of 
flooding from rivers.

sewer flooding.  
 Planning permission has been granted for this site

their delivery partners are workin g closely with the 
Council and other stakeholders, to formulate a 
revised deliverable sch eme for this strategic part of 
borough. This will which represents  form a 
comprehensive major regeneration scheme for 
Croydon Metropolitan Centre which will secure an 
improved quality and expanded shopping centre

Appraisal recommends that the impact of the 
proposal on the conservation area is mitigated 
through the herit age and townscape assessment.

There are further areas of medium

 The redevelopment of this site could help to meet the 
need for new homes in the borough. The site lies 
outside of Purley District Centre so is not a suitable 
location for town centre uses including retail and 
offices. The Shopping Parade on the southern part of 
the site is proposed for de -designation as it does not 
have any shops in it. The current community us e 
within the site should be included to assist 
sustainability in the local context. As the site is within 
a Flood Zone 3 it will be subject to the Exception 
Test as part of a Site Specific Flood Risk 
Assessment. Any development which involves an 
increase i n building footprint should ensure there is 
no impact on the ability of the floodplain to store 
water. The Sustainability Appraisal recommends 
public transport improvements are made as part of 
the proposal to mitigate the site’s low public transport 
access ibility rating.

the site is no longer required for its

be noted that ordinary 
watercourses have not have been 
included in the fluvial modelling of 
the River Wandle and therefore a 
fluvial flood risk from this 
watercourse may be present  
 
 This site does not meet the criteria for designation as 
Metropolitan Open Land as it does not contribute to 
the physical structure of London, it does not include 
open air facilities which serve the whole or significant 
parts o f London and it does not contain features or 
landscapes of national or metropolitan importance. 
For this reason it has been assessed by the same 
criteria as other non -Metropolitan Open Land sites 
and is considered acceptable for development. 
Residential de velopment will help to meet the need 
for new homes in the borough. The locally listed 
building should be converted in a sensitive manner 
that responds to its special interest. Development in 
the grounds would need to demonstrate that it can be 
accommodated  in a manner that responds to the 
locally listed building and preserves or enhances its 
setting.   Post 2032

Bus stand underneath the flyover and 
a district energy centre and residential 
development on the remainder of the 
car park. The majority of the site is 
within Flo od Zone 3a to the south -
west and the rest of the site are within 
Flood Zone 1. This More Vulnerable 
development should be preferably 
located in Flood Zone 1. If it is 
essential to build on Flood Zone 3a, 
then all residential uses should be 
located in the f irst floor level or above. 
Self-contained residential basements 
and bedrooms at basement level are 
not permitted in areas that have 
‘potential for groundwater to occur at 
the surface’ (BGS Susceptibility to 
Groundwater Flooding).  
 TfL Buses require a bus standing space in Croydon 
Metropolitan Centre so that bus stands can be 
removed from the Mid Croydon Masterplan area. A 
district energy centre is a policy aspiration of the 
Croydon Local Plan 2018 and the Wandle Road 
surface car park has been identified as  the most 
cost effective and realisable site for its location. 
The remaining capacity can be used for new 
housing which will help to meet the need for new 
homes in the borough. As the site is within a Flood 
Zone 3 it will be subject to the Sequential Test as

 The site is of a suitable size for a secondary school, is

school places and can make a significant contribution 
to meeting this demand. The site has met the criteria 
for de -designation as Green Belt and part of the site 
will be de -designated to accommodate a school. The 
site is currently used as playing pitches which are 
protected so any redevelopment for a school should 
look to retain some of this use. Development could 
potentially require  mitigation to address the effects of

 The site is suitable for mixed use development with 
retail development and a community use on the 
ground floor with residential accommodation on the 
upper floors. Previous use of the site was retail and 
would be acceptable as it  is also partly within a 
Primary Shopping Area. Community use would add to 
the network of community facilities throughout the 
borough and new homes would help alleviate the 
need for new homes in the borough. The buildings 
fronting on to London Road contrib ute to the Local 
Heritage Area and should be retained and converted 
as part of the proposal.

1. This is based on provisional data provided of completions for the April 2019 to March 2021. This will be subject to change at a future date, based on verified data from GLA.  
2. This based on provisional site start data provided for April 2020 to March 2021.  Verified site start data for April 2019 to March 2020 needs to be included. Provisional starts data for older permissions between 
2016 -19 (excluded 2018/19 financial year) was used with older permissions sifted out based on officer knowledge and soundness. Provisional data will be subject to change at a future date, based on updated 
verified data from GLA. 
3. Provisional data of site with permissions was used for period between April 2018 to April 2021 and will be subject to change in the future, based on verified data from GLA. Data for permissions for period from 
April 2020 and March 2021 (and after this) needs to be included. This also included data for extant permissions from 2018/19 onwards until March 2020 (FYR 2019/20), after an officer soundness sift. An 80% 
implementation rate was applied based on past completion trends data of permissions. 
4.  This was based on a London Plan Policy H2 small sites target of 641 (*17 years) dwellings per annum. This is not based on past trends of windfall completions on sites below 0.25ha, which indicatively 
suggest a supply of 750 per annum. No assumptions have been applied to take account of potential windfall sites above 0.25ha.    
5. In line with para 74a of the NPPF (2021) , a 5% buffer was applied to the London Plan target, to ensure choice and competition in the market for potential housing land supply.  
6. Further sites may be included into the future supply from a Brownfield Land Register.
