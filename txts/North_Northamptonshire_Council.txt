 North Northamptonshire Strategic Plan Scope and Issues  
March 2022  
 
Foreword   
 
North Northamptonshire has a long and successful history on strategic planning that 
has provided new jobs, homes, and investment in town centres and local 
infrastructure at the same time as protecting and enhancing our natural and historic 
environment.  
The North Northamptonshire Strategic Plan is a key strategic document. It will set 
out the blueprint of future growth and development in our area over the next two 
decades, and the framework for the area based or topic -based plans, including 
potential review s and updates of the Part 2 Local Plans or Neighbourhood Plans, 
which compliment it and address other local planning issues in our area.   
Preparation of the plan provides the first opportunity for the nascent Council to 
consider a planning response to sig nificant changes in local, regional, and national 
context for example Covid -19, levelling up and climate emergency commitments.   
Proper planning means that we can deal with conflicting priorities, ensuring that we 
can help cater for growth, while at the s ame time protecting our precious 
environment.  
Of course, to do this properly, we need to be appropriately informed and that is why 
we need to go out to consultation so we can be confident that we can start to shape 
the plan in the best way possible.  
Change is always inevitable. We just need to make sure that we are in the best 
shape possible to deal with this change to help ensure that the North 
Northamptonshire area continues to be a great place in which to live and work.   
Please let us have your vi ews by responding to the consultation.

 Introduction  
 
The North Northamptonshire Joint Core Strategy  (JCS)  was adopted in July 2016.  It 
is the strategic part 1 Local Plan  for North Northamp tonshire, providing the big 
picture  for development across North Northamptonshire in the period 2011 -2031 and 
ensuring that an up -to-date decision -making and investment framework is in place.  It 
contains policies to deliver  sustainable development including 35,000 new homes 
and 31,100 new jobs to 2031. Additional local detail  is provided  by Part 2 Local 
Plans and Neighbourhood Plans where these have been or are being produced.   
   
What is the North Northamptonshire Strategic Plan  
 
The S trategic Plan will cover the whole  of North Northamptonshire . The plan will 
review and , where appropriate , replace the policies that address the strategic 
priorities for the area . The plan will not cover minerals and waste planning as this will 
be a matter for the Minerals and Waste Local Plan. The Strategic Plan will be 
supported by a combination of area -based or topic -based plans,  which could include 
reviews and updates of the Part 2 L ocal Plans.  This consultation on Scope and 
Issues is the first formal stage of preparing the Strategic Plan. The latest timetable is 
set out below:  
 
• Scope  and Issues  Consultation - March 2022  
• Options Consultation - November 2022  
• Draft Plan Consultation - June 2023  
• Publication Plan Consultation - November 2023  
• Submission to the Secretary of State - April 2024  
• Examination - September 2024  
• Inspector’s Report - April 2025  
• Adoption - September 2025  
 
What is t his document about  
 
The Scope and Issues consultation is the first stage of the Strategic Plan. At this 
stage we are looking for your views on whether we have identified the right issues 
facing North Northamptonshire and what the plan should cover.  
 
There is a statutory requirement to und ertake a review of the Local Plan within five 
years of adoption to ensure that planning policies are kept up to date and respond to 
changing local needs and circumstances.

 Relationship with the North Northamptonshire Corporate Plan  
 
The Strategic Plan will take forward the key commitments  for the Council  set out  in 
the Corporate Plan1, that was adopted on 1st December 2021  and provide the spatial 
dimension to it.   
The Corporate Plan  sets out the Vision for North Northamptonshire:   
“A place where everyone has the best opportunities and quality of life”  
In addition to its Vision , the Corporate Plan sets out  the six key commitments  
(priorities)  the Council is making  to North Northamptonshire  residents.

Scope of the Strategic Plan  
 
The Strategic Plan  will focus on strategic matters which will, as a minimum, meet the 
requirement, set out in the NPPF2, for the Council  to have  a plan that addresses the 
strategic priorities for its area. The plan will also help to deliver the priorities set out 
                                                           
2 National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) Paras 20 - 23, Strategic policies   
8 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 in other Council  plans and strategies , notably the Corporate Plan (discussed above) . 
The plan will also need to  respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by 
the Oxford -Cambridge Arc  (discussed on page 17).  
To address the strategic priorities for the area it is expected that the  scope of the 
plan will include the issues set out below. This may be refined subject to  any 
changes to  national  and sub -regional  guidance and in response to  consultation 
feedback .  
• The spatial vision for North Northamptonshire – extended to 2050 to reflect 
the Oxford -Cambridge Arc Spatial Framework (ASF)  and meet the requirements 
of the NPPF . 
• The approach to climate change  – setting the framework for the local response 
to the climate  emergency, building on existing initiatives and setting priorities to 
deliver net zero carbon.  
• The approach to Levelling Up  – setting  the framework for the local response to 
addressing inequalities and setting priorities to level up .          
• The s patial strategy for the distribution of development  – including the roles 
of settlements and the distribution of housing, employment, retail, leisure, and 
other commercial development. Cooperation will be needed with adjoining 
authorities and other relevant agencies to ensure cross boundary issues, 
including options for the longer -term growth of Northampton , Bedford and 
Peterborough  are considered .  
• The housing requirement  – the number of new homes to be provided across 
North Northamptonshi re and the distribution of these. Within this context, the 
size, type, and tenure of housing needed for different groups  will be identified , 
including addressing the proportion of the overall housing requirement that 
should be provided as affordable  and planning for the needs of an ag eing 
population .  
• Economic growth – an economic vision to strengthen and diversify the economy 
of North Northamptonshire , taking account of existing sectoral strengths, 
opportunities provided by the Oxford -Cambridge Arc and implications  of Covid -
19, including changes to working patterns. An overall jobs target for North 
Northamptonshire, distribution of this and identificatio n of new employment land  
capable of meeting a wide variety of needs . 
• Town Centres - updated  policy guidance and strategy for town centres and retail 
development taking account of the impact of policy changes and social/economic 
implications including  Covid -19. This will focus on reimagining and redesigning 
town centres to support regeneration and economic  recovery from Covid -19 
including opportunities for town centres to become community service hubs with 
increased leisure and residential space.    
• Strategic Development Locations and Opportunities  – strategic sites that are 
key to the delivery of the spati al strategy will be identified in the plan. The  
9 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 strategic site threshold3  will be refined as the plan is progressed, including 
consultation on its scope. The location of these sites will be a key consideration 
in the context of climate -change related risk s and ensuring future development 
contributes towards a reduction in carbon emissions. The plan will define clear 
development principles for these areas. These will provide the basis for design 
codes/frameworks.  
• Infrastructure  – key infrastructure projects  that are required to deliver the 
strategy such as strategic transport schemes  includin g active travel , utility 
networks , community facilities , health,  emergency services infrastructure and 
site-specific  requirements .  
• Place -making /sustainable development  – key principles to ensure high quality 
development that is sustainable and supports local communities . The design and 
future sustainability of development will be a key consideration in the approach to 
climate change and the S trategic Plan will set out a stronger approach to 
integrating land -use and transport considerations. This will include a review and 
refresh of the Protecting Assets policies in the JCS to ensure they are locally 
distinctive with increased emphasis on healt h and wellbeing. It may be necessary 
to harmonise the approach to open space/sports provision across N orth 
Northamptonshire  and the broad criteria for the delivery of these.                                                                             
• Natural  and Historic  Environment – key principles and measures to achieve 
environmental net gain including the protection, restoration, and enhancement of 
natural, and historic assets. This will include natural capital benefits such as flood 
protection, recreation and improved water and air quality as well as ensuring 
appropriate measures for internationally, nationally and locally designated sites 
and priority habitats  or protected species . The S trategic Plan will seek to 
maximise the  health and wellbeing  benefits of nature and accessibility  to it. 
Opportunities to enhance the green  and blue  infrastructure network within N orth 
Northamptonshire  and maximise its wider benefits and opportunities will be set 
out. The spatial strategy and place -making  approach will  be influenced by  the 
importance of the natural and historic environment including the role they play in 
creating local distinctiv eness. 
 
These issues are discussed in more detail within the document along with questions 
to obtain feedback.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
3 The current threshold in the JCS is 500+ dwellings or 5+ ha of employment land. This will be reviewed taking 
account of the thresholds for development proposals to be considered by the Council’s Strategic Development 
Management Committee.

 Spatial context  
 
North Northamptonshire is the area covered by the four former boroughs and 
districts of Corby, Kettering, East Northamptonshire  and Wellingborough (see Image 
1 below). It has a population of c.350,0004, which has grown  at one of the fastest 
rates in the country during the last few years , spread across a  distinctive network of  
settlements, from large (“growth”) and market towns thr ough to villages (of which 
there are over 100). It is bordered by the local authority areas of West 
Northamptonshire (comprising the former local authority areas of Northampton, 
Daventry, South Northamptonshire), Rutland, Harborough,  South Kesteven,  
Peterb orough, Huntingdonshire, Milton Keynes and  Bedford. It is also part of the 
Oxford - Cambridge Arc area identified by Government for its significant economic 
potential.

11 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 North Northamptonshire benefits from a central location and excellent  strateg ic 
transport connections.  The A14 provides links to the M1, M6 and A1 as well as the 
East Coast Ports, while the  Midland Main Line provides rail connections from Corby, 
Kettering and Wellingborough to London (with  onward Eurostar trains) and north to 
Leicester, Nottingham and beyo nd. A range of international airports  are all within 70 
miles of North Northamptonshire.  
 
Each settlement has its own role to play and contribution  to make to the overall 
sense of place  and character of North Northamptonshire.  Many of the towns  have 
undergone significant change and economic evolution  in recent decades, following 
their expansion as centres for the boot and shoe industry or, in the case of Corby, for 
the steel industry , and subsequent decline of these industries .  
 
The relationship between the network of settlements and the surrounding 
countryside is a distinctive feature of North Northamptonshire and one of the main 
attractions for residents and businesses seek ing a high-quality environment . A 
marked contrast exists between the quiet rural character of much of the area, 
particularly the rural northeast of the  area and the main settlements in the urban 
spine where the emphasis  is on investment in growth and renew al. The countryside 
incorporates many of North Northamptonshire’s environmental, cultural and heritage 
assets such as the Nene Valley and Rockingham Forest.    
 
The economy tends to function as two distinct sub -areas, with the northern area 
focused on Corby and Kettering and the southern area on Wellingborough and 
Rushden, which has closer functional links with Northampton  and Bedford . Whilst 
manufacturing still represents a key component of the area’s economy , it has 
become significantly more advanced taking advantage  of the latest innovative 
technology, with service -based sectors also playing an important role. The area has 
seen significant growth in, and demand for logistics floorspace.  
 
North North amptonshire  is not uniform, socially or economically, with pockets of rural 
deprivation and three wards  (Windmill Ward in  Kettering (previously known as 
Avondale Grange),  Kingswood & Hazel Leys in Corby , and Queensway in 
Wellingborough ) are  identified as ‘left behind  neighbourhoods ’ with significant levels 
of social  and economic  deprivation , typically characterised by  lacking pl aces to meet, 
barriers to  active and engaged community and perform ing less well on measures of 
social  connectivity5. Additionally, house prices are so high in some rural parts of 
North Northamptonshire that it is extremely difficult for lower incomes and new 
emerging households to be able to  buy or rent affordable housing.  
 
North Northamptonshire ha s a range of health inequalities, with a disproportionate 
number of  negative  health outcomes compared to the England average6. For 
example, North Northamptonshire is significantly worse than the average in England  
for adults who are overweight or obese , alcohol related hospital admissions , hospital 
admissions due to falls in 65+ years  and adult smoking.

The JCS sets out a spatial strategy for 
the area which outlines the role places 
play and how development is 
distributed between these places. This 
is an urban -focused strategy which  
identifies Corby, Kettering, 
Wellingborough and Rushden as 
Growth Towns  providi ng the focus for 
co-ordinated regeneration  and growth 
in jobs, housing , leisure, retail and 
services.  
Burton Latimer, Desborough, Higham 
Ferrers , Irthlingborough, Oundle , 
Raunds, Rothwell and Thrapston are 
defined as Market Towns with a scale 
of development related to existing 
commitments, infrastructure capacity , 
regeneration needs and local 
character, allowing the m to provide  a 
strong service role for the local 
community and wider rural hinterland. 
Development in the rural areas is 
limited to that required to support a 
prosperous rural economy or to meet a 
locally arising need, which cannot be 
met more sustainably at a nearby 
larger settlement. A key objective of 
the JCS is to maintain  distinctive and 
separate settlements by prevent ing 
coalescence .   
 
The current spatial  distribution of the housing requirement is set out in Table 1 which 
reproduces information from Table 5 of the JCS . One of the key issues  for the 
Strategic Plan  to consider is whether this  spatial  strategy remains appropriate or 
whether alternative options  for the dis tribution of development need to be 
considered . This is discussed further in this document .   
13 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 Vision and Outcomes  
 
Spatial Vision  
The JCS incorporates a  vision for North Northamptonshire  and sets out how the 
areas  and settlements within it  will contribute towards  its delivery  as follows:   
  
Vision  
By 2031, North Northamptonshire will be a showpiece for modern green living and well 
managed sustainable development: a resilient area where local choices have increased the 
ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to global economic changes. The 
special mixed urban -rural character of North Northamptonshire will have been maintained 
through urban -focused growth supporting a strong network of vibrant and regenerated 
settlements, which each maintain their separate and distinct character within an  enhanced 
green framework of living, working countryside.  
North Northamptonshire will be outward looking, taking advantage of its excellent strategic 
transport connectivity to be a nationally important growth area and focus for inward 
investment. Plan led  change will have made North Northamptonshire, its northern and 
southern sub -areas and individual settlements more self - reliant, with more choices available 
locally. Investment in infrastructure, services and facilities and growth in high quality jobs wil l 
have led to less need to travel and will have shaped places in a way that meets the needs 
and aspirations of local people. A strong focus on growing investment in tourism, leisure and 
green infrastructure will be balanced with the protection and enhancem ent of the area’s 
landscape character and its valuable built and natural environment.  
North Northamptonshire will be an exemplar for construction based innovation and the 
delivery of low carbon growth. Its high quality environment and prosperous economy w ill 
ensure it has a stronger profile within the UK and Europe; widely recognised as a safe, 
healthy, affordable and attractive area for residents and visitors, and an excellent place for 
business to invest in.  
Ecosystems will be protected and enhanced and  provision of ecosystem services increased 
where demand exists. The Rockingham Forest will be re -invigorated through major new tree 
planting, providing carbon storage and a focus for tourism, recreation and sustainable wood 
fuel production. Restored and ne wly created habitats in the Nene Valley Nature 
Improvement Area, will have delivered improvements for both wildlife and people and a step 
change in nature conservation whilst recognising its tourism potential.  
Contributing To This Overall Vision  
• Corby wi ll be well on the way to doubling its population and will offer international 
class culture and sport facilities. Enterprise areas will have promoted the town as a 
base for businesses leading the way in high performance technologies, creative 
industries an d the green economy. Smart and innovative regeneration and growth 
will have delivered a transformed, vibrant and growing Town Centre and sustainable 
urban extensions; together with a network of accessible natural green spaces 
forming the urban gateway to t he wider Rockingham Forest.  
 
• East Northamptonshire will be the heartland of small and medium sized enterprises, 
based on regenerated and thriving market towns with an enhanced role for Rushden 
as the District’s Growth Town. Implementation of the consented development at  
14 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 Rushden Lakes will have provided a new out of centre retail and leisure offer serving 
residents in the southern area of North Northamptonshire and delivering significant 
environmental benefits in the Nene Valley. Diverse, sustainable village s and a living, 
working countryside will provide the backdrop for tourism, creative industries and low 
carbon businesses to locate at the meeting point of the Nene Valley and Rockingham 
Forest.  
 
• Kettering will be the largest retail centre and its vibrant town centre, regarded for 
being characterful, distinctive and fun, will provide a focus for its surrounding market 
towns and villages. The town will be the focus for healthcare and will lead the way in 
renewable energy investment to strengthen the green ec onomy. Its business 
community will capitalise on its excellent connectivity, including its position on the 
Trans -European (E24 route) A14 and on the electrified Midland Mainline rail route.  
 
• Wellingborough will be the gateway to North Northamptonshire for  businesses 
looking for good rail connections to the south east and Europe, with a high profile 
office development centred on the railway station. Its historic core will be the heart of 
the community, serving the town and its prosperous satellite villages with a 
diversified retail, leisure and heritage offer.   
 
As the Strategic Plan  is updated it will be necessary to review the vision and 
consider how it can be extended to 2050. It is considered that whilst the existing 
vision remains relevant, it needs to  take into consideration important issues and 
opportunities that have emerged since the JCS was adopted , such as significant and 
ongoing changes to the planning system , as well as changing patterns to lifestyles 
accelerated through the Covid 19 pandemic. The vision will also need to be reviewed 
by taking into account the impact that existing major planning permissions may have 
on   the spatial strategy.   
Consultation question:  
1. Is the vision in the JCS still appropriate for guiding future development and 
growth in North Northamptonshire . Are there any changes you would like to 
see to the vision and why?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
15 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 Spatial O utcomes  
The JCS vision is supported by 10 Spatial Outcomes , the delivery of which is key to 
achieving the vision by 2031 : 
 
1. Empowered And Proactive Communities  
The Plan sets out a framework for place shaping, focusing on the issues that matter to local 
communities and providing a context within which community led planning initiatives can 
flourish and prosper. It seeks to create successful, safe , strong, cohesive and sustainable 
communities where residents are actively involved in shaping the places wher e they live.  
 
2. Adaptability To Future Climate Change  
The Plan will create more sustainable places that are naturally resilient to future climate 
change. Carbon footprints will be minimised and sustainable transport choice will be 
improved. Low carbon gr owth will be delivered through policies that seek the highest viable 
standards for energy efficiency, renewable energy and sustainable construction.  
 
3. Distinctive Environments That Enhance And Respect Local Character And Enhance 
Biodiversity  
The Plan se ts out a framework for retaining the area’s distinctiveness, by maintaining and 
enhancing landscape and townscape character. It promotes an integrated approach to 
biodiversity management and a net gain in Green Infrastructure, strengthening links between 
the countryside and the towns.  
 
4. Excellent Services And Facilities Easily Accessed By Local Communities And 
Businesses  
The Plan establishes the priorities for future public and private investment and collaboration. 
It will help to secure provision of the  infrastructure, services and facilities needed to sustain 
and enhance communities and support new development.  
 
5. A Sustainable Balance Between Local Jobs And Workers And A More Diverse 
Economy  
The Plan provides for the workplaces, jobs, skills and sites to help build a more diverse, 
dynamic and self -reliant economy; one which is not overly dependent on in or out 
commuting. Higher skilled jobs will be facilitated through improved further education 
provision and enterprise and innovation will be enabled through next generation digital 
connectivity. Provision will be made to capitalise upon existing sectoral strengths i n creating 
a stronger, greener economy.  
 
6. Transformed Connectivity  
The Plan seeks transformed connectivity at all levels. It sets out measures to enhance 
Neighbourhood Connectivity, establishes the requirement for inter urban transport links and 
for imp rovements to the strategic road network and main -line rail connections. It identifies 
the growth locations that will provide connections to and support the longer -term opportunity 
for the Northamptonshire Arc Rapid Transit network.  
 
7. More Walkable Places  And An Excellent Choice Of Ways To Travel  
The Plan identifies the actions needed in order to make walking the first choice of transport 
to local services and jobs including increasing connectivity to and from new development 
and the countryside and centres and ensuring that developments allow movement through 
them. It makes the links to the Local Transport Plan for the county, which identifies 
improvements to public transport, cycling networks and travel information that will encourag e 
a shift away from car use in the towns and increase transport choice in the rural area.   
16 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
  
8. Vibrant, Well Connected Towns And A Productive Countryside  
The Plan proposes sustainable urban -focused development and a proactive approach to 
meeting rural need s, supporting greater self -reliance for the area as a whole. The network of 
settlements will be strengthened through transformed public transport services within the 
north -south urban spine and out to the market towns in the east, with demand responsive 
services in the rural areas. Superfast broadband will support rural businesses, enable more 
working from home and assist the development of local food and fuel supply chains.  
 
9. Stronger, More Self -Reliant Towns With Thriving Centres  
The Plan proposes the regeneration of town centres and of older parts of towns will help to 
maximise the use of brownfield land for new development and inspire community confidence 
in the need for positive change. The Plan identifies the town centres at Kettering and Corby 
as areas of focus for leisure, retail and cultural facilities for the northern area, making them 
into real hearts for their communities. Implementation of the consented Rushden Lakes 
development will provide an additional retail and leisure focus serving the s outhern area, 
complementing Rushden and Wellingborough town centre, which will diversify and 
strengthen their convenience retail provision and cultural offers.  
 
10. Enhanced Quality Of Life For All Residents  
The Plan identifies the quality and mix of hous ing needed to meet the full, objectively 
assessed needs of the housing market area, ensuring that a sufficient proportion is 
affordable and accessible to all. It supports initiatives that build stable, safe, healthy and 
strong communities, which means resp ecting cultural diversity and distinctiveness; planning 
new development to help reduce crime, anti -social behaviour and the fear of crime; 
promoting well -being and health; ensuring that development is of local character; and 
supporting area based renewal.  
It is considered that the spatial outcomes remain relevant,  but the Strategic Plan will 
need to consider w hat changes are needed to the spatial outcomes  as it is 
developed .  
Consultation question:  
2. Are the spatial outcomes in the JCS still the most appropriate  ones for 
guiding development and growth in North Northamptonshire  in light of the 
issues discussed in this document .  What changes  to, or other outcomes 
would you like to see?

 Relationship with Oxford -Cambridge Arc  
 
The Oxford -Cambridge Arc has been identified by the Government as a key 
economic priority. The Government set out that it want ed to support sustainable 
economic growth in the Arc  by developing an Arc Spatial Framework ( ASF) to plan 
for that growth to 2050 and beyond. It was thought that  the ASF would form both 
national planning policy and transport policy for the Arc and local planning and local 
transport authorities must have regard to it when preparing local transport and local 
development plans and polic ies. It would also be capable of being a material 
consideration in relevant planning decisions in the area.  
 
Figure 2: The Oxford -Cambridge Arc  
 
Source: Creating a Vision for the Oxford -Cambridge Arc Consultation  
Consultation on  the Vision for the ASF  was undertaken between July and October 
2021.  The consultation  document7 set out that the ASF would have sustainability  at 
its core and guide planning decisions and investment under four policy  ‘pillars’  The 
Environment, The Economy, Connectivity and Infrastructure and Place -making. The 
Government is currently analysing the respon ses to the consultation and is preparing 
its response which is expected to be published imminently . There is currently 
considerable uncertainty over progress  with the ASF. Should the ASF not be 
progressed as previously anticipated , the Strategic Plan  will seek to respond to 
relevant opportunities that arise within the Arc, and these are ref lected within this 
document.  
Consultation question : 
3. How should the S trategic Plan respond to the Oxford -Cambridge Arc?

 What period should the Plan cover?  
 
Timeframe for the Strategic Plan   
 
The NPPF  expects  strategic policie s to look ahead  at least 15 years post adoption  
and to ensure that large scale growth is set within a vision of at least 30 years.  As 
previously discussed, Government is currently preparing the ASF which looks to 
2050.  It is proposed that the statutory period of the  Strategic  Plan will be 2021 to 
2041, with the spatial vision extending to 2050 to align with the ASF  and to meet the 
requirements of the  NPPF .  
This is because those aspects of the plan which must be evidence based, such as 
housing and job numbers, are better suite d to this shorter time horizon  and it should 
help to demonstrate  that the plan is deliverable . However, a longer -term view on 
climate change will also be evidenced as part of a holistic, long -term approach.  It is 
proposed that where possible, evidence to i nform the S trategic Plan will look to 
2050.  
Consultation question : 
4. Do you agree that  the plan-period  should be  2021 to 2041 ? If not, what 
should it be and wh y?

 The Council declared a climate and 
environment emergency on 28th July 
2021. Responding to the Climate 
Emergency is a priority area for the 
Council , with a Climate Change Task 
and Finish Group established to 
identify recommendations and actions 
the Council could undertake to 
facilitate climate change adaptation 
and mitigation locally, amongst other 
objectives.  This work has culminated 
in the publication of a draft Climate 
Change Framework which contains 
several recommendations for the 
Council to implement (s ubject to public 
consultation)8. Within this draft 
framework, recommendations are 
made on a thematic basis across 
those areas the Council has influence 
over. With regards to “Planning, 
Transport, Energy, Natural and Built 
Environment”, the framework  makes 
several recommendations of particular 
relevance to the S trategic Plan which  
are reflected in this document.   
 
The Task and Finish Group recommended that the Council “ supports a growing 
North Northamptonshire  that future developments embed proven low carbon 
technology, sustained and improved green infrastructure, and sustainable forms of 
transport fit for the future ”. These elements are already contained within the JCS and 
will be taken forward  and refined  as the S trategic Plan is developed.  
 
Responding to climate  change will be at the heart of the plan, with ambitious  but 
deliverable  policies, consistent with social, economic, and environmental objectives, 
and with legislation and national policy.  The plan must be based on robust evidence, 
including a credible pathway  which outl ines how North Northamptonshire will achieve  
net zero by 2050 at the latest. Technical work will explore the potential to accelerate 
this to reach net zero sooner.  Consideration will  also need to be  given to  targets set 
out in the ASF which builds on England’s Economic Heartland transport strategy in 
aiming for net zero carbon emissions from transport by 2040, but no later than 2050.  
 
Taking account of climatic projections, a ll elements of the Plan will need  to deliver  
development, including patterns of development, which reduces greenhouse gas

 emissions locally as part of the area’s wider contribution to national  objectives . This 
will include consideration of  the amount and  distribution of development , how people 
travel within and beyond North Northamptonshire, it’s environment and 
environmental opportunities and the approach to building design and standards. It 
will be important that the Strategic Plan focuses on elements that it can influence , 
which will form part of the Council ’s wider  approach to climate change.  
North Northamptonshire has been subject to serious flooding in recent years, 
including in areas that have not been previously known to flood, with climate change 
and extreme levels of rainfall playing a role in this. Despite this, North 
Northamptonshire is  in the driest region of the UK with low rainfall (71% of the UK 
average) and high evaporation losses. Water resources are already under pressure 
and the region is designated as an area of serious water stress by the Environment 
Agency where opportunities for new water resources are limited.   
The approach to climate change will consider both adaptation and mitigation  
measures across both the built and natural environment  as well as ensuring 
resilience to climate change . These measures may include:   
• The sustainability standards of buildings ;  
• Locating new development to minimise the risk of flooding , protecting water 
quality and maximising water efficiency ; 
• limiting the need to travel by car, particularly for short journeys ; 
• Identifying opportunities for renewable and low carbon energy generation and the 
associated infrastructure ; 
• multifunctional greenspace  that can support carbon storage  and address 
overheating , flooding and soil erosion  
The plan will also look to build upon existing JCS policies and initiatives that respond 
to climate change, including the Rockingham Forest for Life9. The design and future 
sustainability of development will be a key consideration in the approach to climate 
change and the Strategic Plan  presents an opportunity to fully integrat e land-use and 
transport planning around efforts to address the C limate Emergency.  
 
Consultation questions:  
5. What is a realistic and deliverable pathway  for reaching  net zero  for the 
Strategic Plan? 
6. What are the key measures that the plan should take to ensure appropriate 
climate change adaptation, mitigation and resilience?

Corporate Plan Priorities:  
 
1. Active, fulfilled lives  
• Improve the accessibility and use of 
leisure, culture, art and sport  
• Tackle the causes of complex problems 
such as poverty and homelessness  
3. Safe and thriving places

5. Connected Communities  
• Inform and listen to our communities, 
giving them a greater say in their future   
 
 
The Corporate Plan announces the 
Council’s intention to support our 
communities , recover from the 
pandemic and help them level -up.  
The Government  published the 
Levelling Up White Paper in February 
2022. It sets  out a detailed strategy to 
‘level up’ and help ‘left behind’ areas of 
the country, including devolved p owers 
and a series of wide -ranging national 
missions to be achieved by 2030. The 
national missions  include : closing the 
gap in healthy lifestyle expectancy; 
improving local transport connectivity ; 
providing access to 5G broadband for 
most of the population; improving 
people’s satisfaction with town centres 
and local culture; and raising the level 
of high -quality skills training.    
The opportunity for the S trategic Plan 
to contribute to the achievement of the 
national missions and reduce 
inequalities within and between 
communities and ensure a social and 
economic recovery from the pandemic 
is very significant.  The pandemic has 
exposed and exacerbated existing 
inequalities, i ndicating a  need for 
additional action  to support 
communities most in need.  
 
The JCS coordinate s and facilitate s a nationally significant scale of growth in North 
Northamptonshire , with significant levels of housing accompanied by new and 
improved infrastructure of all types. This has helped level up communities by 
increasing housing options, transforming town centr es, improving access to open  
22 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 spaces and green infrastructure, spreading opportunities for employment, and 
enhancing access to community and cultural facilities. Yet there are still significant  
inequalities within North Northamptonshire with some 37,400 hou seholds 
experiencing some form of income deprivation, and 11,530 households in fuel 
poverty , whilst  Kingswood and Hazel Leys in Corby, Windmill  Ward in Kettering , and 
Queensway in Wellingborough are among the most deprived neighbourhoods in the 
country identified as ‘left behind’10. 
Reinforcing the approach to the levelling up agenda is important to residents and a 
priority area for the Council , who have established a Scrutiny Commission to review 
and understand data, engage local stakeholders, and make recommendations to 
develop a levelling up plan focussed on the three areas identified as ‘left behind 
neighbourhoods’ . It is recognised that that any insights gathered through the scrutiny 
review could apply to other wards and areas across North Northamptonshire.  
The S trategic Plan will take forward the findings of the Scrutiny Commission and 
build on the existing JCS policies and initiatives including support for well -designed, 
energy efficient and affordable housing, supporting regeneration  of brownfield sites, 
and improving acces s to green spaces, health care and social infrastructure, that 
help to level up communities and ensure a social and economic recovery from the 
pandemic, in order to support the Council’s priorities and respond to the 
Government’s White Paper. It will suppo rt and deliver for all areas of North 
Northamptonshire. However, working with partners will also target those 
communities experiencing the greatest level of deprivation and he alth inequality.   
Consultation question s: 
7. How can the S trategic Plan help to level up and ensure no community is left 
behind ? 
8. Are there priority areas for levelling up  that the plan should focus on ?

 The Strategic Plan  will contain policies 
that set out the overall spatial strategy 
for the distribution of development.  
The current urban -focused growth 
strategy set out in the JCS gives hig h 
priority to the reuse of suitable 
brownfield  sites within the Growth 
Towns  and Market Towns, particularly 
where they can be served by public 
transport. It is underpinned by  
Sustainable Urban Extensions (SUEs) 
(also known as Garden Communities) 
which will be delivered up to and 
beyond 2031 . 
As of 1st April 202 1, there have been  
2,752  completions at the Garden 
Communities and there were  
outstanding commitments for  23,116 
dwellings. Of these, 13,349 dwellings  
are expected to be delivered in the 
period to 2031, with the remaining 
9,767 dwellings delivered post 2031 .  
Of these Garden Communities, the 
JCS identifies West Corby, Priors Hall 
and Weldon Park (North -East C orby), 
Hanwood Park (Kettering East), 
Glenvale Park (Wellingborough North) , 
Stanton Cross (Wellingborough East)  
and Rushden East  as Principal SUEs. 
The JCS sets out at paragraph  5.10 
that “ Subject to detailed assessment, 
the expansion of the principal SUEs  
identified in Figure 16 is likely to make 
best use of infrastructure investment 
and support the viability of these 
developments ”.

Monitoring shows that between 2011 and 202 1 there has been less housing delivery 
at the Growth Towns than anticipated and more than anticipated  at the Market 
Towns , 4 named villages  and in rural areas11. This can be explained by the time 
taken for the Garden Communities to come forward and it is likely that the Growth 
Towns will continue to see further increases in the coming years as more of the 
Garden Communities begin to build at a  more rapid pace.  
 
 
 
Alongside the focus on Garden Communities as locations for large -scale growth, 
Policy 14 of the JCS identifies the opportunity to create an exemplary Garden Village 
                                                           
11 The JCS sets out housing requirements for Growth Towns, Market Towns, the four largest villages of Earls 
Barton, Finedon, Irchester and Wollaston in Wellingborough referred to as villages and baseline level of 
growth that should be planned for in the Rural Areas of each former district/borough  
 
25 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 at Deenethorpe airfield and sets out demanding standards for its des ign and 
operation. This is being taken forward as Tresham Garden Village, which is one of 
14 garden village projects that the Government is supporting through capacity 
funding and assistance from Homes England. This support has enabled the 
preparation of a  detailed masterplan and delivery strategy which will form the basis 
of a planning application.  
 
The current approach for rural areas  is for limited  development  required to support a 
prosperous rural economy or to meet a locally arising need, e.g. affordable housing, 
which  cannot be met more sustainably at a nearby larger settlement.      
 
Policies  that set out the overall spatial strategy for the distr ibution of development  in 
the S trategic Plan will need to facilitate  sustainable development to meet local needs 
and support  measures to both mitigate  and adapt to climate change and address 
inequalities.  They will be key to delivering levelling up in North Northamptonshire. 
Transport i s the largest source of emissions that the Council can influence, so the 
plan will need to focus on a sustainable pattern of development that reduces the 
need to travel, encourages model shift and facilitate other measures such as 
enabling a switch to elec tric vehicles, cycling and walking, including the provision of 
supporting infrastructure.  The extent of existing commitments  (sites with planning 
permission , allocated in local plans  and other identified supply ) will strongly influence 
the future spatial strategy alongside infrastructure capacity, the need to reduce 
carbon emissions and environmental opportunities and constraints.   
 
Respecting and strengthening the different identities of the towns, villages and rural 
communities in North Northamptonshire is a key priority in the Corporate Plan. This 
will be underpinned by the spatial strategy of the Strategic Plan. It will continue to 
support suitable brownfield development and regeneration opportunities, particu larly 
within town centres.   
A key consideration for the S trategic Plan will be  whether to continue with an urban 
focused growth strategy or  consider other sp atial options for development such as:  
 
• Dispersal  - Growth in villages wi th appropriate infrastructure and  sufficient access 
to services and facilities .  
• New settlements  - The potential for freestanding new settlements  and the future 
role of Tresham Garden Village .  
• Corridor -based growth  - The potential to focus growth alongside infrastructure 
improvements alongside key transport corridors either existing or proposed.  
• Empl oyment focus  - The potential to focus residential development along side 
existing or proposed strategic employment areas.      
 
Consultation questions : 
 
9. Should future needs be met by continuing  with the current strategy of 
urban -focused growth . If not, why?   
10. Are there any other spatial options not already identified  in the 
consultation document that should be considered?

 Housing  
 
Corporate Plan Priorities:  
 
1. Active, fulfilled lives  
• Tackle the causes of complex problems 
such as poverty and homelessness  
3. Safe and thriving places  
• Strengthen the c ultural identity of 
towns, villages and rural communities  
• Improve the standard of new and 
existing homes and ensure housing 
supply meets demand  
• Tackle the causes of difficult issues 
leading to nuisance, crime and anti -
social behaviour  
 
 
 
 Ensuring that the right  number and 
type of houses are delivered across 
North Northamptonshire are key 
issues for the Strategic Plan  to 
address  and can play a leading role in 
addressing the dual challenge of 
levelling up and climate change . The 
Strategic Plan  will set out t he number 
of new homes to be provided across 
North Northamptonshire and the 
distribution of these  based on the 
spatial strate gy for the distribution of 
development .   
Within this context, the size, type, and 
tenure of housing needed for different 
groups will be identified including the 
proportion of the overall housing 
requirement that should be affordable.   
In the JCS housing figures are provided by former LPA area and distributed in a way 
that supports the settlement hierarchy. Housing requirements are provided for 
Growth Towns, Market Towns and named villages with rural housing requirements 
also set out. T he NPPF sets out at paragraph  66 that within the overall housing 
requirement, strategic policies should also set out a housing requirement for 
designated neighbourhood areas which reflects the overall strategy for the pattern 
and scale of development and a ny relevant allocations.    
From 15th July 2021 five -year housing  supply  is being measured  against Local 
Housing Need ( LHN) for the North Northamptonshire Housing Market area  as whole  
based on a calculation in accordance with the Government’s standard methodology .  
The Strategic Plan will need to consider the future approach  for assessing  housing 
land supply  (HLS).  
 
How much housing do we need to plan for?  
 
Local Housing Need  
 
In terms of the overall scale of housing growth that the plan needs to plan for, the 
NPPF identifies at paragraph  61 that to determine the minimum number of homes 
needed, strategic policies should be informed by a local housing need assessment, 
conducted u sing the standard method in national planning guidance unless 
exceptional circumstances justify an alternative approach. The latest LHN for North 
Northamptonshire is 1,784 net additional dwellings per annum  which would equate to  
27 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 35,680 dwellings over the p eriod 2021 -2041.  This is  very similar to the 35,000 new 
dwellings identified in the JCS  for the period 2011 -2031 .   
LHN could change over the plan period or if the standard methodology changes.  The 
Council has commissioned consultants to update evidence on housing and 
economic needs in North Northamptonshire , referred to as a Housing and Economic 
Needs Assessment (HENA).  
 
Uplift for contingencies  
 
The LHN figure provides a  minimum starting point in determining the  number of 
homes needed in an area. It will be importan t for the Strategic Plan  to consider 
whether an uplift  should be provided to the LHN to provide additional choice and 
flexibility and contingency for any delivery issues that may arise  or to assist with  
delivering key aims for the area .  
In considering potentia l levels of u plift, issues such as impact on infrastructure, 
market saturation, etc will need to be assessed. It will also be necessary to consider 
the distribution of potential uplift . Feedback is sought  on whether North 
Northamptonshire  should plan for an uplift above LHN , and what the extent of this 
should be.  To determine the most appropriate level of housing it will be important to 
factor in the outcomes of further work regarding specific housing needs (including 
mix of housing sizes, types and tenures for different gro ups, including proportion of 
affordable housing) which will be informed by the HENA and the relationship with the 
economy of the area, recognising the need for a sustainable balance between 
homes and jobs, as set out in the current JCS.  
 
Current housing supply  
 
To identify what provision the plan will need to make it is important to look at  existing 
housing supply  as this will determine the number of sites that will need to be 
identified . As described above, this existing supply will also strongly  influence the 
spatial strategy of the Strategic Plan .  Given the plan will run from 2021 to 2041 
there is  clearly a significant level of supply already identified  to come forward through 
the JCS, specifically at the Garden Communities and additional site allocations  
within the Part 2 Local Plans.  The evidence base informing the Strategic Plan  will 
need to demonstrate that there is sufficient supply of deliverable housing sites to 
meet the requirements. This will be informed by  monitoring of  housing delivery and a 
technical assessment in a Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment 
(HELAA).  Across North Northamptonshire as at 1st April 202 1 existing  committed  
supply amounts to 35,308  dwellings  to 2041 . When considering  this supply against  
the LHN requirement of 35,680 (1,784 x 20) dwellings between 2021-41, this leaves 
a shortfall  of 372 dwell ings to be found in this period to meet the requirement.   
The NPPF sets out that  any housing  needs that cannot be met  within neighbouring 
areas should be taken account in establishing the amount of housing to be planned 
for. The Council  has and  will continue to  work  across geographical boundaries and  
with adjoining  authorities  through the duty to cooperate  to establish if any unmet 
need should be provided for in t he plan. However,  this has not been raised  as an  
28 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 issue to address  through ongoing discussions  with adjoining authorities  and local 
plan development  to date .  
 
Consulta tion question:  
11. Should the Strategic Plan  set out a provision for housing  above L ocal 
Housing Need? If so, w hat should this  uplift  be? 
 
How to diversify the Market ? 
 
The issue of delivery, particularly on larger sites is a nationwide issue that has been 
recognised by Government.  A number of the Garden Communities have not 
progressed as quickly as expected.  Substantial work has gone into progressing the 
Garden Communities including seeking to resolve viability and infrastructure issues  
with support f rom Homes England . It is expected  that delivery at the G arden 
Communities  will accelerate  and will be a key element of the Strategic Plan .  
Reliance on a small number of large developers and housebuilders  is identified in 
the N orth Northamptonshire Infrastructure Framework (NNIF ) as a factor affecting 
delivery. Several of  the same volume housebuilders are  particularly active  across the 
area’s  key development sites, and whilst  they offer scale of operation and speed of 
progress, residential build out rates can  often be affected by capacity pinch points , 
customer sales and competition. This points to a potential need to broaden the range 
of house builders operating across North Northamptonshire’s main development 
sites, making these opportunities  available to a diverse range of providers including 
SMEs, custom and self -builders and potentially the Council .                       
A series of government reviews into housing supply, including  the Letwin review12 
(October 2018) and Bacon review13 (August 2021) , identified possible measures  to 
seek to increase the supply of new homes to the market , including Modern Methods 
of Construction and  diversifying the housing offer on strategic site s through different 
tenures  and house types including ensuring sufficient plots for self -build/custom -build 
housing. This will be an important issue for this plan to address.  
Consultation question:  
12. What measures could the plan  include to diversify the housing offer  or 
otherwise increase the rates of housing delivery?

 What type of housing do we need to plan for?   
 
Locally, there are some wide variations in house prices, however generally prices 
have increased at a faster rate than the England average. Although cheaper than the 
rest of the country, prices are higher than the average for the East Midlands and  
remain u naffordable to many local households14. An average priced property in North 
Northamptonshire is significantly higher than  the average income. North 
Northamptonshire is not delivering the amount of affordable housing sought in the 
JCS, and the economic viabi lity of  deliver ing affordable housing has been identified 
as a key issue in the Garden Communities  and other sites . The unaffordability of 
housing can have significant social consequences, including for those on low 
incomes and key workers . 
Within the context of the overall housing requirement, the NPPF sets out that the 
size, type and tenure of housing needed for different groups in the community should 
be assessed and reflected in planning policies . This work will be informed  by the 
HENA , and will also inform the following : 
• The level of affordable housing that needs to be provided for  and the size, 
type and tenure , including what threshold shoul d be applied.  
• What the specific needs  are for specialist accommodation , such as sheltered 
housing, extra care housing and care homes, residential care and supported 
living . This will need to take account o f the age profile of the area  and 
recognise  an increasingly ag eing population.  
• Types and te nures of housing .  
Consultation question:  
13. Are there any particular types of specialist housing that you feel there 
should be more of ? Do you have any evidence to support this?  
 
How do we ensure the houses are of good quality and fit for purpose ? 
 
To ensure that North Northamptonshire  continues to be an attractive place to live the 
quality of housing is important.  The government recognised this by introducing the 
following optional national standards:  
• Accessibility and wheelchair housing standards  
• Wate r efficiency standards  
• Internal space standards  
The JCS applies these optional standards  and some of the Part 2 Local Plans  take 
this forward . The evidence being undertaken to identify specific housing needs will

30 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 need to consider the need for, and how these standards should be applied moving 
forward.  
Following a public consultation on measures to reduce personal water use in 2019, 
the Government published a Written Ministerial Statement15 in July 2021 
encouraging local authorities to adopt a tighter standard of 110 litre s per person per 
day for new homes where appropriate, and a roadmap towards greater water 
efficiency in new developments and through retrofits, including options such as 
rainwater harvesting, water re -use and storage options. These measures will help 
meet the ambitions set out in the Environme nt Agency’s National Framework for 
Water Resources. Policy 9 of the JC S includes the tighter water efficiency standard 
which sets out that all residential develop ment should incorporate measures to limit 
use of water to 110 litres per person per day for areas of water stress.  
Government announced changes to the Building Regulations that will take effect in 
June 2022 as part of its response to the Future Building Standards consultation . 
Under the new regulations, CO2 emissions from new build homes must be around 
30% lower than current standards and  emissions from other new buildings, including 
offices and shops, must be reduced by 27%. These changes will raise standards and 
are an important step towards a cleaner greener built environment, paving the way 
for the Future Homes and Buildings Standard i n 2025, which will mean all future 
homes are net zero ready and will not need retrofitting.  
The Strategic Plan  will explore  the potential  to exceed Building Regulation energy 
efficiency standards in advance of the introduction of the Future Homes  and 
Buildings  Standard.  
Consultation question s: 
14. Should the Strategic Plan maintain the approach to  accessibility and space 
standards  that are set out in the JCS? Is there any ev idence to support 
exceeding these?  
15. Could the Strategic Plan improve the approach to environmental standards 
in homes? If so, what could be improved and is there any evidence to support 
this?  
 
 
Gypsy and Trav eller Accommodation  
 
A Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment for North Northamptonshire was 
published in March 201916. It sets out pitch and plot requirements for the period 2018 
to 2033 for the permanent and temporary accommodation needs for both gypsies 
and travellers and travelling show people.

31 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
  
Currently a dual approach to traveller site/pitch provision is adopted in North 
Northamptonshire. The J CS includes Policy 31 that allows sites coming forward 
through the planning application process to be considered. The Part 2 Local Plans 
and emerging Local Development Scheme refer to the preparation of a North 
Northamptonshire Gypsy and Traveller Sites Allocation Policy Development Plan 
Document that will identify sites to meet the accommodation nee ds of gypsies and 
travellers and travelling show people.  
 
Improving the standard of new and existing homes and ensuring housing supply 
meets demand is a priority for the Corporate Plan. Having no permanent 
accommodation can adversely affect any traveller. Providing permanent and 
temporary accommodation improves the ability to meet other primary needs, 
especially health, education, and access to employment.  
 
The Council is seeking to commission consultants to undertake additional work to 
better understand th e accommodation needs and a variety of options to meet these 
needs. Options for making provision, which will be properly assessed through the 
development plan process and planning applications, could include extensions of 
existing lawful sites, accommodati ng additional pitches on existing lawful sites, 
potential enforcement of sites occupied by non -travellers, and new site provision.  
 
A key issue to consider  is whether the criteria for assessing planning applications 
and site allocations set out in Policy 31  of the JCS  remains appropriate and relevant 
to inform these options.  
 
Consultation question s:  
 
16. Do you agree with the current policy approach to accommodating gypsies 
and travellers and travelling show people? Please explain your answer.  
 
17. Is Policy 31 of the Joint Core Strategy still appropriate for assessing 
planning applications? Are there any changes you would like to see and why?  
 
 
Housing in Multiple Occupation  
Houses in Multiple Occupation , or HMOs as they are commonly referred to, are 
recognised as meeting important and specific housing needs. However, concern has 
been expressed by local councillors and residents in some areas of North 
Northamptonshire about the number, distribution and impact of HMOs. Some of 
these comments have suggested that it may be appropriate to restrict the scope of 
permitted development rights with the application of Article 4 direction to enable the 
creation of new HMOs to be managed in these areas.  
 In response to these concerns and s uggestions, the Council is undertaking an 
exercise to investigate the options available to effectively control and manage 
HMOs. Initial investigative work has highlighted that there is no specific policy in the 
existing Local Plan that relates specifically  to HMOs a pplications.   
32 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 It is recognised that the re are   policies that relate to the  considerations required to 
assess the suitability of an application for HMOs, such as Policy 8 of the JCS which 
ensures that development responds to the site’s immediate character and protects 
the amenity by not resulting in an unacceptable impact upon fu ture occupiers or 
neighbouring residents , however,  strengthening the planning policy position through 
the inclusion of a  specific policy within the Strategic Plan  for assessing the suitability 
of an application for HMOs  is potentially an option that could be explored further . 
This could comprise  clear guidance to prospect ive developers of HMOs on the key 
standards, assessments, and evidence that the Council require to properly consider 
and assess applications.  
 
 
Consultation question:  
 
18. Should the Strategic Plan  contain a policy regarding Housing in Multiple 
Occupation ? If yes, please explain.

 Economic Growth  
 
Corporate Plan Priorities:  
 
1. Active, fulfilled lives  
• Tackle the causes of complex problems 
such as poverty and homelessness  
3. Safe and thriving places  
• Strengthen the cultural identity of 
towns, villages and rural communities  
• Help town centres and villages respond 
to changing trends  
• Attract tourism, visitors and inward 
investment  
• Working with local busi nesses and 
partners to support the creation of 
high -quality, better -skilled jobs  
• Enable people to travel across North 
Northamptonshire and beyond  
4. Greener, sustainable environment  
• Embed low carbon technology, 
sustained and improved green 
infrastructure, and sustainable forms of 
transport fit for the future  
• Protect the countryside and open 
spaces, and enhance the natural 
environment and ecology   
 
The S trategic Plan will set out an 
economic vision  and strategy to 
strengthen and diversify the economy . 
Existing sectoral  strengths, 
opportunities provided by the Oxford -
Cambridge Arc and implications 
arising from the Covid -19 pandemic 
including changes to working patterns 
will be important considerations.  
The plan will also set out an overall 
jobs target for North 
Northamptonshire, distribution of this 
and identification of strategic locations 
for new employment land. The HEN A 
will provide evidence to inform the 
employment strategy and land 
requirements.
  
The JCS aims to make North Northamptonshire more economically self -reliant by  
achievin g a sustainable balance between local jobs and workers and  a more 
prosperous and diverse economy.  Key elements of this  strategy  include  planning for 
enough jobs to  match the forecast  growth in labour force  plus an additional number 
in the southern area  of North Northamptonshire  to reduce reliance on out -
commutin g, resulting in a  target for 31,100 net additional jobs over the period 2011 -
2031 . In addition, the JCS  aims to ensure the right amount and type of employment 
land is available in locations that balance the demands of the market with the 
capacity of infrastructure and the n eed to protect and where possible enhance the 
environment.  
Business Register and Employment Survey  (BRES ) data indicates that in the period 
2011 -2020 North Northamptonshire has delivered a net increase of 2 2,000 jobs  and 
would appear to be well on its way to meeting job targets . However, this data does 
not take account of the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic, and it will be important to 
monitor this closely.  
 
  
34 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 Sectoral strengths and opportunitie s 
 
The JCS identifies sectoral strengths a nd opportunities in logistics , high performance 
technologies, particularly related to motorsport and renewable  and low carbon 
energy and green technologies.  Existing sector strengths identified in the North 
Northamptonshire Economic prospectus17 include Logistics, Manufacturing, Retail 
and Leisure and Visitor economy  including tourism . 
From a commercial property market perspective18, North Northamptonshire 
accommodates two broad market areas. The main focus of market activity is 
industrial  (General Industrial and  Logistics) , with office markets considered to be 
weaker and more secondary.   
North Northamptonshire has seen strong g rowth  and demand for logistics  due to its 
central location and excellent strategic road connections . As land supply has  
tightened in the ‘Golden Triangle ’19, availability of sites has decreased and 
occupa tion costs have increased, making sites in areas such as North 
Northamptonshire more attractive.  The Strategic Plan  and evidence being developed 
will need to consider how to respond to the demand for logistics floorspace  and 
consider how the poten tial economic benefits can be balanced against impacts , 
including impacts of HGV movements  including emissions , visual, landscape and 
amenity impacts.  
Despite being one of the fastest growing areas in the UK in recent years in terms of 
housing delivery, and with tens of thousands more houses in the pipeline, North 
Northamptonshire has struggled to deliver higher value jobs and has lagged behind 
other areas of the Arc in this respect with our  Gross Value Added20 (GVA ) amongst 
the lowest in the Arc.  The economic base of some parts of North Northamptonshire 
has be en characterised by low skilled and low paid activities, with wages not keeping 
up with the cost of housing to create issues of local affordability, despite being one of 
the most affordable parts of the Arc.  There are a number of constraints which are 
hamp ering development in the wider area, including viability, electrical capacity and 
access to suitable workforce.  
A key challenge for the Strategic Plan  will be to deliver higher -value, higher skilled 
employment  and routes into such employment . Against the backdrop of the Oxford -
Cambridge Arc and national Industrial Strategy, significant opportunities exist to 
achieve a step change in the area’s commercial property market performance, if 
                                                           
17 This Economic Prospectus presents an overarching economic narrative for North Northamptonshire to 
articulate existing economic strengths and USPs and focus attention on key opportunity areas to maximise its 
growth potential and realise growth priorities. It is placed within the context of the area’s wider amenity offer 
and underpinning place shaping ambitions which seek to ensure that development is genuinely sustainable 
and inclusive by creating places where  people want to live, work and do business.

 suitable infrastructure a nd sites can be provided to attract and grow high value, 
innovative business activity to complement ongoing population and housing growth.  
This will also require provision of sufficie nt skilled training facilities and resources, 
enterprise support and Rese arch & Development through links to universities, further 
education.   
The Economic  prospectus21 identifies sector opportunities and growth potential as 
renewable and low carbon energy (referencing Chelveston  Renewable Energy Park 
as a case study), high performance technologies, life sciences and construction.  
Opportunities for renewable energy creation/use will be explored  in the Strategic 
Plan with work to be commissioned to  inform this.   
The v isitor economy  is identified as a sector strength in the economic prospectus. 
The prospectus recognises that North Northamptonshire offers iconic landscapes 
and outdoor activities that support a growing visitor economy. The area is home to 
beautiful unspoilt countryside , historic market towns and attractive villages, together 
with a unique collection of historic houses and diverse range of arts festivals and 
other cultural events. This is complemented by an ever -expanding leisure and 
hospitality offer within the area’s u rban centres.  These pro vide opportunities to 
enhance the tourism offer  whilst protecting and enhancing assets .  
The prospectus sets out that the key opportunity for North Northamptonshire going 
forward is to align new employment generation with sector opportunities identified 
across the wider Oxford -Cambridge Arc economic area, and in doing so, support 
higher value business growth  and activity. The Strategic Plan  and its evidence base 
will consider how to capitalise on these opportunities and  will set the  strategic priority 
framework for supporting the creati on of high -quality, better skilled jobs.  
Although the plan will need to p lan for employment needs and land requirements, 
North Northamptonshire has a significant over -supply of employment land, 
particularly in the Corby and Kettering areas. The S trategic Plan and evid ence base 
being developed will need to consider whether sites that have not come forward 
should be de -allocated or brought forward for another use  or whether alternative 
methods of delivery can be used e.g. public sector delivery .  
    
Skills  
 
A key element in delivering higher value jobs relates to skills  and this is a key priority 
within the Corporate Plan . This includes supporting key sectors such as construction 
and renewable energy.  Education and training are at the heart of government plans 
to level up left behind areas. North Northamptonshire has consistently been one of 
the fastest growing areas in the UK yet despite this it has no Higher Education facility 
for local residents to access, with the result bei ng a net loss of people (particularly 
younger residents) from the area, and who often do not return.

 Town Centres  
 
Corporate Plan Priorities:  
 
1. Active, fulfilled lives  
• Improve the accessibility and use of 
leisure, culture, art and sport  
3. Safe and thriving places  
• Strengthen the cultural identity of 
towns, villages and rural communities  
• Help town centres and villages respond 
to changing trends  
• Attract tourism, visitors a nd inward

North Northamptonshire consists  of a 
network of  12 town centres from the 
Growth Towns to Market Towns.  The 
town centres  in North 
Northamptonshire are the focus  for 
retail, leisure and cultural facilities and 
provide significant  employment. They 
also act as the heart of their 
communities and serve the ir 
surrounding rural area s, whilst also 
offering opportunities for regeneration 
over the coming years.   
 
The JCS retail strategy  seeks to maintain and regenerate Kettering and Corby town 
centres as the focus of higher order facilities and retail investment serving growing 
communities in the north of North Northamptonshire , including a minimum increase 
of 12,500 sqm net comparison s hopping floorspace in each of Corby and Kettering 
town centres by 2031. In the south of North Northamptonshire , the retail strategy 
recognises that the Rushden Lakes retail and leisure  development will account for 
most, if not all, of the forecast additional comparison spending in the southern area 
and will also divert some trade from existing shopping locations.   
Town centres across North Northamptonshire have changed  and evolved  
significantly over recent years , due to the growth in online shopping, the Covid -19 
pandemic , which has  had, and continues to have a significant impact,  and the 
opening of the Rushden Lakes development. Changes to Permitted Development 
rights will also affect the future of town centres.  As shopping patterns have changed,  
cultural led regeneration is ev olving the way town centres connect with people in 
North Northamptonshire, so they continue to act as the heart of the community.  The 
Corporate Plan sets out that t he Council will reimagine and redesign key town 
centres to help respond to changing trends in shopping, leisure and living, with 
developed masterplans  and identif ication  of opportunities for public realm 
improvements .       
Town centre regeneration is ongoing in North Northamptonshire  and the area  has 
benefitted from significant funding  to deliver this . Kettering has received funding to  
38 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 deliver a High Street Heritage Action Zone22 (HSHAZ)  and Corby has been awarded 
£19.9m of the government’s Towns Fund, it is hoped the money will pay for a new 
sixth form centre and an improved  walking and cycling  route fro m the town centre to 
the railway station.  Government funding is also being provided through the ‘Welcome 
Back Fund23’.  
The Strategic Plan  will provide updated policy  guidance and strategy for town  
centres and retail development taking account of the impact of policy changes and 
social/economic implications including Covid -19. This will include a review of 
comparison floorspace requirements.  It will be necessary to think about how the 
Council will reimagine and redesign key town centres and how the Strategic Plan  
can support regeneration and economic recovery from Covid 19 as well as ensure 
that town centres play a role in helping to address the climate emergency,  meet 
housing need s, provide necessary services and facilities, and support people’s 
health and wellbeing.  Updated retail and town centre evidence is being 
commissioned to inform this approach  and will consider what uses or facilities should 
be permitted within town centres to attract people to use them .  
Beyond the town centres  are a variety of out -of-centre locations , including the 
significant  Rushden Lakes  shopping and leisure sc heme . The Strategic Plan  will 
need to consider the future role of out-of-centre locations . 
Consultation questions:  
26. How can the Strategic Plan support town centres so they continue to act as 
the heart of their communities ?  
27. What should the future role of Rushden Lakes and other out -of-centre 
locations be?

 Strategic Development Locations and Opportunities  
 
Corporate Plan Priorities:  
 
3. Safe and thriving places  
• Strengthen the cultural identity of 
towns, villages and rural communities  
• Help town centres and villages respond 
to changing trends  
• Attract tourism, visitors and inward 
investment  
• Working with local businesses and 
partners to support the creation of 
high -quality, better -skilled jobs  
• Improve the standard of new and 
existing homes and ensure housing 
supply meets demand  
• Tackle the causes of difficult issues 
leading to nuisance, crime and anti -
social behaviour  
• Maintain our highways infrastructure to 
keep people  moving safely around 
North Northamptonshire  
• Enable people to travel across North 
Northamptonshire and beyond  
4. Greener, sustainable environment  
• Promote sustainable, active travel  
• Embed low carbon technology, 
sustained and improved green 
infrastructure, a nd sustainable forms of 
transport fit for the future  
• Protect the countryside and open 
spaces, and enhance the natural 
environment and ecology  
 Strategic sites that are key to the 
delivery of the  spatial strategy will be 
identified in the plan. The current 
strategic sites threshold in the JCS is 
500+ dwellings or 5+ ha of 
employment land  and the Strategic 
Plan will consider whether this 
threshold should be amended or 
retained.  As discussed earlier , Garden 
Communities are key elements of the 
Strategic Plan which  will consider  their 
potential for  further  expansion.  
The location of  strategic sites will be a 
key consideration  in the context of 
climate -change  and ensuring future 
development contributes to a reduction 
in carbon emissions.  Future 
infrastructure opportunities and 
investment will be important 
considerations in determi ning these 
potential locations. The Strategic Plan  
will define clear development 
principles for  sites identified in the 
plan. A ‘Call for Sites’ was launched in 
January 2022  where interested parties 
were invited to submit potential sites  
for consideration in the plan and 
potential  sites can be submitted via  the 
online Call for Sites form .     
    
Consultation question:  
28. Should the strategic sites th resho ld of 500+ dwellings or 5+ ha of 
employment land  be retained or amended ? Please provide reasons for 
amendments .

 Infrastructure  
 
Corporate Plan Priorities:  
 
1. Active, fulfilled lives  
• Improve the accessibility and use of 
leisure, culture, art and sport  
3. Safe and thriving places  
• Strengthen the cultural identity of 
towns, villages and rural communities  
• Help town centres and villages respond 
to changing trends  
• Attract tourism, visitors an d inward 
investment  
• Working with local businesses and 
partners to support the creation of 
high -quality, better -skilled jobs  
• Maintain our highways infrastructure to 
keep people moving safely around 
North Northamptonshire  
• Enable people to travel across North  
Northamptonshire and beyond  
4. Greener, sustainable environment  
• Promote sustainable, active travel  
• Embed low carbon technology, 
sustained and improved green 
infrastructure, and sustainable forms of 
transport fit for the future  
• Protect the countryside and open 
spaces, and enhance the natural 
environment and ecology   
Infrastructure must be considered in its 
widest  sense and include all systems 
and services to support growth. The 
JCS identifies 3 broad types of 
infrastructure - Physical  (necessary to 
connect homes and work places to the 
wider environment such as transport, 
waste, utilities to meet the day to day 
needs) , Green  (to provide green 
spaces and habitat to allow 
ecosystems to function alongs ide 
development and includes land and 
water)  and Social  (to ensure that the 
communities can function effectively 
and covers a wide range of assets 
such as education, healthcare, sports 
facilities  and libraries) .   
All three  infrastructure types  are 
required to deliver sustainable 
communities that function effectively.  It 
is also critical that this  infrastructure is 
delivered alongside development in a 
timely manner to the benefit of existing 
and new residents.   
 
An important principle in the JCS that will be taken forward in the Strategic Plan is 
that new development should be located and designed to minimise its demand on 
infrastructure, and that any additional impacts arising as a result o f development can 
be effectively mitigated through delivery of new or expanded, high quality 
infrastructure. The design , layout and location of development can minimise the 
need for or make more efficient use of some items of infrastructure.  Where there i s 
a need related to new developments then contributions towards its delivery will be 
secured from the development.  
The Strategic Plan will need to consider the mechanisms for funding and delivering 
infrastructure and demonstrate that its proposals can be delivered. Currently 
infrastructure  required as a result of development  is delivered largely through 
Section 106 developer contributions. Proposals to replace the Community 
Infrastructure Levy and Section 106 with a new consolidated Infrastructure Levy 
were published by government as part of the Planning White Paper consultation but 
no decision has been made on this.  Other funding sources will be considered where  
41 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 appropriate to enhance and improve infrastructure provision throughout North 
Northamptonshire . 
Current  infrastructure priorities to deliver planned growth to 2031 are set out in the 
North Northamptonshire Investment Framework (NNIF). The NNIF identifies 
infrastructure pressures and pinch points as factors affecting delivery, most notably 
congestion  and capacity issues along key strategic highways networks in North 
Northamptonshire such as the A14, A43 and A45 corridor. Beyond transport, there is 
reported to be some capacity constraints within the area’s electricity network, with 
solutions required t o connect new developments to the grid, including low carbon 
and renewable technologies. When upgrades do occur to the electricity network, this 
tends to be approached in a piecemeal, rather than strategic way that anticipates 
future development and associ ated demand.  This creates challenges , including for 
District Network Operators connections for Electric Vehicle charge points.  The 
requirement for strategic upgrades to North Northamptonshire’s electricity network 
has been recognised for some time.      
In parts of North Northamptonshire, particularly areas with lower land values, viability 
impacts on the delivery of infrastructur e and affordable housing. The N NIF identified 
that the highest priority infrastructure projects had a funding shortfall of just under 
£316m, based on a ‘point -in-time’ snapshot  at June 2019 . This shortfall represents 
the tip of the iceberg for North Northa mptonshire. Viability will be an important 
consideration as the NNSP is developed.   
The Strategic Plan  will need to consider the cumulative impacts o f development and 
identify the  key infrastructure required to deliver the strategy such as strategic 
transport schemes, utility networks , green infrastructure  and community facilities  
including schools . The Corporate Plan sets out that providing a range of accessible 
leisure, sports and play facilities an d attractive open spaces will be important in 
helping people to live active, fulfilled lives. T his will be informed by a re -fresh of the 
infrastructure evidence base, including updated transport modelling work  to ensure 
that all forms of movement infrastructure are identified and planned for.    
There is a need to improve access to digital connectivity (such as in rural areas) by, 
for example, securing efficient full fibre broadband provision for all. Full fibre ensures 
that speeds can increase to k eep up with demand which will continue to grow at 
even faster rates as more devices and services become connected and richer data 
needs to be transmitted.  This is now even more critical given the effects of the 
Covid -19 pandemic and the shift for many peop le and businesses to home working. 
Addressing this matter is vital in ensuring the continuation of business growth and 
innovation, improving access for residents to services and opportunities in ways that 
enrich lives, reduce the need to travel, and which in turn also contributes to the 
decarbonisation of the transport network and the realisation of technology driven 
benefits in all sectors.  
Supporting  the decarbonisation of the transport sector will be an important element 
of the Strategic Plan.  The plan will identify future opportunities to achieve 
connectivity through sustainable modes of transport and active travel, a priority in the 
Corporate Plan. In terms of distance, the main towns of North Northamptonshire are  
42 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 located relatively close to one another , however  there is a distinctly  rural nature 
between settlements.  This presents opportunities to deliver modal shift for travel 
between these locations. Green Infrastructure and new walking and cycling routes 
provide a n opportunity to facilitate modal shift in a location where the travel to work 
area is relatively contain ed (people travel small distances) but car use still 
dominates.  Initiatives such as the Greenway and Ise Valley Way could act as  
exemplar s for the wider Arc area  in delivering walking and cycling infrastructure, 
including opportunities provided by green infrastructure corridors .

 Central to the economic vision and 
overall growth strategy for North 
Northamptonshire is an ambitious 
agenda for ‘place shaping’, to ensure 
that growth and development is 
genuinely sustainable and inclusive by 
creating places where people want to 
live, wor k and do business, now and in 
the future.  
Great places go beyond aesthetics 
and visual appearance. Place -making  
encompasses social and economic 
opportunity, creating an environment 
that supports health, wellbeing and 
contributes to the quality of people’s 
life. They are safe and inclusive, well 
planned, built and run, and offer 
equality of opportunity and good 
services for all and promote a green 
economy.  
The National Planning Policy 
Framework and National Model Design 
Code makes clear that creating high 
quality buildings and places is 
fundamental to the planning and 
development process, with specific 
emphasis on the need to create high 
quality sustainable places that address 
climate resilience and health and 
wellbeing.  
The Strategic Pla n will play a key role in responding to the changing national policy 
context in relation to design. It will  reflect the corporate ambition to drive up the 
quality of design and provide strong design and place -shaping policies, building on 
the existing poli cy framework provided in the JCS.   
The JCS provides  a robust policy framework to shape North Northamptonshire which 
includes  increased protection for North Northamptonshire’s cultural and 
environmental assets, stronger recognition of the importance of the natural 
environment and the opportunities it provides, and greater emphasis on urban 
design principles and how places could change for the better.   
To create sustainable places, all development is assessed against the North 
Northamptonshire Place Shaping Principles set out in Policy 8  of the JCS which  
44 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 provides a checklist of the key issues that need to be considered by developm ent in  
delivering the highest possible quality of development sought by the plan. These 
principles  seek to ensure that development proposals support strong, vibrant and 
healthy communities,  which, where possible, make physical activity easy to do and 
creat e inclusive places and  spaces that support community engagement.  Policy 8 
and these principles will be updated and strengthened in the S trategic Plan.   
The Council  will ensure that we have access to, and make appropriate  use of, tools 
and processes for as sessing and improving the design of development such as  
Building for a Healthy Life (BHL) 2020 . We have previously used its predecessor 
(BfL12) to assess design quality in the area as part of the AMR.  
With the increased emphasis at the national level for place -making  to support health 
and wellbeing, it will be essential that the Strategic Plan seeks to addr ess health 
inequalities to ensure that no communities/populations are left behind when realising 
the ambitions for North Northamptonshire. Many of the existing health inequalities 
have been exposed throughout Covid -19 and in many cases exacerbated.   
The S trategic Plan will update and strengthen the policies in the JCS to help shape 
places where health and wellbeing is considered in every element of development 
and where inequalities in health and wellbeing are reduced. Apart from obvious 
benefits to people ’s well -being, this should also assist in reducing demands on the 
local NHS and social care services.      
There are several  elements to place -making  and creating sustainable communities . 
The Strategic Plan  will seek to  take forward the key principles set out below, which 
relate to all elements of it and have been discussed within this document . Many of 
these are already contained within the JCS.  
 
Key Principles for Place -making  and Sustainable Communities  
 
1. Active, inclusive  and safe  - Fair, tolerant and cohesive with a strong local culture 
and other shared community activities  
 
Development proposals will support strong, vibrant and healthy communities where 
people feel safe, healthy, socially connected and proud of where the y live.   
 
2. Environmentally sensitive  - providing places for people to live that are 
considerate of the environment  
 
New development will respect and make use of the natural and historic character of 
North Northamptonshire and ensure that all residents and visitors can benefit from 
the advantages these characteristics offer.   
 
3. Well designed and built  - featuring quality built and natural environment   
 
Sustainable communities offer:   
45 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 o sense of place - a place with a positive 'feeling' for people and loc al 
distinctiveness  
o user-friendly public and green spaces with facilities for everyone including 
children and older people  
o sufficient range, diversity, affordability and accessibility of housing within a 
balanced housing market  
o appropriate size, scale, density, design and layout, including mixed -use 
development, that complement the distinctive local character of the 
community  
o high quality, mixed -use, durable, flexible and adaptable buildings, using 
materials which minimise negat ive environmental impacts  
o buildings and public spaces which promote health and are designed to reduce 
crime and make people feel safe  
o accessibility of jobs, key services and facilities by public transport, walking 
and cycling.  
 
4. Well connected  - with good transport services and communication linking people 
to jobs, schools, health and other services   
 
Sustainable communities offer:  
o transport facilities, including public transport, that help people travel within and 
between communities  and reduce dependence on cars  
o facilities to encourage safe local walking and cycling  
o an appropriate level of local parking facilities in line with local plans to manage 
road traffic demand  
o widely available and effective telecommunications and Internet a ccess  
o good access to regional, national and international communications networks.  
 
5. Thriving Community/offer  - with a flourishing and diverse local economy   
 
Sustainable communities feature:  
o a wide range of jobs and training opportunities  
o sufficient  suitable land and buildings to support economic prosperity and 
change  
o dynamic job and business creation, with benefits for the local community  
o a strong business community with links into the wider economy  
o economically viable and attractive town centres .  
 
7. Future proofed  - climate resilient, adaptable and fit for the future  
 
Development should be fit for the future and incorporate resilience to climate change 
as well as allowing flexibility to adapt to new smart technology such as that emerging 
for independent living.      
 
Consultation question:  
30. Does  the consultation document identify the correct  place -making  
principles for the Strategic Plan or are there  any other s that need to be 
considered?   
46 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 Natural and Historic Environment  
 
Corporate Plan Priorities:  
 
1. Active, fulfilled lives  
• Improve the accessibility and use of 
leisure, culture, art and sport  
3. Safe and thriving places  
• Strengthen the cultural identity of 
towns, villages and rural communities  
• Help town centres and villages respond 
to changing trends  
• Attract tourism, visitors a nd inward 
investment  
4. Greener, sustainable environment  
• Demonstrate clear leadership on 
tackling environmental sustainability  
• Embed low carbon technology, 
sustained and improved green 
infrastructure, and sustainable forms of 
transport fit for the future  
• Protect the countryside and open 
spaces, and enhance the natural 
environment and ecology  
 Protecting and enhancing our natural 
and historic environment in the area is 
fundamental to delivering a 
sustainable development strategy. The 
environment is our most valuable 
asset and underpins our wellbeing and 
prosperity.  
Our rich heritage contributes to local 
character and distinctiveness and will 
have a strong influence on the spatial 
strategy of the plan and the 
identification of suitable development 
locations. It will also be at the core of 
our approach to responding to climate 
change. We draw from the 
environment all we need to live (food, 
water, air and energy for growth) so 
protecting and enhancing the 
environment is critical for the next 
generation t o flourish.  
The corporate plan sets out as a key priority demonstrating clear leadership on 
tackling environmental sustainability and the Strategic Plan can be one mechanism 
to help deliver this.  
North Northamptonshire is well placed to be an exemplar of sustainable living and 
working. The JCS already includes a vision to be ‘a showpiece for modern green 
living and well managed sustainable development: a resilient area where local 
choices have incr eased the ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to 
global economic changes.’  
The environment needs to be considered in its widest sense and the Strategic Plan 
will contain policies to ensure resources are used sustainably and efficiently, t hat 
there is reduced harm from environmental hazards such as flooding and that we 
seek to improve air quality.  
It is a key ambition of the plan to leave the environment in a better state than it is 
now. That means achieving an environmental net gain.  
 
Natu ral Capital  
 
The concept of natural capital lies at the heart of North Northamptonshire’s growth 
strategy which recognises the importance of the natural environment and the 
opportunities it provides to enhance economic prosperity, productivity and inward  
47 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 investment. We also recognise the importance of accessible, good quality natural 
environments to encourage community cohesion, activity and healthy living.  
Natural Capital is ‘t he sum of our ecosystems, species, freshwater, land soils, 
minerals, our air and our seas. These are all elements of nature that either directly or 
in directly bring value to people and the country at large. They do this in many ways 
but chiefly by providi ng us with food, clean air and water, wildlife, energy, wood, 
recreation and protection from hazards’ .24  
Recognising the complex ways in which natural social and economic systems 
interact enables us to make better decisions that protect  and enhance the services 
and benefits that we need.  Biodiversity net gain is a primary driver for growing 
natural capital , with healthy, diverse and resilient ecosystems essential to underpin 
the delivery of a wide range of services and long -term be nefits  for people and 
places.  
Our principle  is to take a biodiversity first approach that is founded upon and 
complem ents the requirements in the Environment Act 2021  for mandatory 
Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG)  and Local Nature Recovery Strategies, whereby  
environmental enhancement should deliver  BNG first and this cannot be traded off 
against other Natural Capital benefits . 
 
Biodiversity and Biodiversity net gain  
 
The Environment Act, which was passed in November 2021, will require all new 
developments to deliver a  mandatory minimum 10% net biodiversity gain  from 2023 . 
Other key components  of the Act include  the opportunity to enter conservation 
covenants and register off site biodiversity gains . There is also a requirement to 
prepare Nature  Recovery Strategies. These will be key components to feed into the 
preparation of t he Strategic Plan. 
 
The Environmental Principles for the Oxford -Cambridge Arc are seeking a 
biodiv ersity gain of 20%  to reflect the ambition to be world leaders on environmental 
ambitions.  There is also a target to double the area of land managed primarily for 
nature  and to increase tree and woodland cover across the Arc from 7.4% to 19%. 
There  are considerable opportun ities to engage with the desire to double nature , 
increase tree planting  and increase biodiversity gain  within North Northamptonshire 
through projects including within the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits  Special 
Protection Area  (SPA) and the Rockingham Forest.  
The SPA is internationally recognised for its si gnificance as a wetland habitat for 
birds . Development could potentially pose threats to the SPA through increased 
disturbance through human activity, l oss of supporting habitat or changes in 
ecological condition. The plan will need to ensure that t he SPA is suitably protected 
and where possible enhanced. There is an existing mitigation strategy associated 
with the JCS, this will be reviewed to ensure that  it remains  fit for purpose. The need 
                                                           
24 A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment, HM Government, 2018   
48 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 to protect this important habitat may influence  the spatial strategy of the plan.  It also 
however provides an opportunity to enhance the biodiversity of the area.  
 
Green and Blue Infrastructure Corridors  
 
Green Infrastructure (GI)  including blue infrastructure comprising the network of 
rivers and lakes,  is a strategically planned and delivered network comprising the 
broadest range of high -quality green spaces and other environmental features. It 
should be designe d and managed as a multi -functional resource capable of 
delivering ecosystem services and quality of life benefits. For example, GI supports 
healthier lifestyles, including opportunities for active travel, manages flood water, 
improves air quality and help s to mitigate the effects of climate change.  
 
Access to natural environments provides important health and well being benefits, 
which we will want to maximise  in the  Strategic Plan . It will therefore be important to 
ensure that the plan ensures that high quality natural spaces are provided in 
locations which are accessible and that we seek to improve the equality of 
sustainable access to nature and its benefits across the whole area. This will mean 
ensuring accessible natural spaces are provided within exi sting settlements and as 
part of new developments as well providing access to natural areas within the wider 
countryside. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of access to local 
greenspace for physical and mental health and to encourage social activ ity. The 
provision of good quality green space for people and nature must be a fundamental 
component of good place making . It will need to be considered whether the plan  
should include standards for open space provision and whe ther existing standards in 
the Part 2 Local Plans should  be harmonised across North Northamptonshire.  
The GI framework set out in the JCS and Part 2 Local Plans includes a network of 
Sub-Regional and Local Corridors. The focus is on the strategic corridors of t he 
Rivers Nene and Ise, and the Rockingham Forest area and includes the open 
countryside around urban areas, which is important to maintain distinct and separate 
settlements. In some instances , there is limited connectivity to access the natural 
greenspace  from the main towns and opportunities need to be taken to link urban 
parks and woodland into the wider countryside. As previously discussed, Green 
Infrastructure and new cycle routes provide a particular opportunity to facilitate 
modal shift  to active travel  and enhance  connectivity between settlements.  
This network provides opportunities to enhance tourism in North Northamptonshire, 
while ensuring that its most sensitive assets are protected. The special policy areas 
of the Nene and Ise Vall eys and Rockingham Forest in the JCS are strategically 
important in stimulating sustainable economic growth through tourism and rural 
diversification and are being delivered through initiatives such as the Greenway and 
Ise Valley  Way. Evidence produced for  the ASF identifies Rockingham Forest into 
John Clare Country, Nene Valley and Sywell Wood as strategic -scale environmental 
opportunity zones.     
  
49 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
   
Consultation questions : 
31. What are the key mechanisms the plan should use to achieve a net 
environmental gain and how can this be measured?  
32. Should the plan seek to introduce biodiversity net gain targets above the 
mandated 10% and align to the Oxford – Cambridge Arc target of 20%? 
33. Should the plan seek to identify opportunity areas for enhancing the 
natural environment  at a strategic scale? Should this includ e continuing to 
identify green infrastructure  corridors?  
34. Should the plan seek to introduce other environmental targets? If so, what 
should they cover and how should they be measured?  
35. How should the plan seek to improve equality of sustainable access to 
nature and its benefits . Should the plan include standards of access to green 
space ? 
 
 
Landscape  Character    
 
The landscape in North Northamptonshire has been influenced by a combination  of 
human and physical influences. These landscapes, both man -made and natural, are 
what  makes the area distinctive and there is a pressing need to conserve and 
enhance many of the  features of importance landscape settings, as well as 
recognising the importance of views  and vistas of these.  A Landscape Character 
Assessment which was undertaken in 2008 for the county and informed the JCS is 
still relevant.  
 
Some la ndscapes are more sensitive to change than others. Development can  
impact on the landscape through its effects on the character and the quality of the 
landscape  and the degree to which development will become a significant or defining 
feature in the  landsc ape, including skyline (where additional development appears 
disproportionately  dominant), and loss of sense of remoteness. Visual impacts 
concern the degree to which  proposed development will become a feature in 
particular views (or sequences of views) an d the impacts this has on people 
experiencing view s. The JCS recognises  the need to protect tranquil lity in the  King’s 
Cliffe Hills and Valleys Landscape Character Area . The Strategic Plan  will update  the 
policy approach to ensure that proposals understand and respond to the character of 
the landscape setting within which they are located.  
  
Historic Environment  
 
The historic environment is one of North Northamptonshire’s  most valued assets. It 
is an im portant element of the  landscape and contributes to the individual character  
50 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 and appearance of settlements. Responding appropriately to the historic 
environment is a key principle of good place making.  Elements of the historic 
environment that  hold significance  are termed ‘heritage assets’ and include any 
building, monument, site, place, area or landscape  positively identified as having a 
degree of significance meriting consideration in planning decisions. This includes 
below ground archaeology.  These assets are an irreplaceable resource that need to 
be conserved so that they can be enjoyed for their contribution to the quality of life of 
existing and future generations.  
 
Known heritage assets can be designated or non -designated.  There are also new 
sites being  discovered all the time.  North Northamptonshire has over 2800 
designated heritage assets spread across its rural and urban landscapes. 
Designated25 heritage assets within North Northamptonshire include scheduled  
monuments, listed buildings, registered park s and gardens, and conservation areas. 
North  Northamptonshire contains many heritage assets of national importance 
including Grade  1 listed historic buildings and estates and their settings including 
Lyveden New Bield,  Apethorpe Hall, Rockingham Castle, Kirby Hall and Boughton 
House.   However, some of  these assets are currently identified on the Historic 
England ‘Heritage at Risk Register’  which identifies listed buildings, important historic 
sites, places and landmarks that are at  risk from neglect or decay.      
 
Non-designated heritage assets are an important component of North  
Northamptonshire and are at risk from the impact of development, or the cumulative 
loss of  structures.  Non-designated heritage assets are  identified by the local 
planning authority  through ‘Local Lists’.   
The Strategic Plan  will focus on strategic heritage issues  and refresh and update the 
policy approach to the historic environment . It will set a policy framework to ensure 
the significance of heritage assets is appropriately considered through the 
development mana gement process and that there is appropriate preservation of 
assets either in situ or by investigation and recording where appropriate.  
 
Consultation questions:  
36. Should the plan identify particular landscapes  that are more sensitive to 
change?  
37. How should the plan set out a positive strategy for the conservation and 
enjoyment of the historic environment?  
 
 
 
                                                           
25 Designated assets are designated under s tatute and some, such as listed buildings, conservation areas and 
scheduled monuments, benefit from statutory protection and require specific statutory duties to be exercised 
or tests to be applied when assessing the impact of a development on them. They m ay also be subject to a 
separate heritage consent regime   
51 | North Northamptonshire Council – Strategic Plan Scope and Issues Consultation  
 Process and Next Steps  
 
This consultation is the first stage in preparing the Strategic Plan  and runs from 
Monday 28th March  until 5pm on Monday 23rd May 2022 .  
It is important to clarify that at this stage no views have been formed on the scale of 
growth, which sites and locations should be allocated for new development, how 
existing policies should be updated or whether there should be any additional 
policies. The responses to the Scope and Issues consultation document will inform 
and contribute to the development of detailed planning policies and proposals at later 
stages of the plan making process.  
The next stage in the preparation of the Strategic Plan will be to develop a range of 
potential spatial options to meet the level of growth we are planning for across North 
Northamptonshire. We hope to consult on these  Options  later this year  and al l 
responses made to this consultation  will help us to develop these . The development 
and consideration of spatial options will also need to take account of a range of 
influences such as the plans of adjoining authorities .
