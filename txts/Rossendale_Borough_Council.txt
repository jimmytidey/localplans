   P a g e  | 6  Spatial  Portrait  
1 The Rossendale Local Plan seeks to promote sustainable housing and employment 
growth while protecting and enhancing the special valley and moorland setting of the 
Borough.  The Plan will cover the whole of the Borough of Rossendale for the period 
2019 to 203 6 and will provide the statutory planning framework for the borough. The 
Plan will be used to guide decisions on planning applications and areas where 
investment should b e prioritised. Once adopted, it will replace the Adopted Core 
Strategy 2011.  
  
2 Rossendale has much to offer  – historic towns, attractive countryside, a substantial 
pool of skilled workers and proximity to Manchester. Marrying development potential 
to sit es does however present challenges.  
 
3 One of the smallest boroughs in Lancashire, Rossendale covers an area of 138 sq 
kilometres, with a population of 70,000 people, and is located in the south east of 
Lancashire, on the border with Greater Manchester and  West Yorkshire.  The city of 
Manchester has a strong influence for work and shopping, with good road links to 
Manchester via Bury (the A56) and poorer linkages via Rochdale.   
 
4 Although earlier in origin, the main towns that now form Rossendale grew rapidly 
during the Industrial Revolution due to the availability of water and coal to power 
mills and this led to a strong textile industry, typical of this part of Lancashire. 
Rossendale in particular was well -known for i ts shoe and slipper industries.  
 
5 Rossendale is defined by a series of inter -locking valleys, which dissect open 
moorland, and closely linked small towns line the valley floors.  This creates a main 
urban core from Haslingden through to Whitworth, interspersed with and surrounded 
by count ryside, dictated by geology and topography.  This countryside forms part of 
the broader South Pennine Landscape Character Area, which stretches from 
Chorley through to Bradford.  Rossendale contains some priority habitats including in 
particular blanket bo g as well as upland heath, upland oak and wet woodland, and 
upland springs and flushes.   
 
6 This countryside still has evidence in places of its importance for farming (mainly 
sheep grazing which continues today), quarrying (which once was extensive for 
sandstone and though much diminished still takes place), mining and textile 
manufacture.  As a result, different historic periods are clearly identifiable.  More 
recently dis -used quarries are being re -used for leisure purposes, for example, Lee 
Quarry is p opular for mountain bikers. This part of Lancashire also has an extensive 
network of rights of way.  
 
7 Changes have come following the rapid development in Victorian times and the 
subsequent decline in manufacturing and to some extent the Borough has an  P a g e  | 7  east/west split, with areas in the west benefitting from better road connections (the 
A56), and an attractive landscape, some of which is designated as Green Belt.  As a 
result these areas are more affluent with fewer signs of deprivation, However  going 
east from Rawtenstall, the towns have poorer interconnectivity and the perception of 
being isolated. Parts of Rossendale around Bacup (so including the densely terraced 
areas of Stacksteads and Britannia too) were included in the East Lancashire 
Housing Marke t Regeneration Programme, known as Elevate, where residents voted 
to refurbish their properties rather than demolish and build new houses. This 
regeneration programme has finished.   
 
8 Using other funding sources the Council is now prioritising regenerati on in Bacup 
and Haslingden with its 2040 Visions for both towns. Each identifies a number of 
specific projects; under the themes of enterprise, place,  people and vibrancy for 
Bacup.  The themes for Haslingden are: investment; evolution; revitalisation; and 
people.  
 
9 Development choices in Rossendale are constrained by the topography of the area. 
This means that the supply of flat, available land is limited. There are also other 
physical constraints, notably flood risk and  geology, as well as a road network  that is 
operating close to capacity in some key locations  and limited bus -based public 
transport . Brownfield sites, where available, often have issues that require resolution 
before the site can come forward. Large, easy to develop sites are  in short sup ply. 
In addition Green Belt covers over 20% of the Borough while there are also 
extensive areas of m oorland.  
 
The Local Plan Vision  
10 The emerging Local Plan attempts to reflect the Council’s current Corporate Strategy 
(2017 to 2021) with the following vision:  
 
11 Rossendale will be a place where people want to live, visit, work  and invest.  
By 2034, inequalities across the Borough will be reduced through sustainable growth 
and by strengthening opportunities in the east of Rossendale and fulfilling the 
potential of the west of the Borough. The Town and District Centres, and key 
transport hubs, will be the main areas of development, with surrounding communities 
also having opportunities for growth and enhancement. The vision and masterplans 
for Rawtenstall , Bacup and Haslingden will act as regeneration catalysts, creating 
new opportunities for retail, leisure, recreation, housing and other economic 
development.  Rossendale’s distinctive landscapes and natural assets will continue 
to be protected and enhance d for their intrinsic value to biodiversity and tackling 
climate change as well as their recreational and economic value to local people and 
visitors alike.  Coupled with housing and employment growth and a range of policies 
designed to enhance the built, natural and social environment, this will boost the 
economic potential of the Borough and improve health and well -being of residents.  P a g e  | 8  The special character will be maintained whilst supporting and accommodating 
sustainable growth for the Borough, its resid ents and businesses.  
 
 
Local Plan Objectives  
12 The objectives for the Local Plan are as follows, grouped according to the themes of 
people, economy, and environment:  
 
 People  
 Rebalancing the east/west divide in Rossendale by providing a range of 
housing and economic opportunities across the Borough

sustainable development in appropriate locations  
 Reducing the impact of and ad apting to climate change, including suitable 
flood prevention measures, the promotion and protection of Green 
Infrastructure, green energy projects, and encouraging travel by modes other 
than the car  
 Protecting and enhancing natural assets, and improving b iodiversity   
 Conserve and e nhance the  historic environment   P a g e  | 9  Strategic Priorities  
13 The key projects and priorities that will help achieve the Vision and Objectives are as 
follows:  
 Delivering housing and employment allocations  
 Provide new employment opportunities along A56 Corridor – the A56 
Rossendale Valley Growth Corridor  
 Development of Futures Park as a mixed -use site to generate employment 
within the east of the Borough – the Futures Park Employment Village  
 Rawtenstall Town Centre Regeneration  
 Deliver Bacup 2040 Vision  
 Deliver Haslingden 2040 Vision  
 Improving links to Greater Manchester, such as the Manchester to 
Rawtenstall Valley  Rail Link and supporting improvements to the M60, M62 
and A56  
 Addressing congestion including Rawtenstall Gyratory  improvements  
 Developing the strategic cycle network, linking the Borough’s towns and 
improving access to the countryside  
 Deliver a series of actions identified in the Visitor Economy Strategy, which 
will grow Rossendale’s leisure, tourism, heritage and cu lture sectors  
 Enhancing the Borough’s biodiversity including through the use of the Scout 
Moor Habitat Enhancement Fund to deliver upland restoration projects  
 Addressing the Climate Change emergency through the enhancement of 
Green Infrastructure, provision of electric charging points and renewable 
energy projects  
   P a g e  | 10  The Spatial Strategy  
14 The Spatial Strategy seeks to make the most of the existing physical infrastructure in 
the Borough when allocating sites:  
 The main transport corridors, particular ly the A56 and the A682 link into 
Rawtenstall  
 Existing Town centre renewal initiatives  
 Proximity to services  
 Previously developed land  
 
15  The Borough ’s built and environmental heritage is fundamental to the unique 
character of the area. The Local Plan recognises the importance of:  
 Important buildings and historic areas  
 Areas of high environmental value, such as the South and West Pennine 
Moors  
 Greenspace corridors  
 
 
16 A number of major sites are identified, some of which are outside the urban 
boundary  and / or were previously in Green Belt. Their strategic value for 
development has led to their inclusion in the Plan. These sites reflect, where 
possible, the priorities  of the Council and key partners.  
17 The Key Diagram  (overleaf) illustrates the principal spatial proposals contained in 
the Local Plan.  
 
18 This Local Plan does not cover minerals and waste planning as this is the 
responsibility of Lancashire County Council. The adopted Joint Lancashire Minerals 
and Waste Local Plan forms part of the  development plan for Rossendale.  
 
 
 
 
Development Hierarchy  
 
19 This is the Settlement Hierarchy which identifies the role and function of places.  It 
has helped to inform the spatial distribution of growth and the Spatial Strategy.  
Please see Policy SS for details.

 P a g e  | 12  Key Service Centres  
 
20 The town of Rawtenstall is the Borough’s primary centre  complemented by  Bacup, 
Haslingden  and Whitworth , which act as Key Service Centres with a range of 
housing and employment opportunities, as well as retail, leisure and other services 
such as GP’s that serve a wide area. They are each located on high frequency bus 
corridors.  
 
Local Service Centres  
 
21 Those Local Service Centres that are close to the Key Service Centre towns and are 
more urban in character are distinguished from Local Service Centres in more rural 
locations.  
 
22 Urban Local Service Centres benefit from good transport connections to servi ces in 
the nearby towns as well as having a range of facilities such as schools, parades of 
shops and community facilities. These include Waterfoot, Crawshawbooth and 
Stacksteads.   
 
23 Rural Local Service Centres are discrete settlements with links to Key Service 
Centres that serve their own residents and those in nearby villages with basic 
services, and are able to provide for future local housing and employment needs. 
These include Rising Bridge, Loveclough/Goodshaw and Water . Good access to 
services is essential if rural communities are to survive and prosper.  
 
 
Other Settlements  
 
24 Outside of the main urban area and service centres, there are many smaller 
settlements or villages wit h limited facilities. Examples include Acre and Cowpe.  In 
the interests of sustainable development, growth and investment should be confined 
here to small scale infill and the change of use or conversion of existing buildings. 
Affordable housing developmen t of an appropriate scale on the edge of a rural 
settlement to meet a particular local need may be justified in accordance with 
national planning policy.  
 
25 The following table provides details of each of the settlements in the Borough in 
terms of; designation, and services, facilities and characteristics identified in 2021.  
The established settlement hierarchy is based on the facilities that are offered at 
present at each location as identified in Table 1 Settlement Hierarchy.

  P a g e  | 14  Key topics  
Housing  
26 The Plan allocates in full land to meet the Housing requirement of 3,191 new homes 
over the Plan period 2019 to 2036.  
 
27 The majority of new housing will be located in and around the main centres of 
Rawtenstall and Bacup with these  centres accommodating in total a round 50% of 
the housing requirement. The majority of the other development will be located in 
other identified settlements.  
28 The Strategy seeks to maximise the use of brownfield land for housing by bringing 
former mill sites back into use. It is expecte d that 30% of allocated housing land will 
be brownfield. A significantly higher percentage of windfall sites will be brownfield.  
29 Higher densities  (40 dwellings per ha or higher) will be sought near town centres, in 
particular Rawtenstall, and where it is appropriate to the existing development 
pattern.  
30 Strategic Green Belt releases  for housing are proposed in Edenfield. The 
development in Edenfield creates the opportunity to masterplan a substantial new 
addition to the village that would have a limited impact on the openness of the Green 
Belt.   
Employment   
31 The Plan sets a requirement for  27 ha of employment land of which 23 ha is new 
provision. The new sites are primarily located close to the A56 and A682 as this is 
where market demand is highest.  
32 Development of Futures Park in Bacup will build on the existing leisure o ffer in the 
area, in particular the Mountain Bike facility at Lee Quarry, as well as a range of 
mixed uses.  
33 Green Belt release  is required south of New Hall Hey , north of Hud Hey and at Ewood 
Bridge  for the proposed  new sites . This reflects the current  tight nature of the urban 
boundary and the availability of suitable land.  
Retail  
34 The existing retail hierarchy is retained with the addition of a new local centre  in 
Crawshawbooth. The former Valley Centre has been removed from the Primary 
Shopping Are a (PSA)  as it is now public realm.  The Local Plan proposes retaining 
this as potential PSA should a new retail scheme re -emerge.    
 
  P a g e  | 15   
Green Infrastructure  
35 Protection of designated sites, including the West Pennines SSSI, features in the 
Plan as does enhancement of non -designated locations such as Scout Moor. This 
integrates with a broader objective to protect and enhance a network of Ecological 
Corridors  that reflect river valleys and cycle routes as well as ecological corridors. It 
is recognised that Green Infrastructure enhancement has multiple benefits, including 
for the health of the population. This also links into protection of play and sports 
facilitie s.   
Historic Environment  
36 New Conservation Areas are proposed in , Helmshore,  Crawshawbooth  and 
Newchurch . A new Local List will be introduced to provide protection to key non -
designated assets that make a strong contribution to the area ’s character.  
Transport  
37 The Plan recognises the importance of working with partners to address key 
transport issues. This especially relates to addressing issues affecting key road 
junctions such as the Gyratory  in Rawtenstall; enhancing the A56 corridor  and

Strategic Policy SS: Spatial Strategy  
The Council will focus growth and investment in and around the Key Service 
Centres, with development supported in other areas taking account of the 
suitability of the site, its sustainability and the needs of the local area, whilst 
protecting the landscape  and existing built form and the character of rural 
areas.   
 
Greenfield development will be required within and on the fringes of the urban 
boundary to meet housing and employment needs. The Council will require 
that the design of such development relates well in design and layout to 
existing buildings, green infras tructure and services.   
 
To promote vibrant local communities and support services, an appropriate 
scale of growth and investment will be encouraged in identified Local Service 
Centres, providing it is in keeping with their local character and setting.  
 
The Council will work with partners and developers to protect and enhance the 
Ecological Corridor Network and the Borough’s built heritage.  
 
A level of growth and investment appropriate to the settlement size will be 
encouraged at the Urban Local Service C entres listed in Table 1 above to help 
meet housin g, employment and service needs.  
 
Limited growth and investment will be encouraged at the Rural Local Service 
Centres  listed in Table 1 above to help meet local housing and employment 
needs and to support the provisio n of services to the wider area.  
 
In other places – such as smaller villages and substantially built up frontages 
– development will typically be small scale and limited to appropriate infilling, 
conversion of buildings and proposals to meet lo cal need, unless there are 
exceptional reasons for larger scale redevelopment schemes . 
 
 
38 The pattern of development in Rossendale has been heavily influenced by the 
natural and physical environment, from the earliest development at key sheltered 
locations through the Industrial Revolution, when the area grew rapidly, taking 
advantage of its location.  As a result urban development has grown along the valley 
bottoms, and opportunities for further development are constrained by factors 
including topography, geology, flood risk, and ecology. Nevertheless the  Borough Explanation   P a g e  | 17  does have development needs over the next 15 years to provide sufficient housing 
and employment land for its residents, and opportunities for shopping and leisure 
pursuits.  Such  development needs to take place in sustainable locations, which are 
not at risk of flooding or exacerbating flooding elsewhere, whilst retaining and 
strengthening Rossendale’s special character and enhancing its valuable natural 
habitat.  
 
39 In identifyin g suitable sites priority has been given to transport nodes, close to the 
identified centres.  The use of brownfield land has been maximised but greenfield 
sites have been needed in order to identify sufficient land to meet the Borough’s 
development needs.  Development sites that are deliverable are necessary.  Factors 
that have been taken into account include the settlement hierarchy as well as 
existing designations such as the countryside and Green Belt, as well as the physical 
constraints mentioned above.  
 
40 As well as extending the urban boundary into the designated countryside to identify 
additional new sites, the Green Belt has also had to have been considered.  The loss 
of existing Green Belt land has been minimised but there are exceptional 
circumstances to justify some Green Belt release on greenfield sites, given the 
overall imperative to identify sites that can deliver the Borough’s future needs.   This 
applies to new employment sites, which need to be in areas with good access to the 
strategic road network, which is where businesses want to be.  
 
41 The Borough’s largest housing allocation at Edenfield (H62) for 400 new houses is 
located on the former Green Belt land, which has good accessibility. The scale of the 
site to the west of Market  Street means that this allocation will contribute significantly 
to housing provision, including affordable tenures, in Rossendale. The strategic 
release of the land identified for allocation will be contained by a strong boundary 
(the A56), so limiting th e potential fo r future urban sprawl . This will be perceived as 
the main block of settlement within Edenfield, growing incrementally north and will to 
fill the gap between the A56 and the linear settlement along Market Street , to create 
a stronger Green Bel t boundary and settlement edge.  
 
42 Some smaller housing sites have been allocated on land released from the Green 
Belt, but where part of the land is previously developed .  In keeping with the priority 
to protect Green Belt and take forward robust boundar ies for the future , the Council’s 
approach to Green Belt releases focuses on major schemes that will contribute 
significantly to meeting the Borough’s needs for employment and housing  and have 
a strategic role . All allocations which will result in the release of Green Belt will need 
to provide compensatory benefits to the land remaining in the Green Belt.  
 
   P a g e  | 18  Strategic Policy SD1: Presumption in Favour of Sustainable 
Development  
When considering development prop osals the Council will take a positive 
approach that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development 
contained in the National Planning Policy Framework ( NPPF ). The Council will 
always work proactively with applicants to jointly find solutions which mean 
that proposals can be approved wherever possible, and to secure 
development that improves the economic, social and environmental 
conditions in the area.  
  
Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Local Plan will be 
approved without delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  
 
Where there are no relevant policies or the policies which are most important 
for determining the application  are out of date at the time of making the 
decision the Council will gr ant permission unless :  
 
a) the application of policies in the NPPF that protect areas or assets of 
particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development 
proposed; or  
 
b) any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably 
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policie s in the NPPF taken 
as a whole.  
 
 
Explanation  
 
43 At the heart of the NPPF is a presumption in favour of sustainable development, this 
is a golden thread running through both plan -making and decision -taking.  
 
44 For plan -making this means the Council will:  
 positively seek opportunities to meet Rossendale’s development needs with 
sufficient flexibility to adapt to rapid change;  
 prepare strategic policies to provide for the needs for the Borough in terms of 
housing and other uses , unless:  
o the policies of the NPPF that protect areas or assets of particular 
importance provide a stron g reason to restrict the scale, type or 
distribution of development ; or  
o any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably 
outweigh  the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF 
taken as a whole .   P a g e  | 19   
45 For decision -taking this means the Council will:  
 approve development proposals that accord with the Local Plan without delay; 
and  
 where the Local Plan is absent, silent, or relevant policies are out -of-date, 
grant permission unless:  
o the policies protecting areas or assets of  particular importance in the 
NPPF provide a clear reason for refusing the development proposed, 
or 
o any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably 
outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF 
taken as a whole . 
 
46 Policies in this Local Plan follow the approach of the presumption in favour of 
sustainable development contained in the NPPF so that it is clear that development 
which is sustainable can be approved without delay. This Local Plan is based on and 
reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development, with clear policies that 
will guide how the presumption should be applied locally.  
Strategic Policy SD2: Urban Boundary and Green Belt  
All new development in the Borough will take place within the Urban 
Boundaries, defined on the Policies Map, except where development 
specifically needs to be located within a countryside location and the 
development enhances the rural character of the are a. 
Land has been removed from Green Belt in the following locations on the 
basis that exceptional circumstances exist:  
• H63 Cowm Water Treatment Works, Whitworth  
• H64 Irwell Vale Mill  
• H65 Land E ast of Market Street  
• H66 Land W est of Market Street, Edenfield  
• H67 Edenwood Mill, Edenfield  
• NE1 Extension to Mayfield Chicks, Ewood Bridge  
• NE2 Land north of Hud Hey, Haslingden  
• NE4 Extension of New Hall Hey, Rawtenstall  
 
The Council will expect that the design of development on the above  sites 
minimi ses the impact on   the character of the area and addresses relevant 
criteria in policy ENV3 . 
 
Development will also be expected to contribute to compensatory 
improvements to land elsewhere in the Green Belt, enhancing both its quality 
and public access.   P a g e  | 20  Explanation  
47 The settlement boundaries set out on the Policies Map define the extent of the towns 
and villages within the Borough. Sustainable Development will normally be 
permissible in these locations subject to the policies of the Plan as a whole.  
48 Development in the countryside will be supported where it is for a use that needs to 
be located in this location. Examples would include farm diversification or certain 
types of tourism uses , as well as rural affordable housing to be delivered on rural 
exce ption sites.  
 
49 The Plan makes a number of changes to the Green Belt boundaries  which have 
been incorporated in the urban boundary. Most of these are cartographical changes. 
A small number of major changes have been made to the Green Belt boundary, 
most n otably at Edenfield for housing and at Rawtenstall and Haslingden for 
employment use. “Exceptional circumstances ” are considered to exist that justify the 
proposed releases. There is a need for a balanced portfolio of sites within the 
Borough that reflect need; are attractive to the market and address past under -
delivery, particularly for housing. A wide range of sites have been considered for 
development across the Borough, with a focus on brownfield sites and higher 
densities around town centres. In addit ion, neighbouring authorities have been 
consulted on their ability to accommodate part of Rossendale’s demand. The Green 
Belt releases have been taken forward following detailed analysis of the non-Green  
Belt alternatives.  
 
50 At Edenfield th e justificatio n for Green Belt release  particularly relates to the strong 
defensible boundary of the A56 and the opportunity to masterplan the site to produce 
a high quality planned housing development that minimises impact on openness. 
There is strong market demand in the area. For the Green Belt employment sites , 
the challenge of finding suitable employment land reflecting  strong market demand 
close to the A56 corridor  as well as meeting the overall employment land 
requirement , is considered to be an exceptional cir cumstance.   
 
51 Masterplanning or , for smaller sites, the development of a design framework, will be 
expected to demonstrate how the design of the scheme minimises impacts on 
openness such as through the location of development within the site; the scale of 
the buildings and appropriate landscaping. In order to provide compensatory 
improvements to the remainder of the Green Belt, developments will be expected to 
contribute to enhancements to other open  space and improved recreational access.  
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 21   
Policy SD3: Planning Obligations  
Where developments will create demands for additional services, facilities and 
infrastructure or exacerbate an existing deficiency , the Council may seek a 
contribution  or legal agreement  to address this issue where it cannot be suitably 
addressed through the use of planning conditions or other mechanisms . Where 
sought , such contributions will reflect the most up to date national guidance and may 
include, but not exclusi vely, the following issues:  
- Affordable Housing  
- Public Open Space  
- Green infrastructure  
- Sustainable transport  
- Schools and Educational facilities  
- Health infrastructure  
- Sports and recreation facilities  
 
Explanation  
52 The topography and existing pattern of development within Rossendale means that 
there is already pressure on parts of the existing infrastructure such as roads and 
flood defences. Many schools are close to capacity.  
 
53 New development frequently places demands on existing infrastructure or in some 
cases requires completely new infrastructure . This can often be addressed through 
the use of planning conditions  or Section 278 agreements for Highway 
improvements.  
 
54 The use of planning obligations to addres s unacceptable impacts of development is 
one way of mitigating negative impacts. The use of such obligations is particularly 
helpful where management agreements are required or work is required off -site and 
financial contributions are required. Such obliga tions have to meet national 
requirements of being necessary, directly related to the development and fairly and 
reasonably related in scale and kind. The Council may seek contributions to address 
a range of infrastructure and related issues. In doing so it  will take into account the 
wider policies in this Plan, the comments of consultees and the viability of the 
development.    P a g e  | 22   
Policy SD4: Green Belt Compensatory Measures  
Where land is to be released for development, compensatory improvements to the 
environmental quality and accessibility of the remaining Green Belt land will be 
required.  
Types of improvements that would be considered acceptable include the creation or 
enhancement of green or blue infrastructure; biodiversity gains (additional to those 
required under Policy ENV1), such as tree planting, habitat connectivity and natural 
capital; landscape and visual enhancements (beyond those needed to mitigate the 
immediate  impacts of the proposal); new or enhanced walking or cycling routes; as 
well as improved access to new, enhanced or existing recreational and playing field 
provision.  
This policy applies to developments on land that is located within the Green Belt or 
on allocated housing and employment sites that were previously in the Green Belt as 
listed in Policy SD2  
The Council has identified a number of projects where Green Belt compensatory 
measures can be delivered, or proportionate contributions made towards thes e 
schemes, listed below.  Further details are contained in the Green Belt 
Compensatory Document or its successor:  
 Rossendale Forest  
 Rossendale Incredible Edible  
 New Hall Hey Gateway  
 Edenfield Cricket Club  
 Edenfield CE / Stubbins Primary School Extension  
 Public Rights of Way / Cycleway Upgrades and  
 Improvements to the Network  
 
Explanation  
55 Exceptional circumstances exist within Rossendale to release land from the Green 
belt for the development of additional new housing and employment land.  However, 
in de veloping on such land developers must provide compensatory improvements to 
the remaining Green Belt that will help to mitigate the loss of the Green Belt for 
existing residents.  
56 Rossendale has several specific areas of Green Belt – around Rising Bridge,  
between Haslingden and Rawtenstall, south of Rawtenstall to Edenfield and the 
Borough boundary with Bury, land around Turn, the Glen between Waterfoot and  P a g e  | 23  Stacksteads, and land around Whitworth, from Britannia in the north  to the boundary 
with Rochdale.  
57 All improvements are expected where possible to be located in the same area of 
Green Belt to ensure local residents who are most affected by the loss of the Green 
Belt receive the benefit from the compensatory improvements.  
60 The Council may ask developers to provide such measures on -site.  Alternatively 
other l and may be identified, for example, in the Council’s land ownership. The 
Council is likely to use planning obligations to ensure the delivery of off -site 
measures.  
  58 It should be noted that planning consent may be required for additional off -site 
compensatory improvements.  The applicant will be responsible for ensuring all 
required planning consents for such compensatory improvements are obtained, 
where this is requir ed.  
59 Further details of precise measures are set out in the relevant site specific 
policy, and the Council’s Green Belt Compensatory Document or its successor.  
Additionally a Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) will be produced 
setting out the detail s of these schemes, for example, showing PROW 
improvements, locations for tree planting etc. These documents inform the site -
specific policies and will inform future site -specific negotiations   P a g e  | 24  Chapter 1: Housing  
Strategic Policy HS1: Meeting Rossendale’s Housing Requirement  
The net  housing requirement for the period 2019  - 2036  will be achieved 
through:  
a) Providing at least  3,191 additional dwellings over the plan period 
equating to  208 dwellings a year  between 2019/20 and 2020/21 and 185 
dwellings a year from 2021/22 to 2035/36  
b) Delivering an overall amount of 30% of all new dwellings on previously 
developed land (PDL) across the Borough  
 
c) Keeping under review housing delivery performance on a yearly basis  
 
The housing requirement figure for Edenfield  Community  Neighbourhood Area 
from 2019  - 2036 is 456 dwellings.  
 
Explanation  
61 The need for new housing in Rossendale has been assessed in the Council’s 
Strategic Housing Market Area Assessment (SHMA) (2016) and subsequent 2019  
up-date.  The initial 2016 study and 2019 update examined a range of housing, 
economic and demographic evidence to assess housing need and demand in 
Rossendale.  The 2019 update was undertaken in light of new demographic 
evidence that had emerged in the in tervening period, and in particular, the 
publication of the revised NPPF and updated Planning Practice Guidance (PPG).   
 
62 The 2016 SHMA recommends that the need for additional housing in Rossendale is 
between 265 and 335 dwellings per year.  
 
63 However,  since the SHMA was produced the Government has implemented a 
standard methodology for calculating housing figures. Using this approach the 
relevant annual housing provision for Rossendale as of 2019 is set at 208 homes per 
year for years 2019 and 2020, an d 185 dwellings for the remaining years of the plan 
(2021 to 2036), as set out by the latest Standard Method (March 2021) . This figure 
is applicable for ten years but the Council has extrapolated this over the Plan period, 
giving a total housing figure of  3191 dwellings. The Council is not pursuing a higher 
figure based on “economic uplift”.   
64 The SHMA particularly highlights a need for larger, aspirational property types in 
Rossendale to rebalance the stock away from small terraced properties and reduce  
the high levels of out -migration to adjoining areas  to satisfy the demand for suitable 
house types . It also evidences the need for more good quality, specialist 
accommodation designed specifically for the growing elderly population  and also  P a g e  | 25  identifies a n eed for single level accommodation . The SHMA also identifies a need 
for 1 and 2 bedroom dwellings.  
 
65 Previously developed land (brownfield land) has been identified wherever possible 
but the supply of sites without significant constraints within the urban boundary is 
limited. Overall 152 brownfield sites were considered comprising a total of 182.4ha. 
39 of these sites are proposed for development on an area of approximately 45 ha. 
Other brownfield sites were rejected for a variety of reasons including flood risk; 
contamination and access  difficulties . The overall brownfield delivery rate is 
expected to be higher than the 30% figure as most sites below the 5 dwelling 
threshold for inclusion in the Plan are on brownfield land , as are “windfall” sites. 
Further information on the land supply for housing for Rossendale over the next 
fifteen years (201 8-2033) is included in the Council’s Strategic Housing Land 
Availability Assessment (SHLAA) (201 8).  
 
66 Housing delivery performance will be kept under review o n a yearly basis in 
Rossendale’s Five Year Housing Land Supply Reports  and the Housing Delivery 
Test.   
 
67 The five year housing land supply is calculated from the intended Local Plan’s 
adoption year (2021), so from 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2026. It includes dwellings 
remaining to be built on site allocations and other committed sites during that period, 
as well as a small sites allowance from 2024/25 onwards. The five year supply is 
discussed below, firstly setting out the housing req uirement and secondly identifying 
the housing supply.  
Housing Requirement:  
68 The five year housing target is based on the Local Plan proposed housing 
requirement of 208 dwellings per annum in years 1 and 2 (2019/20 and 2020/21) and 
185 dwellings per annum  for the remainder of the plan period 2021 -2036. The 
housing requirement should also consider any shortfalls from the early years of the 
Plan period, in this case 2019/20 and 2020/21. In 2019/20 and 2020/21, 171 
dwellings were completed which amounts to a shortfall of 245 dwellings.  
69 According to paragraph 74 of the NPPF, a 20% buffer should be included where 
there is a significant under delivery. As stated above the number of dwellings 
delivered sin ce the start of the plan period  is significantly lower than the requirement. 
Furthermore, the Housing Delivery Test published in January 2021, shows that 
Rossendale delivered less than 85% of its housing requirement. The Council has 
therefore applied a 20% buffer to the five year housin g land  calculation. The 
Planning Practice Guidance on housing supply and delivery further explains that the 
buffer should be applied to the requirement including any shortfall. Following this 
guidance, the calculation of the five year requirement between 2 021 and 2026 is 
shown in Table 2 and amounts to 1,404 dwellings.   P a g e  | 26  Table 2: Calculating the housing requirement for the period 2021 -2026

  P a g e  | 27  70 Therefore, based on the housing requirement of 208 dwellings per year (2019/20  - 
2020/21) and 185 dwellings per annum thereafter (including a backlog and 20% 
buffer), the Council can demonstrate an 8.26 year housing supply  for the period 
2021 – 2026. This i s set out in Table 5 below:

Please note that the table above includes extant planning permissions which have 
not started or are still being built out, and are not expected to be completed this 
financial year . Further detail relating to planning permissions can be found in the 
Housing Update Paper (August 2021) . The Housing Trajectory will be  updated 
annually and will be made publically available on the Council’s website in the 5 Year 
Land Supply Report which will be saved in the Monitoring Section of the Local Plan 
pages.   
 
Explanation   
72 Table 7 provides a list of housing allocations and the status of each site at 31st 
March 2021.  The final column of the table identifies sites that have site specific 
policies which should be referred to prior to submitting a planning application to 
ensure that t he site specific policy requirements are met for individual sites.  Site 
specific policies are additional requirements that should be met in conjunction with 
other Local Plan Policies.  
 
73  The NPPF requires the Council to maintain a five year land supply of specific 
‘deliverable’ sites that can meet the housing need for the next five years, plus the 
relevant buffer for any previous under -delivery.  Sites are considered ‘deliverable’ if 
they are available now, in a suitable location for development, and wit h a realistic 
prospect that the houses can be delivered within the next five years. It is expected 
that approximately 920 units will be built on allocated sites within the first five years 
of the Local Plan period (April 2019 to April 2024) providing a hea lthy supply of land 
to meet the Borough’s housing need. The NPPF also requires Local Planning 
Authorities to identify a supply of ‘developable’ sites to deliver houses within the next 
6 to 10 years and if possible for years 11 -15. In order to be considered  ‘developable’, 
sites should be in a sustainable location for housing and they should be available or 
achievable by a certain point in time.  
 
74 Approximately  50% of the sites allocated are small and medium in size reflecting the 
nature of the Valley , and this follows recommendations in the NPPF that at least 
10% of the sites allocated for residential development in a local plan should be sites 
of a hectare or less.  
 
75 The sites listed above have been identified in the Council’s SHLAA as ‘deliverable in 
the next five years’ (1 -5 years) or ‘developable in the medium to long term’ (6 -10 
years and 11 -15 years). Only larger sites, i.e. sites that could accommodate five or  P a g e  | 33  more dwellings are included. Housing delivery is monitored and updated on an 
annual basis and included in the Council’s Five Year Housing Land Supply Reports.   
 
76 Brownfield land has been utilised wherever possible  (30% of the site allocated are 
brownfield  and 10% are mixed sites)  but the supply of sites without significant 
constraints within the urban boundary is limited. Bringing vacant dwellings back into 
use is not counted within the allocations , in line with national guidance. Green Belt 
releases have been avoided wherever possible in line with the NPPF  which 
maintains strong protections for Green Belt, however it is recognised that some 
releases will be required to meet the housing requirements. A review of 
Rossendale’s Green Belt ‘Rossendale Green Bel t Review’ (2016) has been 
undertaken and is included as part of the Council’s evidence base documents. 
Allocation of sites on land identified as performing strongly in Green Belt terms has 
been avoided wherever possible.  Some allocated sites are recognise d as having 
issues that will require resolution before development can  start; other pieces of land 
however may come forward more quickly than anticipated. Further information on the 
methodology for assessing sites is included in the Council’s SHLAA.  
 
77 Larger developments of 50 dwellings or more will be expected to be guided by 
Masterplans taking a comprehensive approach to development. This would be 
expected to include a design code; address key infrastructure issues and provide an 
indication of how dev elopment of the site will be implemented.  
 
Housing Site Specific Policies  
H4 – Swinshaw Hall, Loveclough  
Development of up to 47 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. Comprehensive development of the entire site is demonstrated through a 
masterplan with an agreed programme of implementation;  
2. The development is implemented in accordance with an agreed design 
code;  
3. A Transport Assessment is provided demonstrating that the site can be 
safely and suitably accessed by all users, including disabled people,  prior to 
development taking place on site. This should provide details of a suitable 
vehicular access from Burnley Road, including access by pedestrians and 
cyclists and all required mitigation measures, such as relocation of the bus 
stop;  
4. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve, and where 
possible, enhance the setting of the nearby non -designated heritage asset 
known as Swinshaw Hall; and to also ensure the developm ent makes a 
positive contribution to the Loveclough Fold Conservation Area;  
5. Archaeological investigation of the area south of Swinshaw Hall for a 
potential historic burial ground;   P a g e  | 34  6. Measures to deal with minerals identified at the site are submitted and 
agreed prior to development taking place on site;  
7. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the Grassland Ecological Network 
and stepping stone habitat located within the site;  
8. A Landscape Assessment is submitted with details relating to layout, design 
and landscaping, showing how the development would respect the 
landscape character of the site and the views into and from the site;  
9. A Tree Impact Plan and Tree Constraints Plan are submitted with their 
findings secured and agreed prior to development taking place on site;  
10. A Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
11. New on -site open space is provided which leads to equivalent or better 
provision of open space in the area. The on -site open space should provide 
a functional parkland setting for Swinshaw Hall with details of an on -site 
play area in accordance with the par ameters plan below;  
12. Details are submitted which clarify the relationship between the 
development and the adjacent retained Loveclough Park;  
13. A Health Impact Assessment is submitted with its recommendations 
secured and agreed prior to development taking plac e on site;  
14. A contribution to the creation of car parking provision within the centre of 
Crawshawbooth;  
15. A contribution towards increased school provision within the area (if 
identified as necessary) . 
 
Explanation  
78   Rossendale Borough Council requires a masterplan for the development of 
the site and will work in partnership with key landowners and key stakeholders to 
ensure a masterplan is prepared. Implementation of development must be in 
accordance with an agreed De sign Code across the whole site allocation.  
79   The Transport Assessment should identify the necessary measures required 
to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for more 
sustainable forms of travel. The development will require a new highway junction in 
the form of a si mple priority junction with Burnley Road to be created. Swinshaw 
Hall is considered to be a non -designated heritage and sits to the east of the site, 
with its wider setting located within the site allocation. As such, development would 
have to consider the  effect of the development on the significance of the heritage 
asset. There is strong local belief that a former Quaker Burial ground is located 
towards the southern end of the site, south of the hedgerow between Goodshaw 
Lane and Broad Ing House, and ther efore an archaeological investigation of the 
relevant areas included in the developable areas would need to be undertaken.   P a g e  | 35  80   The site is located within a mineral safeguarding area, as shown on the 
Policies Map for the Joint Lancashire Minerals and Wast e Local Plan. Most of the 
site is identified as a stepping stone habitat for the Lancashire Ecological Network 
for Grassland. The site has strong landscape character and development should 
include appropriate landscape measures to minimise adverse visual i mpact. Parts 
of the site are at risk of surface water flooding. New on -site open space should be 
provide d in accordance with Policy HS6  with the wider setting of Swinshaw Hall 
enhanced as part of the development, and on -site play facilities secured with th eir 
location agreed with the local planning authority. Loveclough Park is located 
immediately to the west of the southern part of the site allocation and details of 
how the development would relate to this area, which includes areas of open 
space, should b e provided. The Health Impact Assessment should identify the 
health impacts of the development and propose recommendations to maximise the 
positive impacts and minimise the negative impacts, whilst maintaining a focus on 
addressing health inequalities.  
81   The closest Local Centre to the site, with the associated necessary facilities, is 
Crawshawbooth which has identified issues in respect of parking. Given the 
proximity of the site to the Local Centre the development of this site will be 
expected to iden tify and contribute to parking solutions within the Local Centre. 
Crawshawbooth Primary School is operating close to capacity and the additional 
houses will create further infrastructure pressures. A contribution to expanding 
capacity at the local school(s ) might be required to support the development.

H6 – Land adjacent Laburnum Cottages, Goodshaw  
Development of up to 10 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. An off -site contribution is made towards existing open space which leads to 
equivalent or better provision of open space overall;  
2. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserv e, and where 
possible, enhance the setting of the nearby Grade II listed building Church 
of St Mary and All Saints.  
 
 
Explanation  
82   Owing to the available area for development  and the proposed capacity of H6 , 
the Council does not consider it appropriate  to provide on -site open space 
provision if development of the site is for 10 or more dwellings. The nearby site of 
open space provision identified as KKP 95 in the OSA should be prioritised for 
enhancement, including the ancillary play facilities KKP 95.1  and 95.2 located on 
site. Development would have to consider the effect of the development on the 
significance of the heritage asset and should safeguard the setting of the 
designated heritage asset located within close pr oximity to the site allocation.  
 
H7 – Oak Mount Garden, Rawtenstall  
Development of up to 9 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve, and where 
possible, enhanc e the setting of the nearby non -designated heritage asset 
known as Oak Mount.  
 
Explanation  
83   Oak Mount is locate d immediately to the north of H7  and is considered to be a 
non-designated heritage asset.  Development would have to consider the effect of 
the development on the significance of the non -designated heritage asset and 
should safeguard the setting of the designated heritage asset located w ithin close 
proximity to the site allocation.   P a g e  | 37  H8 – Land at Bury Road, Rawtenstall  
Development of up to 7 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. An off -site contribution is made towards existing open space which leads to 
equivalent or better provision of open space overall;  
2. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to ensure the development 
does not have a detrimental impact on the Rawtenstall Conservation Area;  
3. No development take s place that would adversely affect the mature 
woodland to the west of the site running alongside the River Irwell,  
4. A Tree Impact Plan and Tree Constraints Plan are submitted with their 
findings secured and agreed prior to development taking place on site ; 
5. A Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary.  
 
Explanation  
84   The nearby sites of open space provision identified as KKP 42, KKP 44, and 
KKP 45 in the OSA should be prioritised for enhancement. The southern boundary 
of the Rawtenstall Conservation Area is located approximately 80m to the north of 
the site allocation and consideration should be given to the potential impact of th e 
development to this area. The site’s developable area has been reduced to 
accommodate the retention of the belt of mature trees located along the River 
Irwell. The site adjoins land located within Flood Zone 2 and 3.  
H11 – Loveclough  Working Mens Club an d land at rear and extension  
Development of up to 94 dwellings will be supported that:  
1. Comprehensive development of the entire site is demonstrated through a 
masterplan with an agreed programme of implementation;  
2. The development is implemented in accordanc e with an agreed design 
code;  
3. A Transport Assessment is provided demonstrating that the site can be 
safely and suitably accessed by all users, including disabled people, prior to 
development taking place on site;  
4. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to ensure the development 
does not have a detrimental impact on the Loveclough Fold Conservation 
Area;  
5. Measures to deal with minerals identified at the site are submitted and 
agreed pr ior to development taking place on site;  
  P a g e  | 38   
6. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the Grassland Ecological Network 
and stepping stone habitat located within the site;  
7. A Landscape Assessment is submitted with details relating to layout, design 
and landscaping, showing how the development would respect the 
landscape character of the site and the views into and from the site;  
8. A Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is  submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
9. New on -site open space is provided which leads to equivalent or better 
provision of open space in the area;  
10. A Health Impact Assessment is submi tted with its recommendations 
secured and agreed prior to development taking place on site;  
11. A contribution to the creation of car parking provision within the centre of 
Crawshawbooth.  
 
Explanation  
85   Rossendale Borough Council requires a masterplan for t he development of 
the site and will work in partnership with key landowners and key stakeholders to 
ensure a masterplan is prepared. Implementation of development must be in 
accordance with an agreed Design Code across the whole site allocation.  
86   The T ransport Assessment should identify the necessary measures required 
to improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for more 
sustainable forms of travel. Loveclough Fold Conservation Area is located 
approximately 60m to the north of the site allocation and consideration should be 
given to the potential impact of the development to this area.  The site is located 
within a mineral safeguarding area, as shown on the Policies Map for the Joint 
Lancashire Minerals and Waste Local Plan. Most of the site is classified as a 
wildlife corridor serving the Lancashire Ecological Network for Grassland and part 
of the site is identified as a stepping stone habitat. The site has strong landscape 
character and development should include appropriate  landscape measures to 
minimise adverse visual impact. Parts of the site are at risk of surface water 
flooding. New on -site open space should be provided in accordance with Policy 
HS6. The closest Local Centre to the site, with the associated necessary facilities, 
is Crawshawbooth which has identified issues in respect of parking. Given the 
proximity of the site to the Local Centre the development of this site will be 
expected to ident ify and contribute to parking solutions within the Local Centre.  
The Health Impact Assessment should identify the health impacts of the 
development and propose recommendations to maximise the positive impacts and 
minimise the negative impacts, whilst main taining a focus on addressing health 
inequalities.   P a g e  | 39  87   This housing site allocation comprises four separate planning consents, 
should these consents be implemented a masterplan will not be required.  
H15 – Carr Barn and Carr Farm  
Development of up to 25 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Transport Assessment is submitted taking into consideration the impact of 
the development on the capacity of the Rawtenstall Gyratory, with the 
mitigation measures identified in the Assessment delivered as part of the 
development  
2. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve, and where 
possible, enhance the setting of the nearby Grade II listed buildings: Carr 
Farm, Lomas Lane, and Gravestone in the Grounds of Carr House;  
3. A landscape buffer zone using native planting is created along the eastern 
and southern boundaries of the development, and landscaping of an 
appropriate density and height is also implemented throughout the site to 
‘soften’ the overall impact of the development.  
 
Explanation  
88   The Highway Capacity Study 2018 identified that the Rawtenstall Gyratory 
could accommodate the first five years of the Local Plan but could not 
accommodate the full fifteen years of the Plan. Therefore, an improvement scheme 
for the Gyratory is required to meet the additional capacity created from years 5 -15 
of the Plan. Development would have to consider the effect of the development on 
the significance of the heritage assets and should safeguard the setting of the 
designated heritage assets located within close proximity to the site allocation. A 
landscape assessment was undertaken for the site as part of the Lives and 
Landscape Assessment 2017 which recommended suitable mitigation measu res 
for any future development.  
 
H17 – Old Market Hall, Bacup  
Development of up to 16 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve , and where 
possible, enhance the Grade II listed Old Market Hall and its wider setting; 
and to also ensure the development makes a positive contribution to the 
Bacup Conservation Area.  
 
 
Explanation  
89   The Old Market Hall is a Grade II listed building and is located within the 
Bacup Conservation Area.  Development would have to consider the effect of the 
development on the significance of the heritage asset and should preserve the  P a g e  | 40  building and safeguard its setting. Consideration should also be given to the 
potential impact of the development on the Conservation Area.  
H22 – Land at Blackwood Road, Stacksteads  
Development of up to 41 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Heritage Statement and Impa ct Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve the setting of 
the nearby Grade II listed buildings: 22, 24 and 26, Rake Head Lane, and 
Waterbarn Baptist Chapel;  
2. A Transport Assessment is provided demonstra ting that the site can be 
safely and suitably accessed by all users, including disabled people, prior to 
development taking place on site.  
 
Explanation  
90   Development would have to consider the effect of the development on the 
significance of the herita ge asset and should safeguard the setting of the 
designated heritage asset located within close proximity to the site allocation. The 
Transport Assessment should identify the necessary measures required to 
improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for more 
sustainable forms of travel.  
 
H25 – Sheephouse Reservoir, Britannia  
Development of up to 63 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
2. Development avoids land identified as a stepping stone habitat for the 
Wetland and Health Ecological Network;  
3. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suita ble mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the Wetland and Heath Ecological 
Network and stepping stone habitat located within the site;  
4. A Landscape Assessment is submitted with details relating to layout, design 
and landscaping, showing how the dev elopment would respect the 
landscape character of the site and the views into and from the site;  
5. A landscape view is created around the stepping stone habitat and a 
landscape buffer zone is created using native planting along the northern 
boundary of the s ite;  
6. A contaminated land survey and appropriate remediation strategy is 
submitted and secured prior to development taking place on site.  
  P a g e  | 41   
Explanation  
 
91   Part of the site is at high risk of surface water flooding. Most of the site is 
classified as a wildlife corridor serving the Lancashire Ecological Network for 
Wetland and Heath. Part of the site to the west is identified as a stepping stone 
habitat. Oppor tunities will exist to secure on -site improvements in biodiversity. A 
landscape assessment was undertaken for the site as part of the Lives and 
Landscape Assessment 2017 which recommended suitable mitigation measures 
for any future development. The site ha s recorded areas of contaminated land 
connected to historic land uses and therefore investigations and relevant 
remediation measures will be required.  
 
H26 – Land off Pennine Road, Bacup  
Development of up to 71 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. New on -site open space is provided and an off -site contribution is made 
towards enhancing existing sites of open space which lead to equivalent or 
better provision of open space in the area;  
2. No development takes place that would adversely affect the mature  belt of 
trees along the eastern boundary of the site and those to the north.  
3. A Tree Impact Plan and Tree Constraints Plan are submitted with their 
findings secured and agreed prior to development taking place on site;  
4. Vehicular access is taken from Fiel dfare Way;  
5. An Ecological Assessment is submitted which identifies the ecological value 
of the site and addresses any potential harm with suitable biodiversity 
enhancement measures to be delivered on site.  
 
Explanation  
 
92   New on -site open space should be provided in accordance with Policy HS6, 
and existing sites of open space identified as KKP 123 and KKP 128 in the OSA 
should be prioritised for enhancement. The site’s developable area has been 
reduced to accommodate the re tention of the mature trees on site. The proposed 
access is the only safe and adoptable access for the site. The site is of ecological 
value and an Ecological Assessment would be required to accompany any 
planning application in line with ENV4.

provision of open space in the area.   P a g e  | 43   
Explan ation  
 
95   The southern boundary of H31  adjoins the Bacup Conservation Area and 
consideration should be given to the potential impact of the development to this 
area.  New on -site open space should be provided in accordance with Policy HS6. 
 
H33 – Land off Gladstone Street, Bacup  
Development of up to 63 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to ensure the development 
does not hav e a detrimental impact on the Bacup Conservation Area;  
2. A landscape buffer zone using native tree planting is created to the rear of

5. New on -site open space is provided and an off -site contribution is made 
towards enhancing existing sites of open space which lead to equivalent or 
better provision of open space in the area.  
 
 
Explanation  
96   The southern boundary of the Bacup Conservation Area is located 
approximately 40m to the west of the site allocation and consideration should be 
given to the potential impact of the development to this area. A landscape 
assessment was undertaken for the si te as part of the Lives and Landscape 
Assessment 2017 which recommended suitable mitigation measures for any future 
development. The site’s developable area has been reduced to take into account 
the mature trees on site which should be protected as part of  the site’s 
development. The proposed access is the only safe and adoptable access for the 
site. New on site open space should be provided in accordance with Policy HS6, 
and existing sites of open space identified as KKP 123, KKP 128, and KKP 478 in 
the OSA should be prioritised for enhancement.   P a g e  | 44   
H35 – Land off Cowtoot Lane, Bacup  
Development of up to 94 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Transport Assessment i s provided demonstrating that the site can be 
safely and suitably accessed by all users, including disabled people, prior to 
development taking place on site;  
2. Access to the site is taken from both Cowtoot Lane and Gordon Street with 
an internal estate roa d providing links between the two;  
3. A coal mining risk assessment is submitted alongside intrusive site 
investigations which inform the potential remedial works and/or mitigation 
measures necessary and guide the layout of the development;  
4. A Landscape Assess ment is submitted with details relating to layout, design 
and landscaping showing how the development would respect the 
landscape character of the site and the views into and from the site;  
5. A landscape buffer zone using native species is created along the boundary 
of the Moorland Fringe landscape type identified within the site, and 
landscaping of an appropriate density and height is also implemented 
throughout the site to ‘soften’ the overall impact of the development;  
6. Existing boundaries of the site are r etained and repaired where appropriate 
using dry stone walls;  
7. A contaminated land survey and appropriate remediation strategy is 
submitted and secured prior to development taking place on site;  
8. Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is subm itted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
9. An Ecological Assessment is submitted which identifies the ecological value 
of the site and addresses any potential harm with suitable biodiversity 
enhancement measures to be delivered on site.  
 
Explanation  
97   The Local Highway Authority would favour the site being accessed from both 
Cowtoot Lane and Gordon Street with the internal estate road of the development 
providing links between the two as this would reduce the direct impact of the 
development on either o f these routes and allow residents to make an informed 
choice as to the appropriate route to take accounting for the prevailing traffic 
conditions. The Transport Assessment should identify the necessary measures 
required to improve accessibility and safety  for all modes of travel, particularly for 
more sustainable forms of travel.  
98   The site is in an area of recorded and likely unrecorded mine workings at 
shallow depth and the Coal Authority have advised that that there are 3 mine  P a g e  | 45  entries (adits) along  the northern boundary of the site. The site has strong 
landscape character with part of the site located within the Moorland Fringe 
Landscape Character Type. As such, development should include appropriate 
landscape measures to minimise adverse visual imp act. The site has recorded 
areas of contaminated land connected to historic land uses and therefore 
investigations and relevant remediation measures will be required. Parts of the site 
are at risk of surface water flooding. The site is of ecological value and an 
Ecological Assessment would be required to accompany any planning application 
in line with ENV4.  
 
H36 – Land off Todmorden Road, Bacup  
Development of up to 53 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Landscape Assessment is submitted with detai ls relating to layout, design 
and landscaping showing how the development would respect the 
landscape character of the site and the views into and from the site;  
2. A Tree Impact Plan and Tree Constraints Plan are submitted with their 
findings secured and agr eed prior to development taking place on site;  
3. Existing boundaries of the site are retained and repaired where appropriate 
using dry stone walls;  
4. Access is taken from a single access point from Todmorden Road (subject 
to site being delivered under one comp rehensive scheme);  
5. A coal mining risk assessment is submitted alongside intrusive site 
investigations which inform the potential remedial works and/or mitigation 
measures necessary and guide the layout of the development;  
6. Flood Risk Assessment and drainag e management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
7. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the Gra sslands Networks habitat.  
 
Explanation  
99   The site has strong landscape character and development should include 
appropriate landscape measures to minimise adverse visual impact. The Local 
Highway Authority considers a single access point taken from Todmorden Road to 
be the preferred option if the site is to be delivered as a whole. The site is in an 
area of recorded and likely unrecorded mine workings at shallow depth and the 
Coal Authority have advised two mine entries may be present on site, one ad jacent 
to the site boundary with Todmorden Road and one adjacent to the site boundary 
with Old Todmorden Road. Parts of the site are at risk of surface water flooding. 
Part of the site is classified as a wildlife corridor serving the Lancashire Ecological 
Network for Wetland and Heath.   P a g e  | 46   
H42 – Land at Kirkhill Avenue, Haslingden  
Development of up to 22 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. New on -site open space is provided which leads to equivalent or better 
provision of open space in the area;  
2. Vehicular access is taken solely from Kirkhill Avenue with cycle and 
pedestrian links to Kirkhill Road;  
3. An Ecological Assessment is submitted which identifies the ecological value 
of the site and addresses any potential harm with suitable biodiversity 
enha ncement measures to be delivered on site;  
4. A Tree Impact Plan and Tree Constraints Plan are submitted with their 
findings secured and agreed prior to development taking place on site;  
5. A Landscape Assessment is submitted with details relating to layout, desi gn 
and landscaping showing how the development would respect the 
landscape character of the site and the views into and from the site;  
6. Landscaping of an appropriate density and height is implemented 
throughout the site to ‘soften’ the overall impact of the  development.   
 
Explanation  
100   New on -site open space should be provided in accordance with Policy HS6. 
It is not considered that a safe and suitable vehicular access from Kirkhill Road 
can be achieved, and therefore vehicular access would have to be taken from 
Kirkhill Avenue. However, agreement would have to be reached with the relevant 
street managers f or the use of and access on to Moorland Rise and Kirkhill 
Avenue as parts or all of these roads are privately maintained. The site is of 
ecological value and adjoins a wildlife ecological corridor serving the Lancashire 
Grassland Ecological Network. Theref ore, an Ecological Assessment would be 
required to accompany any planning application in line with Policy ENV4. The 
site’s developable area has been reduced to accommodate the retention of the 
existing woodland across the site. The site has strong landscap e character and 
development should include appropriate landscape measures to minimise adverse 
visual impact.  
H44 – Land adjacent 53 Grane Road, Haslingden  
Development of up to 5 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. An off -site contribution is made towards existing open space which leads to 
equivalent or better provision of open space overall;  
2. A Tree Impact Plan and Tree Constraints Plan are submitted with their 
findings secured and agreed prior to development taking place on site.  
 
  P a g e  | 47  Explanation  
 
101   H44 forms part of a larger site of open space identified as KKP 22 in the OSA 
and this should be prioritised for enhancement. The site’s developable area has 
been reduced to accommodate the retention of the existing mature trees on the 
site. 
 
H45 – Land Adjacent Park Avenue/Cricceth Close, Haslingden  
Development of up to 30 dwellings  will be supported provided that:

towards enhancing existing sites of open space which lead to  equivalent or 
better provision of open space in the area;  
2. Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
3. A contaminated land survey and appropriate remediation strategy is 
submitted and secured prior to development taking place on site.  
 
Explanation  
 
102   New on -site open space should be provided in accordance with Policy HS6, 
and existing sites of open space identified in the OSA as KKP 19, KKP 318, and 
KKP 381 (including the ancillary play facilities located on KKP 381) should be 
prioritised for enhancement. Part of the site is at high risk of surface water flooding. 
The site has recorded areas of contaminated land connected to histo ric land uses 
and therefore investigations and relevant remediation measures will be required.  
 
H46 – Land to side and rear of Petrol Station, Manchester Road  
Development of up to 6 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve, and where 
possible, enhance the setting of the nearby Grade II listed building Church 
of St Peter, and the Grade II* listed building Grane Mill, Haslingd en, 
including boundary walls and north yard;  
2. A contaminated land survey and appropriate remediation strategy is 
submitted and secured prior to development taking place on site.  
 
Explanation  
103   Development would have to consider the effect of the develop ment on the 
significance of the heritage asset and should safeguard the setting of the 
designated heritage asset located within close proximity to the site allocation. The 
site has recorded areas of contaminated land connected to historic land uses, and  P a g e  | 48  the site’s existing use is a filling station. Therefore, investigations and relevant 
mediation measures will be required.  
H47 – Land to the rear of Haslingden Cricket Club Haslingden Cricket Club, 
land off Private Lane  
Development of approximately 30 dwellings and enhanced cricket facilities will be 
supported provided that : 
1.      The redevelopment of the entire site will be in general accordance with the 
parameters plan shown belo :w, which indicates the area for housing shaded 
orange (reference to Policy HS2) and the area for the retention and 
improvement of the existing sports and recreation facilities shaded green and 
reference to Policy LT1  and subject to the criteria listed below:    
  Figure 2: Haslingde n Cricket Club Location Plan  
  
2.      A masterplan for the whole site  with an agreed programme of implementation 
to be submitted as part of a planning application in general accordance with 
the parameters plan;  
3.      Retain at least an equivalent quantity of land and ancillary facilities to accord 
with Policy LT1 f or the continued operation of Haslingden Cricket Club 
including the provision of a pitch, practice net area, and an element of car 
parking to serve the cricket club;  
4.      Include for the provision of a new, relocated pavilion to serve the cricket club 
and other local community functions, of a n equivalent or greater  size to the 
existing facilities, together with improved changing facilities   All relocated and 
improved facilities should meet the England and Wales Cricket Board desig n 
requirements;  
5.      Provide for the relocation of the training wicket off -site to land at Haslingden 
High School, prior to any development taking place;  
 
 
 P a g e  | 49   
 
6.      Provide satisfactory measures to protect both the proposed dwellings and 
surrounding existing dwellings from the risk of ball strike from the adjacent 
cricket pitch, where adequate safety margins are not in place. The measures 
should be  informed by a Ball Strike Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategy  
and approved as part of any subsequent  planning application for the housing 
development;  
7.      Provide satisfactory measures to protect both the proposed dwellings and 
surrounding existing dwellings from noise from the adjacent cricket ground.  
The measures should be informed by a Noise Ass essment and Mitigation 
Strategy;  
8.      Deliver approximately 30 houses in the western part of the site to the rear of 
the existing properties on Grasmere Road;  
9.      Provide satisfactory vehicular access to the new residential properties off 
Private Lane;  
10.     Provide a satisfactory new vehicular access from Clod Lane to serve the 
cricket ground;  
11.    Provide a safe and convenient pedestrian and cyclist access to the site, 
linking it to the footpath and cycleway network;  
12.      A phasing and in frastructure delivery schedule for the entire allocation;  
13.     The protection of the existing Sport and Recreational Facilities within the site 
allocation boundaries in perpetuity subject to the criteria set out in Strategic 
Policy LT1.  
 
Explanation  
104   Bent Gate cricket ground is ho me to Haslingden Cricket Club. The allocation 
seeks to secure the future of sports provision on -site through an element of 
enabling, residential development.  The site is located within the urban boundary in 
Haslingden, surrounded by existing built development.  
105   The facilities  at Haslingden Cricket Club, although well used, are date d and 
in need of improvement.  Additional male and female changing facilities are 
required, and these should be accessible for people wit h disabilities. Some of the 
land on the western side of the Cricket Club is surplus to the Cricket Club’s 
requirements and considered suitable for additional new housing.   The sale of this 
land for housing would finance the redevelopment of the Cricket Clu b immediately 
to the east of this housing allocation.     P a g e  | 50  106   This land includes a training wicket which, although not in use currently, will 
need to be replaced.   The Cricket Club has been in discussions with Haslingden 
High School to provide at the Schoo l a non -turf cricket wicket, capable of being 
used by the school for both practice and matches and which the Cricket Club 
would be able to use as needed.   This will need to be provided prior to the 
approval of any planning application. Some of this land is  currently used for 
parking by the Cricket Club on match days and for other social events held in the 
Pavilion. This car parking will need to be accommodated elsewhere and it is 
expected that both the Pavilion and the associated required car parking may be  
relocated to the eastern side of the Cricket Ground, with access removed from 
Private Lane and a new access created from Clod Lane.   Although in principle the 
Pavilion and parking can be relocated development management matters will need 
to be resolved to  the satisfaction of the Local Panning Authority and the Highway 
Authority.  
107   The Playing Pitch Strategy (2016) identifies sufficient availability of cricket 
pitches within Rossendale to meet existing and future demand.   this is confirmed in 
the emerg ing un -adopted Playing Pitch Strategy for 2021, as agreed with Sport 
England. On this basis the applicant is not required to replace the land lost to the 
housing development, so long as the policy criteria  set out above is met.  However, 
the re -provision o f a non -turf training wicket to the playing pitches at Haslingden 
High School is required in order to meet an in crease in junior cricket demand.  
108   This comprehensive redevelopment approach to the site has been the 
subject of discussions with the England and Wales Cricket Board and Sport 
England and they confirm their endorsement subject to the protection of the sports 
and recreation facilities on sit e, including mitigating any potential prejudicial impact 
from the proposed housing that could affect the operation of the cricket ground 
either from incidents of ball strike and/or noise complaints from residents.  This 
proposal will provide additional new  homes in line with the Council’s housing 
strategy and secure the long -term sustainability of the sport and recreation 
facilities used by Haslingden Cricket Club.  
  
H52 – Foxhill Drive, Whitewell Bottom  
Development of up to 7 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. New on -site open space is provided which leads to equivalent or better 
provision of open space in the area.  
 
 
Explanation  
109   Part of H52  has been identified as open space in the OSA (ref. KKP 481) and 
therefore the loss should be replaced by equivalent or better provision.   P a g e  | 51

the nearby Grade II listed building Heightside.  
 
 
Explanation  
 
111   Part of the site has previously been granted planning permission for no. 30 
dwellings3. Therefore, the remaining developable area of the site has a capacity of 
50 dwellings.  Part of the site is at risk of surface water flooding. Develo pment 
would have to consider the effect of the development on the significance of the 
heritage asset and should safeguard the setting of the designated heritage asset 
located within close pro ximity to the site allocation.  
H56 – Hareholme, Staghills  
Development of up to 9 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. An off -site contribution is made towards existing open space which leads to 
equivalent or better provision of open space overall;  
2. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suit able mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the Woodland Ecological Network 
and stepping stone habitat located within the site.   P a g e  | 52  Explanation  
 
112   The nearby sites of open space provision identified as KKP 58 and KKP 72 in 
the OSA should be prioritised for enhancement. The site is identified as a stepping 
stone habitat for the Lancashire Ecological Network for Woodland.   
 
H57 – Land off Peel Street, Cloughfold  
Development of up to 8 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Heritage State ment and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to ensure the development 
does not have a detrimental impact on the Cloughfold Conservation Area;

mitigation measures necessary;  
3. A contaminated land survey and appropriate remediation strategy is 
submitted and secured prior to development taking place on site.  
4. An Ecologic al Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the Woodland Network and stepping 
stone habitat located within the site.  
 
Explanation  
 
113   Part of the site is located within the Cloughfold Conservation  Area and 
consideration should be given to the potential impact of the development to this 
area. Part of the site is at risk of surface water flooding. The site has recorded 
areas of contaminated land connected to historic land uses and therefore 
investiga tions and relevant remediation measures will be required. The site is 
classified as a stepping stone habitat and wildlife corridor serving the Lancashire 
Ecological Network for Woodland.  
 
H58 – Hargreaves Fold Lane, Chapel Bridge, Lumb  
Development of up t o 23 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve the setting of 
the nearby Grade II listed buildings Hargreaves Fold Cottages and 
Hargreaves Fold Farmhouse South, and the non -designated heritage asset 
known as Lumb Baptist Chapel;  
2. A suitable access to the site is achieved from the section of land located 
adjacent to Burnley Road East with cycle and pedestrian links from 
Hargreaves Fo ld Lane.   P a g e  | 53  Explanation  
114   Development would have to consider the effect of the development on the 
significance of the heritage assets and should safeguard the setting of the 
designated heritage assets located within close proximity to the site allocation.  It is 
unlikely that a suitable vehicular access could be achieved from Hargreaves Fold 
Lane and therefore the creation of a new access from land owned by Rossendale 
Borough Council would be recommended.  
H64 – Irwell Vale Mill  
Development of up to 30 dwel lings will be supported provided that:  
1. A Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
2. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is  provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve, and where 
possible, enhance the setting of the nearby Grade II listed buildings 1 -5 
Aitken Street, 1 -21 Bowker Street, and 2 -24 Bowker Street;  
3. The development makes a positi ve contribution to the Irwell Vale 
Conservation Area;  
4. Compensatory improvements must be provided to the Green Belt land in 
proximity of the site;  
5. A contaminated land survey and appropriate remediation strategy is 
submitted and secured prior to development taking place on site;  
6. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the nearby designated areas for 
Grassland Network and Woodland Network, and the adjoining watercourse.  
 
 
 
Explanation  
 
115   The site is located within Flood Zone 2 and Flood Zone 3, and is also at high 
risk of surface water flooding. An outline planning application has been submitted 
for 30 dwellings on the site and the Flood Risk Assessment accompanying the 
application p roposes mitigation measures which the Environment Agency consider 
to be acceptable. Therefore, the Environment Agency have no objection to the 
application subject to conditions which include construction of a flood wall along 
the southern bank of the River  Ogden within the site; construction of flood storage 
area; finished floor levels to be set 150mm above adjacent ground levels, and a 
minimum 8m undeveloped buffer strip is provided adjacent to the River Ogden.  
  P a g e  | 54  116   Development would have to consider th e effect of the development on the 
significance of the heritage assets and should safeguard the setting of the 
designated heritage assets located within close proximity to the site allocation. 
Development should also make a positive contribution to the Irw ell Vale 
Conservation Area.  
 
117   Due to the removal of the site from Green Belt it is necessary that there are 
compensatory improvements to the Green Belt within the local area in accordance 
with Policy SD4.  Further details are contained in the Green B elt Compensatory 
Document or its successor. The site has recorded areas of contaminated land 
connected to historic land uses and therefore investigations and relevant 
remediation measures will be required.  
118   The site is located within close proximity t o a Core Area of the Lancashire 
Ecological Network for Grassland, a stepping stone habitat for the Lancashire 
Ecological Network for Woodland, and adjoins a watercourse with ecological value. 
In reference to the outline planning application submitted on th e site, the 
Environment Agency consider the development to be acceptable in terms of its 
impact on ecological value subject to conditions protecting a minimum 
undeveloped 8 metre wide buffer zone along the River Ogden’s north western and 
southern banksides , and a new 20 metre flood storage area along the River 
Ogden’s left hand bank. These conditions are outlined in the Flood Risk 
Assessment which accompanied the outline planning application.   
 
H65 – Land East of Market Street, Edenfield  
Development of up  to 9 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. Landscaping of an appropriate density and height is implemented 
throughout the site to ‘soften’ the overall impact of the development and 
provide a buffer to the new Green Belt boundary;  
2. Materials and bounda ry treatments should reflect the local context;  
3. Compensatory improvements must be provided to the Green Belt land in 
proximity of the site.  
 
Explanation  
119   Sensitive landscaping will be required in order to provide a buffer to the new 
Green Belt boundary.  Any biodiversity improvements should be directed to this 
landscaped area. Due to the removal of the site from Green Belt it is necessary 
that there are compensatory improvements to the Green Belt within the local area 
in accordance with SD4 in p articular these should relate to proposals identi fied at 
Edenfield Cricket Club and Edenfield and Stubbins Schools. Compensatory  P a g e  | 55  measures could also be directed towards footpath and cycleway improvements in 
the vicinity.  
H66 – Land West of Market Street, Edenfield  
Development for approximately 400 houses  would be supported provided that:  
 
1. The comprehensive development of the entire site is demonstrated through 
a masterplan with an agreed programme of implementation and phasing;  
 
2. The development is implemented in accordance with an agreed design 
code;  
 
3. A Transport Assessment is provided demonstrating that the site can be 
safely and suitably accessed by all users, including disabled people, prior to 
development taking place on site. In particular:  
i. safe vehicular access points to the site are achieved from the field 
adjacent to no. 5 Blackburn Road and from the field opposite nos. 88 – 
116 Market Street. Full details of access, including the number of access 
points, will be determined through the Tra nsport Assessment work and 
agreed with the Local Highway Authority;  
ii. agree suitable mitigation measures in respect of the capacity of Market 
Street to accommodate additional traffic. Improvements will be needed to 
the Market Street corridor from Blackbu rn Road to the mini -roundabout 
near the Rawstron  Arms.  Measures to assist pedestrian and vulnerable 
road users will be required;  
4. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conse rve, and where 
possible, enhance the setting of the Church, the non -designated heritage 
assets which include Chatterton Hey (Heaton House), Mushroom House, 
and the former Vicarage, and the other designated and non -designated 
heritage assets in the area;  
5.     Specific criteria for the design and layout needs to take account of:  
i. Retention and strengthening of the woodland enclo sures to the north and 
south of  the Church  
ii. The layout of the housing parcels should be designed  to allow views to 
the Church to continue  
iii. The relationship of the new dwellings to the Recreation Ground to ensure 
safe non -vehicular access is provided  
iv. Public open space to be provided along the woodland area south of t he 
brook/ Church enclosure  
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 56   
v. Landscaping of an appr opriate density and height is implemented 
throughout the site to ‘soften’ the overall impact of the development and 
provide a buffer  to the new Green Belt boundary  
vi. Materials and boundary treatments should reflect the local context  
6.      An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts particularly on the Woodland Network and 
stepping stone habitat located within the site.  
7. Compensatory improvements must be provided to the Green  Belt land in 
proximity of the  site in accordance with Policy SD4  
8. Geotechnical investigations will be required to confirm land stability and 
protection of the A56, and consideration paid to the suitability or not of 
sustainable drainage systems on the boundary adjoining the A56  
9. Provision will be required to expand either Edenfield CE Primary School or 
Stubbins  Primary School from a 1 form entry to a 1.5 form entry primary 
school, and for a secondary school contribution subject to the Education 
Autho rity.  Land to the rear of Edenfield CE Primary School which may be 
suitable is shown on the Policies Map as ‘Potential School and Playing Field 
Extension’.  Any proposals to extend the schools into the Green Belt  would 
need to be justified under very spe cial circum stances and the provisions of 
paragraph 144 of the NPPF;  
10. Noise and air quality impacts will need to be investigated and necessary 
mitigation measures secured;  
11. Consideration should be given to any potential future road widening on the 
amenity of any dwellings facing the A56.  
 
Explanation  
120   Exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated to support the release 
of this land lying between the A56 and Market Street in Edenfield from the Green 
Belt. The area is very open in character and allows views of the surrounding hills 
and moors and will require a well -designed scheme that responds to the site’s 
context, makes the most of the environmental, heritage and leisure assets, and 
delivers the necessary sustainability, transport, connectivit y, accessibility (including 
public transport) and infrastructure requirements.  
121   Rossendale Council therefore requires a Masterplan and will work in 
partnership with key landowners and key stakeholders, including the Edenfield 
Community Neighbourhood Forum, to ensure a Masterplan is prepared.   P a g e  | 57  122   Edenfield Parish Church is Grade II* and development would have to 
consider the effect of the development on the significance of the heritage asset 
and should safeguard the setting of the designated heritage asset located within 
close proximity to the site allocation.  There are several non -designated heritage 
assets located within close proximity of the site allocation and other  designated 
and non -designated heritage assets located in the area. Development wo uld have 
to consider the effect of the development on the significance of these heritage 
assets and should safeguard the setting of the heritage assets.  
123   Sensitive landscaping using native species will be required in order to 
provide a suitable buffer to the new Green Belt boundary.  Any biodiversity 
improvements should be directed to this landscaped area as well as to the mature 
woodland, identified as a s tepping stone habitat.  
124   Due to the removal of the site from Green Belt it is necessary that there are 
compensatory improvements to the Green Belt within the local area in accordance 
with SD4 in particular these should relate to proposals identi fied a t Edenfield 
Cricket Club and Edenfield and Stubbins Schools. Compensatory measures could 
also be directed towards footpath and cycleway improvements in the vicinity as set 
out in the Council’s Green Belt Compensation Document.  
125   Any proposed developmen t must make a positive contribution to the local 
environment and consider the site’s form and character, reflecting the setting of 
features such as the Grade II*  Listed Edenfield Parish Church and incorporating 
appropriate mitigation. Development must be  of a high quality design using 
construction methods and materials that make a positive contribution to design 
quality, character and appearance. The development must contribute towards the 
sustainable use of resources. Implementation of development must b e in 
accordance with an agreed Design Code/Masterplan across the whole 
development. The layout should be designed to allow glimpsed views towards the 
Church to continue, for example, by aligning the principle road(s) along a north -
south or north east – south west axis, and building heights restricted.  
126   In light of the site’s natural features and relationship to surrounding uses, 
development is likely to come forward in a number of distinct phases. The 
infrastructure associated with the overall developm ent and each individual phase 
will be subject to the production of a phasing and infrastructure delivery schedule 
to be contained in the Masterplan. Site access will be a key consideration.  
127   Development proposals will be subject to a Scoping Study, a Transport 
Assessment and Travel Plan. This must be agreed with Lancashire County 
Council. Appropriate measures must be put in  place to address any impacts the 
development may have on the strategic and local road networks. A Travel Plan will 
seek to ensure  that the development promotes the use of public transport, walking 
and cycling.  
128   A Health Impact Assessment will be required to maximise the overall benefits 
of the scheme to intended residents.   P a g e  | 58  129   An Appropriate Assessment under the Conservatio n of Species and Habitats 
should be  undertaken to address any impact on the Breeding Bird Assemblage for 
the South Pennine Moors.  
130   A geotechnical study will need to confirm that there will be no adverse 
impacts on the A56.  The suitability of provid ing a Sustainable Drainage System 
will need to be considered too as National Highways  consider that storing water on 
site may not be advisable. National Highways  may wish to widen the A56 and 
further discussions with National Highways  are advised and if th is is possible, this 
should be addressed by a suitable site layout plan to address this.  
131   Edenfield Primary School is operating close to capacity and there is no 
capacity at Stubbins Primary School. The preferred course of action of the 
Education Authority would be to expand Edenfield CE Primary School onto 
adjacent land to the rear, provided that any access issues can be overcome, or at 
Stubbins Primary School . 
H67 – Edenwood Mill, Edenfield  
Development of up to 47 dwellings will be supported prov ided that:  
1. A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment is provided and suitable 
mitigation measures are identified and secured to conserve, and where 
possible, enhance the non -designated heritage asset Edenwood Mill and its 
wider setting;  
2. Views should be pr otected across the valley by sympathetic massing, height 
and layout of the dwellings ; 
3. A Flood Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary ; 
4. A Transport Assessment is provided demonstrating that the site can be 
safely and suitably accessed by all users, including disabled people, prior to 
development taking place on site;  
5. Compensatory improvements must be provided to the Green Belt land in 
proximity of the site including improvements to the woodland on -site and 
access to this and to the footpaths in the vicinity of the site.  Other relevant 
schemes include Edenfield Cricket Club ; 
6. The site has recorded areas of contaminated land connected to hi storic land 
uses and therefore investigations and relevant remediati on measures will be 
required;  
7. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the Woodland Ecological Network 
and stepping s tone habitat located within the site, as well as the adjoining 
watercourse. Measures should include retaining as many of the mature 
trees within the site as reasonably possible;  
8. A Tree Impact Plan and Tree Constraints Plan are submitted with their 
findings  secured and agreed prior to development taking place on site.   P a g e  | 59   
Explanation  
132   The capacity of the site allocation is based on the retention and conversion of 
Edenwood Mill and its associated buildings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction 
of the Local Planning Authority that retention of the mill buildings is not reasonably 
possible then the capacity of the site may be lower than 47 dwellings, however this 
would be confirmed at planning application stage. Edenwood Mill is located within 
the site a llocation and is considered to be a non -designated heritage asset.  
Development would have to consider the effect of the development on the 
significance of the heritage asset and should safeguard the setting of the 
designated heritage asset located within close proximity to the site allocation.  
133   A landscape assessment was undertaken for the site as part of the Lives and 
Landscape Assessment 2017 which recommended suitable mitigation measures 
for any future development. Part of the site is located withi n Flood Zone 2 and 
Flood Zone 3, and is also at high risk of surface water flooding in parts. The 
Transport Assessment should identify the necessary measures required to 
improve accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for more 
sustai nable forms of travel. A suitable vehicular access cannot be achieved from 
Rosebank and therefore vehicular access to the site should be taken from the 
existing access from Wood Lane (A56) to the north with suitable mitigation 
measures secured and agreed w ith the Local Highway Authority.  
134   Due to the removal of the site from Green Belt it is necessary that there are 
compensatory improvements to the Green Belt within the local area in accordance 
with SD4. The site has recorded areas of contaminated land  connected to historic 
land uses and therefore investigations and relevant remediation measures will be 
required. Most of the site is classified as a wildlife corridor serving the Lancashire 
Ecological Network for Woodland and part of the site is identifie d as a stepping 
stone habitat for the Woodland network. The site also adjoins a watercourse which 
has ecological value. The site’s developable area has been reduced to 
accommodate the retention of the mature trees on site which form part of the 
stepping st one habitat and should be retained for their ecological and landscape 
value.  
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 60     
H68 – Grane Village, Helmshore  
Development of up to 139 dwellings will be supported provided that:  
1. Vehicular access should be created with a junction on Holcombe Road;  
2. A Flo od Risk Assessment and drainage management strategy is submitted 
which guides the layout of the development and secures the appropriate 
mitigation measures necessary;  
3. An Ecological Assessment is undertaken which identifies suitable mitigation 
measures for any adverse impacts on the adjacent Grassland, and 
Woodland stepping stone habitats;  
4. Landscaping of an appropriate density and height is implemented 
throughout the site to ‘soften’ the overall impact of the development;  
5. New on -site open space is provided w hich leads to equivalent or better 
provision of open space in the area;  
6. The site has recorded areas of contaminated land connected to historic land 
uses and therefore investigations and relevant remediation measures will be 
required.  
 
Explanation  
135   Parts of the site are at high risk of surface water flooding. The site sits 
adjacent to stepping stone habitats belonging to the Grassland and Woodland 
Lancashire Ecological Networks respectively, as well as a corridor for the 
Woodland network. A landscape  assessment was undertaken for the site as part of 
the Lives and Landscape Assessment 2017 which recommended suitable 
mitigation measures for any  future development. Part of H68  has been identified 
as open space in the OSA as KKP 16 and therefore the loss should be replaced by 
equivalent or better provision. The site has recorded areas of contaminated land 
connected to historic land uses and therefore investigations and relevant 
remediation measures will be required.  
  P a g e  | 61  Policy HS3:  Affordable Housing  
New housing developments of 10 or more dwellings (0.50 hectares or part there of) 
will be required to provide:  
a) a requirement of 30% on -site affordable housing from market housing schemes 
subject to site and development considerations (such as financial viab ility). Of 
the total number of homes to be provided, at least 10% should be available for 
affordable home ownership as part of the overall affordable housing 
contribution, unless the proposal provides solely for Build for Rent, provides 
specialist accommod ation to meet specific needs (e.g. purpose built 
accommodation for the elderly), is a self -build proposal, or is exclusively for 
affordable housing, entry level exception sites or rural exception sites.  
 
b) The affordable housing shall be provided in line with identified needs of tenure, 
size and type as set out in the latest available information on housing needs.
  
In particular the SHMA indicates there is a requirement for:  
• Older peoples housing, especially extra care and residential care, of around  
1700 units by 2034  
• Housing suitable for Disabled people  
• Social rented housing in rural communities  
 
The Council will expect, where appropriate, a proportion of the affordable housing 
provided to meet these needs. This is to be considered in conjunction w ith policy 
HS8.  
  
Within larger  housing developments, the affordable housing will be evenly distributed 
throughout the development. Where a site has been divided and brought forward in 
phases, the Council will consider the site as a whole for the purposes  of calculating 
the appropriate level of affordable housing provision.  
 
Rural Exception Sites  
 
On any rural exception sites there will be a requirement of 100% on -site affordable 
housing unless it can be demonstrated that a small element of market housing  is 
required to make the scheme viable.  Any such proposal will also need to address 
the criteria of policy HS15.  
 
In exceptional circumstances, off -site provision or financial contributions of a broadly 
equivalent value instead of on -site provision, will be acceptable where the site or 
location is unsustainable for affordable housing.  
 
   P a g e  | 62   
The size of the development should not be artificially reduced to decrease or 
eliminate the affordable housing requirement, for example, by sub -dividing sites or 
reducing  the density of all or part of a site. The Council will consider the site as a 
whole for the purposes of calculating the appropriate level of affordable housing 
provision.  
 
Explanation  
 
136 The Government is committed to boosting housing supply and deliver ing a wide 
choice of housing, including affordable housing to meet housing needs. Affordable 
housing comprises social rented, affordable rented and intermediate housing 
provided to eligible household s whose needs are not met by the private housing 
market.   
 
137 The Council’s SHMA has demonstrated that there is considerable need for 
affordable housing in Rossendale and it states that the issue must be tackled to 
prevent the problem from becoming more acute. The study recommends that there is 
a need for at least 158 affordable dwellings to be provided in Rossendale per year in 
addition to market housing , and potentially that there is a need for up 321 affordable 
dwellings per year. There is a particular need to provide for the growing elderly 
population (inc luding bungalows or single level accommodation as well as specialist 
care facilities) as well as those with disabilities. There is an overall shortage of social 
rented housing in rural areas.  
 
138 Despite the high need for affordable housing in Rossendale,  the SHMA recognises 
that there is a need to balance  the delivery of affordable housing against viability of 
delivery.  The requirement in terms of tenure will be based on the housing need at 
the time of submission of the planning application. Further deta ils will be provided in 
a Supplementary Planning Document.  
 
Policy HS4: Housing Density  
Densities of at least 40 dwellings per hectare should  be provided within town and 
district centres.  
The density of the development should be in keeping with local areas and have no 
detrimental impact on the amenity, character, appearance, distinctiveness and 
environmental quality of an area.  
Explanation  
139 The Government’s Housing White Paper ‘Fixing our broken housing market’ (2017) 
encourages better use of land  for housing by encouraging higher densities where 
appropriate, such as in urban locations where there is high housing demand. This is  P a g e  | 63  repeated in the NPPF (within the “Making effective use of land” chapter 11 and 
especially paragraph 124 a) to e).  
 
140  Densities in excess of 40 dwellings per hectare will be expected to be delivered in 
town centres within Rossendale. Other sustainable locations where higher densities 
will be expected include sites within the urban boundary and within reasonable 
walking dis tance to bus stops on key corridors such as the X43 and 464 bus routes. 
Inclusive Mobility – Gov.uk propose that 400m walking distance to a bus stop as a 
suggested standard. High quality design can ensure that high density proposals are 
good quality scheme s.   
 
141 It is recognised that housing densities will be lower in other areas of the Borough 
because of physical constraints and on site issues, for example, topography, areas 
at risk of flooding and landscape.  
 
Policy HS5 : Housing Standards  
In accordance with the national regime of optional technical standards for housing, 
the Council will adopt the following local standards for new housing developments of 
five dwellings or more, in line with the National Planning Practice Guidance:  
at least 20%  of any new housing provided on a site should be specifically tailored to 
meet the needs of elderly or disabled residents, or be easily adaptable in line with 
the Optional Standards M4(2) of the Building Regulations . The Council will expect 
submitted infor mation to demonstrate how this has been achieved.  
 
Explanation  
142 The NPPF requires local authorities to provide a mix of housing based on current 
and future demographic trends to meet the needs of different groups in the 
community.   
 
143 Rossendale’s SHMA highlights a considerable growth in the number of elderly 
households in Rossendale with an expected rise of 52% over the period to 2035 and 
a need for the quality of stock to be improved to meet their needs. The SHMA also 
shows that there is a high pe rcentage of households containing one or more adults 
with some form of disability (19.8%) which is above the national rate of 17.6% , and 
found that households containing a disabled resident were more likely to consider 
that their home is unsuitable than th e Borough -wide average. The Housing Register 
contains a disproportionate amount of need among older residents and those with 
disabilities . There is therefore a need to increase the amount of suitable housing for 
elderly and disabled residents in Rossendale  and to ensure that new housing is 
easily adaptable to meet their needs. This should be set out in a Planning Statement, 
through annotated drawings or within detailed Design and Access Statements.   P a g e  | 64   
144 The Council has a duty under the Public Sector Equalit y provisions to ensure that the 
needs of individuals with protected characteristics, such as the elderly, are catered 
for as much as possible.  
 
145 These Access standards have been considered as part of the development of the 
Council’s evidence base and are not considered to undermine housing viability in 
Rossendale.  
 
Policy HS6:  Open Space Requirements in New Housing 
Developments  
Where there is an identified local deficiency in quantity of open space, on -site 
provision will be required . Where there is no identified local deficiency in quantity or it 
is demonstrated to be inappropriate due to site specific circumstances payment of a 
financial contribution towards off -site provision or improvements to existing open 
spaces will be required.   
The Council is committed to producing an update to the 2008 Open Space and Play 
Equipment Contributions Supplementary Planning Document  that will utilise the 
recommendations of the 2021 Open Space Report and establish a n updated 
mechanism for calculating site specific open space requirements (on and off -site 
including maintenance) and open space design principles.  This new SPD will be in 
place as soon as possible and will form the basis  for calculating site specific ope n 
space requirements thereafter.    
 
 
 Housing developments of 10 or more new dwellings (0.50 hectares or part thereof) 
will be required to make provision for open space, and should have regard to the 
most up to date evidence on the quantity, accessibility and quality of open space in 
the Borou gh, as identified in the  2021 Rossendale Open Space Report or its 
successors or more up to date robust evidence . 
The size of development should not be artificially reduced to decrease or eliminate 
the open space requirement, for example, by sub -dividing sites or reducing the 
density of all or part of a site. The Council will consider the site as a whole for the 
purposes of calculating the appropriate level of open space provision.  
Until such time as the document is replaced Site specific open space requirements 
will be calculated using the 2008 Open Space and Play Equipment Contributions 
SPD, index linked and secur ed through planning obligations.      P a g e  | 65  Explanation  
146 The NPPF recognises that access to high quality open spaces and opportunities for 
sport and recreation can make an important contribution to the health and well -being 
of communities.  
 
147 The Local Plan seeks to ensure that Rossendale’s residents have access to outdoor 
amenity space and recreation space. This is important for e ncouraging health and 
well-being. In meeting the requirements of Paragraph 98 of the NPPF, the Council 
commissioned the Rosse ndale Open Space Assessment Report (2021).   
148 In providing the most appropriate on site open space requirement and/or financial 
contribution tables 12.4.1 to 12.4.6 ‘Summary of Quantity, Quality and Accessibility’ 
of the Council’s Open Space Study 2021 will be referred to, in combination with 
relevant site specific policies to determine open space requirements.  
149 Provision should be on site unless it can be clearly demonstrated to be impractical due 
to site specific circumstances, for example it is to o small to accommodate usable open 
space, or the specific needs of the users can be more than adequately met within 
walking distance (200 m)  and enhancement to such nearby facilities can be provided 
via a financial contribution. Examples of identified def iciencies in open space where a 
financial contribution should be sought include areas where the site is too small for on -
site provision to be practical or appropriate.  
150 In some areas of the Borough the proximity of development to sensitive moorland 
habitats means that there can be recreational impacts on the flora and fauna.  
 
Policy HS7: Playing Pitch Requirements in New Housing 
Developments  
Housing developments of 10 or more new dwellings (0.50 hectares or part thereof) 
will be required to pay a financial contribution towards improvements to existing 
playing pitches and pr ovision of an all -weather pitch (identified in the 2016 Play Pitch 
Strategy or its successor) in the Borough where there is an identified local need or 
Borough wide importance.  
The size of development should not be artificially reduced to minimise or eliminate 
the contribution to the playing pitch requirement, for example, by sub -dividing sites or 
reducing the density of all or part of a site. The Council will consider the site a s a 
whole for the purposes of calculating the appropriate level of playing pitch/open 
space provision.  
 
 An accompanying Supplementary Planning Document will establish that, where 
there is a local need for playing pitches based on the Playing Pitch Strateg y, 
appropriate financial contributions will be sought from new residential developments.   P a g e  | 66  Explanation  
151 The Council’s Playing Pitch Strategy (2016) identifies a number of deficiencies in 
provision in Rossendale against  Sport England’s requirements. A 2021 Strategy is 
currently being prepared for the Council and will provide an update to the 2016 
document.  Once published its findings will be considered when seeking financial 
contributions for new, and enhancements to existing playing pitches througho ut the 
Borough. In particular is the need for residents to access all weather pitches.  
152 These deficiencies include a shortage of both football and rugby union pitch capacity 
at the current time and up to 2026. A significant contributor to the lack of c apacity is 
the condition of many pitches. This means that they are unable to accommodate 
more than a minimal amount of use. The Playing Pitch Assessment that underpins 
the Playing Pitch Strategy ranks the condition of pitches as Good, Standard and 
Poor acc ording to the number of games they can host per week. For grass football 
pitches 2 were ranked as good; 27 as standard and 20 as poor. Poor condition 
pitches include those at Haslingden Sports Centre and Maden Recreation Ground, 
Bacup. The main reason for pitches performing poorly was inadequate drainage. The 
Study recommends that investment in pitch quality and maintenance should be a 
priority.  
 
153 This policy recognises that there is an existing deficiency in provision that should be 
addressed through a variety of funding streams. Where usage by residents of new 
development contributes to the inadequacy of pitches or where additional provision 
is ne eded whether for formal or informal purposes, contributions will be expected.   
 
154 An accompanying Supplementary Planning Document will provide information on 
local standards and required financial contributions.  
 
Policy  HS8 : Private Outdoor amenity s pace  
All new residential development should provide adequate private outdoor amenity 
space. This should be in the form of gardens unless the applicant can demonstrate 
why this is not achievable and proposes a suitable alternative.  
 
In determining the appropriate size for outdoor amenity space for individual dwellings 
regard will be had to:   
 
 The size and type of dwelling(s) proposed; and  
 The character of the development and the garden sizes in the immediate 
neighbourhood . 
 
Amenity s pace for individual dwellings should be useable and have an adequate 
level of privacy. All boundary treatments should be appropriate to the character of 
the area.  
  P a g e  | 67  Explanation  
155 The NPPF identifies as one of its core planning principles, that planning sh ould 
“always seek to secure high quality design and a good standard of amenity for all 
existing and future occupants of land and buildings.”   Access to outdoor amenity 
space, particularly green space, is important for quality of life,  health,   biodiversity  
and to provide playspace for children and young people.  It is therefore important 
that all residential development, including all new homes, residential care homes and 
other residential institutions provide outdoor amenity space for residents.   
 
Policy  HS9: House Extensions  
Permission will be granted for the extension of dwellings provided that the following 
criteria are satisfied:  
 
a)  The extension respects the existing house and the surrounding buildings in terms 
of scale, size, design, fenestration  (including dormer windows)  and materials, without 
innovative and original design features being stifled;  
b)  There  is  no  unacceptable  adverse  effect  on  the  amenity  of  neighbouring  
properties  through overlooking, loss of privacy or reduction o f daylight;  
c)  The proposal does not have an unacceptable adverse impact on highway safety; 
and 
d)  In the case of the Green Belt or the Countryside, the proposed  
extension  should  not  result  in  a  disproportionate  increase  in  the  volume  of  
the  original  dwelling..  
 
Explanation  
 
156 The Government recognises the importance of being able to extend and alter homes 
to meet changing lifestyles, growing families and changing physical mobility. It has 
extended rights for homeowners to extend and alter homes without requiring formal 
planning permission, either through permitted development rights or the prior 
notification procedure.  
 
157 This policy applies where planning permission is required and seeks to allow 
homeowners the flexibility to alter  and extend their homes whilst protecting the living 
standards of neighbouring properties and the character of the local area.  
 
158 Further information on what is permitted in terms of house extensions in Rossendale 
is provided in the Council’s Supplement ary Planning Document on Alterations and 
Extensions to Residential Properties. The Government’s Planning Portal also 
provides useful guidance for homeowners looking to extend: 
(https://www.planningportal.co .uk/).  
  P a g e  | 68   
Policy  HS10 : Replacement Dwellings  
Permission  will  be  granted  for  the  replacement  of  dwellings  provided  that  the  
following  criteria  are satisfied:  
a)  The proposed replacement dwelling respects the surrounding buildings in terms 
of scale, size, design and facing materials, without innovative and original 
design features being stifled;  
b)  There  is  no  unacceptable  adverse  effect  on  the  amenity  of  neighbouring  
properties  through overlooking, loss of privacy or reduction of  daylight; and  
c)  Safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved.  
 
And in the case of  the Green Belt or countryside:  
d)  The proposed replacement dwelling would not detract from the openness to a   
greater extent than the original dwelling; and  
e)  The proposed replacement dwelling would not be materially larger than the 
dwelling it replaces nor involves enlarging the residential curtilage.   
 
Explanation  
159 Where replacement dwellings are provided, these need to respect the surrounding 
building s, have no unacceptable effects on the amenity of neighbouring properties 
and have safe and suitable access.  If the property is in the Green Belt or 
countryside, it should also not detract from the openness of the Green Belt / 
countryside and should not b e materially larger than the original dwelling. This is 
necessary to ensure that Rossendale’s natural assets of the attractive landscape 
and natural environment which surround the settlements are protected from 
overdevelopment.  Countryside includes areas of the Borough which are outside the 
urban boundaries .  Green Belt boundaries are shown on the Policies Map.  
 
 
Policy HS11: Rural Affordable Housing – Rural Exception Site s 
 
Explanation  
160 The Government has placed the provision of housing for rural communities high up 
its agenda and its Planning Practice Guidance on rural housing stres ses the 
importance of housing supply and affordability issues in rural areas. The SHMA 
highlights that there remains a strong demand for housing in rural areas within A  limited  number  of  dwellings  exclusively  to  meet  a  local  need  for  affordable  
hous ing  may  be  allowed adjoining  the built form of existing settlements providing 
all of the following criteria are met:  
a)  There is no suitable site available within the urban boundary;  
b)  The scale and nature of the development would be in character with the    
settlement;   P a g e  | 69  Rossendale and there is an overall shortage of social rented stock. To increase the 
suppl y of affordable housing in rural areas in Rossendale, the Council may allow a 
limited number of dwellings exclusively to meet a local need, providing the criteria 
above are met.  
 
 
Policy HS12:  Conversion and Re -Use of Rural Buildings in the 
Countryside  
Proposals for the conversion of an existing building in the coun tryside will be 
permitted where:  
 The proposal does not have a materially greater impact on the openness of 
the area and the proposal will not harm the character of the countryside;  
 The buildin g is of a permanent and substantial construction, structurally sound 
and capable of conversion without the need for more than 30% 
reconstruction;  
 The conversion works and facing materials to be introduced would be in 
keeping with the original building, and  important architectural and historical 
features would be retained. Particular attention will be given to curtilage 
formation, including appropriate boundary treatments and landscaping, which 
should  be  drawn  tightly  around  the  building  footprint  an d  the  
requirement  for  outbuildings,  which should be minimal;  
 The building and site has a satisfactory access to the highway network and 
the proposal would not have a severe impact on the local highway network;  
 Satisfactory off -street parking, bin stor age and bin collection points can be 
provided without adversely impacting on rural character and mains services 
are available for connection into the scheme;  
 The development does not require the removal of, or damage to, significant or 
prominent trees, hed ges, watercourses, ponds or any other natural landscape 
features;  
 The development would not have an unacceptable impact on nature 
conservation interests or any protected species present;  
 Drainage and sewerage requirements are met to the satisfaction of the  
relevant agencies;  
 If  an  agricultural  building,  it  is  not  one  substantially  completed  within  
ten  years  of  the  date  of  the application;  
 The proposal would not harm the agricultural or other enterprise occupying 
the land or buildings in th e vicinity; and  
 The re -use of the building must not be likely to result in additional farm 
buildings which would have a harmful effect on the openness of the area.  
 
  P a g e  | 70  Explanation  
161 The Government has made it easier to change agricultural buildings to other uses 
without planning permission th rough the prior approval process, subject to meeting 
certain criteria. This policy applies when planning permission is required and it seeks 
to increase the supply of housing in rural areas and diversify the rural e conomy , 
whilst ensuring that works do not result in a substantial rebuild of structures and 
ensure that conversions which involve external alterations and / or other associated 
development e.g. hardstanding, boundary treatment etc. which are sympathetic to  
the character of the building and the rural setting of the building.  Further information 
is available in the Council’s Supplementary Planning Document on Converting and 
Re-using Buildings in the Countryside.  
 
 
Policy HS 13 : Rural Workers Dwellings  
Proposals for permanent residential accommodation, outside of the urban boundary 
in well -established agricultural enterprises, where it is required to enable agriculture, 
horticulture, forestry (or other rural based enterprise) for workers to live at, or i n the 
immediate vicinity of, their place of work will be supported where it can be 
demonstrated that  (a):  
i. There is a clearly established functional need;  
ii. The functional need relates to a full time worker or one primarily employed in 
agriculture, forestry  or rural based enterprise activities;  
iii. The unit and the agricultural or forestry activity concerned have been 
established for at least three years,  have been profitable for at least one of 
them, are currently financially sound,  and have a clear prospect  of remaining 
so;  
iv. The  functional  need  could  not  be  fulfilled  by  another  dwelling  on  the  unit  
or  any  other  existing accommodation in the area which is suitable and 
available;   
v. The dwelling achieves a high standard of design and its siting is well related to 
the existing farm buildings or its impact on the landscape could be minimised; 
and  
vi. The dwelling is of a size and scale commensurate with the established 
functional requirement of the rural enterprise. Dwellings that are unduly large in 
relation to the needs of the rural enterprise will not be permitted.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 71   
If a new dwelling is essential to support a new farming or forestry activity on an 
established unit or on a new agricultural unit, an application should be made for 
temporary accommodation. The application should satisfy all the following criteria  (b):  
 
i. There is clear evidence of a firm intention and ability to develop the new 
enterprise concerned;  
ii. a functional need relating to the enterprise;  
iii. There is clear evidence that the new activity has been planned on a sound 
financial basis;  
iv. the  functional  need  could  not  be  fulfilled  by  another  existing  dwelling  on  
the  unit  or  any  other : 
v. existing  accommodation  in  the  area  which  is  suitable  for  and  available   
for  occupation  by  the workers concerned;  
vi. the proposal would not give rise to significant environmental damage, 
particularly in relation to its impact on the landscape;  
vii. satisfactory vehicular access and parking can be achieved within the site; and  
satisfactory infrastructure including drainage facilities are available.  
 
Where existing dwellings are subject to conditions restricting occupancy, applications 
to remove such conditions  will  not  be  permitted  unless  the  applicant  can  
demonstrate  that   there  is  no  longer  any realistic agricultural or forestry need both 
from the enterprise and the locality for the restriction to be maintained by meeting all 
the following criteria  (c):  
 
i. the  essential  need  which  originally  required  the  dwelling  to  be  permitted  
no  longer  applies  in relation to the farm unit and that the dwelling will not be 
required similarly in the longer term;  
ii. the  property  has  been  actively  marketed  in  specialist  and  local  press  and  
estate  agents  at   least once a month for a minimum of 12 months;  
iii. the advertised selling price is realistic given the age, size,  condition and location 
of the property; and  
iv. following marketing that meets criteria c) ii) and iii) above, no realistic offers 
have been made t o the  vendors  from people  eligible  to  occupy  the  dwelling  
meeting  the  terms  of  the  planning condition concerned.  
 
Explanation  
162 The NPPF states that new isolated homes in the countryside should be avoided 
unless there are special circumstances, such as the essential need for a rural worker 
to live permanently at or near their place of work in the countryside. This policy sets 
out what crite ria need to be met to provide rural housing for both permanent and 
temporary workers.  This information will need to be provided by a suitably qualified 
person.   P a g e  | 72   
Strategic Policy HS14: Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling 
Showpeople  
The accommodation need for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople 
over the Plan period is of up to four permanent pitches.  
 
Two of the pitches will be provided via intensification on existing sites (at 
Tong Lane, Bacup and/ or Cobland View, Stacksteads) and any potential  need 
for other pitches will be dealt with as windfall development against the 
following criteria:  
 Access to the road network;  
 Access to schools and services;  
 Availability of water and infrastructure services;  
 Proximity to existing development and the sett led community, 
particularly with respect to noise and light; and  
 Adequacy of landscaping and boundary treatments.  
 
The Council’s Gypsy and Traveller Area Assessment (2016) identifies that 
there is a need for four transit pitches in the borough. In order to  make 
provision for these needs the Council will seek to implement a Negotiated 
Stopping policy, as part of which the Council will need to identify suitable 
stopping sites. Such sites should be:  
 on readily available land;  
 close to existing infrastructure a nd services;  
 able to provide appropriate living conditions for occupants in terms of 
noise, light and privacy.  
 
To manage the sites the following must be agreed upon before occupation of 
any suitable stopping site:  
 The length of use of the site (no more t han 28 days);  
 Any necessary refuse and sanitary facilities to be provided;  
 Site hygiene requirements.  
 
Explanation  
163 The Council’s Gypsy and Traveller Area Assessment (2016) (GTAA) showed that 
there is a demand for up to four additional pitches within the Borough. Two of these 
pitches will be provided via intensification at existing sites. The other two via windfall 
sites later in the plan period dependent upon whether the demand arises. The 
windfall approach for two of these pitches is appropriate as i t is not entirely clear 
whether the two pitches later in the Plan period will definitely be needed.   P a g e  | 73   
164 The GTAA also recommended that provision for four transit pitches is made within 
the Borough. As no suitable transit sites have been identified in the Plan, the Council 
is seeking to meet this need via the implementation of a Negotiated Stopping Policy. 
This would allow Gypsies and Travellers transiting the area to places such as 
Appleby Horse Fair to legally stop over for a temporary period of time in a  suitable 
location, subject to a Negotiated Stopping agreement. Basic facilities such as toilets, 
water and waste bins would be provided, in exchange for keeping the site tidy and 
respecting neighbours of the site. It is anticipated that this would help to  reduce 
illegal encampments.  
 
165 Being able to come to a Negotiated Stopping agreement would benefit the Local 
Authority by reducing the amount of resources spent on moving Travellers on, and 
the Travelling groups by decreasing the number of evictions th ey experience. No 
requirement has been identified at the present time for a site to meet the needs of 
Travelling Showpeople.        
 
166 No requirement has been identified at the present time for a site to meet the needs 
of Travelling Showpeople.    
 
Policy  HS15 : Specialist Housing  
Development proposals for specialist forms of housing, including retirement 
accommodation, extra care accommodation and supported accommodation services, 
will be supported provided that:  
 
 The development is well located so t hat shops, public transport, community 
facilities and other infrastructure and services are accessible for those without 
a car, as appropriate to the needs and level of mobility of potential residents, 
as well as visitors and staff;  
 The development contain s appropriate external amenity space of an 
acceptable quantity and quality;   
 Adequate provision is made for refuse storage and disposal facilities;   
 It would not have an unacceptable impact on the character of the area or the 
amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring properties ; and 
 The design and layout of the accommodation and its relation to its broader 
context fully meets the requirements of the residents of the specific type of 
accommodation proposed.  
 
The following  site is allocated on the Policies Map specificall y for specialist 
accommodation:  
 H19 - Former Bacup Health Centre  
 H48 – Waterfoot Primary School  
 H61 – Land behind Buxton Street, Whitworth   P a g e  | 74  Explanation  
 
167 There is an identified need for specialist supported housing in the Borough, includin g 
a strong demand for housing for older people and there are higher than average levels 
of residents with mental health needs.  
 
168 In relation to supported housing for older people, the SHMA indicates that the number 
of residents aged over 65 in Rossenda le is projected to increase by 6,336 (52.9%) by 
2034, in contrast to the overall growth in population of just 5,915 residents (8.6%). 
Given the substantial increase in the number of residents aged over 65 combined with 
the current insufficient supply of sp ecialist housing for older people in the Borough, 
there is a need for more good quality accommodation designed specifically for the 
growing elderly population. It is recognised that the number of sites proposed above 
will not fully meet the projected expan sion of the elderly population and of those with 
other specialist needs. The Council will therefore welcome applications that meet the 
requirements set out in this policy and  will work proactively with care providers to 
deliver schemes, especially where these meet the needs of those in deprived areas.  
 
169 The Council will work with infrastructure providers to ensure that any issues on 
allocated sites are fully addressed.  
 
Policy  HS16 : Self Build and Custom Built Houses  
The Council will support individuals who wish to commission or build their own dwelling 
by identifying suitable serviced plots of land. To ensure a variety of housing provision  
developers of schemes comprising of 50 dwellings or over  will be encouraged, where 
possible, to make at least 10% of plots available for sale to small builders or individuals 
or groups who wish to custom build their own homes.  This will be subject to the 
Council’s self -build register and si te viability.  
 
The following housing sites allocated under Policy HS2 are identified specifically for 
self-build and custom build housing:  
 
 H5 - Land south of 1293 Burnley Road, Loveclough  - 5 units  
 H56 - Hareholme  - 9 units  
 H53 - Lea Bank - 9 units  
 
 
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 75  Explanation  
 
170 The Government is committed to increasing the supply of self-build  and custom build 
homes and wants to make this form of housing a mainstream housing option. 
Evidence from the SHMA indicates that the level of demand for plots is currently low 
in Rossendale however this policy seeks to support individuals who would like t o 
build or commission their own home by making plots available for them . The Council 
maintains a self -build and custom build housing register  and, as of  31st March 2021, 
there are 33 individuals registered and no Associations on the Self -build Register . In 
order to meet this demand a number of Council owned sites have been made 
available. However, in order to supplement this, the Council  will also encourage 
developers to make plots available for these purposes.  
   P a g e  | 76  Chapter 2: Employment Growth and Employmen t 
 
Strategic Policy EMP1: Provision for Employment  
The Council, together with developers and other partners, will seek to provide 
sufficient employment land to meet the Borough’s gross requirement of 27 
hectares for business, general industrial or storage  and distribution (Use 
Classes E(g), B2 and B8) for the Plan period of 2019 - 2036.  
 
 
Explanation  
171 Employment levels have declined in Rossendale since 1997 with the loss of 
manufacturing jobs; however there are still high levels of industrial activity, including 
that which is generated from the Borough’s heritage of shoe and textiles 
manufacturing and distribution. The Council’s Employment Land Review (ELR) 
(2017) identifies an overall lack of good quality small to medium -sized industrial 
premises for industrial and manufacturing (B2 and B8), which is suppressing 
demand. The need for industrial premises is greatest i n the west of the Borough 
where there is ready access to the A56 and M66.  
 
172 In terms of office uses, activity is generally focused to the west of the Borough 
around Rawtenstall and Haslingden. Whilst there is a current oversupply in the short 
term, the ELR evidences a need for new office accommodation (E(g)(i) ) in the longer 
term to meet the forecast growth in the service sector, and suggests that this could 
be located in Rawtenstall.  
 
173 The wage levels of Rossendale residents who also work in the Bo rough are lower 
than the national and regional average and the Borough’s supply of employment 
space is limited with constraints based on topography and flood risk.  Out -commuting 
into neighbouring authorities for work remains a major issue for Rossendale, with a 
net loss of around 8,560 employed residents daily. There are high levels of out -
commuting to Rochdale, Bury and Burnley as well as Manchester City Centre. Wage 
levels of residents working outside the Borough are significantly greater than those 
living and working within Rossendale . Providing suitable employment land within 
Rossendale to increase the number and quality of jobs in the Borough will assist in 
reversing this trend and ‘claw -back’ out -commuters, reducing net out -commuting 
rates. It is also  important that the Borough cooperates with neighbouring authorities 
to ensure that the needs of businesses and commuting residents are being 
effectively met.  
  P a g e  | 77  174 The Employment Land Review (ELR)  study from 2017  considered a number of 
scenarios in order to identify the Borough’s Objectively Assessed Need for 
Employment, ranging from 22 ha to 32 ha over the period 2014 to 2034. The lower 
figure is based on past delivery of employment land, which has been low and i t could 
be considered that this under supply has been constraining Rossendale’s economic 
growth.  Hence the Council is proposing a mid -way  employment land gross 
requirement of 27 ha, which aligns with  Housing Need (based on a labour supply of 
220 dwellin gs per annum ) (dpa) and takes into account an allowance for the 
replacement of losses (of 26.9ha) and factors in a flexibility margin of two years take -
up of 1.99ha).  
 
175 In 2019, an update to the scenarios for the period 2019 to 2034 was undertaken 
using  data from the 2019 SHMA. This re -modelling reduces the range of 22 -32 ha 
between 2014 -2034 to a range of 14 -25 ha over the period 2019 -2034. A further 
Update was undertaken in April 2021 to take account of the longer plan period (2019 
to 2036) and the upd ated Local Housing Need figures which were published in 
March 2021, and demonstrated a lower housing requirement (of 185 dpa).  Taking 
these factors into account, the employment land modelling shows that the range for 
the Objectively Assessed Need (OAN) is  from 14 ha to 19 ha for the period 2019 to 
2036.  This is lower than the range identified in the previous Update (17 -25 ha).  This 
is because of the reduction in the average employment loss replacement and past 
take-up rates, despite the plan period havin g been extended However, the Council 
considers that it is appropriate to retain the employment land requirement of 27 ha to 
take account of previous under provision of employment land in the past few years 
(0.33ha of employment land built between 2015 -19 against the ELR  requirement of 
1.35 ha per year or 6.75 ha over the five years). Qualitative evidence identifies a 
shortage of good quality larger premises, particularly in the west around the 
Rossendale Valley Growth Corridor. The employment land requireme nt of 27ha will 
provide choice for businesses as well as offering flexibility in the supply of sites.  
 
176 Of the existing employment sites that are to be retained, the study notes that much 
of this committed supply is of poor quality, nor located where ma rket demand is 
greatest. Hence there is a qualitative as well as a quantitative need to identify new 
land for employment.   
 
177 The plan sets a requirement for 27ha of employment land for business, general 
industrial and storage or distribution (Use Class es E(g), B2 and B8) within 
Rossendale over the plan period (2019  – 2036).   This figure is intended to meet 
Rossendale’s employment space needs in full so that its economy is not constrained 
whilst recognising that developments in adjoining areas will remain a key influence.  
178 As well as protecting existing employmen t sites (as recommended in the review of 
employment sites) there is the need to allocate new land and the Council is 
proposing to make available additional land for employment purposes . As shown in  P a g e  | 78  the table below the Council has identified an employment s upply of 31 ha, which is 
greater than the requirement of 27 ha. The supply of employment land identified in 
the Local Plan comprises five sites that will bring forward up to 23ha of new 
employment land.  There are also three mixed use sites that have been identified for 
a range of potential uses, including E(g), B2 and B8, which will bring forward up to 
1.94 ha of new employment land.  Additionally some of the sites currently in existing 
employment use, and which are to be protected for employment uses, have  spare 
capacity that can come forward and would generate an extra 2.57 ha of employment 
land supply.  The remaining supply is made up of employment site completions in 
2019/20 (1.07 ha) and sites for employment with planning permission that are still 
outst anding (2.57 ha).  
 
Policy EMP2: Employment /mixed -use allocations  and existing 
employment sites  
The following sites shown on the Policies Map are allocated and protected for 
business, general industrial or storage and distribution (Use Classes E(g), B2 or B8 
respectively) in the period 2019 -2036. Additional uses will be permitted on mixed -
use site allocations.

Explanation  
179  The table above identifies sites where new employment land may come forward.  
This includes the five new employment sites (NE1 -NE5), as well as sites identified 
for mixed use purposes, including E (g),B2 and  B8, identified as M1, M2 and M3 .  
Another source of employment land supply is spare capacity on existing employment 
sites.    P a g e  | 83  180 An Employment Land Review  was undertaken in  2017, the assessment included a 
review of the characteristics and quality of committed employm ent land supply in the 
Borough.  Overall assessments of existing sites indicated that the Borough has a 
range of employment sites of varying quality and type, wit h the majority dominated 
by ind ustrial or warehousing uses. Some of the supply was deemed to be of poor 
quality, in need of regeneration, with a gap in the market for small industrial units and 
evidence indicating a need for new sites in the west of the Bo rough where there is 
good access to the A56 and M66.  Recommendations were however  made to retain a 
number of sites for employment use in light of their roles and characteristics 
including; well established industrial areas with low vacancy rates and exc ellent 
public transport links.  Sites that continue to be protected for employment use are 
included at Table 8.  
 
181 The sites identified above will increase the current choice of sites and provide the 
Borough with  new development opportunities.  Focus has been  placed upon 
identifying new sites in areas of strongest market demand, in the west of the 
Borough, to provide further industrial and warehousing allocations to meet need.  
The Futures Park allocation seeks to meet employment needs in the east of the 
Borou gh. Regarding the provision of new offices, schemes should also align with 
Policy R1. The retention of existing sites helps to ensure that the needs of a wide 
range of employers are met, and will provide employment opportunities in all parts of 
the Borough , including those where there are high levels of deprivation and the 
ability to travel for work is limited.   
  
182 Existing employment sites have been assessed and protected accordingly where 
appropriate. The Council will encourage and support the upgradi ng, refurbishment 
and redevelopment of existing employment areas so that they can be used more 
efficiently and remain attractive and viable to the market.  All developers will be 
expected to ensure that relevant infrastructure requirements, including utili ty 
provision and road access are taken into account when upgrading, refurbishi ng and 
redeveloping their sites . A small number of these protected existing employment 
sites have spare capacity for additional employment uses as shown in the table 
above.  
 
183 The site allocations identified in Table 8 will retain and provide new employment 
opportunities in the Borough for businesses, general industrial or storage and 
distribution (Use Classes E(g), B2 and B8 respectively). Additional uses will also be 
permitted  on mixed -use site allocations.  
 
184 Following recommendations in the ELR, several employment site allocations  and 
sites have not been carried forward from the previous plan primarily due to poor 
demand or where sites are considered to be better suited for other development , 
including residential .  This is in line with t he NPPF , which  seeks to avoid the long 
term protection  of sites allocated for employment use where there is no reasonable 
prospect of a site being used for that purpose.   P a g e  | 84  Site Specific Policies  
185 A number of employment sites have site specific policies to guide their development, 
as listed in Table 8 above.  These are sites NE1, NE2, NE3, NE4, NE5 and Mixed 
Use Sites M1 and M3.  
 
Policy NE1: Extension to Mayfield Chicks, Ewood Bridge  
Within the area designated on the Policies Map at the extension to Mayfield Chicks, 
Ewood Bridge (NE1) new high quality development comprising E(g) Business, B2 
(General Industrial) and B8 (Storage or Distribution) will be permitted subject to the 
following:  
(a) the net developable area will comprise no more than 1.57 ha and 
development must exclude the land on the northern  boundary which is identified as 
grassland stepping stone habitat on the Lancashire Grassland Ecological Network 
Map.  
(b) an ecological assessment of the entire allocation will be required and all 
adverse impacts on the grassland habitat will need to be fu lly mitigated against.  Any 
measures to address the loss of biodiversity that cannot be incorporated within the 
area of development (i.e. the developable area) will need to be addressed by 
improvements to the grassland stepping stone habitat;  
c) vehicular access will be through the existing industrial site and improvements 
to the junction and widening of the access road will be required;  
d) a site specific -flood risk assessment is undertaken;  
e) details relating to layout, massing and landscaping, will be r equired to show 
how the proposed development will respect views from the Irwell Sculpture Trail and 
the East Lancashire Railway line.  This should include native -species tree and 
hedgerow planting to delineate the new Green Belt boundary.  
f) Measures will be required to compensate for the loss of the Green Belt with 
proportionate contributions being made to all or some of the following identified 
projects:  
 Rossendale Forest;  
 The New Hall Hey Gateway;  
 Improvement works to footpaths in the vicinity – namely F P 14-4-FP309 and 
14-4-RB303 to ensure the site links with other parts of the Borough;  
 Improved biodiversity measures on the grassland stepping stone habitat.  
  P a g e  | 85   
Explanation  
186 This allocation relates to an extension to an existing employment site in order for the 
business already located there to expand and use the additional land for storage and 
distribution.  
187 Exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated to allow the re lease of 
additional land from Green Belt for employment purposes.  In accordance with the 
National Planning Policy Framework compensatory measures to improve the 
remaining Green Belt land, as set out above, must be agreed before any planning 
consent can be  issued. Further details of Green Belt compensation measures are 
included in Policy SD4.  
188 This is a sensitive location for landscaping, bounded by the Irwell Sculpture Trail, the 
River Irwell, the line of the East Lancashire Railway and adjoining the Gr een Belt. As 
such a high quality design will be expected that takes account of the wider site 
context, including measures relating to building materials, massing, layout and 
landscaping, and especially boundary treatments.  
189 Part of the site falls within  Flood Zone 3.  The Council’s Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment recommends that development proposals for employment uses should 
be subject to a site specific flood assessment.  
190 The land in the north of the allocation has ecological value as a stepping st one 
habitat.  As such there should be no adverse impacts on this habitat as a result of 
the development, and mitigation measures will be required and advantage taken to 
ensure that the grassland is improved and retained as a wildlife corridor.  
   P a g e  | 86   
Policy NE2: Land north of Hud Hey, Acre  
Within the area designated on the Policies Map at the Land north of Hud Hey, Acre, 
(NE2) new high quality development comprising E(g) (Business Uses) B2 (General 
Industrial) and B8 (Storage or Distribution) will be permitte d subject to the following:  
a) the net developable area will comprise no more than 2.03 ha  
b) development should avoid the northern and eastern boundaries of the 
allocation and these areas should be planted with native -species trees in order 
to create a buffer a nd provide a new Green Belt boundary.   
c) any existing woodland within the site, particularly along the A56, A680 and 
between the new development and existing housing should be retained, 
maintained and enhanced. Opportunities for additional tree planting and  habitat 
creation should also be explored, whilst not completely blocking views through 
the site;  
d) a new priority junction and access from Hud Hey Rd is to be provided.  This will 
need to be based on the findings of a detailed geotechnical feasibility study  of 
land stability and a full ground investigation survey, and be subject to a 
Transport Assessment, including Road Safety Audit,  
e) a drainage study and drainage mitigation to ensure no drainage runoff onto the 
A56. A sustainable drainage system shall be use d as part of the green 
infrastructure through the site, subject to land stability;  
f) measures will be required to compensate for the loss of the Green Belt with 
proportionate contributions being made to all or some of the following identified 
projects:  
 Creat ion of footpath links to adjacent Worsley Park and Improvement work 
to footpaths in the vicinity which improve access to or are within the Green 
Belt; 
 Improvements to National Cycle Route 6 to enhance the link between 
Haslingden and Rising Bridge;  
 Improved  biodiversity measures at Worsley Park, woodland to the north and 
east of the park and to the south of Clough End Road, and any other 
appropriate areas in the surrounding Green Belt.  
 Rossendale Forest  
 New Hall Hey Gateway  
 
Explanation  
191 This allocation relates to a site in Acre, between Rising Bridge and Haslingden, 
which borders the existing employment site, EE12, to the south, and housing to the 
north. Sensitive landscaping will be needed to ensure the boundary to the new 
Green Belt is reinforced with measures such as local stone walls and additional 
native species planting. Tree Preservation Orders protect some of the existing 
woodland.   P a g e  | 87  192 National Highways  is responsible for the A56 and requires extensive studies be 
undertaken to show that, not only is the land stable, but that the proximity of the 
access to their bridge structure (the A56 over -bridge abutments and highway verge) 
will cause no unnecessary risks.  As well as geotechnical studies, drainage details 
are also required.  
193 Exceptional circ umstances have been demonstrated to allow the release of the land 
from the Green Belt for employment purposes.  In accordance with the National 
Planning Policy Framework, compensatory measures to improve the remaining 
Green Belt land, as set out above, mus t be agreed before any planning consent can 
be issued. This includes any footpath links created to Worsley Park, the existing 
Public Rights of Way on the other side of King’s Highway and any surrounding 
Green Belt areas.  
 Improvements to NCR6 to enhance th e link between Haslingden and Rising 
Bridge;  
 Improved biodiversity measures at Worsley Park, woodland to the north and 
east of the park and to the south of Clough End Road, and any other 
appropriate areas in the surrounding Green Belt.  
   P a g e  | 88   
Policy NE3: Carrs Industrial Estate North Extension, Haslingden  
Within the area designated on the Policies Map as the northern extension to Carrs 
Industrial Estate, Haslingden (NE3) new high quality development comprising E(g) 
(Business), B2 (General Industrial) and B 8 (Storage or Distribution) will be permitted 
subject to the following:  
a) the net developable area will comprise no more than 4.26 ha  
b)  access is to be delivered via Commerce Street with a site -specific ground 
investigation required to address potential  geotechnical and geo -environmental 
risks;  
c)     a drainage study and drainage mitigation to ensure no drainage runoff onto the 
A56. A sustainable drainage system shall be used as part of the green 
infrastructure through the site, subject to land stabilit y 
d)  buildings should subservient to  Britannia Mill and units should be designed so 
as to be sympathetic to the local area and the setting of nearby Listed Buildings 
and other heritage assets;  
e)  key views will need to be retained to Britannia Mill and the Church of St James;  
f)  native species tree planting is to be provided along the A56 and further 
landscape treatment is expected adjacent to the Public Right of Way along the 
western boundary.  
Explanation  
194 This allocation will extend the popular employment area known as Carrs Industrial 
Estate, along the A56.  
195 Access to the site will need the full agreement of National Highways  given its 
proximity to the A56, a trunk road.  As well as transport issues developing this site 
will require detailed investigation of the geology and an assessment of how this will 
affect future development.  National Highways’  approval will also be requ ired to 
ensure no adverse effects on the A56 in the future.  
196 Any development at this location will need to consider impacts on  the setting of 
heritage assets in the vicinity of the site (namely Britannia Mill and the Church of St 
James), and as such any  development on the site must be sympathetic to this. The 
scheme will need to be designed in such a way that the height of the new buildings 
do not compete with Britannia Mill or harm its setting.  The southern part of the site 
will need to be treated part icularly sensitively to protect and retain views of these 
heritage assets.   P a g e  | 89   
Policy NE4: New Hall He y 
Within the area defined on the Policies Map at New Hall Hey (NE4) new high quality 
development will be permitted for employment uses comprising E(g)  (Business), B2 
(General Industrial) and B8 (Storage or Distribution).subject to the following:  
 
(a) a net developable area comprising of no more than 3ha  
 
(b) The implementation of development to be in accordance with an agreed design 
code, prepared in con sultation with key stakeholders including statutory undertakers. 
The Design Code shall include the design principles for the whole of the site and will 
incorporate, amongst other elements:  
a.  A greenspace and landscape strategy reflecting both its status as a “gateway” to 
the Borough as part of the New Hall Hey Gateway and ecological value;  
b. A movement framework supported by a det ailed Travel Plan and Transport 
Assessment, whic h  also identifies the access point(s);  
c. Existing overhead and underground i nfrastructure;  
d. Layout considerations to accommodate long views east -west across the site;  
e. Parking and garaging;  
f. Appropriate building and hard surfacing materials;  
g. Measures to mitigate and enhance the impa ct on the setting of the listed 
Hardman’s Mill;  
h. Maximising energy efficiency in design;  
i. Details of appropriate boundary treatments;  
j. Lighting;  
k. Details of the laying of services, drainage and cables;  
l. Bin storage and rubbish collection;  
m. Ecology and nature conservation;  
n. The relationship with the adjacent Irwell Sculpture Trail;  
o. The relationship with the River Irwell.  
 
(c) A phasing and infrastructure delivery schedule for the area.  The schedule shall 
include, amongst other elements:  
a. Highway hierarchy;  
b. Bridge over  the River Irwell;  
c. Foul and surface water drainage including flood risk mitigation;  
d. Surface water drainage strategy including details of Sustainable Drainage;  
e. Nature conservation and enhancement works;  
f. Provision of footpath and cycle links  
g. Tree works and tree protection measures.  
 
(d) An agreed programme of implementation in accordance with the masterplan.   P a g e  | 90   
(e)  Suitable Green Belt compensation measures will be required in accordance with 
Policy SD4.  In particular these will contribute towards the New Hall Hey Gateway 
which seeks to enhance pedestrian and cycle links, as well as improvements to the 
blue and green infrastructure within the vicinity, and to other projects set out in Policy 
SD4.  
Explanation   
197  In light of the two distinct areas of the site, the site’s natural features and relationship 
to surrounding uses, development is likely to come forward in a number of distinct 
phases. The infrastructure associated with the overall development and each 
individual phase will be  subject to production of a phasing and infrastructure delivery 
schedule to be contained in the Masterplan. Site access will be a key consideration 
as to which will be the most suitable option.  Site A, north of the River Irwell, could be 
accessed via the roundabout at New Hall Hey Rd/Ashworth Way.  An option for 
access to Site B, which is south of the River Irwell, is being investigated via Holme 
Lane and the United Utilities/Electricity North West land, which would not then 
require a new bridge over the R iver Irwell. The access solution will determine 
phasing.  Should a bridge be required site A will be brought forward first  
198 Development proposals will be subject to a Scoping Study, a Transport Assessment 
and Travel Plan. This must be agreed with Lancas hire County Council and National 
Highways . Appropriate measures must be put in place to address any impacts the 
development may have on the strategic and local road networks. A Travel Plan will 
seek to ensure that the development promotes the use of public  transport, walking 
and cycling and links effectively with existing infrastructure such as the Irwell 
Sculpture Trail. Contributions towards these will be needed as Green Belt 
Compensation Measures. The Council is committe d to the New Hall Hey Gateway.  
199 Exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated for Site A to be released from 
the Green Belt.  Contributions will be required towards schemes which will 
compensate for the loss of this Green Belt. Particular relevant projects include the 
New Hall Hey Ga teway as well as improvements to Public Rights of Way for 
accessing the Green Belt on foot and by cycle, and the Rossendale Forest

Policy NE5:  Extension to Baxenden Chemicals site, Rising Bridge 
Within the area designated on the Policies Map at Baxenden Chemicals Ltd., Rising 
Bridge (NE5) new high quality development comprising E (g) Business B2 (General 
Industrial) and B8 (Storage or Distribution) will be permitted subject to the following:  
a) the net developable area will comprise no more than 4.4 0ha; 
 
b) ecological surveys for the ponds and Woodnook Water are undertaken to 
ensure water quality and biodiversity are retained;  
 
c) subject to the findings of the ecological assessment and Tree Impact Plan and 
Tree Constraints Plan, which will be agreed prior  to development taking place 
on site, any existing trees within the site will be retained where possible and 
opportunities identified for additional planting of native species trees to link with 
the adjoining woodland;  
 
d) access to the site is to be provided  via the existing private road from Rising 
Bridge Road. Any increase in traffic generation would need to consider the 
possibility of a localised widening scheme along Rising Bridge Road, as well as 
some form of junction control required to deal with increa sed traffic generation 
near the local primary school;  
 
e) a site specific Flood Risk Assessment is undertaken, ensuring any adverse 
impacts are mitigated and a drainage study with drainage mitigation to ensure 
no drainage runoff. A sustainable  drainage syste m shall be used as part of the 
green infrastructure through the site;  
 
f) any existing woodland within the site should be retained, maintained and 
enhanced. Opportunities for additional tree planting and habitat creation should 
also be explored, whilst not co mpletely blocking views through the site.  
 
Explanation  
200 This allocation relates to an easterly extension of the Baxenden Chemicals site 
(EE28) in Rising Bridge, west of Rising Bridge Road and south of Blackburn Road. 
This site was allocated for employment in the Rossendale District Local Plan, 
adopted in 1995, but no development has taken place to date on this land.  
Discussions have been held with the current owners, Lanxess Urethanes UK Ltd, 
who wish the land to remain as an employment allocati on to enable the company to 
invest in modernising and improving the processes and infrastructure within the site.   P a g e  | 92  This would facilitate the relocation of the existing warehousing and/or workshops, 
which are currently located centrally in the existing site,  to enable the warehousing to 
be more efficient and allow the expansion of the manufacturing plant into the area 
vacated by the warehouse and workshops.  
201 The boundary of NE5 is slightly larger than the previous allocation, with a slither of 
land that wa s previously designated as countryside being brought within the Urban 
Boundary and added to the previous allocation site boundary. This is to enable the 
access road to be widened if necessary.  Any trees affected will need to be replaced 
in accordance with  Policy ENV10. 
202 Sensitive landscaping will be needed to ensure the boundary to the Green Belt is 
reinforced with appropriate landscape buffering and measures such as local stone 
walls and additional native species planting.  
 
Policy M1: Waterside Mill,  Bacup  
Within the area designated on the Policies Map at Waterside Mill, Bacup (M1) new 
high quality development comprising E(g) (Offices, Research & Development or Light 
Industrial), B2 (General Industrial), B8 (Storage or Distribution) and C3 (Residential) 
will be permitted subject to the following:  
(a)  the net developable area will comprise no more than 0.09 ha with conversion 
for up to 39 apartments.  
(b)    the significance of the heritage asset, its setting and the character and 
appearance of the Bacup Town Centre Conservation Area will be sustained 
and enhanced by the development;  
(c)  subject to the findings of the Heritage Impact Assessment, the building and 
structures on the site will be retained and converted  
(d)  a full structural sur vey is conducted to inform the retention of the heritage asset 
and its reuse;  
(e)       the recording of the building prior to the carrying out of any approved 
intervention as part of the planning application for the site;  
(f)  a high quality design that r esponds to the site’s industrial heritage including the 
need for any new buildings to respond positively to local character and 
distinctiveness in terms of layout, design and materials;  
(g)      any additional or replacement buildings should be of high qua lity design, and in 
keeping with the former mill building in terms of materials and design, and 
enhance the Conservation Area  
(h)  adequate parking provision is to be provided.   P a g e  | 93   
Policy M3 : Futures Park  
Within the area defined on the Policies Map at Futures Park (M3 ) new high quality 
development will be permitted subject to the following:   
a) Comprehensive development of the site is demonstrated through a 
masterplan;  
b) Environmental constraints are reflected in the design;  
c) A phasing and infrastru cture delivery schedule for the area including access 
improvements for vehicular traffic as well as pedestrians and cyclists ; and  
d) An agreed programme of implementation in accordance with the masterplan.  
 
The following uses are considered to be acceptable:  
i.  Employment uses comprising E(g) (Business), B2 (General Industrial) and B8 
(Storage or Distribution);  
ii.  Hotel (Use Class C1), Restaurants and cafes (Use Class E(b)) and drinking 
establishments (Use Class Sui Generis);  
iii.  Leisure use s and  (inclu  ding Use Class F2);  
iv.  Display/ retail of goods(Use Class E(a));  
v.  Pedestrian and cycle route – “Valley of Stone” Greenway and link to Lee 
Quarry;  
 
Explanation  
203 Land at Futures Park, Bacup, has been identified as having the potential  to 
accommodate a flexible mixed use scheme, subject to national policy in the NPPF 
and other relevant policies of this Local Plan. In addition to the 1.85 ha identified in 
EMP2 for E(g), B2 and B8 traditional employment uses the other plots of land are 
expected to contribute to the wider aspirations of the Council, including leisure 
facilities as part of the Council’s Outdoor Rossendale initiative to provide a 
visitor/cycle hub. The remaining area (comprising 4.6 ha,in total, of which part is 
already under  construction or built on for employment uses and a day nursery) will 
require a well -designed scheme that responds to the site’s context, makes the most 
of environmental and leisure assets, takes account of the nearby Leisure facility at 
Lee Quarry, and de livers the necessary sustainability, transport, connectivity, 
accessibility (including public transport) and infrastructure requirements. The site is 
adjacent to the River Irwell; an Important Wildlife Site (IWS) and parts of the site are 
Stepping Stone Ha bitat for grassland and woodland. Rossendale Borough Council 
therefore requires a Masterplan for the development of this site.   P a g e  | 94   
Policy EMP3: Employment Site and Premises  
 
All existing employment premises and sites last used for B2 (General Industrial) or 
B8 (Storage and Distribution) and not allocated for other purposes will be protected 
for employment use unless a clearly justified case can be made for a change of use.  
Proposals on all B2 or B8 employment sites/premises for re -use or redevelopment 
other than B use class employment uses will be assesse d under the following 
criteria:  
a) whether there would be an unacceptable reduction on the quantity of 
employment land supply;  
b) the extent of any job losses ; 
c) the relative quality and suitability of the site for e mployment and  
d) an assessment of the existing provision for the proposed use and whether 
there is a clearly identified need;  
e) the location of the site and its relationship to other uses;  
f) whether the ability to accommodate smaller scale employment requirements 
would be compromised;  
g) there would be a net improvement in amenity;  
h) the site and/or buildings are listed or locally listed heritage assets and their re -
use or development is the most appropriate means to secure and maintain an 
acceptable and vi able use that is consistent with their conservation in line with 
other relevant policies in this Plan; and  
i) the site has an adequate access and its redevelopment would not create a 
traffic hazard.  
 
Any proposals for housing use on all B2 or B8 employment sites/premises will need 
to address criteria a to i above and also be subject to:  
j)  convincing evidence of lack of demand for employment re -use and 
employment redevelopment demonstrated through a r igorous and active 
marketing strategy to be agreed with the Council and normally of 12 month 
duration;  
k)  an assessment of the viability of employment development including 
employment re -use and employment redevelopment; and  
l) where the existing building s make a positive contribution to the local area a 
structural survey and assessment of the building to demonstrate the feasibility 
of retaining and converting the building as part of the residential development. 
Where an existing building will be lost as p art of the development, there will 
the requirement to consider the re -use of the existing materia ls within the new 
development.  
 
 
  P a g e  | 95   
An accompanying Supplementary Planning Document will be produced which will set 
out a balanced criteria based approach, including marketing and an assessment of 
the viability of employment use, under which all proposals for re -use will be  
assessed. The SP D will ensure the maintenance and creation of employment 
opportunities in Rossendale and set out the marketing requirements.  
 
Explanation  
204 This policy seeks to protect Rossendale’s employment sites and premises to ensure 
the Borough’s employment space needs can be met over the plan period, this is 
especially important given the Borough’s current shortfall of employment land.  It is 
recognised  that the market for employment land and premises is constantly changing 
and that some older stock may not be suitable to meet current business 
requirements. Nevertheless, having a range of different employment stock is 
important to provide a variety of pr emises to different types and scales of business.  
 
205 Where there is a planning application for a site or building for change of use out of 
employment, the Council will require supporting evidence to show that the proposal 
meets the criteria above. Propos als for housing use on employment sites/premises 
need to meet additional criteria to demonstrate that there is a lack of employment 
demand, that the site/premises are no longer viable and consider retaining and 
converting any existing building if it makes a positive contribution to the local area.  
 
206 Further details will be provided in an accompanying Supplementary Planning 
Docume nt.  
 
Policy EMP4: Development Criteria for Employment Generating 
Development  
Proposals for new employment generating develop ment from Class E (Commercial, 
Businesses and Services), Class B2 (General Industrial) or Class B8 (Storage and 
Distribution), including extensions to existing premises, which provides for or assists 
with the creation of new employment opportunities, inwar d investment and/or 
secures the retention of existing employment within the Borough will be supported 
provided that:  
 The scale, bulk and appearance of the development is compatible with the 
character of its surroundings;  
 There is no significant detrimental  impact on the amenity of neighbouring land 
uses and the character of the area by virtue of increased levels of noise, 
odour, emissions, or dust and light impacts, surface water, drainage or 
sewerage related pollution problems;  
  P a g e  | 96   
 The site has an adequate access that would not create a traffic hazard or 
have an undue environmental impact;  
 The traffic generated does not have a severe adverse impact on local 
amenity, highway safety or the operation of the highways network; and  
 Appropriate provision is made for on -site servicing and space for waiting 
goods vehicles;  
 Adequate screening is provided where necessary to any unsightly feature of 
the development and security fencing is located to the internal edge of any 
perimeter landscaping;  
 On the edges of indus trial areas, where sites adjoin residential areas or open 
countryside, developers will be required to provide substantial peripheral 
landscaping;  
 Development will only exceptionally be supported outside the Urban 
Boundary, subject to other policies in the  Plan, and where it can be shown 
there are no other appropriate sites.  Any development in the Green Belt will 
need to re -use existing buildings or constitute limited infill on previously 
developed sites and demonstrate very special circumstances  
 Masterpla nning or, for smaller sites, the development of a design framework, 
will be expected;  
 Open storage areas should be designed to minimise visual intrusion; and  
 The proposal will be served by public transport and provide pedestrian and 
cycle links to adjacent  areas.  
 
Proposals for land uses that are regarded as main town centre uses, as defined in 
the NPPF, will need to accord with Policies R1 to R5 and ensure there are no 
adverse impacts on the Borough’s centres and parades as defined in R1    
 
Explanation  
207 The Employment Land Review evidences declining employment levels in Rossendale 
since 1997 and high levels of out -commuting. In line with the Council’s Economic 
Strategy , it is essential therefore to attract new employment generating development 
to support the future growth and prosperity of the Borough. Proposals will need to meet 
the above criteria and other policies within the Local Plan, including Policies SD2 and 
R1-R5, to ensure that development is compatible with neighbouring land uses, the 
character of the surrounding area and to ensure there are adequate access and on -
site servicing arrangements.

Policy EMP5: Employment Development in non -allocated 
employment a reas 
New small scale employment development (Use Classes E(g), B2, B8, and E(c) 
(E(c) limited to under 100m2 of new floorspace)), will be permitted in areas where 
employment is not the principal land use provided there would be no detriment to the 
amenity of the area in terms of scale, character, noise, nuisance, disturbance, 
environment and car parking.  Very special circumstances will need to be 
demonstrated for land that is within the Green Belt.  Where this can be demonstrated 
then contributions towards  Green Belt compensatory measures as out in Policy SD4 
will be required.  
 
Explanation  
 
208 There are high levels of demand in Rossendale for employment space from small 
businesses.  Ensuring that there is a supply of flexible space suited to the needs of 
SMEs will be important to help them grow.  This policy seeks to support the growth 
of new small scale employment development where there is no detrime nt to the 
amenity of the area.  
 
 
  P a g e  | 98  Chapter 3: Retail  
Strategic Policy R1: Retail and Other Town Centre Uses  
Retail development, together with other main town centre uses, including 
offices, leisure, arts, culture and tourist facilities, will be focused within the 
defined centres, in accordance with th e Retail hierarchy set out below (the 
boundaries of which are i dentified on the Policies Map):  
 
Town Centre: Rawtenstall  
District Centres: Bacup, Haslingden  
Local Centres: Crawshawbooth, Waterfoot, Whitworth  
Neighbourhood Parade: Stacksteads, Helmshore, Ed enfield and Facit  
 
Development proposals will be expected to maintain or strengthen the retail 
offer and vitality and viability of town, district, local and neighbourhood 
parades , in line with Policy R3.  
 
Major proposals will be directed to Rawtenstall with other large schemes 
encouraged to locate in the district centres of Bacup and Haslingden, with 
ancillary local retail in the other centres. Retail proposals will be directed to the 
Primary Shopping Areas (PSA). Proposals for non -retail uses appropriat e to 
town centres will be considered favourably within the town centre boundary, 
which encompasses but extends beyond the PSA.  
 
The existing markets at Bacup, Haslingden and Rawtenstall will be retained. 
Consideration will on ly be given to relocation where : 
 this forms part of a wider regeneration initiative ; and 
 it positively reinforces the role of the market . 
 
Where retail, leisure and office development is proposed outside of the defined 
centre boundaries, an impact assessment will be required where the f loorspace 
exceeds:  
 Rawtenstall Town Centre       : 400 sq.m  
 Bacup and Haslingden District Centres    : 300 sq.m  
 Crawshawbooth, Waterfoot, Whitworth Local Centres  : 200 sq.m  
 
 
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 99   
 
Proposals that require planning permission which would result in the loss of  
E(a) uses in the PSA of the town, district and local centres will only be supported 
where:  
 It would make a positive contribution to the vitality and viability of the 
relevant ce ntre;  
 It would not result in a significant break in retail frontage or lead to the 
loss of retail floorspace at a scale that would be harmful to the shopping 
function of the centre or which would reduce the ability of local 
communities to meet their day -to-day needs within the centre;  
 It is compatible with a retail area and would maintain an active frontage 
and be immediately accessible to the public from the street; and  
 There would be no significant adverse impacts on the character of the 
area, the amenity  of local residents, road safety, car parking or traffic 
flows.

  P a g e  | 100  209 In Rawtenstall, the Town Centre has benefitted from the redevelopment of part of the 
former Valley Centre into a new bus station incorporating retail units and the 
refurbishment of the Old Town Hall. While in Bacup, the District Centre received a 
£2.2 million grant through the National Lottery Heritage Fund to refurbish historical 
buildings alongside the provi sion of townscape and public realm improvements. A 
strategy for the regeneration of Bacup District Centre has been outlined in a “Bacup 
2040 Vision” which recognises Bacup’s potential as a desirable location for new 
housing, nestled within an attractive na tural landscape and benefitting from a well -
preserved historic character. Furthermore, the Council is currently delivering a £1.08 
million High Street Heritage Action Zone which includes restoration grants, 
redevelopment of derelict buildings, improvements  to the public realm and 
development of community activities. Similarly, a strategy has been developed for 
Haslingden District Centre, the “Haslingden 2040 Vision and Masterplan”. This vision 
aims to increase investment in the district centre, to enable it  to evolve into a 
distinctive and attractive location, to facilitate its revitalisation and to contribute to the 
well-being of its community.  
 
210 Government policy in the NPPF recognises that town centres are the heart of 
communities and requires local planning authorities to define a network and 
hierarchy of centres to support their vitality and viability.  
 
211 The Council commissioned WYG Planning to undertake a Town Centre, Retail, 
Leisure and Tourism Study (town centre and retail study) (2017) to assess retail, 
leisure and tourism needs and capacity in Rossendale up to 2034 . This study is in 
line with Government policy and has informed retail policies and definition of centr es 
within this Local Plan.  
 
212 The town centre and retail study recommends that Rossendale’s retail hierarchy 
remains broadly the same as in the Core Strategy, with major proposals directed to 
the town centre of Rawtenstall followed by the district centre s of Bacup and 
Haslingden.  Local centres Waterfoot and Whitworth remain important for local 
shopping trips and Crawshawbooth has been elevated from a neighbourhood parade 
to a local centre to better reflect its scale and offer. Stacksteads, Helmshore and 
Edenfield continue to remain as neighbourhood parades which , although they are 
not ‘centres’ in the way that town, district and local centres are, should still be 
afforded some protection due to their local role and function. Facit has also been 
listed as a neighbourhood parade as recommended in the study.  
 
213 Government policy in the NPPF requires retail proposals to be directed to Primary 
Shopping Areas ( PSAs ) within centres. Minor changes are proposed to some of the 
PSA and centre boundaries as recommended in the town centre and retail study and 
these are discussed in the retail policies below.  
  P a g e  | 101  214 Rossendale has three markets including Rawtenstall, Haslingde n and Bacup. These 
markets provide an important function and they will be retained and enhanced where 
appropriate in line with the NPPF .  
 
215 The town centre and retail study has examined the need for convenience goods and 
comparison goods within each of Rossendale’s centres to evidence existing retail 
provision and to inform decisions on future planning applications. Convenience 
goods relate to everyday essential items such as food , and comparison goods 
include retail items not bought on a frequent basis such as televisions and white 
goods.  Overall, the study found that there is adequate provision of convenience 
goods within Rossendale, although there may be an argument to improve Bacup’s 
convenience goods offer over the longer -term to improve local consu mer choice and 
competition.  In terms of comparison shopping, the study recommends that existing 
and planned future floorspace at the “out of centre” New Hall Hey Retail Park in 
Rawtenstall is capable of meeting  projected needs , and any future provision above 
and beyond this should be provided within Rawtenstall town centre in the first 
instance.  
 
216 Rawtenstall’s town centre boundary and PSA boundaries have been extended 
slightly to reflect recommendations in the town centre an d retail study. Changes to 
Rawtenstall town centre boundary include expanding the town centre boundaries to 
encompass the Asda foodstore off St. Mary’s Way, the Tesco foodstore off Bocholt 
Way and East Lancashire Railway Station. Both foodstores represent ‘main town 
centre’ uses which are accessible from Rawtenstall , and East Lancashire Railway 
Station represents important supporting transport infrastructure and is the gateway in 
to Rawtenstall for many tourists. Changes to the PSA boundary include an exten sion 
north from Bank Street to include Rawtenstall market and the immediately 
surrounding retail uses; this is because the market represents an important retail 
anchor and key destination.   
 
217 When assessing planning applications for retail, leisure and  office development over 
a certain size outside town, district and local centres, the NPPF requires an impact 
assessment to be undertaken.  The impact test determines whether there would be 
likely significant adverse impacts of locating main town centre de velopment outside 
of existing town centres. The thresholds are lower than those advocated in the NPPF 
to address Rossendale’s specific retail needs, the thresholds reflect 
recommendations in the Council’s town centre and retail study and are considered 
appropriate to ensure that the viability and vitality of each centre is protected.  
 
218 The loss of  E(a)  uses4 in all town, district and local centres will be resisted unless 
the criteria in this policy are met.   
                                                           
4 as defined in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) include business for the display or 
retail of goods, other than hot food, principally to visiting members of the public .   P a g e  | 102   
219 Periodic health checks will be undertaken by the Council to monitor the viability and 
vitality of centres and further guidance will be provided, if required, in a 
Supplementary Planning Document.  
 
 
Policy R2: Rawtenstall Town Centre Extension  
Within the area defined on the Policies Map within Rawtenstall Town Centre , shown 
as an extension to the Primary Shopping Area, redevelopment will be permitted 
subject to the following:  
a) Comprehensive development of the site is demonstrated through a 
masterplan;  
b) The i mplementation of development in accordance with an agreed design 
code; and  
c) An agreed programme of implementation in accordance with the masterplan.  
 
The following mixes of uses are considered to be appropriate:  
i. Commerce, Business and Service (Use Class E); 
ii. Hotel (Use Class C1);  
iii. Drinking establishments (Use Class Sui Generis);  
iv. Leisure uses (Use Class Sui Generis and F2);  
v. Residential units above ground floor level.  
 
 
Explanation  
 
220 The redevelopment of the former Valley Centre as part of the ‘Rawtenstall Town 
Centre’ redevelopment project involves changes to the Primary Shopping Area 
(PSA).  The site of the former Valley Centre has been removed from the PSA and 
the area is identified as a ‘Future Primary Shopping Area Extension’.  The area  has 
benefitted from the construction of a new bus station incorporating retail units and 
the refurbishment of t he neighbouring Old Town Hall. Future planning applications 
within the extension to the PSA will need to be guided by a masterplan and design 
code and ensure high quality community space.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 103   
 
Policy R3: Development and Change of Use in Town, District and 
Local Centres and Neighbourhood Parades  
The boundaries of these centres are defined on the Policies Map. The following 
criteria apply for change of use and development in these centres:  
a)   Planning permission will be granted for E(a), E(b) and E(c) uses, and pub and 
drinking establishments (S ui Generis) which support the role and function of 
these centres.  
b)   Hot food takeaways (Sui Generis) will  be  permitted  where  the  proposal  
would  not  adversely  impact, either individually or cumulatively, on the 
function, vitality and viability o f the centre, subject to the provisions of other 
policies in this Plan.  
c)   Planning permission will be not be granted for non -retail uses (including the 
loss of E(a) use) unless it can be shown that there is no demand for retail or 
commercial use or the property was last occupied by a non -retail/non -
commercial use. This will need to be demonstrated  through an active 12 
month marketing  process  sh owing  that  the  property  has been offered for 
sale or rent on the open  market at a realistic price and th at no reasonable 
offers have been refused.  
 
The provision of flats on the upper floors of the building will be encouraged but this 
will not apply where the applicant can demonstrate that the whole building will be 
fully utilised for retail/commercial purpo ses. 
 
 
Explanation  
 
221  This policy seeks to protect E(a ), E(b) and E(c) uses5 including  the display/ retail of 
goods, other than hot food, the sale of food/ drink for consumption (mostly) on the 
premises, financial and professional services and Sui Generis uses such as drinking 
establishments in Rossendale’s district and local centres. These  uses are protected  
                                                           
5   as defined in the Town and Country Planning (Use  Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) include  
E (a) Shop other than for the sale of hot food  
E (b) Food and drink which is mostly consumed on the premises  
E (c) the following kinds of services principally to visiting members of the public  
i. financial serv ices  
ii. professional services (other than medical services)  
 iii. any other services which it is appropriate to provide in a commercial, business or service locality   P a g e  | 104  to enable the centres to continue to meet local needs, to remain competitive and be 
resilient to future economic changes. Hot food takeaways (Sui Generis) will only be 
permitted where the proposal does not adversely impact on the functi on, vitality and 
viability of the centre. Proposals for non -retail uses need to demonstrate that there is 
no demand for retail or commercial use or the property was last occupied by a non -
retail/non -commercial use.       
 
222 Minor changes have been made t o the boundary changes of Rossendale’s district 
and local centres and PSAs following recommendations in the Council’s town centre 
and retail study. In Bacup , for example , there has been an extension to the district 
centre boundary to encompass the Morrison s’ foodstore on Lee Street and an 
extension to the PSA to include the retail units on King Street, Rochdale Road and 
Irwell Street , as well as the centre’s new B&M Bargains store and public car park.  In 
Haslingden there has been a reduction to the northern fringe of the district centre 
boundary to remove residential properties and a modest extension to the south and 
west to include retail units . The PSA has  also been extended to include the Nisa 
Extra foodstore to the east of Deardengate and shops o n Pleasant Street and Hindle 
Street. The local centres of Crawshawbooth, Waterfoot and Whitworth have only one 
defined centre boundary and there has been limited  change from the Core Strategy 
with the exception of Crawshawbooth being redefined as a local c entre.  
 
Policy R4: Existing Local shops  
Development proposing the change of use or loss of any premises or land currently 
or last used as a local shop (Use Class E(a) or F2(a) for shops mostly selling 
essential goods, including food, with a premises of n o more than 280 sqm and 
located more than 1km away from similar facilities) outside of the defined town, 
district and local centres or neighbourhood parade boundaries will be permitted 
where it can be demonstrated that:  
a)  The use is not financially viable; and  
b)  There is sufficient provision in the local area.  
 
Explanation  
223 It is recognised that local shops outside of town, district or and local centres or 
neighbourhood parades, can provide a useful function in meeting people’s day to 
day shopping needs and constitute a sustainable form of necessary infrastructure 
reducing the need to travel by car. The Council therefore will seek to pr otect such 
facilities where they provide a valuable resource to the local community. Supporting 
evidence should be provided demonstrating that retention as a shop is no longer 
feasible. This policy applies to shops outside of those areas covered by Policy R3. 
  P a g e  | 105  224 In September 2020, the government introduced changes to the Use Classes Order 
to enable the re -purposing of buildings on high streets and in town centres. Shops 
(mostly) selling essential goods to visiting members of the public, including food, 
which are not larger than 280 sq.m. in area and not surrounded by any other such 
facility within 1000 metres fall under category F2(a) This will provide extra protection 
for such local shops.  
 
Policy R5: Hot Food Takeaways  
The development of hot food takeaw ays will be supported provided the following 
criteria are met and subject to other policies of this plan:  
 
a) the development is located within a town or district centre and it would not 
adversely impact the vitality and viability of the area;  
b) where the propo sed development would be located outside of the primary 
shopping area of the town or district centre, it is of no more than 100 square 
metres (gross) floorspace and it would not give rise to an over -concentration 
of hot food takeaways that adversely impact s the vitality and viability of the 
area;  
i) The development would not give rise to unacceptable adverse impacts on 
local amenity, privacy or highway safety.  
 
 
Explanation  
225 The Council seeks to manage the development of hot food takeaways to avoid an 
over-concentration and to manage potential issues such as noise, litter and smell. 
There are also health considerations associated with having high numbers of hot 
food takeaways as poor diet is linked to obesity, especially in children, and 
takeaways can be one of the contributors to unhealthy eating patterns. Rossendale c) where the proposed development is located within 400m of a secondary 
school that lies outside of designated town and district shopping centres,  
takeaway opening hours are restricted at lunchtimes and school closin g times;  
d) applications for new hot food takeaways are not in wards where more than 
15% of Year 6 pupils or 10% of Reception class age pupils are classified by 
Public Health England as obese;  
f) where a new shopfront is proposed it is of a high quality design that is in scale 
and keeping with the area;  
g) provision is made for the control and management of litter both on site and on 
the public highway;  
h) provision is made for the treatment and management of cooking odours and 
any external flue/means of extraction wo uld not cause harm to visual or 
residential amenity, and;   P a g e  | 106  saw a 27% increase in Hot Food Takeaways between 2012 -2016 and has a density 
of such uses that is significantly  above the national average.  
 
226 The Council’s town centre and retail study identifies an over concentration of hot 
food takeaways in several areas of the Borough including for example, the south -
eastern periphery of Haslingden (Manchester Road area) and  Victoria Parade in 
Waterfoot.  The Study states that this creates a lack of activity for much of the day -
time and undermines the areas’ vitality.   
 
227 To help ensure that Rossendale’s centres retain a diverse mix of uses and are 
competitive, the Council  will seek to limit the development of hot food takeaways to 
within town or district centres or restrict them to a certain size if they are located 
outside the PSA.  
 
228 This policy also seeks to manage potential issues such as noise, litter and smell 
through the criteria above.  
 
229 Interim guidance on shopfront shutters is provided in the Council’s Supplementary 
Planning Document on Shopfront Design (2012). A Supplementary Planning 
Document will be also be produced to provide additional guidance on Hot F ood 
Takeaways , updating the Interim Policy Statement dating from 2011.   
 
Policy R6: Shopfronts  
The Council will seek the retention of shopfronts and commercial frontages with 
features of architectural or historic interest (particularly those in Conservation Areas), 
unless the replacement or significant alteration of these shopfronts would better 
preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the building and the wider area.  
 
Proposals for new shopfronts and commercial frontages and the improvement of 
existing frontages should reflect the character of the area.  
 
 
Explanation  
 
230 Shopfronts play an important role in Rossendale’s economic life and are a highly 
visible part of the Borough’s physical fabric. Traditional shopping streets such as 
Bank Street in  Rawtenstall , Deardengate in Haslingden and St James Street in 
Bacup combine local busin esses and historic building types in an attractive market 
town setting.  
  P a g e  | 107  231 The Council’s Supplementary Planning Document on Shopfront Design (2012) 
provides guidance on the design of new shopfronts and the improvement of existing 
frontages , including th e principles of good design and recommendations on issues 
such as the detailing of fascia, signage and security measures.   All proposals will 
have regard to the “Shopfront design” Supplementary Planning Document, including 
any subsequent updates  
   P a g e  | 108  Chapter  4: Environment  
Strategic Policy ENV1: High Quality Development in the Borough  
All proposals for new development in the Borough will be expected to take 
account of the character and appearance of the local area, including, as 
appropriate, each of the follo wing criteria:  
a) Siting, layout, massing, scale, design, materials, lighting, building to 
plot ratio and landscaping;  
b) Safeguarding and enhancing the built and historic environment;  
c) Being sympathetic to surrounding land uses and occupiers, and 
avoiding demonstrable harm to the amenities of the local area;  
d) The scheme will not have an unacceptable adverse impact on 
neighbouring development by virtue of it being over -bearing or 
oppressive, overlooking, or resulting in an unacceptable loss of light; -
nor shou ld it be adversely affected by neighbouring uses and vice 
versa;  
e) Link in with surrounding movement patterns, encourage permeability 
and reflect the principles of “Manual for Streets”;  
f) Not prejudice the development of neighbouring land, including the 
creati on of landlocked sites;  
g) Demonstration of how the new development will connect to the wider 
area via public transport, walking and cycling;  
h) Minimising opportunity for crime and malicious threats, and maximising 
natural surveillance and personal and public s afety;  
i) Providing landscaping as an integral part of the development, protecting 
existing landscape features and natural assets, habitat creation, 
providing open space, appropriate boundary treatments and enhancing 
the public realm;  
j) Including public art in appropriate circumstances;  
k) There is no adverse impact to the natural environment, biodiversity and 
green infrastructure unless suitable mitigation measures are proposed 
and the Council will seek biodiversity net gain consistent with the 
current national po licy; 
l) That proposals do not increase the risk of flooding on the site or 
elsewhere, where possible reducing the risk of flooding overall, having 
regard to the surface water drainage hierarchy;  
m) A Development Brief or Design Code (as appropriate) will be req uired to 
support major new development and smaller proposals as appropriate 
(this document will be proportionate to the size of the scheme). Such 
documents should set out the design principles, the appropriateness of 
the development in the context of the a rea and consideration of 
innovative design;   P a g e  | 109   
n) Where appropriate applications shall be accompanied by an 
independent Design Stage Review ;  
o) Making provision for the needs of special groups in the community such 
as the elderly and those with disabilities;  
p) Consideration of Health impacts, including through a Health Impact 
Assessment for major developments, looking particularly at effects on 
vulnerable groups, and identification of how these may be mitigated;  
q) Designs that will be adaptable to climate change, inc orporate energy 
efficiency principles and adopting principles of sustainable construction 
including Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS); and  
r) Ensuring that contaminated land, land stability and other risks 
associated with coal mining are considered and, whe re necessary, 
addressed through appropriate investigation, remediation and 
mitigation measures.  
 
Explanation  
 
232 Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development and in making places better 
for people. This includes consideration of both buildings and open spaces and the 
relationship between the two; a balance between the need for neighbourliness and 
the scope for design freedom.  
 
233 Developments need to function well and add to the overall quality of the area. They 
should optimise the potential of  the site to accommodate development and respond 
to Rossendale’s local character, history and topography. In Rossendale the 
relationship of town and countryside, hill and valley, stone and other materials are 
particularly important.  The topography of the Borough also means that the visual 
impact of a development can be greater when looked down from higher ground or 
from the valley below compared to being viewed from its immediate situation. The 
use of local materials, particularly stone and slate, is impor tant in reinforcing local 
distinctiveness. “Anywhere” standardised design solutions will be discouraged.  At 
the same time as encouraging local distinctiveness, innovation in design will not be 
discouraged where this contributes to a high quality developme nt. Good architecture 
and appropriate landscaping play key roles in ensuring that Rossendale is visually 
attractive and in creating safe and accessible environments.  Developments also 
need to maximise energy efficiency and be adaptable to climate change. The need 
to minimise flood risk is a key consideration and design should look at reducing heat 
loss and heat island effects through use of materials, orientation and landscaping. 
Higher densities in developments need not lead to sites appearing cramped , and 
high quality design solutions delivering more houses on urban sites will be 
encouraged. Equally, the creation of high quality and adaptable internal spaces is as 
important to users as external appearance. Wherever possible , internal layouts  P a g e  | 110  should meet t he requirements of all members of the population and be adaptable. 
The Council welcomes pro -active engagement on all elements of design.  
 
234 Design briefs or design codes will be required for major development and other sites 
as appropriate to help deliv er high quality proposals. The Council will work with 
developers to address the nature and scope of these documents.  The Council will 
prepare a Design Guide SPD to provide specific advice to developers.  An SPD 
addressing climate change will also be produ ced. 
 
Strategic Policy ENV2: Historic Environment  
The Council will support proposals which conserve or, where appropriate, 
enhance the historic environment of Rossendale.  
 
Particular consideration will be given to ensure that the significance of those 
elements of the historic environment which contribute most to the Borough’s 
distinctive identity and sense of place are not harmed. These include:  
 The historic town centres of  Bacup, Haslingden and Rawtenstall; Pre-
industrial farmhouses and weavers cottages;  
 The legacy of  mill buildings and their associated infrastructure 
including engine houses, chimneys and mill lodges , and the relationship 
to nearby terraced workers ’ housin g;  
 The fine examples of Victorian Mill Owners ’ Mansions;  
 The infrastructure associated with the Borough ’s mining and quarrying 
heritage;  
 The N ineteenth century institutional buildings including its libraries, 
institutes, schools  and former public baths;  
 The range, wealth and quality of its places of worship;  and  
 The network of historic open spaces, parks, gardens, and cemeteries ;  
 Historic l andscape . 
 
Proposals affecting a designated heritage asset (or an archaeological site of 
national importance) should  conserve those elements which contribute to its 
significance. Less than substantial harm to such elements will be permitted 
only where this is clearly justified and outweighed by the public benefits of the 
proposal. Substantial harm or total loss to the s ignificance of a designated 
heritage asset (or an archaeological site of national importance) will be 
permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Where permission is granted for 
a development which would result in the partial or total loss of a designated  
heritage asset, approval will be conditional upon the asset being fully recorded 
and the information deposited with the Historic Environment Record (HER).  
  P a g e  | 111   
Proposals which would remove, harm or undermine the significance of a non -
designated heritage ass et will only be permitted where the benefits are 
considered sufficient to outweigh the harm.   
The historic landscape of the Borough should be protected and any proposals 
which would impact on its qualities or functions will be assessed according to 
policy ENV3.  
Where the proposal affects (non -designated) archaeological sites of less than 
national importance it should conserve those elements which contribute to 
their significance in line with the importance of the remains.  In those cases 
where development a ffecting such sites is acceptable in principle, mitigation 
of damage will be ensured through the preservation of the remains in situ as a 
preferred solution.  When in situ preservation is not justified, the developer 
will be required to make adequate provi sion for excavation and recording 
before or during development, the findings of which should be deposited with 
the Historic Environment Record.  
 
Proposals within or affecting the setting of a conservation area will only be 
permitted where it preserves or e nhances the character and appearance of the 
area, including those elements which have been identified within the 
conservation area appraisal as making a positive contribution to the 
significance of that area.  
 
All applications which affect a heritage asset  should be accompanied by a 
Statement of Significance which may form part of a Design and Access 
statement and/or a Heritage Impact Assessment.  This should provide the 
information necessary to assess the impact of the proposals on the heritage 
asset and i ts setting , demonstrating how the proposal has taken into account 
the elements that contribute to its significance including , where relevant , its 
architectural and historic interest, character and appearance.  
 
As well as fulfilling its statutory obligation s, the Council will:  
 Seek to identify, protect and enhance local heritage assets;  
 Promote heritage -led regeneration including in relation to development 
opportunities;  
 Produce conservation area appraisals and management plans;  
 Develop a positive strategy to safeguard the future of any heritage 
assets that are considered to be “at risk”;  
 Adopt a proactive approach to utilising development opportunities to 
increase the promotion and interpretation of the Borough’s rich 
archaeological wealth; and  
 Develop a po sitive heritage strategy for the Borough.   P a g e  | 112   
 
Explanation  
235 Rossendale’s historic built environment includes; Listed Buildings, Conservation 
Areas, Registered Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Ancient Monuments, 
archaeological sites, historic landscapes and locally identified buildings, sites and 
structures. Many buildi ngs and structures in the Borough pre -date the Industrial 
Revolution, are constructed from locally quarried stone and contribute to Rossendale’s 
local character and distinctiveness. These heritage assets are an irreplaceable 
resource and it is essential to  protect and enhance them.  
 
236 Rossendale contains over 270 heritage assets which are protected on Historic 
England’s National Heritage List for England. The protection of heritage assets 
extends to Rossendale’s ten conservation areas, shown on the Polic ies Map, 
including:  
 Bacup Town Centre ;  
 Haslingden ; 
 Rawtenstall Town Centre ;  
 Loveclough ; 
 Goodshawfold ;  
 Cloughfold ;  
 Fallbarn ;  
 Whitworth Square ;  
 Irwell Vale ; and  
 Chatterton Strongstry.  
 
237 The Council is intending designating additional conservation areas, shown on the 
Policies Map, in:  
 Crawshawbooth;  
 Helmshore; and   
 Newchurch.  
 
238 A new Local List will be introduced to provide protection to key non - designated assets 
that make a strong contribution to the areas character.  
 
239 Listed Parks and Gardens, such as Whitworth Cemetery, are afforded the same 
treatment as Conservation Areas.  
 
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 113  240 Accordingly, all new development affecting Rossendale’s heritage assets or their 
setting needs to be based on a thorough understanding  of the context, significance 
and local distinctiveness of the site and its surroundings , and should be of a high 
quality in terms of its urban, landscape and architectural design , and use of materials. 
Development needs to be in accordance with the NPPF and relevant Historic England 
guidance , the Council’s Conservation Area Appraisals and should be accompanied by 
a heritage statement.  
 
241 All development needs to sustain, conserve and , where appropriate , enhance the 
heritage asset and its setting , and sh ow consideration to the criteria in this policy.   
 
242 Development will only be granted for the demolition or removal of heritage assets in 
exceptional circumstances and needs to be clearly justified with comprehensive 
evidence.  
 
243 The Council are developing a local list of non -designated heritage assets which 
include buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes of significance. 
These heritage assets don’t meet national standards for designation but make a 
significant contribution to Ros sendale’s landscape and merit consideration in planning 
decisions. The identification of heritage assets on the list plays an important role in 
ensuring the proper validation and recording of Rossendale’s local heritage assets 
and in protecting the Borough ’s individual character and distinctiveness. Assets on the 
list have been carefully selected in accordance with guidance on Local Heritage Listing 
from Historic England6 and will be kept under review .  
 
244 Development proposals which result in the total o r partial loss of a locally listed 
heritage asset would need to be fully justified with comprehensive evidence.   
 
 
Policy ENV3 : Landscape Character and Quality  
The distinctive landscape character of Rossendale, including large scale sweeping 
moorlands, pastures enclosed by dry stone walls, and stonebuilt settlements 
contained in narrow valleys, will be protected and enhanced.  
 
The Council will expect development proposals to conserve and, where possible, 
enhance the natural and built environment, its immediate and wider environment , and 
take opportunities for improving the distinctive qualities of the area and the way it 
functions.  
 
 
                                                           
6 ‘Local Heritage Listing - Historic England Advice Note 7’ Historic England, May 2016   P a g e  | 114   
 
Development proposals which are in scale and keeping with the landscape character , 
and which are appropriate to its s urroundings in terms of siting, design, density, 
materials,  and external appearance and landscaping will be supported.  
 
In order to protect and enhance the character and quality of the landscape, 
development proposals should , where appropriate:  
 Respond po sitively to the visual inter -relationship between the settlements and 
the surrounding hillsides and follow the contours of the site;  
 Not have an unacceptable impact on skylines and roofscapes;  
 Be built to a density which respects the character of the surr ounding area with 
only low density development likely to be acceptable in areas abutting the 
Enclosed Upland or Moorland Fringe Landscape Character Areas;  
 Retain existing watercourses, trees and green infrastructure features that make 
a positive contributi on to the character of the area;  
 Incorporate native screen planting as a buffer to soften the edge of the building 
line in valley side locations;  
 Take into account views into and from the site and surrounding area , retaining 
and, where possible, enhancing  key views; and  
 Retain and restore dry stone walls, vaccary stone flag walls and other boundary 
treatments which are particularly characteristic of Rossendale.  
 
Development proposals should incorporate a high quality of landscape design, 
implementation and  management as an integral part of the new development. 
Landscaping schemes should provide an appropriate landscape setting for the 
development and respect the character and distinctiveness of the local landscape.  
 
 
Explanation  
245 Development needs to con serve and enhance Rossendale’s dramatic and attractive 
natural environment and its built environment. The Borough’s landscape is significant 
in terms of its local identity, cultural value, tourism and general contribution to quality 
of life , and it is essential that it is protected.  
 
246 Rossendale is defined by a series of interlocking valleys dissecting wide expanses of 
open moorland, which has determined how the district has grown and developed over 
the years.  A series of closely linked small towns line the valley floors, the largest being 
Rawtenstall and Bacup. Expansive long distance views are available from the uplands. 
Rossendale forms part of the broader South Pennine Character Area defined by 
Natural England. The evidence of farming , quarrying, mining and industry can clearly 
be seen within the steep sided valleys and moorland plateaux. A typical current cross -
section through the Borough is shown in Figure 1.  P a g e  | 115   
Figure 3: Typical current cross-section through Rossendale   
 
 
247 The Council has commissioned various consultants to better understand 
Rossendale’s valuable landscape and to investigate the potential effects of 
development. The Council , together with neighbouring local authorities , commissioned 
Julie Martin Associates to undertake a study7 to investigate the potential effects of 
wind energy development on the character and quality of the landscapes of 
Rossendale and the wider South Pennines area. More recently, the Council 
commissio ned Penny Bennett Architects to develop this approach into a broader 
application to all development. This Study recommends that development should not 
generally take place within enclosed upland or moorland fringe landscape character 
types, identifies the importance of green infrastructure such as native screen planting , 
and the need for development to retain key views to important landmarks.  
 
248 To ensure Rossendale’s landscape is protected for future generations, new 
development should demonstrate it is based on and responds to a thorough 
understanding of the landscape  character and quality of the immediate and wider 
context , and take steps to co nserve and enhance the natural and built environment.  
All development should be in scale and in keeping with the landscape character in 
which it is set and be appropriate to its surroundings. To protect and enhance the

Councils, Julie Martin Associates and LUC (October 2014)  
 P a g e  | 116  character and quality of the landsca pe, development should be in accordance with the 
criteria and incorporate high quality landscape design. This should be demonstrated 
in the Design and Access Statement and any other supporting documentation, as 
appropriate.  
 
Policy ENV4 : Biodiversity, Geodiversity and Ecological Networks  
Development proposals that have potential to affect a national or locally -designated 
site, as shown on the Policies Map and its immediate environs , or on protected habitats 
or species , will be expected to be accompanie d by relevant surveys and assessments 
detailing likely impacts. A sequential approach should be followed to avoid harm and 
where possible enhance biodiversity, and where not possible, provide appropriate 
mitigation and , as a last resort, on and off -site co mpensatory measures to offset the 
impact of development. Any development that adversely affects or damages a Site of 
Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) will not normally be granted permission.  
 
Development proposals should protect areas of biodiversity and  protected species; 
areas of geodiversity and ecological networks , and where possible enhance sites and 
linkages.  Any adverse effects should be first of all avoided; if this is not possible, 
minimised and mitigated against, and where this cannot be achiev ed, compensated 
for. All development proposals should seek to protect and enhance biodiversity, and 
will be requested to quantify any net gains.  
 
Key components of Ecological Networks have been identified on the Policies Map. As 
well as designated ecologi cal areas these include “Greenlands” which are areas of 
open space including parks, cemeteries and open land , many of which were previously 
included in the Core Strategy.  Opportunities to enhance components of the Ecological 
Network, particularly the defi ned “core areas” and “Stepping Stones” and the linkages 
between them , will be supported , with development proposals affecting them expected 
to identify how this is being addressed. An SPD will be produced setting out more fully 
the elements within and the role of Ecological Networks.  
 
The design and layout of new development should retain and enhance existing 
features of biodiversity or geodiversity value within and immediately adjacent to  the 
site. Ecological networks should be conserved, enhanced and expanded. 
Development proposals will be expected to demonstrate how ecological networks are 
incorporated within the scheme.   
 
Where appropriate, development should incorporate habitat featur es of value to 
wildlife , especially priority species, within the development (including within building 
design).  Development proposals should demonstrate they will not adversely affect the 
integrity of any European site of nature conservation.  The Appropr iate Assessment 
should  identify measures necessary to avoid, minimise or mitigate against harm.  
  P a g e  | 117   
The Council will work with other authorities and partner organisations in the South 
Pennines to develop a Visitor Management Plan for the South Pennine Moors Phase 
2 Special Protection Area (SPA).  
 
Explanation  
249 Rossendale contains a diverse range of national, county level and locally designated 
sites which need to be protected and enhanced. These sites are incorporated on the 
Policies Map and include:  
 
National sites  
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) at Lower Red Lees Pasture, Lee Quarry  
(geodiversity) , Hodge Clough and West Pennine Moors  
 
County level sites  
Biological Heritage Sites (BHS)  
Local  Geodi versity Sites (L GS)-, e.g, The Glen  
 
Local sites  
Healey Dell Local Nature Reserve (LNR)  
Important Wildlife Sites (IWS’s)  
 
250 In addition to the various national, county level and locally designated sites, 
Rossendale’s ecological network comprises areas between sites that although not 
design ated, also need to be protected to allow plants and animals to move between 
sites. The Lancashire Ecological Network maps identify networks of woodland, 
grassland , and wetland and heath within Rossendale, including wildlife corridors and 
stepping stones, w hich need to be afforded protection and enhancement. These maps 
are available to view on the Council’s website. These areas includes ‘Core Areas’ 
which are wildlife sites of at least county importance, ‘stepping stones’ and ‘wildlife 
corridors’. As well as  Core Areas, stepping stone habitats will be particularly protected; 
these are identified as sites of local ecological importance and areas of priority habitat 
within or adjacent to corridors.  Some development may be acceptable in wildlife 
corridor sites where the corridor is maintained, however any unavoidable adverse 
effects should be minimised and mitigated against , and where this cannot be achieved, 
compensated with habitat enhancement elsewhere.  
 
251 The Council’s Environmental Network Study identifies a wider network which includes 
the Ecological Network as well as rivers, linear recreational routes and open areas of 
wider green infrastructure value which  need to be afforded protection. The study also  
emphasises the importance of cross -border linkages and the value of the network for 
flood risk management and leisure. Where there are elements of limited value within 
a larger area, it may be possible to release part of a site whilst retaining and enhanc ing 
elements of most environmental value and/or contribute to the enhancement of 
another part of the network  in line with Policy ENV5 . Rossendale’s ecological network  P a g e  | 118  map as identified in the study is included in Appendix 2. Further details on 
Rossendale’s  ecological network will be set out in a Supplementary Planning 
Document  (SPD) .  
 
252 Rossendale has a number of Priority Habitats identified by Natural England such as 
blanket bog, deciduous woodland, lowland meadow and good quality semi -improved 
grasslan d. These support Priority Species such as Curlew, Lapwing and Brown Hare. 
The Council will work with applicants as well as , more broadly , with partners to seek 
improvements to the management of these areas and facilitate progress to meeting 
national targets.  
 
 
Policy ENV5 : Green Infrastructure networks  
Development proposals will be expected to support the protection, management, 
enhanceme nt and connection of the green infrastructure network, as identified on the 
Policies Map. Proposals which enhance the integrity and connectivity of the green 
infrastructure network will be supported. Development proposals should seek first to 
avoid or , if not feasible, mitigate biodiversity impacts on -site. Schemes which would 
result in a net loss of green infrastructure on -site will only be permitted if:  
 
 The function and connectivity of green infrastructure networks are retained or 
replaced; or  
 The development scheme integrates new or enhanced green infrastructure 
where appropriate, such as natural greenspace and trees; and in all cases  
 The proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on amenity, surface 
water or nature conservation.  
 
Where practic able and appropriate, new green infrastructure assets incorporated into 
development proposals should be designed and located to integrate into the existing 
green Infrastructure network and should maximise the range of green infrastructure 
functions and ben efits achieved.  
 
Explanation  
253 Green Infrastructure is a network of multi -functional green space, urban and rural, 
which is capable of delivering a wide range of environmental and quality of life benefits 
for local communities.  In Rossendale it includes Ecological Networks, “Greenlands”, 
and linear corridors such as cycle routes and waterways (“blue infrastructure”), which 
were identified in the Environmental Network Study (TEP 2017). It is a key component 
in the areas “environmental capital” and has an important role in providing habitats 
and migratory routes for many plants and animals, as well as reducing flood risk 
through initiatives such as Natural Flood Management. Green infrastructure, including  P a g e  | 119  landscaping and Sustainable drainage measures help the Borough mitigate and adapt 
to climate  change. It also has significant social benefits, contributing to increased 
health and well -being, especially in more deprived areas. Opportunities will be taken 
to work with partners to enhance the network wherever possible. The work of multi -
agency initi atives such as the Irwell Catchment Partnership will be supported.  
 
254 Development should protect, manage, enhance and connect Rossendale’ s green 
infrastructure network.  This includes protecting Rossendale’s Public Right of Way 
network, which is one of th e densest networks in the country, but also one which is 
generally in a poor state of repair.  
 
255 The Council will apply a mitigation hierarchy to the loss of green infrastructure. 
Wherever possible , development proposals should avoid damaging the existing 
assets within the site. Where this is not possible the remaining green infrastructure on 
site should be enhanced to achieve “no net loss”. Development proposals which result 
in a net loss of on -site green infrastructure will only be permitted where there are clear 
proposals submitted and agreed for off -site net gain i.e. if the loss is replaced by 
equivalent or better provision. This should include clear management proposals to 
ensure that the biodiv ersity or other infrastructure gains are deliverable in the long 
term. Net gains in biodiversity and green infrastructure will be sought that are 
consistent with current national policy.  
 
Policy ENV6 : Environmental Protection  
Development which has the potential, either individually or cumulatively, to result in 
pollution that has an unacceptable impact on health, amenity, biodiversity (including 
designated sites ), air or water quality , will only be permitted if the risk of poll ution is 
effectively prevented or reduced and mitig ated to an acceptable level by:  
 Undertaking assessments and/or detailed site investigations of land which is or 
may be affected by contamination and implementing appropriate remediation 
measures to ensure the site is suitable for the proposed use , and that there is 
no unacceptable risk of pollution within the site or in the surrounding area;  
 Ensuring developments are sensitively designed, managed and operated to 
reduce exposure of sensitive uses and wildlif e to noise and noise generation 
having regard to the location of the proposed development, existing levels of 
background noise and the hours of operation;  
 Assessing the impacts of new development on surface water and groundwater 
quality and implementing suitable measures to control the risk of these being 
adversely affected ;  
 Incorporating appropriate measures to prevent light pollution through the 
design and siting of the development and by controlling the level of illumination, 
glare, and spillage of light, including through the use of developing technologies 
such as LED; and   P a g e  | 120   
 
 Undertaking Air Quality Assessments to the satisfaction of the Council for 
proposals which have the potential to have a significant adverse impact on air 
quality, particularly within or adjacent to an Air Quality Management Area 
(AQMA) shown on the Policies Map, and implementing measures such as 
Travel Plans, dust suppression techniques and the incorporation of electric car 
charging points to both mitigate the effects of the dev elopment on air quality 
and to ensure that the users of the development are not significantly adversely 
affected by the air quality within that AQMA.  
 
Development will not be permitted if the risk of pollution cannot be prevented or if 
mitigation cannot b e provided to an appropriate stan dard with an acceptable design.  
 
New development proposals for sensitive uses, such as housing or schools, located 
near to existing noise, odour or light generating uses , will be expected to demonstrate 
that the proposal is compatible with the surrounding uses and that an acceptable 
standard of amenity would be provided for the occupiers of the development, for 
example through the use of mitigation measures to reduce the e xposure of the 
occupants to pollution, the design of the building and its orientation and layout.   
 
Explanation  
256 New development should be appropriate for its location and should not result in soil, 
air, water, noise pollution or land instability which has unacceptable impacts on health, 
amenity and biodiversity.  
 
257 Where development has the potential to result in  pollution because of its scale or 
nature, it will only be permitted where the risk of pollution is effectively prevented, 
reduced or mitigated to an acceptable level by complying with the criteria in this policy. 
Evidence should be submitted to the satisf action of the Council to support the 
proposed use on the site and demonstrate no unacceptable risks of pollution within 
the site or the surrounding area. Adverse impacts on health and quality of life arising 
from noise should be mitigated and reduced.  Dev elopment should not adversely 
impact on surface and ground water. Lighting should minimise spillage through good 
design, especially in rural areas. Proposals which have the potential to have a 
significant adverse impact on air quality, particularly within or adjacent to an Air Quality 
Management Area, need to demonstrate how the effects will be prevented or 
mitigated. Air Quality Management Areas are declared where research indicates that 
levels of substances such as nitrogen oxides ( NoX) or particulates ex ceed government 
guidelines.  
 
258 Where new development is proposed for sensitive uses close to existing sources of 
noise, odour or light, proposals will need to demonstrate that the proposal is  P a g e  | 121  compatible with surrounding uses and ensure that acceptable standards of amenity 
are provided f or the occupiers of the development.  
 
259 Proposals need to be supported by clear, evidence based research and reflect 
adherence to national and international standards , and the Government’s national 
ambitions on reduced emissions to support climate chang e targets.  
Policy ENV7 : Wind Turbine s  
Community led proposals for wind turbines in all parts of the Borough will be supported 
provided they meet the technical requirements set out below.  
 
Areas suitable for commercial Wind Turbines have been identified on the Policies 
Map. Single, and exceptionally, small groups of Turbines of up to 59m may be 
suitable in the “Enclosed Uplands Areas Suitable for Wind Turbine s” shown on the 
Policies Map. New l arger turbines or re -powerin g of existing ones may be considered 
on the “ High Moorland Plateau Areas Suitable for Wind Turbine s” shown on the 
Policies Map , provided areas of deep peat (over 40cm depth) and blanket bog are 
avoided.  Development of new wind turbines  over 25 metres in height or re -powering 
of existing machines outside these areas would be resisted.   All areas of the 
Borough are considered to be potentially suitable for single turbines of up to 25m in 
height.  
Commercial proposals for new wind turbines  or re -powering of existing schemes 
outside Suitable Areas defined on the Policies Map should  demonstrate that the 
criteria used for designating these areas have been fully addressed in their proposals , 
as well as covering the criteria set out below.  
 
Proposals for commercial wind farms and individual turbines (including repowering of 
existing schemes) within Areas of Search shown on the Policies Map will only be 
supported if the following criteria are addressed to the satisfaction of the Local 
Planning  Authority : 
 The impacts identified by the local community have been taken into account 
and fully addressed;  
 The scale, height and siting of the turbine(s) and all supporting information is 
appropriate to the area taking into account:  
o The vertical height and horizontal expanse of the topography;  
o The degree of openness of the landscape;   
o The scale of adjacent landscape features, buildings and walls;  
o The proximity to designated and non -designated built heritage assets;  
o The proximity to distinctive landforms , such as a ridgeline, knoll or rock 
outcrop, which makes a key contribution to local landscape character;  
o The presence of existing settlement or field patterns; and  
o The opportunities to screen or reduce the visual impact of the 
development;  
  P a g e  | 122   
 It would n ot result in the loss of, or significantly detract from, key views of scenic 
landmarks or landscape features;  
 The design, colour, layout and arrangement of turbines are appropriate to their 
setting;  
 The proposal would not result in unacceptable visual clut ter in combination with 
other existing structures , with cumulative impacts fully assessed to the 
satisfaction of the Council;  
 There would be no unacceptable harm to neighbour amenity, protected species 
or the use of public rights of way or bridleways or a severe impact on highway 
safety;  
 Shadow and Reflective Flicker impacts on buildings and Public Rights of Way 
are fully assessed with a precautionary approach taken to mitigation;  
 The scheme would not result in unacceptable noise impacts, including 
amplitud e modulation, on residential properties and other sensitive users;  
 The impact on geology, including former mine workings, peat and hydrogeology 
is fully appraised and issues identified addressed , including restoration plans 
as appropriate;  
 No development i s proposed on areas of peat of over 40cm depth;  
 Impacts on designated species and ecological assets are avoided or minimised;  
 The proposal does not cause unacceptable harm to any heritage assets and 
their setting;  
 The impact on recreational assets is asse ssed and impacts on key routes such 
as the Pennine Bridleway and Rossendale Way are avoided or if this is not 
possible, mitigated;   
 The scale, siting and design of any ancillary structures and access tracks are 
appropriate to the character of the area and  the landscape setting;  
 The submission contains a Construction Management Plan, including impacts 
on the Highway network, and incorporates proposals for managing the de -
commissioning and removal of the turbines and the restoration of the site ;  
 Any landscape features removed or altered to enable the erection of the turbine 
are reinstated and the design, materials and scale of any new fencing or walling 
needed is appropriate to the character of the local area;  
 Issues with respect to the following  are appropriately addressed to the 
satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority:  
o Shadow and reflective flicker ; 
o TV and phone reception ; 
o Air traffic radar reception; and  
 A de-commissioning scheme is included.

Explanation  
260 The NPPF and national guidance on renewable energy8 highlights the importance of 
increasing the amount of energy from renewable technologies to help make sure the 
UK has a secure energy supply, reduces greenhouse gas emissions to slow down 
climate change and stimulate investmen t in new jobs and businesses. Applicants for 
renewable energy development are not expected to demonstrate an overall need for 
renewable energy.  
 
261  In recent years Rossendale has accommodated a considerable amount of wind 
energy development reflecting the high wind resource in the area. This has 
contributed significantly to meeting renewable energy targets.  
 
262 In parts of the Borough there has been  cumulative visual impact, including with 
adjacent schemes outside Rossendale. Different heights and designs of turbine can 
have discordant visual effects. Other impacts include that of noise, shadow flicker 
and effects on hydrology.  
 
263 The Areas shown o n the Policies Map reflect recommendations included in the 
South Pennines Wind Energy Landscape Study  by Julie Martin Associates (2014). 
They also take into account wind resource and the location of deep peat.  
 
264 All areas of the Borough are considered t o be potentially suitable for single turbines 
of up to 25m in height, in particular where this supports farm diversification. Single, 
and exceptionally, small groups of Turbines of up to 59m may be suitable in the 
“Enclosed Uplands”  landscape area shown on  the Policies Map. Larger turbines may 
be considered on the “ High Moorland Plateau ” Area of Search within or adjacent to 
the existing Scout Moor Wind Farm. Development on deep peat (over 40cm depth) 
or blanket bog within the area suitable for wind turbines  should be avoided. Any 
development in this suitable area  should take into account of, and complement 
proposals by Moors for the Future for the improvement of the habitat of Scout Moor.  
New turbines along the Heald Moor ridge are not considered acceptable .  
 
265 Proposals for wind farms and individual turbines need to address the criteria set out in 
this policy to ensure the development is acceptable. It is particularly important that , in 
line with the Written Ministerial Statement of 2015 , the planning impacts identified by 
the affected local community are fully addressed and the proposal therefore has their 
backing.  
 
 
 
                                                           
8 Renewable and low carbon energy, Department for Communities and Local Government, Planning Pra ctice 
Guidance, 18 June 2015   P a g e  | 124   
266 The Council’s Wind energy in the Landscape study9 recommends that in considering 
whether a development can be accommodate d in the landscape a range of criteria 
may be considered including; landscape character, potential for landscape or visual 
harm, sensitive siting, design, additional mitigation / landscape enhancement and 
cumulative impact. This would apply both to individ ual turbines as well as wind farms. 
Generic good practice in siting, layout and design of wind energy developments in the 
landscape, and on assessing the landscape, visual and cumulative impacts of wind 
energy developments can be found in Appendix 3 and Ap pendix 4 of the Council’s 
wind energy study and in national guidance on renewable energy.  Applicants will be 
expected to take into account the latest Good Practice guidance produced by or on 
behalf of the Council on assessing the Landscape Impacts of Wind Turbines  
 
267 While landscape is generally the greatest impact of new development there are a wide 
range of other factors that need consideration. Noise impact can change according to 
the weather conditions and should be modelled according to the latest go od practice 
guidance including the effects of amplitude modulation.  
 
268 Ecological impacts, including on peat, can be significant unless the siting of the 
turbines is given careful consideration. The legacy of previous mining and quarrying 
means that hydr ological issues need to be given careful consideration to avoid effects 
on public and private water supplies. Natural England considers areas of deep peat 
(over 40cm in depth) as particularly important and siting of turbines and supporting 
infrastructure o n these areas should be avoided. Some areas are also valuable for 
nesting birds.  
 
269 The legacy of previous mining and quarrying means that hydrological issues need to 
be given careful consideration to avoid effects on public and private water supplies.  
 
270 Overall, proposals will need to demonstrate no unacceptable impacts and that any 
potential harm is being mitigated and minimised.  New wind turbines proposed outside 
Areas of Search or above the indicated size thresholds will be resisted unless it can  
be demonstrated that all issues have been fully addressed.  
   
271 The Council sets out what evidence is required to support new development in its 
Validation Checklist. This list is not exclusive however and there may be other locally  
specific items. The plan for decommissioning, restoration and after care at the end of 
the permission or life of the turbines (whichever is earlier) should be set out in the 
planning application.  The Council will ensure conditions on de -commissioning and 
restoration are incl uded when granting permissions for wind developments and will 
consider financial guarantees through a section 106 agreement.

Policy ENV8 : Other forms of Energy generation  
The Council will take a positive approach to renewable energy proposals in the 
Borough, such as solar and hydro -electric schemes, including community led 
initiatives, subject to the Authority being satisfied that any negative impacts, including 
of any supporting infrastructure, can be minimised. Proposals for decentralised energy 
generation and distribution will be given positive consideration subject to their wider 
environmental impacts.  
 
Explanation  
272 The increasing efficiency of solar panels and lower costs of production mean that this 
is an increasingly attractive form of energy  generation  including in Rossendale . Many 
forms of solar panels on buildings are permitted development but larger arrays or 
those that are ground mounted require permission. Issues that will be considered in 
the appraisal of any development include:  
 Orient ation;  
 Landscape and visual impact, including cumulatively;  
 Glint and glare, especially on any neighbouring uses and road users;  
 Design of panels, including colour and shape;  
 Impacts on the setting of listed buildings, conservation areas , registered parks  
and other heritage assets ; 
 Impacts on existing agriculture, where relevant;  
 Landscaping proposals; and  
 Impacts of supporting infrastructure including access roads and cabling.  
 
273 Hydro -electric schemes have not yet proved to be viable in Rossendale. Howe ver, if 
a scheme was brought forward the impact on fish,  managing flood risk and improving 
water quality would be the key considerations.  The Environment Agency operates 
separate licencing regimes on hydro -electric schemes and developers should liaise 
sepa rately with them on these matters.  
 
274 Biomass Energy systems have  already been implemented in the Borough and further 
such schemes would be supported. The main considerations would be air quality from 
emissions and delivery and storage of fuel.  
 
275 District Heating Schemes will be encouraged and supported subject to consideration 
of emissions/noise from the main power plant.      
 
276 Consideration of Hydraulic fracturing for gas  (fracking)  is a matter for the Mineral and 
Waste Planning Authority, in  this case Lancashire County Council. As a consultee, 
Rossendale Borough Council would take into account the  wider environmental  P a g e  | 126  impacts, latest Mineral and Waste Local Plan policies and associated Supplementary 
Planning Documents ( SPD’s ) on this topic whe n making its response.    
 
277 Rossendale is an area that historically was heavily mined for coal with reserves still 
remaining. There are no known plans for further extraction but, if proposed, they would 
need to be environmentally acceptable and would be considered by the Minerals and 
Waste Planning Authority. The Mineral Safeguarding Areas identified in the Minerals 
and Waste Local Plan are also shown on t he Policies Map for this Plan.   
 
278 Consideration of energy generation through extraction of car bon based resources 
(coal, gas, etc) is the responsibility of Lancashire County Council as the Minerals and 
Waste Authority.  
 
Policy ENV9 : Surface Water Run -Off, Flood Risk, Sustainable 
Drainage and Water Quality  
All development proposals will be required  to consider and address flood risk from all 
sources. A sequential approach will be taken and planning permission will only be 
granted for proposals which would not be subject to unacceptable flood risk, or 
materially increase the risks elsewhere, and wher e it is a type of development that is 
acceptable in a Flood Risk location. Assessment should be informed by consideration 
of the most up to date information on Flood Risk available from the Environment 
Agency, the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA), th e Lead Local Flood Risk 
Authority and the sewage undertaker. Developers will be expected to provide 
appropriate supporting information to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, 
such as Flood Risk Assessments for all developments in Flood Zones 2  and 3 and as 
required by national policy and any local validation requirements. Site specific 
mitigation measures should be clearly identified.               
 
All development proposals will be required to manage surface water as part of the 
development in  the following order of priority:  
 An adequate soakaway or some other form of infiltration system.  
 An attenuated discharge to surface water body.  
 An attenuated discharge to public surface water sewer, highway drain or 
another drainage system.  
 An attenuated discharge to public combined sewer.  
 
Applicants wishing to discharge surface water to a public sewer will need to submit 
clear evidence demonstrating why alternative options are not available. The 
expectation will be for only foul flows to communicate with  the public sewer.  
 
  P a g e  | 127   
On greenfield sites, applicants will be expected to demonstrate that the current natural 
discharge solution from a site is at least mimicked. On previously developed land, 
applicants will also be expected to follow the surface water hierarchy and any proposal 
based on a proposed reduction in surface water discharge from a previously 
developed site will be expected to target a reduction to a greenfield rate of run -off. 
Development proposals will be required to incorporate sustainable d rainage systems 
and consider surface water management early in the design process. Applicants will 
need to consider what contribution landscaping proposals (hard and soft) can make to 
reducing surface water discharge. Development proposals will be expected  to 
maximise the use of permeable surfaces / areas of soft landscaping, and the use of 
Green Infrastructure as potential sources of storage for surface water run -off. The 
proposed drainage measures  should fully integrate with the design of the 
development  and priority should be given to multi -functional sustainable drainage 
systems SuDS (as opposed to underground tanked storage systems), which 
contribute to amenity, biodiversity and water quality, as well as overall climate change 
mitigation.  
Alternatives  to multi -functional level SuDS will only be permitted where it is 
demonstrated that they are impractical or there are other exceptional circumstances.  
Applicants will need to submit clear evidence when multi -functional sustainable 
drainage features are n ot proposed.  
 
All drainage proposals should incorporate clear implementation, management and 
maintenance arrangements.  
 
Proposals for minor development in areas at risk of flooding should also incorporate 
SuDS into the design of the scheme unless there is clear evidence that it would be 
inappropriate. Drainage proposals for minor schemes should follow the surface water 
hierarchy and at least demonstrate that SuDS solutions (including multi -functional 
SuDS) have been considered.  
 
Any development proposal which is part of a wider development / allocation will be 
required to demonstrate how the site delivers foul and surface wa ter drainage as part 
of a wider, holistic strategy which co -ordinates development and infrastructure 
between phases, whilst having regard to interconnecting phases. Infrastructure should 
be sized to accommodate flows from interconnecting phases and drainag e strategies 
should ensure a proliferation of pumping stations is avoided on a phased development.  
 
Applicants will be expected to liaise with utility providers. It may be necessary to co -
ordinate the delivery of development with the delivery of infrastruc ture improvements.  
Use of septic tanks will only be permitted where connection to the foul  sewer network 
is not feasible.   P a g e  | 128   
Explanation  
279 Rossendale has large areas of flood risk. There are high surface water runoff rates 
coming off the hillsides especially after sustained periods of heavy rain. The rivers 
Irwell and Spodden respond quickly to any changes in flow, producing fluvial (river) 
flooding. Flood risk is a very serious issue for the Borough and the cumulative impacts 
of development can be significant.  The impacts of climate change and more intense 
rainfall events also need to be taken into account when considering new development. 
High surface water runoff also contributes to temporary poor water quality.  
 
280 The NPPF sets strict tests to  protect people and property from flooding. Where these 
tests are not met, national  policy is clear that new development should not be allowed. 
The Council applies a sequential approach to site selection so that development is, as 
far as reasonably possibl e, located where the risk of flooding is lowest. If , following 
application of the Sequential Test, it is not possible for the development to be located 
in areas with a lower probability of flooding  the Exception Test can be applied if 
appropriate.  
 
281 The Council commissioned JBA Consulting to undertake a Level 1 and Level 2 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (2016) for Rossendale10. This study looked at a large 
number of potential development sites in the Borough and made recommendations in 
relation to the ir potential flood risk. The Council has taken the recommendations into 
account when considering individual site assessments for the Local Plan.   
 
282 Natural methods to manage surface water run -off will be encouraged as a priority. The 
use of permeable s urfaces/areas of soft landscaping, the use of green infrastructure , 
and the use of natural flood management measures in upland areas will all be 
supported where appropriate, working together with relevant partners.  More detail on 
this will be contained in  the forthcoming Climate Change SPD.  
 
283 Proposals for major development will be expected to incorporate multi - functional 
SuDS ; this must be included within the early stages of the site design and involve 
consultation with relevant partners.  Proposals f or minor development should also 
consider the incorporation of above ground SuDS. SuDS can include a variety of 
natural surface water management and could include innovative approaches such as 
green roofs , grey water management  and bio -retention tree pits.  Further guidance on 
this will be contained in a future Climate Change SPD.  
 
284 The Council will seek advice from key agencies including Lancashire County Council 
and the Environment Agency where appropriate. Utility provider s (currently United 
Utilities) will also be consulted.  
                                                           
10 Rossendale Hybrid Level 1 and Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, JBA Consulting, November 2016   P a g e  | 129   
Policy ENV10 : Trees and Hedgerows  
Development proposals must seek to avoid the loss of, and minimise the risk of harm 
to, existing trees, woodland, and/or hedgerows of visual or nature conservation 
value . Any harm to ancient and veteran trees should be avoided unless wholly 
exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated. Where trees and/or woodlands are 
to be lost as a part of development this loss must be justified as a part of an 
Arboricultural Impl ications Assessment (AIA) submitted with the application . 
 
The Council will expect developers to plan for retention by using an AIA to inform site 
layout, in advance of the submission of any application. Where trees, woodland 
and/or hedgerows lie within a development site, they should wherever possible be 
incorporated effectively within the landscape elements of the scheme . 
 
Development proposals should , where appropriate:  
 not result in the loss of trees or woodland which are subject to a Tree 
Preservation Order or which are considered worthy of protection;  
 not give rise to a threat to the continued well -being of retained trees, 
woodlands or hedgerows;  
 not involve building within the canopy or root spread of trees, woodlands, or 
hedgerows which are to be ret ained, except where it can be proven that the 
construction can be carried out in accordance with the most up -to-date British 
Standard and an appropriate method statement is fully adhered to;  
 make a positive contribution to Green Infrastructure where it is within or 
adjacent to identified Green Infrastructure networks;  
 make a posit ive contribution to biodiversity; and 
 ensure trees are incorporated into the design of new streets and elsewhere to 
support the Rossendale Forest and community orchards.  
 
To ensure that the benefits of the proposed development outweigh the harm 
resulting from the loss of trees, woodlands or hedgerows, compensatory planting 
using native species must take place at a ratio of at least 2:1. Where this ratio cannot 
be achieved t his must be fully justified with the compensatory measures proposed 
clearly justified.  
 
Trees within a Conservation Area that are 75mm diameter or above at 1.5m above 
ground level, and trees protected by tree preservation orders , will be given detailed 
consideration when considering planning consent. Any planning proposal must seek 
to retain these trees unless there are sound arboricultural reasons (as justified within 
the AIA) for their removal.  
 
 
  P a g e  | 130  Explanation  
285 Rossendale generally has a low level of tree coverage and the retention and 
protection of trees, woodland and hedgerow is critical in terms of biodiversity and 
also to protect the Borough’s individual landscape and character. Trees and hedges 
also have an important role in management of climate change including urban 
cooling effects. Core woodland areas exist at Whitworth, Buckshaw Brow, Edenfield 
and the Ogden Reservoir Valley , and these areas are connected by “stepping stone” 
habitats as identified on the Lancashire Ecological Network Maps.   
 
286 Development should not result in the loss or harm to trees, woodland, or hedgerows 
of visual or conservation value. Arboricultural Implications Assessments (AIA) should 
be used to inform site layout and show how trees and hedgerows will be retained.  
The benefits of the proposed development should outweigh the harm resulting from 
the loss of any trees, woodlands or hedgerows and compensatory planting must be 
provided. Provision of new trees of appropriate native species at a ratio of 2:1 is 
required to help to address any biodiversity loss and enhance the existing provision. 
Where a developer cannot meet this requirement this should be clearly justified.  
Where any trees provided as part of compensatory provision die, replacement trees 
should be planted.  
 
287 Care should be taken in the design of development, including supporting 
infrastructure such as roads, to ensure that not only trees and hedges but also their 
associated root systems are given full protection.  
 
288 Particular care shou ld be made to retain trees within a Conservation Area and trees 
protected by tree preservation orders unless sound arboricultural reasons are given 
for their  removal. P a g e  | 131  Chapter 5: Leisure and Tourism  
Strategic Policy LT1: Protection of Playing Pitches, Existing  
Open Space, Sport and Recreation Facilities  
Playing Pitches, Existing Open Space, Sport and Recreational Facilities are 
shown on the Policies Map.  
 
Development proposals which would result in the loss of playing pitches and 
associated facilities , and land or buildings in recreational or sporting use or last 
used as such , or which would prejudice the use of these areas for sport and 
recreation , will be resisted and only be permitted where:  
 
 A replacement of the same type, of an equal or greater qu antity and 
quality is provided in an appropriate location; or  
 It is demonstrated to the Council’s satisfaction that there is a surplus of 
recreational land , buildings  or facilities of the same type relative to the 
current and likely future needs of the local community. All development 
affecting playing pitches and associated facilities will be considered 
against the most up to date version of the Playing Pitch Strategy ; or 
 The development involves the loss of a small part of a larger site in 
recreational use and would result in the enhancement of recreational 
facilities on the remainder of the site, or on a nearby site serving the same 
community  and a net gain in sports  provision can be demonstrated ; or  
 In the case of school playing fields or sports facilities, the development 
is for education purposes or the Department for Education is satisfied 
that the land is no longer required for school use , and its loss would not  
result in a shortfall in recreational open space/playing pitches/sports 
facilities for the local community now or in the future .  
 
Given the important role indoor sports facilities play in promoting the physical 
and mental well -being of the community, the Council will work closely with 
Sport England and other partners to ensure that any future decision on the 
provision of all sports f acilities is based on a robust and up -to-date evidence 
base. To assist with this, it is the intention of the Council to produce an Indoor 
Sports Strategy during the next 12 -24 months to help underpin effective policy 
application.       
 
 
  P a g e  | 132  Explanation  
 
289 Playing pitches , sports faci lities and recreational open space are valued by many 
residents of the Borough and play an important role in the health and well -being of 
the community.  This is increasingly important given the rise in obesity levels.  
 
290 The C ouncil commissioned a Playing Pitch Strategy for the Borough (2016) which 
identified a deficit of football pitches and rugby pitches and recommended that all 
existing pitches should be retained, including those not currently in use. 
Development on such pit ches will only be permitted if replacement of equal or higher 
quality is provided elsewhere in the Borough.  
 
291 Because of the topography, substrate and rainfall in the Borough, many pitches are 
poorly drained. The Council will seek contributions to playing pitch enhancement 
from new housing development (Policy HS6).  
 
292 Built sports facilities in the Borough are focussed on the Marl Pits complex at 
Rawtenstall, Haslingden Sports Centre and Whitworth Swimming Pool. There are 
also publically accessible facilities at Valley Leadership Academy and Whitworth 
High Schools. The Council  will seek to support, retain and improve these facilities 
wherever possible . 
 
293 School Playing pitches perform an important role in supporting the fitness of pupils  
and encouraging a healthy lifestyle.  They can also be of wider benefit if the facility i s 
managed for public access and reduce the pressure on public pitches. Any loss of 
School Playing Fields has to be authorised by the Secretary of State for Education.  
 
294 Pitches for other sports such as Cricket, Bowls and Tennis will also be protected 
where this will not lead to a deficit in provision and, where possible, improved.  
 
295 There is a variety of other land that is in recreational use as set out in the Council’s 
Open Space Strategy. This includes Children’s Play Areas, Multi -Use Games Areas 
and Parks, which often include Bowling Greens and Tennis Courts. Allotments also 
perform an important recreational role. All of these sites will be protected from 
development and, where possible, should be enhanced.     
 
296 The loss of small areas of land i n the curtilage of a sporting or recreational site will 
be considered where the scheme would enhance the overall recreational value of the 
site or, alternatively, improved provision would be made within walking distance of 
the site.   
   
  P a g e  | 133   
Policy LT2: Community Facilities  
Development proposing the change of use or loss of any premises , or land currently 
or last used as a community facility (including public houses, post offices, community 
centres, village and church halls, places of worship, children’s centres, libraries, 
cultural facilities, theatres, parks and open spaces and health facilities) will be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that:  
 
a)   The facility no longer serves the local needs of the community in which it is 
located; or  
b)   Adequa te alternative provision has been made, or is already available, in the 
settlement or local area; or  
c)   The use is no longer financially viable and a marketing exercise has taken 
place to demonstrate this.  
 
The creation of new community facilities as par t of proposed new developments will 
be encouraged. Such proposals should, where appropriate, give an indication of how 
ongoing maintenance will be addressed.  
 
 
Explanation  
297 Facilities that serve local communities throughout Rossendale have an important 
social function and enhance the quality of life for residents as well as visitors. The 
provision and retention of community facilities is considered to be integral for 
ensuring  that communities are  sustainable in the long term. The Council will 
therefore support appropriate proposals which seek to enhance the range of 
community facilities  especially in areas where these are currently limited such as in 
parts of the east of the B orough .  
 
298 It is recognised that the demand for a community facility may alter over time as the 
nature and needs of a local community change. The Council will however safeguard 
community facilities against unnecessary loss, particularly where this would  reduce 
the community's ability to meet its day to day needs locally, unless it is demonstrated 
that the facility which would be lost is no longer required or suitable , or that an 
appropriate replacement facility would be provided. The Council as part of a ny 
planning application will expect this to be fully justified and it may be necessary to 
undertake a marketing exercise to demonstrate this.   
  P a g e  | 134  290 Proposals for the partial change of use or the diversification of the range of uses at a 
community facility  can help sustain these facilities and may be supported where they 
would enable the retention of the community facility.  
 
291 All planning applications to redevelop such facilities will need to be accompanied by 
a detailed statement justifying why the fac ility should be lost and assessing the 
implications that the loss will have on the community.  The requirements for this will 
be set out in the Council’s validation checklist . 
 
This justification should be based on the results received from a marketing exe rcise 
demonstrating that the community facility is no longer financially viable for the 
current use. A marketing exercise can involve research on the usage of the 
community facility over time, the general demand for such community facilities in the 
surroun ding area and the quality of said community facility and any costs to bring the 
community centre back to an acceptable standard if necessary.  
 
292 Some developments, especially for larger scale proposals and on masterplanned 
sites, will stimulate the need for additional community facilities within an area. Where 
this is proposed it should include details of how ongoing  maintenance will be 
addressed.  
 
Policy LT3: Tourism  
Tourism throughout the Borough will be  promoted in the following ways:  
 Supporting the “ Outdoor Rossendale” ; 
 The development, extension and upgrading of footpaths, cycleways and 
bridleways (specifically the Rossendale Way, Irwell Sculpture Trail and Mary 
Towneley Loop, and more generally the Public Rights of Way network), 
supported by appropriate signage, interpretation and public art ; 
 Support for the clustering of tourism related activities ; 
 Events promotion ; and  
 Taking a positive approach to development of complementary 
accommodation and hospitality facilities.  
 
Proposals for the enhancement of existing facilities and activities, as well as the 
development of new facilities and activities  will be considered favourably.  This will 
also include supporting infrastructure, such as enhanced access through car parking, 
bike racks, public realm and public transport improvements. The use of existing 
buildings will be encouraged.  
 
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 135   
 
New development outside the urban boundary will be considered acceptable where it 
is essential for the proposed facility, and no sites within the urban boun dary are 
suitable, and there are no unacceptable impacts affecting:  
 Landscape character  
 Visual quality (including light pollution)  
 Neighbour amenity  
 Highways  
 Nature conservation assets  
 
 
Explanation  
 
293 Rossendale is located within the South Pennines, an area shaped by its past textile 
industry, with its mills and traditional dense terraced housing along the valley 
bottoms , with peat moorland above, which has been used for farming, quarrying, 
mining, reservoirs and more recently wind turbines.  Throughout the Borough are 
several museums, and Rawtenstall hosts the northern terminus of the East 
Lancashire Railway, a heritage line, which is hoped in time to support a commuter 
link to Greater Manchester, that would operate alongside the heritage line.  
 
294 The tourism sector has an important role to play in Rossendale’s future prosperity.  
As reported in the 2017 Rossendale Town Centre, Retail, Leisure and Tourism 
Study, STEAM data from 2015 noted that Rossendale attracted 2% of all tourists  
visiting Lancashire,  providing a total economic impact of £53m, which had grown by 
3% from the previous year.  
 
295 Branded as the “Outdoor Rossendale” , support will be given to further enhancing the 
established extreme and outdoor sports facilities on offer within the Borough , 
including Water Ski Academy and motor sports at Cowm Reservoir, skiing and 
snowboarding at Ski Rossendale, and mountain bike tracks at Lee and Cragg 
Quarries.  The Pennine Bridleway allows for hill walking, cycling and horse riding.  
As well as providing  outstanding recreational opportunities for local people, these 
assets can be maximised for employment and income generating opportunities, 
given the Borough’s proximity to the conurbation of Greater Manchester and West 
Yorkshire.   
 
296 New facilities wil l also be encouraged at appropriate locations where the necessary 
infrastructure to support the development can be provided.  For example new leisure 
facilities are being proposed at Futures Park to support Lee Quarry.   P a g e  | 136   
Policy LT4: Overnight Visitor Accom modation  
The Council will take a positive approach to new high quality visitor accommodation.  
This includes hotels, bed and breakfast establishments, self -catering facilities, bed 
and tack, camping barns,  and sites used for camping,  caravanning and camper  
vans . Proposals will be supported particularly where use is made of existing 
buildings.  
 
Proposals will be supported at locations both within and outside the urban boundary 
where:  
 They are appropriate to the locality;  
 They are complementary to existing to urism facilities;  
 There is suitable access by a variety of modes;  
 The capacity of the existing infrastructure is adequate;  
 There are no adverse impacts on visual amenity, landscape or nature 
conservation ; and  
 The development will not reduce the amount of land for the purposes of open 
space and recreation.  
 
All ancillary facilities should be designed (in terms of style and materials) to take into 
account their functions and blend into their settings, with appropriate landscaping 
and boundary treatments.  
 
Ancillary facilities such as cycle storage or horse paddocks will be encouraged in 
locations such as along bridleways or the cycle network.  
 
Any large scale hotel proposals (40 bedrooms or over) should be located in or 
adjacent the centres of Rawtenstall, Haslingden or Bacup. Outside these centres, 
large scale hotel proposals will only be supported where they form part of a wider 
regeneration scheme, can demonstrate a wider community benefit and access to the 
site can be provided by a variety of modes.  
 
 
Explanation  
 
297 A key finding of the 2017 Town Centre, Retail, Leisure and Tourism Study is that 
whilst the tourist economy in Rossendale is improving  (£53 million in 2015) , the 
Borough is lacking in overnight accommodation, with ‘staying visitors’ accounting for 
just 22% of the total ‘visitor days’ recorded in the Valley in 2015 (compared to 31% at 
the county level).  As the tourism offer improves in the Borough it is expec ted that 
the number of overnight stays will increase. STEAM data from 2015 noted that 
Rossendale only has 268 visitor ‘beds’ distributed throughout the Borough, with no  P a g e  | 137  modern hotel space available.  Accordingly this Study  recommended that the Council 
shou ld prioritise overnight accommodation and look to promote delivery of a modern 
‘budget’ hotel to serve the Rossendale area.  
 
298 As well as encouraging a hotel for the Borough other overnight accommodation will 
be supported, including the provision of bed and tack along the bridleways, and 
camping and caravan sites. Accommodation is expected to be small scale and 
where appropriate could re -use existing buildings.   
 
Policy LT5: Equestrian Development  
Proposals for new, or extensions or alterations to exist ing, private or commercial 
equestrian facilities will be supported subject to the following criteria:  
 
 In the case of indoor facilities or commercial stables, priority is given to the re -
use and conversion of existing buildings or the proposal forms part of a farm 
diversification scheme;  
 The siting, design and materials would not have an unacceptable impact on 
visual amenity or the character of the area. They should be well related to 
existing trees, hedges or landscape features, avoiding prominent positio ns, and 
generally at least 30 metres away from neighbouring residential properties;  
 A small private development will involve no more than three horses. For 
development proposals involving more than three horses, the applicant should 
submit a statement with  the planning application detailing why accommodation 
of the size proposed is required;  
 Traditional designs will generally be the most appropriate, clad externally in 
timber and with an internal timber frame, with a maximum ridge height of 3.5 
metres for s tables. Tack rooms and hay stores should be part of the same 
building, and each should be of a similar size to an individual stable;  
 Any new or extended stables and associated infrastructure (including ménages, 
hard-standing, fencing and riding -arena) is o f a scale that is proportionate to 
the activity proposed;  
 Hard -standing areas, access tracks and sand paddocks should be of the 
minimum size necessary and should not encroach on the open countryside;  
 The design of storage or parking of horse boxes on site,  and fencing , is 
appropriate to the local vernacular and not suburban in appearance;  
 Sand paddocks/ménages will utilise existing ground levels unless absolutely 
necessary and should not appear built out of the ground and thus alien to the 
natural contours of the land;  
 
 
  P a g e  | 138   
 
 Floodlighting will be resisted particularly in the open countryside or close to 
residential properties. Where floodlighting is proposed, it should be designed to 
minimise light spillage from the lit area and ensure that protected species  will 
not be adversely affected;  
 The site has adequate vehicle access and the proposal would not have an 
unacceptable impact on the local highway network and highway safety. The 
movement of horses or vehicles resulting from the siting of stables should not  
create danger to horses and riders, or to other road users. Stables are best 
sited to have safe and convenient access to the bridleway network or minor 
roads, although existing bridleways should not become over -intensively used 
as a result of the developm ent; 
 The proposal meets appropriate national standards for horse welfare and 
management , such as those established by the British Horse Society , and 
should include details of effective land management to avoid over -grazing and 
run-off; 
 There should be prop er screening for car and horse -box parking and 
appropriate arrangements for the storage and disposal of manure which would 
not have an unacceptable impact on surface or ground -water or residential 
amenity; and  
 Provision is made for removing any equipment a nd re -instating the land once 
its use for horses is no longer required or where the stables and associated 
development have been unused for a period of at least six months within 10 
years of their completion.  
 
 
Expla nation  
299 Equestrian development is an accepted use in rural areas which can contribute 
towards the provision of recreation opportunities and diversify the rural economy. 
Whilst it  is acknowledged that equestrian development often requires a rural location, 
poorly designed and located equestria n facilities can have an adverse impact on 
amenity, the highways network and the character and landscape of rural areas.  
 
300 When assessing proposals for indoor facilities or commercial stables, preference will 
be given to locating such uses within existing buildings. To minimise the visual 
impact of proposals, the design, siting and scale of any new or extended stables and 
asso ciated infrastructure will be expected to be appropriate to its context and should 
not have an adverse impact on the visual amenity of its surroundings. Proposals will 
normally also need to be located an adequate distance from neighbouring residential 
properties to reduce any impact on amenity.  
  P a g e  | 139  301 Further consideration should be given to the implications of the proposals on the 
surrounding highway network. In particular, the siting of equestrian facilities should 
not create a danger to horses, riders or other road users. Stables and associated 
infrastructure should be sited with safe and convenient access to the local highway 
network and, where possible, direct connections to the local bridleway network.   
 
302 Proposals for equestrian development will al so be expected to demonstrate that they 
would provide an adequate standard of welfare for the horses. This will include 
ensuring that buildings are designed to meet the functional needs of horses and 
demonstrating that there is sufficient land.  
 
Policy LT6: Farm Diversification  
Proposals for farm diversification which require planning permission will be permitted 
on existing farm holdings provided that:  
 They would make a positive contribution to the continued viability of the farm 
holding;  
 They would ret ain or enhance the character of traditional farm buildings;  
 Where possible, the proposal re -uses existing buildings of substantial and 
permanent construction which are structurally sound and capable of conversion 
without major alterations , or the developm ent is well -related to existing 
buildings if no suitable buildings are available for re -use; 
 The agricultural diversification is subservient to the main agricultural use of the 
farm;  
 Wherever possible, they add value to produce of the farm or produced loca lly, 
or contribute to the tourism economy;  
 The scale and nature of the diversification proposals are appropriate for the 
location and would not have an unacceptable impact on residential amenity, 
landscape character, the enjoyment of the countryside or th e purposes of the 
Green Belt;  
 They do not require new dwellings within the rural area to support the 
enterprise;  
 They do not create extensive areas of hardstanding; and  
 The volume and type of traffic that would be generated is appropriate to the 
accessibi lity of the site and the standard of the local highway network.  
 
Explanation  
 
303 In order to ensure that agricultural businesses are sustainable and competitive, well -
conceived proposals relating to the diversification of farm businesses will be 
supported where it can help ensure the long -term viability of existing farm 
businesses and provide rural employment opportunities.    P a g e  | 140   
304 A wide range of types of development may be appropriate for diversification 
including farm shops, leisure and recreation uses, tourism related development, 
sporting activities and equestrian uses. A careful ba lance is however required to 
ensure that the scale and character of farm diversification proposals do not conflict 
with wider countryside objectives, introduce new amenity concerns or have a 
negative impact on the natural environment or the highways networ k. Existing 
buildings of substantial and permanent construction should be re -used, where 
possible, to provide any accommodation needed in association with alternative uses, 
provided that the character of traditional farm buildings can be retained or enhanc ed.  P a g e  | 141  Chapter 6: Transport  
 
Strategic Policy TR1:  Strategic Transport  
Opportunities to enhance the Borough’s external and internal connectivity will 
be actively supported. Proposals which reduce the need to travel will also be 
encouraged.  Working closely with partners inside and outside the Borough, 
focus will be on the following:  
 Improving links to Greater Manchester and the M60/M62 , and 
enhancements to the A56;  
 Developing the potential of the East Lancashire Railway for both 
transport a nd tourism purposes;  
 Developing the strategic cycle network (Valley of Stone 
Greenway/National Cycle Route 6) including links between the different 
routes and to neighbouring authorities;  
 Addressing congestion hotspots identified in the Highway Capacity 
Study, especially the gyratory in Rawtenstall;  
 Promoting sustainable transport solutions to address congestion and 
air pollution;  
 Addressing known road safety issues;  
 Integrating transport more effectively into proposals to improve the 
public realm where th ere are opportunities to do so, for example, the 
area outside Bacup Library and pedestrian links between Rawtenstall 
Railway Station and town centre; and  
 Ensuring development that generates significant movement is located 
where the need to travel will be minimised and the use of sustainable 
transport modes can be maximised.   
A site for “Park and Ride” facilities will be protected at Ewood Bridge and is 
shown on the Policies map.  
 
Explanation  
305 The Council will explore opportunities to enhance the Borough’s external and internal 
connectivity. Rossendale has high levels of out -commuting to neighbouring 
authorities for work, with levels being particularly high to Rochdale, Bury and 
Burnley. Peak ho ur congestion on the M66 is an increasing problem not only for car 
drivers but also for bus passengers and for the movement of goods.  The Council will 
continue to work with partners inside and outside the Borough to improve links to 
Greater Manchester and  the M60/M62.  The development of the “Expressway”  P a g e  | 142  concept to the A56 corridor will also be supported as part of a broader approach to 
creating an enhanced “Central Pennine route” , as identified by Transport for the 
North.  
 
306 Traffic congestion in Rossendale is most pronounced around the gyratory in 
Rawtenstall but is also evident from Crawshawbooth into Rawtenstall, Haslingden 
Tesco roundabout, in Waterfoot and Stacksteads.  The Council will continue to work 
with Lancashire Co unty Council and the Highways Agency to identify funding and 
implement solutions for key junctions identified in the Highway Capacity Study. It will 
also support the Highway Authorities to ensure the effective management of the 
A56/M66 corridor and the mai n road network within the Borough.   
 
307 The Council supports the use of sustainable transport solutions with overall low 
impact on the environment including public transport, walking and cycling, low 
emission vehicles and car sharing.  In relation to rai l travel, opportunities will 
continue to be explored to develop the potential of the East Lancashire Railway.  The 
railway will continue to be safeguarded as a commuter and heritage railway 
operation, together with the protection of “Park and Ride” facilit ies at Ewood Bridge, 
subject to further studies being undertaken. Rossendale’s strategic cycle network will 
continue to be developed including improving links between the different routes and 
to neighbouring authorities . More information on this is provide d in the Footpaths, 
Cycleways and Bridleways Policy below.  The Council recognises that bus services 
play an important role in moving people within Rossendale and to nearby areas. A 
new bus station is currently being built in Rawtenstall as part of the Spi nning Point 
development and the Council will explore other opportunities to improve bus 
services.  
 
308 The Council will seek to ensure that appropriate transport solutions are integrated 
into developments and towns where there are opportunities to do so i n order to 
facilitate safe and easy access for all. Opportunities to reduce casualties, especially 
among vulnerable users, will be pursued wherever possible.  
 
309 Planning policies in this Local Plan seek to balance the location of land uses within 
Rossen dale so that journey lengths can be minimised for employment, shopping, 
leisure, education and other activities. The Council will also seek to ensure that new 
development that generates significant movement are located where the need to 
travel will be mini mised and the use of sustainable transport modes can be 
maximised.  
 
 
 
  P a g e  | 143   
Policy TR2: Footpaths, Cycleways and Bridleways  
The Council will support the development and enhancement of a strategic Public 
Rights of Way network including enhancements to surfac ing, signage , supporting 
facilities,  and feeder routes. Key routes are shown on the Policies Map and include:  
 The “Valley of Stone Greenway” (Rawtenstall to Rochdale) ; 
 National Cycle Route 6 (Bury -Accrington) ; 
 Rawtenstall to Clowbridge Reservoir ; 
 Pennine Bridleway (Mary Townley Loop) ; and  
 Irwell Sculpture Trail/ Rossendale Way.  
 
Proposals to improve, extend or add to the existing footpath, cycleway and bridleway 
network in the Borough and in new development will be supported providing they:  
a) Are integrated with existing routes to facilitate access on foot, by bicycle and by 
horse;  
b) Where  appropriate,  identify  gaps  in  the  existing  network  and  map  potential  
new  link  routes, particularly in areas where there is a high level of demand;  
c) Facilitate ac cess to the network of footpaths, bridleways and cycleways by 
requiring new development adjacent to existing pedestrian, bridleway or cycle 
routes to provide direct, safe and secure links to these routes where possible.  
d) Do not harm residential amenities;  
e) Do not harm nature conservation interests;  
f) Take into account the needs of agriculture;  
g) Are located and designed to minimise the risk of crime;  
h) Have regard to the needs of people with impaired mobility;  
i) Have regard to other users of the route and vehicular traffic ; and  
j) The development would not reduce, sever or adversely affect the use, amenity 
or safety of a Public Right of Way (PROW), or prejudice the planned 
development of the network, if acceptable provision is made to mitigate those 
effects, or divert o r replace the right of way before the development 
commences.  Any replacement or diverted PROW must be no less convenient 
or safe, and of no lower quality than the facility being replaced;  
 
Where developments are directly related to the PROW  network contri butions may be 
sought for their enhancement.  
 
Explanation  
 
310 The Borough’s public footpaths and cycleways are a valued recreational resource 
which form an essential component of Rossendale’s Green Infrastructure network 
resource and play an important role in linking the settlement s to the nearby 
countryside. They al so perform an important role in improving physical and emotional  P a g e  | 144  health. Although Rossendale has the densest PROW  network in Lancashire, much of 
the network is in a poor condition and there is an identified need to develop, extend, 
upgrade and improve access to the network.  
 
311 The strategic PROW  network is particularly important in Rossendale. It is an essential 
asset within the Borough’s tourism offer and a valued resource for local communities. 
Proposals which support the development and enhancement of this strategic network 
will therefore be encouraged and supported. The Pennine Bridleway forms part of a 
national  trail for horse riders and other users. National Cycle Route 6 is part of a 
national route but suffers from a number of gaps and sections are in poor condition. 
The “Valley of Stone Greenway” forms a strategic cycling corridor and will integrate 
with the proposed leisure facilities and link  to the established  “Outdoor Rossendale”  
mountain biking facility at Lee Quarry.  
 
312 The wider network of footpaths and cycleways also has a vital role in providing access 
from the existing settlements  into the surrou nding countryside, encouraging 
sustainable travel options and contributing towards the creation of healthy 
communities. Proposals for development will therefore be expected to support the 
development and enhancement of the wider network of footpaths and cy cleways. 
Development proposals which affect recognised Public Rights of Way should, in the 
first instance, seek to incorporate existing routes satisfactorily within the proposal. 
Where this is not possible, the Council will expect proposals to provide adeq uate 
alternative arrangements through the appropriate diversion of existing routes. The 
Council will also seek to ensure that development proposals make appropriate 
provision for pedestrians and cyclists within the development and also, where 
practicable, provide links to the wider footpath and cycle network  and improve 
supporting facilities such as secure cycle parking.   
 
Policy TR3: Road Schemes and Development Access  
Permission will not be granted for any development on land which:  
 
1)  Is required to allow road access to a site allocated on the Policies Map for 
development; or  
2)  Will prejudice the construction of identified road schemes.  
 
Explanation  
 
313 The Council work with Lancashire County Council, the Highways Agency and oth er 
Partners to support the development of identified road schemes and ensure 
appropriate access is provided for new development and sites allocated in the Local 
Plan.  As such, permission will not be granted for any development on land which is 
required to  allow road access to a site allocated on the Policies map for development 
i.e. which could form a ransom strip or on land that would prejudice the construction 
of identified road schemes.   P a g e  | 145   
Policy TR4: Parking  
All proposals for new development will be required to meet the parking standards set 
out within Appendix 1. These standards are not maximum standards and should be 
implemented unless the applicant can provide an evidence based approach as to why 
a different level of provision would be appropriate, to the satisfaction of the Local 
Highway Authority.  
 
Where parking is being provided to serve new development or to address specific local 
parking problems in existing residential and business areas,  including in 
Crawshawbooth,  the Council will expect the parking provision to:  
 Be conveniently located in relation to the development it serves;  
 Be safe, secure and benefit from natural surveillance;  
 Be designed to ensure that the use of the parking provision wo uld not prejudice 
the safe and effective operation of the highway network;  
 Not dominate the street scene or detract from the character of the area;  
 Incorporate secure, covered cycle parking in line with the Parking Standards 
set out in the Local Plan unle ss otherwise agreed;  
 Where appropriate, incorporate adequate soft landscaping and permeable 
surfaces to avoid the over -dominance of parking and to limit surface water run -
off;and  
 Incorporate electric vehicle charging points, in the following scenarios as 
minimum:  
o One charger per every five apartment dwellings;  
o One charger per every individual new house on all residential 
developments;  
o One charger per every ten parking spaces in non -residential car parks.  
 
Exceptions to the minimum provision  of electric ch arging points will only be considered 
if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council that this is not technically 
feasible or prohibitively expensive.  
 
Proposals to redevelop existing garage colonies will only be supported where:  
 It has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council that the garage 
colony is vacant or underused and there is unlikely to be any future demand for 
the facility; and  
 The redevelopment of the site would not result in a significant increase in on -
street parking which would have an adverse impact on the street scene or on 
highway safety.  
 
  P a g e  | 146   
 
Explanation  
 
314 The availability of parking can have a significant effect on people’s choice of travel 
mode. Restricting levels of parking in new development in locations where alternative 
travel choices are available can help reduce car usage and promote the use of other 
more sustainable fo rms of transport. Given the existing and projected levels of traffic 
congestion in key locations in the Borough it is important that parking standards 
promote sustainable modes of travel but also address local parking issues. 
Nevertheless, the provision of  inadequate car parking can exacerbate existing parking 
problems and can result in excessive levels of on -street parking which adversely 
affects local amenity and the efficiency and safety of the highways network, particularly 
in areas where there are limi ted public transport services.  
 
315 Parking standards that apply to all new development, including changes of use,  are 
set out in Appendix 1. Therefore, when identifying the appropriate level of parking to 
be provided in new development, the Council will h ave regard to the accessibility of 
the site by all means of transport and existing parking conditions in the vicinity of the 
site. 
 
316 The design and layout of car parking provision needs to be carefully considered to 
ensure that it is safe, easy to use, does not detract from the street scene and is well 
integrated into  the overall development and/or the surrounding area. The provision of 
appropriate landscaping can minimise the visual impact of parked vehicles and also 
reduce surface water run -off. All ca r parking areas should however be open to natural 
surveillance and any landscaping should avoid compromising personal safety or 
facilitating car crime. Incorporating charging points for electric vehicles in new parking 
areas can encourage the uptake of ele ctric vehicles and help achieve a number of 
associated environmental benefits, including reduced contributions to climate change 
and improvements to air quality.  
 
317 Within the Borough there are a number of garage colonies that provide valuable off -
road p arking for nearby residential properties. The redevelopment of these areas will 
however be supported where it is demonstrated that the facilities are underused, have 
reached the end of their operational usefulness and that the redevelopment of the site 
would not have an unacceptable impact on the on -street parking, the street scene or 
highway safety.  
 
318 Provision for retail centre parking will be supported where this is part of a balanced 
strategy to enhance access for shoppers. In particular, the Council  will encourage the 
provision of dedicated off -street provision in the centre of Crawshawbooth.  A site for 
this is shown on the Policies Map.   P a g e  | 147  Monitoring  
319 The process of monitoring, evaluation and review is essential to the delivery of the 
Local Plan. It provides the main mechanism for reviewing the implementation of the 
Local Plan and evaluating the effects and outputs of policies. Without this it will be 
impossible to determine whether policies are having their intended effect, or for the 
council to have the evidence base it requires to prepare future planning policies and 
make decisions.  
320 Monitoring of local planning policies has traditionally been und ertaken as part of the 
Council’s Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) process. This is an annual report prepared 
by the Council to show progress with Local Plan preparation, activity relating to duty 
to cooperate and show how the implementation of policies withi n the Local Plan are 
progressing.  Previous reports can be found here: 
https://www.rossendale.gov.uk/downloads/download/10832/authority_monitoring_rep
orts 
321 Whilst amendments to national planning regulations and guidance has removed the 
specific requirement for local authorities to prepare and submit an AMR it retains the 
overall duty for authorities to monitor conditions within their area and report on th ese 
at least annually. The requirements of what such a report must contain are described 
under regulation 34 of the Town and Country Planning (Local Pl an) (England) 
Regulations 2012.  
322 In line with the above regulations, the Council will monitor the impl ementation and 
delivery of the Local Plan and take action where targets are not being achieved. This 
will be set out in the AMR, which the Council will annually publish on its website  
323 This monitoring framework has been informed by the monitoring indica tors proposed 
by the Sustainability Appraisal (SA) process and, where appropriate, it has sought to 
use similar indicators, utilising existing processes and data collection.  
324 Indicators have been selected based on their appropriateness for gauging the 
effectiveness of Local Plan policies. The choice of specific indicators is dependent 
upon the availability of data and it is possible that this could change over time. The 
specific indicators used will therefore be reviewed on a regular basis and removed, 
changed or added to as appropriate. Any change to the indicator s et will be shown in 
the AMR.  
325 As will be the case for other local authorities and in line with Government priorities, the 
two most significant monitoring topics will be housing delivery a nd provision of 
employment and further details on both of these is set out below.  
 
  P a g e  | 148  Housing Monitoring  
326 The Council already report on a number of housing delivery indicators directly to the 
Government on a quarterly and annual basis.  These data return s are known as the 
“P2” and “Housing Flows Reconciliation” (HFR).  The P2 statistics are publicly 
available and report on the number of starts and completions of new build properties 
per quarter.  This only includes those completions overseen by local auth ority 
building control officers and does not include conversions and change of use.  The 
HFR data is collected annually and provides the total number of additional dwellings 
delivered in each local authority, including dwellings created through conversions , 
change of use and permitted development rights by all building control providers 
(minus any demolitions and other losses of residential properties).  This shows how 
many new dwellings have been added to the existing housing stock each year and 
informs th e Housing Delivery Test11 (HDT)  
327 Additionally, this Monitoring Framework identifies a number of other indicators and 
targets through which the future delivery of housing in the district will be monitored. 
Trigger points have also been identified. These describe the situations through which 
monitoring of indicators has reported a continued failure to deliver the identified 
targets and where delivery of the Local Plan is in jeopardy. Where monitoring reveals 
that the trigger points have been activated appr opriate action will need to be taken 
by the council to ensure implementation of the plan and avoid unintended 
consequences. Proposed action measures are identified in the Monitoring Table 1 1 
under Policy HS1.  
328 In line with the requirements of paragraph 48 of the national Planning Practice Guide 
(PPG), t he following trigger points will be monitored:  
  Shortfall in 5 year supply of greater than 1 year; and  
  Alignment to the requirements of the Housing Deliver y Test (HDT): 45% below 
annual requirement from November 2019 (as published in February 2020), 65% 
below annual requirement from November 2020.  
329 Together the two trigger points provide an important measure for monitoring 
performance of the Plan and the  delivery of housing and where triggered will highlight 
the need for immediate action. Actions include the identification of potential causes for 
the variant in performance and the identification of measures to address them.  
330 Measures  include working with key providers, developers and landowners to better 
manage the delivery of development (this will include reviewing Section 106 
Agreements and other contributions where appropriate and where their delivery has 
put into question the delivery of sites); identification of potential funding opportunities 
that might be available to facilitate development; implementation of a new call for sites 
to facilitate the identification of additional supply; a review of capacity assumptions via 
                                                           
11 The Housing Delivery Test is an annual meas urement of housing delivery in the area, looking at housing 
completions over the previous three years: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing -delivery -test  P a g e  | 149  the Strategic Housing La nd Availability Assessment (SHLAA); and where necessary 
a review of the Local Plan.  
Housing Delivery Test  
331 The NPPF and supporting PPG make clear that if the housing falls below the 
housing requirement then certain policies within the NPPF will apply de pending on 
the level of delivery:  
  The publication of an action plan if housing delivery falls below 95%  
  A 20% buffer on the authorities 5 year supply if delivery falls below 85%; and  
  The presumption in favour of sustainable development if housi ng falls below 
75% once the transitional arrangements described in Annex 1 of the NPPF have 
ended.  
332 As a consequence of previous shortfalls in delivery, in line with NPPF, the Council 
have prepared a Housing Delivery Test Action Plan. 
https://www.rossendale.gov.uk/downloads/download/11298/housing_action_plan , 
setting out ways in which it will boost housing delivery in future.  There is also a 
requir ement to provide an additional 20% buffer above the five year housing land 
requirement. Further details on this will be set out in the annual Five Year Housing 
Land Supply report:  
Economic Development Monitoring  
333 The Council will monitor the delivery of  employment land throughout the district 
through the preparation of the Annual Monitoring Report  
334 Should allocations not come forward for employment purposes then the Council will 
seek to investigate the reasons for why such opportunities are not being taken forward. 
These reasons may include changes in the market (either locally or nationally) or the 
presence of site specific constraints which are holding a site back from coming forward 
for its intended use. This will be investigated through ensuring th at the evidence 
relating to economic growth and employment land delivery is maintained in a robust 
and sound manner and is regularly refreshed.  
335 Subject to the reasons behind why a site has not come forward for its intended use (or 
why it is not likely  to come forward in a reasonable timeframe) a range of options will 
be available to the Council to address this. The Council will consider a direct and 
positive intervention to assist with its delivery through the purchase of land or through 
the provision of financial incentives or through permitting alternative uses on a site in 
the context of the most up -to-date national planning policy. Alternatively, the Council 
could seek to address the matter as part of the next Local Plan Review and seek to 
reallocat e the site for a more appropriate purpose. Whilst a range of options are 
available to the Council in this regard, it will be dependent on the scale, nature and 
context of the site to which option is considered suitable.   P a g e  | 150  Duty to Cooperate

Monitoring Framework  
343 The Framework in the below sets out in detail the specific indicators which will  be used 
to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the Local Plan, for both strategic 
and local policies.  It is acknowledged that it may not always be possible to 
meaningfully monitor every policy but, as far as possible, they will be regularly 
reviewed.  A number of specific trigger points have also been identified – these will 
prompt the need for targeted action in order to address any issues with the 
implementation of the policy or its intended outcome.  Unless otherwise indicated, the 
monitori ng period will be the financial year (1st of April to 31st March the following year).     P a g e  | 151

Appendix 1: Parking Standards  
General guidance  
The following Parking Standards apply to all new development and changes of use. 
The car parking standards may be amended subject to  site specific circumstances 
where this is substantiated by appropriate supporting evidence, such as through a 
Transport Assessment, to the satisfaction of the Highway Authority. The standards 
for cycles, mobility impaired and motorcycles are minimum stand ards and are based 
on net floor area  and all other standards are not to be considered maximum 
standards.  
 
Provision for electric car charging points should be made within new developments 
(see Policy TR4) including residential, employment, retail and leisure provision, to the 
satisfaction of the Highways Authority. Provision of charging points should be supplied 
as follows, as a minimum:  
 one charger per five apartment dwellings;  
 one charger per every individual new house on all residential developments ; 
 one charger per every ten parking spaces in non -residential car parks.  
 
Applicants will be expected to submit the attached Accessibility Questionnaire for all 
developments that require a full Transport Assessment. These thresholds are set out 
in the DfT document “Guidance on Transport Assessment” (2007). The Council will 
consider reductions in parking levels on sites which demonstrate good accessibility 
by other modes.  
 
Parking levels for all development should be considered as part of a broader 
appraisal  of accessibility to the site by all modes , with the aim of increasing use by 
walking, cycling and public transport , and reducing car use as promoted in PPG13 
“Transport”. Both the Design and Access Statement and any Transport Assessment 
should consider wi der access into the site; how walking and cycling links can be 
enhanced by good design and layout; existing on and off -street parking provision  P a g e  | 184  and usage in the vicinity of the development and , where appropriate , parking 
management measures.  
 
Travel Plans will be required at thresholds set out in DfT “Guidance on Transport 
Assessment” and will be expected to reflect latest good practice in developing an 
evidence base, setting targets and monitoring.  
 
Detailed Issues  
 
Cycling and motorcycles – provision for long stay parking (covered, secure) should 
be made at locations where users are likely to remain for more than 3 hours, such as 
employment sites with more than 30 staff. Other cycle and motorcycle parking 
should be secure (e.g. Sheffield stands), clearly s igned and close to the main 
entrance to the building.  
 
Cycle Parking should be based on 1 space per 10 car spaces . 
 
Motorcycle provision should be based on 1 space per 25 car spaces . 
 
A minimum of 1 space should be provided for developments with less than 10 
spaces . 
 
Mobility impaired – Provision should be made on the basis of 1 per 10 car spaces  
unless the developer can prove the need for less. Where this is the case the lowest 
level of provision acceptable would be the relevant figure from latest DfT guid ance. A 
minimum of 1 mobility impaired space should be provided for smaller 
developments . 
 
“Parent and child” spaces should form a proportion of the overall mobility impaired 
standard at retail and leisure uses.  
 
Covered, safe parking provision for mobili ty scooters should be made in new 
residential development where there is likely to be a high proportion of older or 
mobility impaired users.   P a g e  | 185   
Residential  – Garages will not be counted towards parking provision figures unless 
suitable evidence is provided. A creative approach should be taken to residential 
parking design building in principles in “Manual for Streets” (2007) to ensure that 
layouts are not car dominated.  
 
Provision should be made in family housing for secure provision for at least 2 cycles.   
 
Mixed use – provision should be based on the proportion of the different uses. The 
only exception to this would be where there are significantly different patterns of 
occupation by users; e.g. a school by day and leisure use in the evening , in which 
case the standard for the use with the highest demand should be used.  
 
Large open areas (e.g. Bulky goods warehouses) – parking levels should be reduced 
by 50% for large open areas.  
 
Town centre uses – New parking provision proposals should be assessed against 
the overall supply and management of private and public on and off -street parking. 
Suitable management arrangements should be utilised, e.g. to manage short stay 
parking stay periods in line with the broader town centre parking strategy.  
 
Uses not specifie d – These will be considered on a case by case basis. Developers 
will be expected to provide a clear rationale for the number of spaces provided.  
 
Design – The design of parking should be of a high quality, incorporating clear 
pedestrian routes and good si gnage. Larger car parks should incorporate design 
features to break up large areas of open space. Drainage should be sustainable 
wherever possible and incorporate oil traps to prevent damage to surface water 
systems.  
 
Coaches and Taxis – Pick up points for  taxis should be provided at retail 
developments of over 2 ,500m² and major leisure developments. Coach parking/drop 
off points should be provided as appropriate, e.g. at leisure destinations.  
  P a g e  | 186  Operational parking – Requirements for operational parking and servicing should be 
set out separately in the Transport Assessment .

Affordable Housing   
Affordable housing: housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by 
the market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership 
and/or is for essential local workers); and which complies with one or more of the 
following definitions:  
 
a) Affordable housing for rent: meets all of th e following conditions: (a) the rent is 
set in accordance with the Government’s rent policy for Social Rent or Affordable Rent, 
or is at least 20% below local market rents (including service charges where 
applicable); (b) the landlord is a registered provi der, except where it is included as part 
of a Build to Rent scheme (in which case the landlord need not be a registered 
provider); and (c) it includes provisions to remain at an affordable price for future 
eligible households, or for the subsidy to be recy cled for alternative affordable housing 
provision. For Build to Rent schemes affordable housing for rent is expected to be the 
normal form of affordable housing provision (and, in this context, is known as 
Affordable Private Rent).  
 
b) Starter homes: is as specified in Sections 2 and 3 of the Housing and Planning Act 
2016 and any secondary legislation made under these sections. The definition of a 
starter home should reflect the meaning set out in statute and any such secondary 
legislation at the time of pl an-preparation or decision -making. Where secondary 
legislation has the effect of limiting a household’s eligibility to purchase a starter home 
to those with a particular maximum level of household income, those restrictions 
should be used.  
 
c) Discounted m arket sales housing: is that sold at a discount of at least 20% below 
local market value. Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local 
house prices. Provisions should be in place to ensure housing remains at a discount 
for future eligib le households.  
  P a g e  | 192  d) Other affordable routes to home ownership: is housing provided for sale that 
provides a route to ownership for those who could not achieve home ownership 
through the market. It includes shared ownership, relevant equity loans, other low cost 
homes for sale (at a price equivalent to at least 20% below local market value) and 
rent to buy (which includes a period of intermediate rent). Where public grant funding 
is provided, there should be provisions for the homes to remain at an affordable  price 
for future eligible households, or for any receipts to be recycled for alternative 
affordable housing provision, or refunded to Government or the relevant authority 
specified in the funding agreement.
