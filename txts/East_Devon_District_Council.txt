 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
7 Chapter 1.  Introduction , evidence  and 
policies  
What the plan is and its production timetable ? 
1.1. The primary role of the local plan will be to guide and inform decisions on where 
development will take place in East Devon.  The Local Plan will be the key ‘turn to’ 
document that is used in determining planning applications.  
1.2. This plan is a draft of what we believe the final plan should look like and we are 
making it available for anyone to comment o n.  Consultation runs from 7 November 
2022 to 15 January 2023 .   Under the legal rules of local plan making this stage of 
work falls under Regulation 18  of the plan making regulations . 
1.3. We will take the comments received from the consultation and add these to  further 
assessment and evidence gathering that we are undertaking.  We may also  
undertake some further detailed consultation work on specific parts of the plan (still 
under Regulation 18 of the plan making rules)  at a later date.  From the plan 
consultati on and other work we will produce  a full revised version of the plan.  The 
intent is that the revised version of the plan will be made available for public 
comment in Autumn 2023 and the n the  revised plan  (its technical term is the 
‘Publication Plan ’ and i t will fall under Regulation 19 of the plan making regulations) , 
comments received  on it and other material will be sent to  the Planning 
Inspectorate .  A Planning Inspector  will undertake a formal examination of the plan 
and If and when they find it to be sound the plan can be adopted  by the Council, we 
hope this will be in 2024.   
1.4. The intent is that the East Devon Local Plan will cover the period from 1 April 2020 
to the 31 March 2040 .  Government  policy is that plans need to have an end date of 
at least 15 years from the date of plan adoption .   
Evidence to support the plan  
1.5. This plan is supported by a number of studies and evidence reports and we will 
continue gathering evidence to inform refinement of the plan after th is phase of  
consultation work is unde rtaken. Consultation feedback will be part of the evidence 
we will draw on to help with amendment s to the plan.   
1.6. We will be producing a report called a  sustainability appraisal (SA) that will 
accompany the draft plan (and later drafts of the plan) and it  will be available for 
public comment  at the same time as the draft plan .  
1.7. As plan making progresses we will also be undertaking assessment of the plan 
under the Habitat Regulations.  Assessment documents will inform policy redrafting East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
8 and be available and a ccompany the plan under any possible future consultations 
drafts and at and through the final stages of plan writing.  
1.8. We have established a schedule of evidence  on our web site and also include links 
to documents in this text.  
1.9. Future key evidence work will include  the commissioning of a whole plan viability 
assessment.  This assessment will consider the financial development val ues and 
returns that might be generated from development schemes to determine whether 
proposed planning policy can be implemented.  In simplified terms it will place a 
commercial cost against contributions sought under plan policy  (for example to pay 
for such matters as affordable housing or biodiversity improvements)  to determine if 
the levels or provision we are seeking are credible given the commercial value that 
any development scheme may deliver.  We have not yet undertaken the 
assessment work but in l ater drafts of the plan the work will help refine policy 
options and choices.  
Policies of the draft local plan  
1.10.  The local plan needs to have actual policies that are used in determining planning 
applications.  In this draft plan  we show policies  in green highlighted boxes .  In 
some cases policies offer suggested finished wording and in other cases we set out 
our broad approach that proposed policy will take , where, for example, we need to 
undertake further evidence gathering.  
The policies map 
1.11.  Some policies in the local plan apply to the whole of East Devon or to differing 
broad types of areas , references will be made  in policy wording.  However, there 
are also some policies that very specifically apply to precise boundaries or areas 
shown on a map.  The map we use is called a Policies Map and it will be referred to 
in policies to show where  spatially defined policies will apply.  
1.12.  Amongst the boundaries shown on the maps are areas of land that we identify as 
suitable for development.  We call these land areas f or development allocations .  
Strategic policies and non -strategic policies  
1.13.  In the plan we have differentiated between Strategic Policies and non -strategic 
policies.  The Government, in their National Planning Policy Framework, advises of 
the need for such a differentiation.   
1.14.  Strategic Policies  – set out the overarching approach and deal with major subject 
matters that are of fundamental importance to decision making  or which set a 
general tone .  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
9 1.15.  Non-strategic policies  – will typically add an extra layer of  detail to inform decision 
making.  
1.16.  Strategic  policies  are denoted with the word ‘Strategic’ in the title and all other 
policies are non -strategic.   Neighbourhood Plans and their policies can supersede 
non-strategic policies but they cannot supersede strat egic policies.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022

11 Chapter 2.  Vision and objective s 
2.1. The vision for the local plan is drawn directly from the new Council Plan as 
endorsed by East Devon District Council on the 20 October 2021.   
 
 
FIGURE 2.  East Devon District and neighbouring authorities .   
 
2.2. The Council P lan sets out the strategic direction of the council and priorities and 
actions to guide the effective use of all council resources.  Although the Council 
Plan looks into the future for a far shorter time period than the new local plan it is of 
strate gic overarching importance for Council work and is therefore seen as 
appropriate to set the agenda for local plan work.  
2.3. Drawing directly from the Council Plan the local plan vision is:  
To make a positive difference to residents’ lives and our environment i n East Devon.  
With three priorities:  
Better Homes and Communities  for all with a priority on the importance of good 
quality, affordable housing suitable in size and location.  
A Greener East Devon , which prioritises issues arising from climate change and 
supports our natural environment.  
A Resilient Economy  bringing prosperity to the district.  
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
12 2.4. From this vision  and expanding on this to draw out other themes in the Council Plan 
a series of objectives have been defined.   
2.5. The plan objectives set a framework  for the chapters and specifically the plan 
policies that follow .  The objectives are not in a priority order or ranking and no one  
carries any  more or less weight than any other .

  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
13 Chapter 3.  The spatial strategy  
Introduction  
 
3.1. The spatial strategy of the local plan is concerned with establishing an ove rarching 
picture of the amounts, types and distribution of future development that will be 
accommodated  in East Devon .  We set out an overarching strategic policy that 
addresses these matters.  
 
1. Strategic Policy – Spatial Strategy  
 
New development will be directed towards the most sustainable locations in East 
Devon, consistent with the spatial strategy to:  
 
 Focus new development on the western side of the district, including a new 
town  and other major strategic development s close to Exeter  
 Promote significant development at the Principal Centre of Exmouth and the 
Main Centres of Axminster, Honiton, Ottery St  Mary, Seaton, and Sidmouth to 
serve their own needs and that of the wider surrounding areas  
 Support development at the Local Centres of Broadclyst, Budleigh Salterton, 
Colyton, Lympstone, and Woodbury that meets local needs and those in the 
immediate surr ound ings 
 Allow limited development to meet local needs at the Service Villages of Beer, 
Branscombe, Broadhembury, Chardstock, Clyst St Mary, Dunkeswell, East 
Budleigh, Exton, Feniton, Hawkchurch, Kilmington, Musbury, Newton 
Poppleford, Otterton, Payhembury , Plymtree, Sidbury, Stoke Canon, Tipton St 
John, Uplyme, Westclyst, West Hill and Whimple.   
 
Settlements not listed above are considered to be ‘open countryside’ for the purposes 
of the Local Plan, where more restrictive planning policies apply.  
 
Justi fication for inclusion of the policy  
3.2. The Local Plan  should promote a sustainable pattern of development that seeks to 
align growth and infrastructure; and strategic policies should  set out an overall 
strategy for the pattern, scale and design quality of pl aces.1  Significant 
development should be focused on locations which are or can be made

Framework (publishing.service.gov.uk)  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
14 sustainable, through limiting the need to travel and offering a genuine choice of 
transport modes.  This helps to reduce congestion and carbon dioxide emissions, 
and im prove air quality and public health.  However, opportunities to maximise 
sustainable transport will vary between urban and rural areas.2 
3.3. In rural areas , which  form large parts of East Devon,  national policy states that 
housing should be located where it wi ll enhance or maintain the vitality of rural 
communities; and policies should identify opportunities for villages to grow and 
thrive, especially where this will support local services.  Where there are groups of 
smaller settlements, development in one vill age may support services in a village 
nearby.3    
3.4. A key part of the spatial strategy is to outline the settlement hierarchy, grouping 
settlements together where they share similar characteristics and placing them in 
different tiers.  Settlements with a hig her population and a greater range of jobs, 
community facilities and services serving a wide area are placed at the top of the 
settlement hierarchy; whilst smaller settlements that have fewer jobs and facilities 
perform a more local, but still important, r ole are grouped lower down the hierarchy.  
Evidence in  ‘The Rol e and Function of Settlements’ considers these factors.4 
3.5. Exmouth has a significantly higher population, number of jobs, and level of 
community services and facilities that distinguish it as the  ‘principal centre’ in East 
Devon.  The six ‘main centres’ benefit from a range of jobs along with strategic and 
local facilities, serving both the settlement and wider surrounding area – in 
Cranbrook’s case some of these facilities are planned to be deliv ered in the coming 
years.  The five ‘local centres’ perform an important local role, with reasonable 
levels of population and jobs; and a smaller selection of strategic facilities alongside 
all or most local facilities.   
3.6. A further 23 settlements have a re latively good range of local facilities either in the 
settlement or nearby, and are ‘service villages’ for both the settlement and 
immediate surrounding rural area.  For the purposes of the Local Plan, all other 
settlements are considered to be ‘open count ryside’ where more restrictive planning 
policies apply.  Nevertheless , development can come forward in these places  in 
certain circumstances , such as rural exception sites, community -led development 
(for example through a neighbourhood plan), and rural wor kers dwellings.

3.7. Despite being a Main Centre, Cranbrook is not addressed in this local plan as 
things stand as a Cranbrook specific p lan was adopted in autumn  2022 and the 
Cranbrook Plan will oversee its development until this local plan and the Cranbrook 
Plan are superseded by a new plan or plans that will be produced, probably in the 
late 2020s or early 2030s. We had envisage d that so me policies in the existing local 
plan that apply to the Cranbrook Plan area would be saved and remain in p lace in 
respect to determination of planning applications at Cranbrook.  An alternative 
approach would be to apply some of the policies of this plan t o Cranbrook where 
the Cranbook Plan does not cover the relevant issue, however it would be important 
to ensure that in so doing we do not undermine the viability of the Cranbrook Plan. 
Views are sought on this issue.

16 2. Strategic Policy – Housing distri bution  
New housing will be distributed across East Devon in accordance with the table below.  
The housing numbers are gross and relate to the period 2020 to 2040, the new town has a 
longer term vision that takes into account the likely timescale for deliv ery and will see 
development of an extra 5,500 homes beyond 2040 .

The Grand total, above, does not include projected future windfalls. Including the windfalls 
would add around an extra 2,335 dwellings to the ove rall grand total.   Cranbrook supply 
figures are mostly allocations in the Cranbrook Plan  and the 4,170 figure is not actually a 
preferred site it is an adopted Development Plan Document figure . 
 
Justification for inclusion of the policy  
3.8. Much of the weste rn side of East Devon has seen considerable levels of 
development in recent years .  This general pattern of development is set to 
continue through existing commitments to development and also through proposals 
in this Local Plan . 
3.9. Over the plan period of 20 20 to 2040 the western side of East Devon, close to the 
city of Exeter, will see roughly half of all new homes built with the other half across 
the rest of East Devon . 
3.10.  In this new plan we are also proposing relatively large amounts of growth and 
developmen t in and around the Principal Centre and Main Centres, with lower 
levels of development typically at Local Centres and Service Villages. Village 
growth is primarily geared towards meeting more local needs and seeking to make 
these settlements more self -sustaining , as set out in Strategy 1 .  The outstanding 
open countryside and coastal qualities that characterise much of our District will be 
protected by ensuring development is only allowed in these areas in limited, locally 
justified circumstances.  
3.11.  The dist ribution strategy responds to the environmental constraints that exist over 
many of the eas tern parts of East Devon .  Western parts  of East Devon , as you get 
closer to the city of Exeter , are typically far less constrained.  The western side of 
the D istrict has  seen strong market demand, both for housing and new employment East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
18 opportunities and job s growth and there  are also high levels of jobs and services 
and facilities in Exeter itself.  The se strong functional links between the western  
side of East Devo n and Exeter reinforce the  logic for new development close to the 
City boun dary.  
Levels of future housing p rovision  
‘Delivering a sufficient supply of homes’ is an NPPF policy theme. The NPPF 
requires Local Plans to identify and meet as a minimum the objectively assessed 
development needs for their area. The purpose of this strategic policy is to set out 
what the housing development requirements  are for East Devon  for the plan period . 
This is central to the council ’s ‘plan, monitor and manage’ approach  to housing 
development . 
 
3. Strategic Policy - Levels of future housing development  
 
1. The Local Planning Authority will plan, monitor and manage the delivery of housing 
development in accordance with the spatial strategy  and the site allocations set out in 
this plan, and other adopted or made Development Plan Documents in the district. 
Housing provision will be made for at least 18,920 dwellings (net) to be delivered in the 
plan area in the plan period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2040, whereby:  
a. At least 4,070 (net) new homes should be affordable  housing ; and  
b. At least 14,850 (net) should be market housing.   
2. The annualised district housing requirement for 5 -year housing land supply and housing 
trajectory purposes will be 946 dw ellings per year (net). The housing trajectory will be 
illustrated in an Appendix and the 5 -year land supply forecast at the anticipated point of 
plan adoption will be set out in  an Appendix  in the plan . 
3. Provision will be made for a supply headroom of appr oximately 10% to provide housing 
supply flexibility in the district in the plan period. For the avoidance of doubt, this does 
not uplift the net housing provision requirement in this policy.  
4. The Local Planning Authority will balance the aspiration to maxim ise the delivery of 
residential development on previously developed land with:  
a. The need to maintain housing supply; and  
b. This plan’s policies for other development to deliver the plan objectives and 
spatial strategy.  
5. Provision will be made in the district for at least 10 % of housing supply over the plan 
period to be met on small and medium sized sites.  
6. To meet the affordable housing requirement, provision will be made in the district over 
the plan period for a mix of affordable housing types to be delivered  through 
development in accordance with Policies on Housing to Address Needs and Affordable 
Housing . 
7. To support the Plan objectives and delivery of the housing requirement, the Local 
Planning Authority will monitor and manage housing development in accorda nce with 
the monitoring framework and contingency measures. The following housing supply East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
19 sources for Use Class C3 (Residential Dwellings)  units  and Use Class C2 (Residential 
Institutions) unit  equivalents will count towards meeting the housing provision 
requirement:  
a. Completions  
b. Planning commitments from planning approvals  
c. Local Plan allocations  
d. Cranbrook Plan allocations  
e. Windfalls and Neighbourhood Plan allocations  
 
8. Policy will set out the housing provision requirements for designated neighbourhood 
areas i n East Devon as follows:

requested to do so by the neighbourhood planning body.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
3.12.  The local plan aligns with the Council Plan ’s expressed priority for robust policy in 
the local plan to address the need for more and better -quality homes and 
communities for all. The Council Plan does not determine how much housing 
growth will be planned for in the district.  It is the role of the local plan to determine 
the amount of housing development in the plan period in East Devon. The plan 
does this through a policy on the levels of future housing development,  covering 
total provision for the plan period and breaking down that provision.  
3.13.  We see it as key that the local plan quantifies the actual overall levels of house 
building that will be provided in East Devon through  plan policy.  
3.14.  Government policy is that  the local plan should establish the amount of housing 
provision by including a strategic policy  to set a housing requirement figure for the 
whole plan area for the plan period . This policy is therefore identified as a Strategic East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
20 Policy that would enable th e local plan to fulfil this role  and express  the council’s  
commitment to the level of housing growth to be provided for in the plan period.  
3.15.  The amount of housing provision is established in line with the presumption in 
favour of sustainable development as it applies to plan -making. This is so that a 
sufficient amount and variety of land can come forward where it is needed. The 
policy is consistent with and helps to deliver the local plan’s vision and objectives. It 
aligns with the overall spatial strategy. Through housing delivery, it supports the 
economic vision and strategy underpinning the plan.  
 
FIGURE 4.  Considered dwellings at Clyst St George  
3.16.  The policy  makes sufficient provision for housing (including affordable housing) to 
meet objectively assessed housing n eed. Setting this out as a minimum net housing 
requirement over the plan period for the whole plan area is in line with the NPPF. In 
doing so, the policy aligns with and supports the Government’s objective for 
‘significantly boosting the supp ly of homes’ a s set out in NPPF . 
In summary  
3.17.  The policy requirement for provision of at least 18 ,920 dwellings in the district in the 
plan period is justified by evidence of local housing need  based on the Standard 
Method, using the latest ONS statistics . To be sufficien tly flexible  and provide 
‘headroom’ , forecast supply in East Devon should be 10% above that figur e. That 
equates to about 20,8 00 dwellings. At this time, we forecast that there is potential to 
deliver  approximately  20,441 dwellings in the plan period from  the supply 
categories we count towards meeting the requirement plus headroom . This includes 
the potential sites being considered in policies 8, 17, and 19 to 26 in this draft plan . 
The forecast potential supply meets the minimum housing requirement of 18, 920 
dwellings , and would provide about 8 % ‘headroom’ .  The Council will keep this 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
21 matter under review, as the plan and its site allocations progress through plan -
making  
3.18.  The affordable housing requirement of 4,070  dwellings is justified by  the latest  
eviden ce of affordable housing need5. This amount of affordable housing would be  
consistent with national planning policy towards : meeting local housing need; and 
achieving 25% of affordable dwellings as First Homes and 10% of dwellings on 
qualifying sites being  affordable home ownership. The current evidence indicates  
there are realistic prospects of delivering about 3,551 affordable dwellings in the 
plan period , based on the affordable housing mix percentages set out in the policy 
in this plan on affordable ho using, and the percentages of affordable housing 
required on qualifying sites. Affordable housing delivered on Rural Exceptions site s, 
First Homes Exception Sites and Neighbourhood Plan allocations would also add to 
the supply .  Detailed explanation of thi s is set out in an interim Housing Topic 
Paper.  
3.19.  More affordable housing could  be delivered as follows:  
 If evidence demonstrates that a higher percentage of affordable housing 
required on qualifying sites were to be viable,  The Council will keep this 
matter  under review as viability evidence becomes available; and/ or 
 If additional sites  were to be allocated in the local plan, where those sites 
meet the qualifying criteria for requiring affordable housing and remained 
viable.  The Council will keep this matter  under review, as the plan and its site 
allocations progress through plan -making.   
 
                                            
 
 
5 Based  on the scale of affordable housing in Sensitivity Test 3 shown in Figure 57 in the East 
Devon Local Housing Need Assessment 2022.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
22  
FIGURE 5.  Homes under construction.  
3.20.  These conclusions depend on sites being allocated  in the local plan  and a reality 
check is needed, through the forthcoming overall local plan vi ability assessment. 
Plan making will keep these matters under review.  
3.21.  The illustrative housing trajectory and 5 -year supply analysis will be included in the 
plan when the relevant evidence is available. Likewise, the percentage of housing 
on small and medi um sized sites will be identified  to inform the Publication Plan. 
3.22.  This proposed scale and mix of housing is largely driven by Government policy and 
guidance aimed at boosting housing growth.  To be found sound t he policy must be 
consistent with Government planning policy. Nevertheless, the Council must still  
justify the policy approach and its details.   
3.23.  The policy relies on substantial and complex evidence which the Council uses to 
justify the policy content. W e are aware that th e amount an d type of eviden ce can 
be overwhelming. Ev en a concise, non -technical  outline expla nation of its use  to 
justify the policy  may be off-putting for some readers.  However, it is essential that 
there is full opportunity at this consultation stage to ensure that the explanati on of 
the policy is part of the consultation process .  
3.24.  The Council intends to produce a Housing Need, Supply and Requirement topic 
paper as  an audit trail documen t for the Publication Plan stage . This will  provide a 
detailed narrative showing  how the Counc il takes account of national policy and 
uses evidence to justify th is local plan policy . It will signpost the relevant information 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
23 in the documents  which provide the evidence  and highligh t the conclusions which 
the Council relies on to justify the policy ’s content.  
3.25.  To foster greater engagement with plan -making at this stage we have limited the 
reasoned justification text for this policy in this draft plan to just the strategic 
headlines. We’ve explained more fully how we justify this policy in a separate 
technical evidence document  – The 2022 Housing Need, Supply and Requirement 
Interim Topic Paper . That document is available in the local plan evidence base6 to 
aid understanding and enable  consultee responses on the policy to be made in the 
light of that evi dence at this consultation stage.  
3.26.  The supporting text of a policy consists of a reasoned justification and any 
descriptive or explanatory material for the policy.  At the Publication Plan stage, it 
will be necessary for the plan to include the reasoned jus tification specific to the 
clauses in this policy.  The Council expects that this will focus on justifying:  
 
 The level of housing provision requirement for East Devon for the plan period 
and the use of evidence, including:  
o The level of East Devon Local Ho using Need; and  
o Our forecast of housing supply and whether this is sufficient to meet the 
housing requirement  
 The annualised housing requirement  
 The supply headroom  
 The approach to use of previously developed land for housing  
 The percentage of housing on small and medium sized sites  
 The approach to monitoring and 5 -year land supply  
 The affordable housing provision requirement for East Devon for the plan 
period and the use of evidence, including:  
o The level of East Devon Affordable Housing Need; and  
o Our fore cast of affordable housing supply and whether this is sufficient to 
meet the affordable housing requirement  
 The housing requirements for Designated Neighbourhood Plan Areas.  
Housing provision requirements in Designated Neighbourhood 
Areas  
3.27.  To date, through local plan production work, the Council has not received requests 
from any Neighbourhood Planning Group for a housing provision requirement figure 
for the Designated Neighbourhood Area.  However, Government policy requires 
that local plan policy sets out h ousing requirements for all Designated 
Neighbourhood Areas. There are currently 40 Designated Neighbourhood Areas in 
                                            
 
 
6 Emerging Local Plan - East Devon  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
24 East Devon. The Council intends to consult on the methodology to be used to 
identify the appropriate level of housing requirements. This pu blic consultation will 
be held prior to determining and justifying the housing requirements for each 
designated Neighbourhood Area to be set out in policy in the Publication Plan.  
3.28.  In line with Government policy, this strategic policy makes clear that the L ocal 
Planning Authority will provide an indicative figure when requested by the 
neighbourhood planning body, in those circumstances where it is not possible for 
the plan to provide a requirement figure. This would encompass Neighbourhood 
Areas that are des ignated after the Publication Plan is published.  
Future employment provision in East Devon  
3.29.  The local plan’s economic role is one of its three roles focused on achieving 
sustainable development. Through its economic role the plan contributes to building 
a resilient local economy aimed at providing economic prosperity for East Devon. It 
ensures that sufficient land of the right type is available in the right places and the 
right time to support growth, productivity and innovation. The plan identifies and 
coordinates development requirements to achieve this, including the provision of 
infrastructure.  
3.30.  The plan sets out the suite of preferred policies which together provide a clear 
economic vision and spatial economic development growth strategy for the District . 
They align with and support the spatial strategy and delivery of the plan’s vision and 
objectives.  
3.31.  The two proposed strategic polices address the strategic employment priorities of 
the area and any relevant cross -boundary issues.  The first covers the am ount of 
employment development provision in the plan period and the distribution of 
employment development. The second identify strategic site allocations where 
employment development is part of mixed uses.  
3.32.  These strategic policies provide a clear basis fo r the non -strategic employment 
policies set out in Cha pter 9. These will inform the determination of planning 
applications on employment and mixed -use development matters and will cover:  
 Employ ment development in built -up areas and the countryside  
 Farm Di versification  
 Retention of employment sites and premises   
 Employment and Skills Statements  
 Provision and retention of rural services and facilities  
 Town Centres and shopping areas  
 Green tourism  
 Visitor attractions  
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
25 Preferred Option for the approach to  economic growth  
 
The suite of plan policies  support development consistent with a resilient, 
inclusive, green economy, delivering growth and prosperity for the benefit of 
everybody in the District. They are orientated to meeting the needs for growth 
and c hange in East Devon and to ensuring the highest quality development 
outcomes. This preferred option for economic growth reflects the direction of 
travel towards delivering productivity through clean and inclusive growth 
promoted by the Heart of the South W est Local Industrial Strategy.  
3.33.  In this preferred approach, economic growth remains coupled with prosperity. This 
means that the drive to support innovation, greater productivity and investment to 
deliver economic growth, as measured by GDP/GVA, is also sh aped by the 
opportunity to transform  the economy through green and inclusive growth. It 
incorporates the concept of sustainable development regarding economic, social 
and environmental objectives, aligned with  the NPPF.  
3.34.  The economic vision and spatial eco nomic development growth strategy provide 
guidance to the local plan on the provision of employment land necessary to meet 
the economic growth opportunities, challenges and options faced by the District. 
This is distinct from other economic development act ivities such as inward 
investment promotion, business support and skills development which, though 
complementary, would be dealt with through separate work -streams within the 
District Council and in collaboration with partners.  
3.35.  The following statements set  out the overarching elements of Economic Vision and 
Economic Strategy which, in combination, the detailed policies convey and support.  
They align with the plan’s preferred approach to economic growth. These 
statements elaborate on and develop the Plan’s overall vision for East Devon, and 
expand the strategic focus that directs the plan’s policies and proposals.   
Economic Vision  
3.36.  Our vision is to develop a resilient, competitive economy where local residents can 
access a choice of employment providing inco me comparable with national levels, 
and afford decent housing that meets their needs. Development will be 
concentrated at places where jobs and homes can be brought together to improve 
settlement self -containment. Supporting both established and emerging s ectors, the 
Local Plan enables businesses to have the flexibility to transform and adapt to 
changing markets and harness new technologies.  Strengthening residents’ access 
to high quality education and training provision enables them to have the right skil ls 
to access new employment opportunities. Crucially, the policies and proposals in 
the Plan support our working age population to live and work locally whilst aiding 
the recovery and transformation of the local economy to a green economy, focused 
on makin g a major contribution to the transition to a net zero economy.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
26 Economic Strategy  
 
We will achieve this vision through a spatial economic development growth 
strategy which : 
 
 Creates conditions for a sustainable, inclusive and green economy 
delivering emplo yment growth  
 Secures high value and higher wage local employment, based on 
productivity  
 Improves East Devon residents’ access to employment  
 
 
3.37.  This will be achieved through:  
a. Securing and growing transformation sectors, fostering the transition to net zero,  
by 
 Supporting development of sectors that have a presence in East Devon or are 
attracted to the wider economic area of which East Devon is a part, and from 
which the East Devon economy and residents benefit . 
 Making flexible provision for development that s upports the introduction, 
expansion and relocation to East Devon of higher GVA sector businesses in 
identified transformational sectors, mindful of the expected benefits they 
should bring to the District through higher wages and skills development . 
 
b. Retaini ng and supporting the existing mix of sectors in East Devon which create a 
resilient economy, including those th at support community well -being.  
 
c. Planning to meet identified employment needs in the plan period, quantifying the 
overall amount of employment development (business uses) provision and retail 
development provision, expressed as minimum policy requirements . 
 
d. Providing the right land and premises in the right location to help businesses 
start, grow and flourish, by:  
 Identifying a range and choice of  employment sites to meet need and 
providing sufficient flexibility to respond to changing economic circumstances.   
 Making provision for start -up and incubation space, at suitable places to 
attract and support new sectors utilising new technologies and enc ouraging 
research expertise to develop . 
 Identifying a new generation of strategic employment sites . 
 Allocating sites and supporting the intensification and expansion of existing 
employment sites . 
 Robust testing of the viability of new employment land alloca tions prior to 
allocation, to strengthen the likelihood of delivery and new employment . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
27  Relying on realistic delivery mechanisms, principally private investment but 
with public sector intervention where this is necessary and can be resourced . 
 
e. Securing new e mployment space, mixed use development and targeted 
regeneration proposals that will result in greater self -containment of our market 
and coastal towns . 
 
f. Continuing to secure employment development opportunities in the western part 
of East Devon, reflectin g that area’s geographical advantages for business, 
including : 
 Supporting the Exeter and East Devon Enterprise Zone designation through to 
its end date of 2042  
 Allocating more land to support the continued development and success of 
Exeter Science Park wo rking in conjunction with partners including the  City 
and County  Councils and the University of Exeter  
 Making provision for the development of a smart and sustainable aviation 
cluster centred on Exeter Airport, utilising existing and enhanced facilities, 
enabling it to act as a test bed for future flight technology and to create new  
markets in maintenance/repair/ overhaul, cargo handling and logistics  
 New communities, including Cranbrook employment and mixed use provision.  
 
g. Retaining employment sites that ha ve good prospects of meeting future needs by:  
 Safeguarding employment land allocations, supported by robust, effective 
mechanisms to deliver development, in order to reduce the demand for 
development in less sustainable, alternative locations  
 Ensuring that  policy designed to safeguard valuable employment provision is 
robust and clearly expressed  
 
h. Ensuring policy makes clear  the importance of maintaining adequate supply of 
employment land to meet the needs of business in the district . 
 
i. Ensuring policies seek  to secure the timely delivery of new infrastructure to 
support new development and a growing population, and address potential 
barriers to investment, including:  
 Enhanced digital connectivity and the roll out of ultra -fast broadband networks  
 Making provis ion for increased, installed renewable energy capacity, to 
support decarbonisation of the grid and roll out of decentralised energy 
networks alongside smart grids, energy storage, hydrogen -based 
infrastructure, and new charging infrastructure    
 
j. Ensuring policies designed to provide flexibility for employment –led uses can 
support established sectors to adapt to changing markets, including our High 
Streets  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
28 k. Sustaining and regenerating the town centres as priority areas for investment and 
for retaining retai l and leisure spending in East Devon  
 
l. Making provision for the development of tourism accommodation, attractions and 
businesses appropriate to the environmental qualities of the area, which support 
a more diversified, green tourism sector that draws on the  key strengths such as 
the food, drink and cultural offer, and retains spend in the area  
 
m. Supporting flourishing rural economies by  
 Focusing employment development at settlements where dwellings, services 
and facilities support the local labour supply  
 Ensu ring that policy designed to enable land based sectors to diversify, 
supports future farming resilience and rural businesses’ ability to adapt to 
agricultural transition, changing markets and regulations, whilst also being 
consistent with the spatial strat egy and supporting the role of settlements  
 Ensuring that policy recognises the importance of supporting local supply 
chains and improving the resilience and flexibility of the rural economy to 
adapt to changing markets. This might include development of fo od grade 
premises for local food and drink producers to expand. Or, accommodating 
local creative industries and local health and well -being businesses whose 
products and services complement local tourism, and community support 
services. Traditional and new  businesses add vitality, provided that their 
development is sympathetic to the rural location.  
 
n. Ensuring local residents are able to access and take up increased job 
opportunities in higher skilled and higher value occupations  
 
o. Maximising the opportunity for new residential and commercial development to 
enable enhanced local education and training, skills and employment provision.  
Responding to challenges  
3.38.  The economic vision and strategy encapsulate the plan’s response to the current 
challenges facing the local economy, and the long term challenges it is likely to face 
over the plan period and beyond. National and local policy is evolving in response 
to generational challenges such as the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, technological 
change, low producti vity and wage disparities, and a growing and ageing 
population. The Council Plan’s priority for a resilient local economy is driven by 
these generational challenges  but also by the economic shock of the pandemic and 
by national and global economic uncertai nties.  
3.39.  Historically, East Devon has a rich heritage of production which brought wealth and 
supported the development of our market and coastal towns. This ranged from 
handmade lace and carpet making to limestone quarrying, farming and dairy 
produce.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
29 3.40.  Today,  our economy is more diverse, spanning established sectors such as tourism 
and agriculture through to world leading climate and data science, advanced 
engineering and cutting edge science and technology.  It is necessary to consider 
East Devon’s role in th e wider sub regional economy centred on Exeter, including 
its transformational sectors.  
3.41.  We continue to broaden local economic and employment opportunities and yet 
there is no part of our economy that has not been touched by the COVID -19 
pandemic.  The Dist rict lost its largest private sector employer (Flybe) in March 
2020 and the Airport continues to rebuild from this.  Structural challenges to our 
economy that existed prior to the pandemic also remain.  East Devon is still an area 
where both resident and w orkplace wages are lower than regional and national 
averages whilst house prices are 12% higher than the England average, 
contributing to a worsening affordability gap.  
3.42.  We are experiencing a period of concerted economic change. There is a significant 
shift nationally and globally in the structure of employment, in response to 
generational challenges. As required by NPPF, the plan has had regard to the 
Heart of the South West Local Industrial Strategy (LIS) 2020. The LIS reflected 
contemporaneous government policy, set out in the UK Industrial Strategy 2017, 
and addressed the challenges of  
 Artificial intelligence and data revolution  
 Shift to clean growth  
 Shaping the future of mobility  
 Harnessing innovation to meet the needs of an ageing population  
3.43.  In March 2 021 Government replaced the UK Industrial Strategy 2017 with its ‘Build 
Back Better - Our Plan for Growth’ 2021. This Command Paper continues a 
transformational approach towards tackling long term problems to deliver growth. It 
supports the transition to n et zero carbon growth, but has a new focus on ‘levelling 
up’ and the Government’s vision for ‘Global Britain’.  Nevertheless, the challenges 
identified in 2017 remain.  
3.44.  Together, these challenges also provide opportunities for the national and local 
economy  to transform. New ways of working have emphasised the importance of 
adaptation and a reliance on digital connectivity in the District. The recent increase 
in home -working due to the pandemic may become a permanent feature for some 
types of jobs. Work forc e expectations and needs are evolving. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) is expected to replace types of traditional jobs that are repetitive and can be 
systematised. The drive for greater productivity reduces the reliance on labour, but 
in turn this releases l abour for employment in new sectors, if skills can be 
transferred, and training provided for the labour force to acquire new skills. New 
sectors are evolving. More flexibility enables new start -ups to grow on and mature. 
New types of employment requiring s pecialist workers are emerging. The changes 
have intensified the challenges experienced by our high streets.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
30 3.45.  Demand from future industries are expected to depend on new types of working 
environments, tailored to the industries’ needs. There are new opportu nities for 
people to reconnect with where they live, enjoy the outstanding environment and for 
businesses to access new markets through improved digital engagement.  
Developments such as Winslade Park are leading the way in terms of 
demonstrating the appea l of new models of living and working with an increased 
focus on wellbeing.  The full impact and legacy of the pandemic in relation to 
demand for physical space such as for offices, logistics and retail continues to 
evolve, as does the impact on the labour  market more widely.  
3.46.  Demand for supplies and services is expected to intensify, depending on the level 
of population growth and the needs of those people. Higher employment levels are 
needed to sustain the future population which is forecast to grow, and m ore jobs 
need to be accommodated locally in expanded or new communities.  The plan will 
reference the new District employment forecasts (jobs -based) that underpin the 
local plan’s employment provision policy, when they are available.  
3.47.  Linked to this, an inc reasing number of people are retiring to the District, increasing 
dependency on a shrinking workforce.  In just 9 years from 2011 to 2020 we have 
seen our population of those over 65 grow by 22% while those aged between 16 to 
24 have reduced by 6%.  The st ark reality is that we have seen a reduction in the 
working age population across more than half of the wards in East Devon.  The 
balancing impact of new settlements cannot be underestimated as the same data 
shows our population of those 0 to 15 years incr easing by 15% due to younger 
families moving into growth areas such as Cranbrook.  As a District with such 
growing levels of economic inactivity in our older population, our Local Plan must 
enable the delivery of affordable housing for key workers and work ing age 
residents, to address growing issues about hous ing affordability  in East Devon.  
3.48.  The impact of the pandemic has been particularly acute for certain age groups, 
places and sectors.  The lowest paid have been badly affected and the Council has 
launche d a Poverty Reduction Strategy to provide a comprehensive package of 
support to individuals and communities.  Alongside our support to transformational 
sectors, if we are to transition to a higher wage economy, we must ensure that 
residents can access the right education and training to develop the necessary 
knowledge and skills to access these new local oppo rtunities.  
3.49.  From a global perspective, the most pressing challenge is the need to reduce 
carbon emissions.  The evidence from the last United Nation’s IPCC report on the 
global threat presented by climate change is clear.  In the context of the Council’s 
own climate emergency declaration the policies and proposals of this Local Plan 
will, by 2040, need to have made a meaningful contribution to supporting  the 
transition to a net zero economy.  This is multi -faceted, spanning transport and 
supporting zero carbon development to promoting renewable energy generation 
and innovation.  There is no bigger challenge. Transition will be difficult and we’ve 
no optio n but to engage fully and precipitate the shift from awareness to 
responsibility and positive action.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
31 Policy for employment provision and distribution  
3.50.  In order to ensure there are good opportunities for people to gain jobs and for 
business to grow, thriv e and pro sper it is key for the local plan to ensure that there 
is a strategic approach to employment provision and distribution, especially in 
respect of making sure that land will be supplied.  
 
4. Strategic Policy - Employment Provision and Distribution 
Strategy   
 
The Council is committed to achieving high quality, high value jobs in East Devon, 
close to people’s homes.   
 
Provision will be made for a n et increase of sufficient  new employment floorspace 
within the plan period (1 April 2020 to 31 March 2040)  to meet need and ensure that 
a choice of appropriate land is available in sufficient quantity, and of the right quality, 
to drive the economic growth of, and support prosperity in, East Devon. The level of 
need will be informed by the ongoing Economic Dev elopment Needs Assessment.  
 
Scale of Development  
The ongoing Economic Development Needs Assessment  will inform the scale of 
development. This policy:  
 Will identify  the level o f E(g)(i ) Offices  that are required. The town centres in the 
tier 1 and 2 settlem ents and the proposed new settlement will be the primary 
locations for new Class E office development  
 Will identify the level of B2 Industrial land  that is required. The majority of this 
provision  will be met through site allocations.  
 Will identify the l evel of B8 Storage and distribution land  that is required. The 
majority of this provision will be met through site allocations.  
E (g) (ii) R& D and E (g) (iii) industrial (which can be carried out in any residential 
area without causing detriment to the a menity of the area) will be provided on mixed 
use site allocations and as windfall development.  
Other employment generating development, such as sustainable green rural tourism 
and leisure development will be permitted in accordance with other Plan Polici es. 
 
Location of Development  
Existing employment areas that will continue to be the primary locations for industrial, 
warehousing, offices, distribution development and other B Class Uses are identified 
on the Policies Map.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
32 Sufficient additional employme nt land to meet East Devon’s requirements will be 
identifie d:  
 on the western side of the District, including the Exeter and East Devon 
Enterprise Zone, for high value uses, including those in transformational 
sectors.   
 at the towns (Tiers 1 and 2 plus th e new settlement in  the Settlement 
Hierarchy) to provide jobs and workspace for new and existing residents, to 
improve settlement self -containment, and to reduce the need to commute to 
work .  
 In the Tier 3 and 4 settlements on mixed use sites, to provide s mall-scale jobs 
and workspace for new and existing residents, to improve settlement self -
containment, and to reduce the need to commute to work.  
  
The Council will monitor the achievement of employment development on existing 
commitments, from planning per missions and on site allocations in the development 
plan.   
The scale of new windfal l employment development will  also be monitored, regarding 
its support for and consistency with the economic vision and strategy, and the plan’s 
vision, objectives and spat ial strategy . 
 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
3.51.  The Council Plan recognises that a resilient economy will promote prosperity and 
reduce hardship for residents and this is a strategic aim of the local plan. Planning 
for a sufficient amount of employ ment growth in East Devon is essential but the 
new jobs must meet local needs. This strategic policy is focussed on raising the 
quality of jobs and locating them close to residents meeting housing needs to 
support communities. It is a commitment to the pro vision of employment land 
development over the plan period, and considers the new supply sources to deliver 
the provision. This policy will ensure that the needs of new and growing businesses 
are met, and the Council will work with businesses and other par tners to ensure the 
sufficient supply of quality employment floorspace.  
3.52.  Strategic policy in the plan should make sufficient provision for employment 
development. This means that the local plan provides an employment provision 
requirement figure for the who le plan area for the plan period.  This accords with 
the NPPF. This states that the plan should as a minimum apply a presumption in 
favour of sustainable development when plan -making, where strategic policy should 
as a minimum provide for objectively asses sed needs for housing and other uses, 
as well as any needs that cannot be met within neighbouring areas (as established 
through Statements of Common Ground), unless circumstances as specified in the 
NPPF apply.  Strategic policy should make sufficient prov ision for employment East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
33 development. This means that the local plan should establish an employment 
provision requirement figure for the whole plan area for the plan period.  
Forecast of employment needs  
3.53.  Unlike housing, the Government does not provide a standar d methodology for 
assessing employment development need.  However it requires the LPA to prepare 
a robust evidence base to understand business need through a Housing and 
Economic Needs Assessment (HENA).  The 2019 PPG on HENAs provides 
guidance about the a pproach to take on Economic Development Needs 
Assessment (EDNA).  PPG makes clear that EDNA evidence will he lp to provide an 
understanding of the underlying requirements for office, general business and 
distribution space, and (when compared with the overa ll stock of employment sites) 
can form the context for appraising individual sites. The EDNA will therefore 
forecast the need for land for offices, industry and warehousing.  It doesn’t 
specifically forecast need for development regarding other employment uses.  
3.54.  Previous evidence on need in the 2011 Housing and Employment Study informed 
the adopted Local Plan, but that evidence is now out of date.  Likewise, evidence 
underpinning the Greater Exeter Economic Development Needs Assessment March 
20177 is out of date because of the Covid -19 pandemic, Brexit and evolving 
national economic and fiscal policy.   
3.55.  East Devon District Council together with Exeter, Mid Devon and Teignbridge 
Councils have commission ed consultants  to undertake an updated Economic 
Developmen t Needs Assessment (EDNA). It covers the Exeter Functional 
Economic Market Area (FEMA) which encompasses the four authorities’ 
administrative areas. This recognises that East Devon is functionally part of a larger 
sub-regional economy.  
3.56.  The purpose of the E DNA is to objectively assess and evidence the need for 
economic development in each district during the period 2020 to 2040.  It will be 
able to take account of latest national and local policy on Covid recovery and Build 
Back Better, and latest evidence o n the state of the national and local economy.  It 
will be informed by the latest available District level forecasts of growth in 
employment (jobs -based) for the plan period.  
3.57.  The task of the EDNA is to understand current and potential future requirements.  
Based on PPG 2019, it will assess the stock of employment land, pattern of supply 
and loss, market demand, wider market signals and any evidence of market failure, 
in East Devon district.  The EDNA will translate employment and output forecasts

34 into relat ed offices, industry and warehousing land need. Then by taking account of 
existing supply, it can identify any shortfall in supply compared to District need. It 
may highlight specific needs, such as providing a range modern good quality 
floorspace for one or more of the employment types, or in particular locations.  It will 
consider the issue of providing sufficient supply flexibility to allow choice and enable 
businesses to respond swiftly to changing circumstances.  
3.58.  The results of the EDNA may identify pot ential shortfalls or surplus of employment 
land supply compared to need. It will be for the Councils to engage actively, 
constructively and in an on -going way to identify effective responses to resolve any 
strategic cross -boundary issues relating to meetin g need, necessary to pass the 
Duty to Co -operate legal test.  
3.59.  The EDNA is expected to be available in time to inform  plan making work in 202 3, 
possible future  draft plan consultation and  the preparation of the Regulation 19 
Publication Plan.  
Employment lan d (or floorspace) supply  
3.60.  To meet the District’s employment floorspace requirement, the Council will need to 
identify suitable sites that provide a realistic chance of delivery and provide for 
flexibility and choice. The EDNA assesses the existing supply a nd indication of any 
supply shortfall.   
3.61.  The Council needs to assess the quality and quantum of employment floorspace 
which could be delivered in the plan period to fill any forecast supply shortfall and 
allow for an appropriate degree of supply flexibilit y.   This includes sites put forward 
through the HELAA call for sites.  It also includes assessing whether any of the 
employment allocations in the adopted local plan but as yet undeveloped remain 
viable and attractive sites, and can be reallocated. The em ployment elements within 
the mixed use allocations in the Cranbrook plan have been tested recently at 
Examination.  
3.62.  Informed by the EDNA, the floorspace requirement identified in Policy 5, identifies 
the need for ‘office’ and ‘industrial’ and ‘warehousing’ employment uses. Policy 
reflects the latest national Use Classes Order (1st September 2020 and 2021). T he 
UCO  included a new E class combining commercial, business and services uses 
such as shops, financial and professional services, cafes, offices, resear ch and 
development, clinics and health centres, day centres and gyms. Further changes to 
permitted permanent change were introduced in August 2021. Use Class E(g) has 
replaced the previous B1 Use Classes.  Use Classes B2 (General Industry) and B8 
(Storage and Distribution) remain.  
3.63.  This has impacted on local plan policies on employment, commercial and retail 
development. The change in use classes, is meant to provide a more flexible 
approach to uses such as industrial and storage and distribution operations.  This 
can be beneficial allowing businesses to respond more swiftly to changing East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
35 circumstances. Allocating sites for E(g), B2 and B8 class uses will need to consider 
which sites are suitable, depending on how similar the site requirements are, and 
the poten tial impact on the mix of uses and adjoining uses. Some uses such as 
general industry and warehousing/logistics generally cannot be carried out in a 
residential area without detriment to its amenity.  
Distribution of employment development  
3.64.  The local plan de termines how to balance the supply of employment land and 
floorspace across East Devon.  To deliver the economic vision, the local plan will 
need to make new employment provision to meet the future needs of the District. 
The policy therefore addresses the distribution of additional employment provision 
across the District, focused on scale and type of employment allocations 
disaggregated to settlement categories.  
3.65.  The plan is an opportunity to support transformation al sectors focused on emerging 
technology, building on the inherent strengths of this part of the District. The 
western side of the District contains particularly advantageous locations for 
businesses; not least proximity to concentrations of higher education, businesses, 
services, consumers and la bour supply at Exeter, and the proximity of the M5 
providing access to the strategic road network for transporting materials and 
products. The concentration of a range of employment sites in that location is a 
unique asset for the District. Not only can th ese sites accommodate new and 
expanding businesses. They also allow policy to place emphasis on providing high 
value jobs with particular focus on encouraging strategic inward investment and the 
transformational sector. The role of the Enterprise Zone is f undamental to the 
economic performance and well -being of the District. The Science Park is already 
positioned to attract knowledge based se ctors, and to support new start -ups and 
the scaling up of businesses, with the potential to provide acceleration and 
innovation services for high tech firms.  
3.66.  The new settlements’ locations and role are integral to supporting the economic 
strength of this part of the District. The role of Cranbrook regarding employment 
land provision is set out in the Cranbrook  Plan DPD, and it is guided by the 
Cranbrook Economic Development Strategy . Further policy on employment 
development on the western side of East Devon is set out in the Policies in Chapter 
6.  For the avoidance of doubt, all the site allocations are intended to meet the 
identified East Devon employment need, being evidence by the EDNA.  
3.67.  Elsewhere in the District employment will mostly be geared to serving local needs 
with a view to securing jobs close to existing and proposed homes. These are 
locations where the demand  for services is a key part of the economy. Employment 
growth at existing settlements is essential to support them and to improve their self -
containment.  Through allocations, the plan provides opportunities to build on the 
economic links between settlemen ts and businesses, with the potential to 
encourage the spin -out of higher value employment and new sectors to more of the 
District. This gives more people the option of not needing to commute long East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
36 distances to work. On larger development allocations, new j obs will be required to 
be provided alongside new housing . Work is in progress to evidence the amount of 
employment, and how this relates to the scale of planned housing growth.  
3.68.  This policy establishes the amount and location of additional employment land to be 
distributed through local plan site allocations in accordance with the strategy 
established in Strategic Policy 5.  It is the summation of the sites allocated in the 
plan. The allocations within the Enterprise Zone make provision for knowledge and 
data-driven, creative or high technology industries, as well as airport use. This 
means that the Cranbrook Plan allocations are also counted for the purposes of this 
policy, subject to the adoption of that DPD.  Most of the allocation sites in 
settlements in  the rest of the s ettlement hierarchy are in tier  1 and 2 settlements. A 
small amount of mixed used development, including employment development, is 
proposed to be allocated at a few settlements in Tiers 3 and 4.  
3.69.  Work is in progress for gathering evidence  through the EDNA and to inform the 
Council’s site selection and site capacity estimates, to justify the amount of 
employment land sufficient to meet the need for employment land provision and the 
degree of supply flexibility in order to ensure sufficient choice in the range, types 
and sizes of sites for the mix of employment uses over the plan period.  
3.70.  The delivery of employment development on those allocations is vital to achieving 
the Economic Vision and Economic Strategy.  The Council will also monitor t he 
delivery of windfall employment land development to complete the evidence about 
employment land delivery over time . 
3.71.  There will be potential alternative strategic approaches to the level and distribution 
of employment development such as providing for a lower or higher level of 
employment growth. These will need to be identified, assessed, and conclusions 
reached about whether they are reasonable alternatives or not, and reasons set out 
for accepting or rejecting them. At this stage we do not have suffici ent evidence to 
make even an initial recommendation and so it is not considered appropriate to 
consider alternative approaches at this stage.  
Mixed use - housing, employment and other uses sites  
3.72.  To help secure sustainable  patterns and forms of d evelopment  it is identified as 
essential that we secure some mixed use development where delivery of housing 
will also help secure employment uses and community and social facilities.  We 
have, therefore set out policy for such development and this relates to a numb er of 
allocations found within the plan.  
 
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
37  
5. Strategic Policy – Mixed use developments incorporating 
housing, employment and community facilities  
 
In order to promote  sustainable patterns of development we will require mixed use 
developments schemes in li ne with the requirements set out below:  
 
For any development compris ing of 100 homes  or more  (noting that the new 
town proposal has specific policy levels) , specifically including at Tier 1 and 2 
settlements , including where land is allocated for developme nt and on windfalls 
sites.  
- We will require at least 0.4 hectares of employment land for each 100 homes 
proposed (with this ratio of provision applied on a pro -rata basis and applying for 
any homes numbering over 100) ; and  
- We will require on -site social and  community facilities in line with needs specifically 
generated by the development.  
 
At tier 3 and 4 settlements or development in the countryside whether on 
allocated site s or windfall sites we will apply a threshold of 25 homes.  
- We will require at least 0.1 hectares of employment land for each 25 homes 
proposed (with this ratio of provision applied on a pro -rata basis and applying for 
any homes numbering over 25), 
 
Sites will be taken to comprise of proposed windfall developments and full allocations 
in the local p lan and will not be restricted to s eparate plots of land irrespective of 
whether there is single  or multiple ownership or control.  This will resist the splitting of 
sites in order to come in below thresholds.  
 
Planning permission will not be gra nted for residential development falling under the 
above unless at least one of the following apply : 
- Specific employment only allocations at that settlement provide a quantum of 
employment land that exceeds the ratio of 0.25 hectares of employment land per  
100 houses allocated (0.1 hectares per 25 homes) when taking into account firstly 
total quantum needs generated by the level of housing allocations p roposed for a 
settlement in the local plan and in addition to this the quantum needs  generated by 
the prop osed scheme.  
- It can be clearly demonstrated that off -site provision of employment land at a 
settlement and at a quantum to meet or exceed above thresholds,  will be 
delivered and is better located to meet needs.  
- The nature of the housing being proposed (fo r example elderly person housing) will 
not generate the need for employment provision.  
- The site, by way of non -typical characteristics or clear constraints, is wholly 
unsuited to provide for employment needs.  
Exceptionally, if sufficient viability or other  evidence may be provided which precludes 
the delivery of necessary employment provision within mixed use sites. Developers 
will be required to make a financial contribution to the Council to support the off -site 
delivery of a sufficient and comparable deg ree of employment provision. The Council East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
38 will use these developer contributions to help deliver Council -owned employment land 
elsewhere in the district, and where possible, within commuting proximity to the 
application site. The methodology for calculating  this contribution is to be determined. 
A Viability Statement and verifiable assessment must be provided to evidence the 
unviability of the employment provision.  
 
Justification for the policy  
3.73.  We recognise the challenges in delivering employment land in t he District but the 
very real need for such provision.  Securing mixed use developments is identified 
as a very clear way forward to secure provision.  From past assessment work we 
have identified that one hectare of employment land, across a range of empl oyment 
uses, might support around 250 jobs  (though this is a higher level figure and would 
typically include higher levels of office uses) .  This ratio is the same as 0.4 hectares 
for 10 jobs and 0.1 hectares for 25 jobs.  
3.74.  Working on the basis of around one  economically active person on average per 
each new home built and with an aspiration on qualifying sites for each resident to 
have the potential to ‘work on site’ it generates the site space requirements 
established in policy.  
Settlement Boundaries  
3.75.  Settle ment boundaries (referred to as Built -up Area Boundaries in the adopted 
EDLP) are a fundamental policy tool for determining areas and locations that are 
generally suitable for development.  Boundaries are drawn around settlements that 
are identified as app ropriate for growth and they serve three primary functions:  
 
a) They define where (within the boundary) development will be acceptable  in 
principle because it will complement objectives of promoting sustainable 
development.  
 
b) They set limits for outward expans ion of settlements and in so doing control the 
overall scale and location of development that occurs in order to ensure 
implementation of the plan strategy;   
 
c) they prevent unregulated development across the countryside and open areas;  
 
6. Strategic Policy – Development inside Settlement Boundaries   
Within  the settlement  boundaries defined on the Policies map development will be 
supported in principle. This does not mean that all development will be acceptable  
within settlement boundaries : proposals will be c onsidered on their own  merits having 
regard to other policies in this plan and any made neighbourhood plan.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
39 This is a strategic policy and significant changes to the boundaries defined through 
neighbourhood planning would be incompatible with it. However, neighbourhood 
plans that propose modest adjustments to the settlement  boundar ies to increase the 
opportunities for additional development may be  considered to be compatible  with 
this policy.   
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
3.76.  Settlement boundaries h elp to direct growth to areas that meet our plan objectives 
and make it clear where development is most likely to be acceptable. This helps t o 
give a degree of certainty to decision makers, local communities, landowners and 
developers ab out where developme nt can be expected.  
3.77.  A Principles of Settlement Boundaries Topic Paper (which was prepared for 
consideration by Strategic Planning Committee  in 2021 ) sets out the relevant 
background and issues in more detail . When drafting the settlement boundaries, we 
have tried to follow our agreed  methodology , but welcome comments on both the 
methodology and whether the boundary lines comply with it or not.  
3.78.  Settlement Boundaries have  been drawn around our Tier 1 to Tier 4 settlements 
(large strategic development sites ma y also have such boundaries or otherwise 
have a clear allocation for development).   
3.79.  We want our settlement boundaries to be used to help manage our growth patterns 
in line with national planning guidance. We want them to be used to guide, but not 
stifle the outward growth of settlements in line with our plan strategy.  Settlement 
boundaries may exclude some areas that are already ‘built -up’, but nevertheless 
would not be considered appropriate locations for additional development (as in the 
current developm ent plan). Outside of  the settlement  boundaries, development is 
more restricted , under separate plan policy  set out below . 
Land outside of settlement boundaries  
3.80.  East Devon is a largely rural district, noted for its outstanding natural environment. 
Our plan  strategy is to direct growth to the Tier 1 to Tier 4 settlements as indicated 
on the following map. This is in line with the NPPF, which requires all plans to 
promote a sustainable pattern of development.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
40  
FIGURE 6.  Tier 1 to Tier 4 settlements  
3.81.  It can be seen fr om the map that there is a good ‘spread’ of tier 1 to 4 settlements in 
the western half of the District , in coastal areas and to the southeast. In these areas 
the identified settlements can provide a very local focus for growth for the 
surrounding areas of  ‘countryside’. In the area to the east of Honiton there are 
relatively large areas that are more remote from tier 1 to 4 settlements. Here 
villages tend to be very small and accessed by a network of single -track lanes, 
notwithstanding the two trunk roads that bisect the area. The character of this area, 
quality of AONB landscape and lack of services and facilities are good reasons not 
to direct strategic levels of development to this area.  
3.82.  The majority of East Devon will fall outside of any settlement bou ndary. In these 
areas development will be limited to what is specifically allowed through policy, 
such as rural workers dwellings or ‘exception’ affordable housing. The areas 
affected will include relatively remote and rural areas, but also smaller settlem ents 
and some areas in or close to places that have a settlement boundary. The purpose 
of drawing a settlement boundary is to show where planning policies will generally 
encourage new development and where they will not. Settlement boundaries help 
to set c lear and unambiguous policies to guide decision makers in accordance with 
the National Planning Policy Framework (Paragraph 16a). Additional development 
may come forward through neighbourhood planning, which is very active in East 
Devon, with 40 designated  ‘Neighbourhood Areas’, 23 ‘made’ plans and at least 8 
more  at various stages of preparation.  
 
 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
41 7. Strategic policy - Development beyond Settlement Boundaries  
 
In locations outside of the defined settlement boundaries, development will not 
generally be suppo rted, except where it is in accordance with a specific Local or 
Neighbourhood Plan policy that explicitly permits such development and where it 
would not harm the distinctive landscape, amenity and environmental qualities  of the 
area within which it is loc ated. 
 
Justification for inclusion of policies  
3.83.  This policy is an important mechanism for delivering the local plan strategy. The 
policy will help us to manage our pattern of growth in line with national planning 
policy. By focussing development inside th e defined settlement boundaries, we will 
promote the sustainable development patterns agreed through the local plan and 
limit the potential for significant amounts of development that would undermine this.  
It would not be possible to focus growth on the lo cations found to be most suitable 
through the local plan without a policy that set restrictions on development in other 
parts of East Devon. However, this should be balanced with the needs of our rural 
communities for suitable growth opportunities. The pla n achieves a suitable balance 
by allowing local communities to plan for appropriate developments and having 
policies that make provision for some forms of development.  
3.84.  Land outside of settlement boundaries will be treated as ‘countryside’ in planning 
policy terms, even though some of it will comprise built -up areas. Such areas of 
‘countryside’ will not usually be considered suitable for development unless a policy 
in this plan (or a made neighbourhood plan) explicitly provides for that type of 
development. This means that there will be some flexibility to allow, for example, 
affordable housing to meet local needs or the conversion of existing buildings.  
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
42 Chapter 4.  Addressing housing needs and 
identifying sites f or development  
 
Assessment of sites  
4.1. One of the critical  jobs of a local plan is to identify sites or land areas that can 
accommodate future development.  We use the word ‘allocate’ to refer to such sites 
that will feature in the plan.   
4.2. In line with the strategic approach to development, and specifically the a pproach of 
establishing Tiers 1 to 4 to establish suitability for development, settlements  of East 
Devon and sites with in and abutting them have been evaluated.  Papers setting out 
site assessment work were presented to Strategic planning committee on:  
 6 September 2022 for Tier 1 and 2 settlements – see item 28: Agenda for 
Strategic Planning Committee on Tuesday, 6th September, 2022, 9.30 am - 
East Devon  and 
 29 Se ptember 2022 for Tier 3 and 4 settlements – see item 35: Agenda for 
Strategic Planning Committee on Thursday, 29th September, 2022, 9.30 am - 
East Devon  
4.3. To date detailed Assessment has not been undertaken of sites on the western 
edges of East Devon where close to the Exeter City Boundary.  Assessment work 
will be undertaken in the coming month s though in this plan we do show suggested 
allocations . 
4.4. It should b e noted that sites in locations that do not come into the Tiers 1 to 4 have 
not been assessed as they do not align with plan strategy and as such  would not be  
appropriate , in principle , for development  (under strategy as currently proposed) .  
We have also not assesse d sites that are clearly remote or some distance from 
settlements that do fall into Tiers 1 to 4 as they would fail to meet pedestrian 
accessibility considerations.  
 
The Housing and Employment Land Availability Assessment 
(HELAA)  
4.5. The Council hav e invited landowners , who may wish to see their land developed , to 
submit site details to us through an exercise called the Strategic Housing Land 
Availability Assessment (HELAA).   We have used the HELAA and sites submitted 
through it, or otherwise submit ted to us, as a basis to establish sites to evaluate .  A 
number of HELAA ‘calls for sites’ have been undertaken in East Devon and these 
have  helped establish a database of sites that potentially offer scope for 
development and as such could potentially be allocated or identified in the local 
plan for development.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
43 4.6. A final technical HELAA report of assessed sites was considered at Strategic 
Planning Committee of the Council on 1 November and earlier working drafts of this 
report and assembled date has directl y informed proposed site allocations.   The 
report to committee can be viewed, item 9, at Agenda for Strategic Planning 
Committee on Tuesday, 1st November, 2022, 9 .30 am - East Devon . Following 
minor presentation al changes , the published  HELAA document  including  full 
appendices is available on the Council ’s website8. 
4.7. On the local plan Policies Map we have shown land allocations suggested as 
potentially suitable for development on the western side of East Devon as well as 
for Tier 1 to 4 settlements.   We have set out in our consultation : 
 Preferred sites , 1st Choice sites , for development ; and also  
 2nd best sites that are not considered to be ideal but may be require d as 
allocations in order to ensure that there could be sufficient sites allocated to 
meet the housing need  
4.8. The policies in the plan directly relate to the policies map  and we colour code sites 
as preferred and 2nd best choices as well as showing currently  rejected alternative 
options.  
The 2022 Call for Sites  
4.9. In addition to previous calls for sites we undertook a further call for sites in 2022.  
Where possible we have sought to assess site submissions and take them into 
account in plan preparation. But this  has not been fully possible for all sites and on 
the Policies Map (various inset maps) there is a notation on the key (for some 
locations) that advises “New site – not assessed’.  For these sites we will undertake 
further work in 2023 and they may offer p ossible scope for allocation for 
development .  
 
 
  
                                            
 
 
8  Emerging Local Plan - East Devon  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
44 Chapter 5.  Future growth and development 
on the western side of East Devon  
What the western side of East Devon is like  
 
5.1. The western side of East Devon, close to the City of Exeter, has seen considerable 
levels of dev elopment in recent years and in th is new local plan we plan to  continue 
with accommodating high levels of growth  in this western area.  Projects and 
schemes that have supported development  so far, and which have formed part of 
the growth agenda , have inclu ded district heating, high  quality green infrastructure, 
a full Growth Point programme, the Enterprise Zone designation , new and improved 
highways and proactive responses to the climate emergency.  
5.2. Past policy concentrating development in the west of the Di strict, close to Exeter, 
has reflected:  
 
 the constraints to development elsewhere in the District, specifically the fact 
that two thirds of East Devon, including much of the north, west and south of 
East Devon fall in designated AONBs; and  
 in East Devon, c lose to Exeter and in the City itself, there is a lot of existing 
built development providing jobs, services and facilities, there is supporting 
infrastructure and there is a market demand for housing and larger strategic 
scale development, no t the least f or employment uses . 
5.3. These considerations still apply today and m uch of what will be built on the western 
side of East Devon over the yea rs ahead is already committed  development , either 
through  already planned development at  Cranbrook or through sites that  are under 
construction or have planning permission  for development.  
5.4. The western side of East Devon has seen a considerable amount of infrastructure 
put in place in recent years to support, promote and facilitate new growth and 
development.  A pattern of o n-going growth will be able to capitalise on existing 
infrastructure provision but will also generate, in its own right, the need for 
additional provision and facilities, this is especially so in respect of proposals for a 
second new town.  
Key messages fro m the Neighbourhood Plans for the area  
5.5. Unsurprisingly neighbourhood planning has been very active in the western part of 
the district, no doubt partly in response to adopted local plan strategy and the 
significant levels of development that have been seen and are on -going.  ‘Made’ 
neighbourhood pl ans in the vicinity cover the parishes of Bishops Clyst ( Clyst St 
Mary and Sowton ), Clyst St George , Farringdon  and Rockbeare , and seek to 
preserve the rural nature of the area, the character of settlements and the ir East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
45 remaining countryside setting.  Emerging and advancing plans at Clyst Honiton and 
Broadclyst are seeking to bring their own preferred sites forward for development 
and to ensure all future development meets their local needs and deliver  real 
benefits fo r their local communities.  Emerging plans are also under varying stages 
of preparation for Ayl esbeare, Whimple and Woodbury, none of which are currently 
anticipated to be specifically planning for growth.  
5.6. Further significant levels of development, includi ng the potential for development of 
a new town or significant outward expansion of Cranbrook would clearly have major 
implications for any Made or emerging neighbourhood plans in the area.   
Policy  for a second new town  
5.7. In order to provide for the signific ant levels of housing growth identified for East 
Devon the local plan is allocating land to accommodate  a new town (this is a 
second new town  in addition to  Cranbrook ).   This new town will be on the western 
side of East Devon close to the border of the Di strict with Exeter city.  
 
FIGURE 7.  New houses at Cranbrook  
5.8. Through extensive research and assessment three broad areas of search were 
identified for the new town and these have now been honed down to identify a 
preferred proposed land allocation for the new town d evelopment.   The technical 
evidence report on new community site options was reported to Strategic Planning 
Committee of the Council on 1 November 2022 – see item 8 at Agenda for Strategic 
Planning Committee on Tuesday, 1st November, 2022, 9.30 am - East Devon  On 
the policies Map we show the preferred site and also the two alternatives.   The 
preferred site being Option 1 that is to the north of the A3052 road.  On e of the non -
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
46 preferred (alternative) sites straddles this road (part to the north and part to the 
south)  and the other non -preferred (alternative) sites falls to the south of this road,  
 
8. Strategic Policy – Development of a second new town east of 
Exeter   
 
Land is allocated , as shown on  the Policies Plan , for the development of a new town 
on the western side of East Devon.   The new town will be a long-term strategic 
development scheme that will start being built during the life span of this local plan 
but development will extend beyond the life of this plan  
 
Development will need to occur and proceed on an agreed phased basis.   The town 
will be built to distinctive high quality design standards with an explicit focus on 
sustainable construction and building  operation and renewable energy pr oduction and 
use. Open spaces and facilities will be readily accessible to all residents with 
convenient and attractive pedestrian and cycle links to local destinations and access 
to high quality public transport services.  
  
Working with our partners we will promote development  starting in this plan period but 
also extending over the longer term (beyond the lifespan of this local plan ) to 
accommodate  the following : 
  
1. New Homes   
 Up to 2040 - Around 2,500  new homes on alloca ted land .  
 Beyond 2040  – Around 5,500 a dditional new homes on allocated land.  
 New homes will need to be of the highest standards in terms of energy and 
resource efficiency, quality of design and access to services and facilities.  
  
2. Gypsy and Traveller Prov ision  
 Up to 2040 - Numbers are to be determined but we would envisage at least 
one site accommodating up to 15 pitches.  
 Beyond 2040  – Numbers are to be determined but we would envisage at least 
one site accommodating up to 15 pitches.  
 Provision will be req uired  in line with  ‘bricks and mortar’ housing  development  
and must be integrated with overall development proposals.  
  
3. Jobs  
 Up to 2040 –. Around 17.5 hectares of land in office, industrial and warehouse 
sectors (E, B2 and B8).  
 Beyond 2040 –  Around 38.5 h ectares of land in office, industrial and 
warehouse sectors (E, B2 and  B8).  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
47  employment  shall be made throughout the town to provide a range of business 
spaces suitable for the needs of businesses as they develop and grow and to 
accommodate a range of emplo yment opportunities for residents of the new 
town  and surrounding areas. It should be noted that many people will be 
employed in jobs that do not fall into the above defined sectors and land will be 
allocated for other uses that also provide employment.  
 
Serviced or otherwise available land should be available for occupation by 
employment uses on a phased based that is directly proportionate to house building:  
  
4. Town Centre  
 Up to 2040 –  Allocation of 15 hectares of land for a town centre with 
completion  of at least 5 hectares of land with completed and operation al town 
centre uses, specifically to include retail.  
 Beyond 2040  –  Completion of additional town centre development to occupy a 
grand total of at least 15 hectares of land (pre and post 2040 de velopment).  
 A town centre will provide a focal point for retail, business and leisure activities 
and will be designed to  create a vibrant day and night -time economy and  this 
will be complemented by a series of smaller neighbourhood centres.  
  
5. Social, Community and Education Facilities  
 Accommodate a full range of social, leisure, health, community and education 
facilities (including new schools) to meet the needs of all age groups that will 
live at the new town.   To specifically include 23 hectares of lan d for education 
provision.   
 
6. Infrastructure   
 Infrastructure provision will need to come forward with overall development 
proposals. This will include at least 254 hectares of land for green 
infrastructure provision  The Council will produce an Infrastru cture Delivery 
Plan that will set out key requirements recognising the need for improved 
transport links and road improvements , district heating connections, new 
education provision, high speed broadband and other services and facilities to 
ensure sustaina ble development is delivered . 
  
Developments shall be developed in a phased and co -ordinated manner alongside 
the required infrastructure and in accordance with parameter plans for the new town  
which will be developed in partnership with the developers and  the community . 
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.9. Local plan policy will provide for a second new town in East Devon on land in close 
proximity to the City of Exeter.  Work on identifying an appropriate site started with 
identifying an overall area of searc h.  From finer grained assessment, including East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
48 drawing on sites that were submitted through the HELAA process, a series of 
possible locations for the new town have been identified .  These are shown in 
supporting documentation.   
5.10.  The scale of proposed developm ent will help ensure that a wide range of services 
and facilities will be provided at the new town with sufficient monies generated to 
support substantive infrastructure provision.   
5.11.  Amongst other key facilities this scale of development will be appropriat e to ensure 
that a secondary school is planned and built to serve the new town with potential 
capacity to also support needs generated from surrounding areas.  
5.12.  A new town will be a long time in the planning and it is unlikely that any new homes 
will be comp leted  until around  2030 .  On t his basis, and at  build  out rates climbing 
to around  300 new homes per year, we can expect  to see around  2,500 new homes 
built at the new town by the 2040 end date of the local plan.  The second new town 
will, therefore, see m ost of its development happening outside of the life of this local 
plan and potential ly running beyond the mid -point of the 21st Century.  
5.13.  There will be a need to build up a long term strategy and vision for the development 
of this new town.  
Strategic scale  employment provision and job growth on the 
western side of East Devon  
5.14.  The western side of East Devon, notably at the Science Park, Skypark and Exeter 
Logistics Park have all seen substantial growth in recent years with a focus on 
higher value and higher s killed jobs. This development has been supported by the 
Enterprise Zone designation, which has unlocked barriers to growth.  These new 
developments also sit alongside other important employment and economic assets 
in this western part of East Devon, notabl y Exeter International Airport.  The 
proposed employment strategy in the plan places a clear emphasis on a 
continuation of this pattern of employment concentration and growth playing on the 
particular strengths of this part of East Devon and market demands .  
The Enterprise Zone  
5.15.  Enterprise zones are designated in areas where employment and business growth 
are actively encouraged. Designated areas offer a simpler planning regime and 
incentives to investors. The Exeter and East Devon Enterprise Zone covers fou r 
areas of land in East Devon.   
5.16.  Through plan policy the Council will continue to positively support development of 
employment generating uses within the designated Enterprise Zone sites.  The 
designated sites have already provided a catalyst for growth su pporting 
demonstrable success and economic prosperity. One of the designated areas falls 
within Cranbrook and this area is excluded fro m cov erage of this local plan policy  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
49 and is instead covered in the Cranbrook Plan .  
 
9. Strategic policy – Development within  the Enterprise Zone  
 
Within the designated Enterpr ise Zone  as shown on  the Policies Plan (excluding the 
area at Cranbrook which is not addressed in this local plan), support will be given for 
inward investment and development for business and allied uses.     
 
All new development will need to be complementary to the existing use and purposes 
of the Enterprise Zone area and its specific vision for development.    
 
All new buildings and supporting infrastructure will need to be of the highest standard 
to incl ude buildings to BREEAM Excellent or equivalent stand ard. New buildings will 
need to  connect to the district heating network on Science Park and Sky Park.  
 
Planning applications will need to demonstrate through a Travel Plan how the 
development will suppo rt the use of active travel and public transport.  There will be a 
requirement for active travel routes throughout the designated sites, linking to the 
surrounding settlements, including Exeter. New developments will be required to be 
accessible by walking , cycling and public transport, and must not generate traffic of a 
type or amount inappropriate for the character of existing or improved access roads.   
 
Planning applications will need to show how proposals will include and promote high 
quality digital c onnectivity ensuring infrastructure reflects the most modern speeds 
and technologies.   
 
In the designated Enterprise Zone  a range of building types and sizes, to maintain a 
flexible and competitive offer will be allowed for. However, other than at Exeter 
Logistics Park large -scale warehousing and distribution development within the 
Enterprise Zone, will only be allowed:  
 as a limited part of a mixed use scheme and  
 providing it will not compromise the ability of those sites to deliver significant 
high valu e employment  
 
Justification for policy  
5.17.  The Enterprise Zone designation has  been a clear success and the intent is to build 
on this success. There will be a continued focus on developing Local Development 
Orders (LDO) to support the delivery of economic g rowth.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
50 5.18.  An LDO is an Order made by the Local Planning Authority (LPA) that grants 
planning permission for a specific development proposal or classes of development 
in defined locations. LDOs were introduced through the Planning and Compulsory 
Purchase Act  2004 (‘2004 Act’) and allow local planning authorities to extend 
permitted development rights for certain specified forms of development subject to 
conditions.  
5.19.  Local Development Orders streamline the planning process, providing clarity and 
certainty for d evelopment and encourage investment into the area. Such orders will 
sit alongside local plan policy and provide more detail on appropriate development 
for the sites.  LDO’s constitute a planning approval, enabling a fast -track route for 
development to be i mplemented in a timely manner  to support businesses and job 
creation.  
5.20.  At the time of publication the following LDOs have been developed:  
 District Heating  
 Power Park, Exeter  
5.21.  The Council is currently working on an LDO for Sky Park.   
Exeter Science Park  
5.22.  Exeter Science Park lies to the north -east of Junction 29 of the M5 motorway.  
Science  Parks are frequently  connected with universities, as ours is with Exeter 
University  and it draws on the academic excellence of the university . The Exeter 
Science Park provi de an environment that supports and encourages  science, 
technology, engineering, mathematics and medical) companies to prosper  and 
thrive.  
5.23.  The existing Exeter Science Park has grown at pace since the early 2010s and has 
attracted  a range of high-quality  business es and considerable new investment  in 
recent years .   
 
10. Strategic policy – Exeter Science Park  
 
At the Exeter Science Park, as shown on the Policies Map the following uses will be 
acceptable:  
 research and development of products or services;  
 active collaborations with universities, higher education, institutes, research or 
similar organisations;  
 technology based services;  
Uses which support the above primary activities and supporting green and grey 
infrastructure will also be accommodated.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
51 New busi ness developments will need to be of the highest quality built in a campus 
style setting, to reflect the existing Science Park development, with a particular 
emphasis on provision of high environmental quality and standards.    
 
Other than for supporting in frastructure planning permission will not be granted for 
built development that comprises of non -business or for businesses that do not 
accord or align with Science Park objectives.  
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.24.  To accommodate future needs for the Scien ce Park a continuation of the current 
approach to development is promoted.  The existing ‘gateway policy’ (a legal 
agreement which relates to the original planning permission) for the Science Park 
will be maintained to ensure that developments will continu e to provide and 
contribute to transformational economic impacts across the area.  The ‘gateway 
policy’ for the Science Park is not a Development Plan policy, but it does address 
the types of business uses that will be able to locate at the Science Park an d how 
they operate.  
Development of land north of Exeter Science Park  
5.25.  Land to the n orth of Exeter Science Park offers scope for high quality employment 
growth in this part of the district and is allocated accordingly.   
 
11. Strategic policy – Land north of the Science Park  
 
A land area of around 4.3 hectares , as shown on the P olicies Map, is allocated for job 
generating uses in the business, research and technology related sectors  and 
supporting green and grey infrastructure will be accommodated.  New business 
developments will need to be of the highest quality and should reflect forms of 
development in the surrounding area , notably  Science Park development  to the 
south , with a particular emphasis on provision of high environmental quality and 
standards.   
 
Othe r than for supporting infrastructure planning permission will not be granted for 
built development for non-business job generating uses.  
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.26.  To help with the  continuation of the pattern of employment growth on the western 
side o f East Devon it is appropriate to allocate additional land for job generating East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
52 uses.   This site is to the north of the existing Science Park and to the east of the M 5 
Motorway , which could have some noise impacts  and which  could adversely impact 
on suitabil ity for some non -employment uses.  
5.27.  The site would form a logical extension to the pattern of employment development 
in this part of East Devon and would draw on locational qualities  that have already 
seen and secured substantive investment and development close by .  As such the 
site could  help deliver  highly-skilled, high-quality well -paid jobs. 
High quality development north of Sowton village  
5.28.  We have identified the need for a further major strategic land allocation for 
employment uses close to junction 29 o f the M5 Motorway and land is allocated 
directly to the nor th of Sowton village (south –east of Junction 29  of the M5 and 
south of and alongside the A30).  
 
12. Strategic policy – High quality employment north of Sowton 
village  
 
An area of around 17 hectares  of land, as shown on the Policies Map, to the north of 
Sowton village,  is allocated for employment uses.   
 
High quality development of the site will be essential  given both its proximity to the 
village of Sowton and its built heritage importance  and the more general ope n setting  
of the site and visual proximity to the A30 at a gateway entrance  point to Ea st Devon 
when leaving the M5 motorway and the city of Exeter.  
 
The site will form a mixed -use business park at which  the following uses will be 
considered appropriate;  
 a mix of B2, B8 and E(g)  
 A limited element of ancillary uses such as indoor sports, recreational, crèche  
or café will be permitted  
Other than for supporting infrastructure, and exceptions noted above , planning 
permission will not be granted fo r built development that comprises of non -business 
uses.  
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.29.  Land to the north of Sowton village, south of the existing Science Park and A30, 
occupies a visually prominent position close to the M5 Motorway, Junction 29 and 
the A 30.  It can be expected to be attractive to potential inward investors and would 
help carry forward the proposed employment strategy.  High quality development East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
53 will, however, be essential given the sensitive nature of surrounding areas, 
specifically includ ing Sowton village,  which is of historic interest, contains several  
listed buildings and much of the village lies with in a Conservation Area.  It is also 
the case that some land around and close to Sowton village falls in a floodplain.  
Exeter Airport and d evelopment in the environs  
5.30.  Exeter Airport is of strategic importance for travel and communications for the 
south -west of England and it forms a key asset for East Devon and surrounding 
areas.  Plan policy supports its future operation and growth of the air port as a key 
gateway to the region and in providing the opportunity for high ly skilled, high value 
job creation in aviation and other sectors.  
 
13. Strategic policy – Exeter Airport and its future operation and 
development  
 
Growth and expansion of the airpo rt and airport related businesses and operations 
will be supported within its current operational boundaries. The role of the Airport as a 
test bed for new technologies will be supported through promoting the development 
of a sustainable aviation cluster.  Land to the north of the runway will be allowed to 
support aviation related development including research and development activity 
alongside maintenance/ repair/overhaul and new freight/cargo operations.   
 
Land to the south will be allowed to accommodate  further aviation related, 
employment and training/education uses. This can include occupiers who rely on 
proximity to an Airport or who benefit from a transferrable skill base as well as to 
support the developing logistics cluster.   
 
Any new developments  must not, however, prejudice or adversely impact on the core 
operational role and functions of the airport as  a travel facility handling the air bound 
movements of passengers and freight.  
 
Noise sensitive development within the 57db noise contour around the airport will be 
restricted (in order to ensure future airport operations are not adversely impacted) 
alongside ensuring that any development proposals do not have a material impact on 
the operation of navigational and safety systems.    
  
The transitio n to net zero carbon operations at the airport will be supported through 
enhanced public transport surface access and the installation of renewable energy 
generating capacity.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
54 Justification for plan policy  
5.31.  Exeter Airport plays an important role as a key  gateway to the region.  This helps to 
support access to markets and both inbound and outbound tourism as well as 
providing a home operating base for the Devon Air Ambulance and National Police 
Air Service helicopters and the nightly Royal Mail flight.  Pa ssenger numbers have 
increased steadily over time, reaching a peak of over one million passengers per 
annum in 2019.  The pandemic has though had a dramatic impact.  Flybe was 
headquartered at Exeter Airport and, when the airline went into administration i n 
March 2020, over 900 jobs were lost locally.  This was the biggest economic shock 
ever experienced in the District.  Passenger traffic reduced by over 90% in the 
following year.    
5.32.  It is estimated that it may take up to 5 years for passenger numbers to r eturn to 
their 2019 levels.  There has though been some positive progress latterly including;  
 The majority of domestic routes being operated by alternative airlines  
 The hangars being taken over by Exeter Aerospace to re -provide a 
maintenance, repair and overhaul operation  
 The purchase of the former Flybe Training Academy by Devon County Council 
and its relaunch as the Future Skills Centre operated by Exeter College to 
provide a specialist facility for the delivery of training for future -facing high -tech 
jobs in engineering, digital, construction and clean growth.  
5.33.  It is important that the Local Plan sets a policy framework that both safeguards 
current operations and supports recovery, particularly the potential to pivot towards 
a more sustainable future.  There is a global challenge to decarbonise the aviation 
industry.  There is a particular opportunity for Exeter Airport to act as a testbed for 
new technologies and modes of propulsion through the creation of a sustainable 
aviation cluster.  A recent repor t for the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise 
Partnership highlights that the Ai rport could be a hub for  a wider test corridor.  
There has already been a test of hybrid electric flight to Newquay Airport through 
the Future Flight programme.  The oppor tunity to develop this potential is alongside 
the need to decarbonise existing operations, for example through promoting public 
transport accessibility and the installation of renewable energy generating capacity.    
5.34.  In addition to the airfield itself ther e are opportunities to bring forward further 
development land both to the north and south of the runway to complement the 
operation of the Airport.  To the north there is an opportunity to develop further 
space to support research and development activity around future flight alongside 
developing new markets for cargo linking to the nearby presence of Exeter Logistics 
Park.  To the south there is an opportunity to bring forward further commercial 
development including allowing for the continued expansion of  education and 
training provision.    
5.35.  It is essential that new development does not compr omise the safe operation of the 
Airport.  This applies both in terms of the proximity of noise sensitive development 
and the safeguarding of navigational and safety sy stems.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022

Employment land to the east of Power Park  
5.36.  Land is allocated, it currently has Enterprise Zone status, for employment uses to 
the east of airport terminal buildings, and the site is shown on the Policies Map and 
is expected to accommodate a range of business uses.  
 
14. Strategic Policy – Employment land to the east of airport 
buildings  
 
An area of 7.7 hectares of land, as shown on the Policies Map to the east of existing 
airport buildings, is allocated for employment uses.  The site will form a mixed -use 
business park and the following uses will be considered appropriate;  
 The site will accommodate a mixed use scheme of employment generating 
uses, which may include - B2, B8 and E(g)  
 A limited element of ancillary uses such as indoor sports, recreation al, crèche  
or café will be permitted  
  
Other than for supporting infrastructure, and exceptions noted above planning 
permission will not be granted for built development that comprises of non -business 
uses.  
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.37.  The proposed all ocation provides an addit ional employment site, sited next  to the 
Power Park, to the south of Exeter Airport.  There is currently work to improve the 
sustainability of this area, with the improvements to Long Lane and use of 
Silverdown Link as a dedicated bus loop/cycleway for the area.  Increasing 
employment density will improve the viability of public transport provision to the 
locality.    
5.38.  Uses that support the role and function of the airport and aviation industry will be 
positively considered.  Land al locations and subsequent development may support 
an increasing transition of aviation away from fossil fuel reliance to less polluting 
fuel options.  
Employment land east of the Airport and north of the A30  
5.39.  Land is allocated for employment uses to the east of the training academy/hotel, 
and the site is shown on the Policies Map.  The site is specifically earmarked for East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
56 high technology airport related uses and clean green technology forms of 
development.  
 
 
15. Strategic P olicy – Employment land east of the Airport  and 
north of the A30  
 
An area of 1 2 hectares of land, as shown on the Policies Map to the east of existing 
airport buildings, is allocated for employment uses.  The following uses will be 
considered appropriate;  
  B2 and E(g);  
  A limited element of B8;  
  Sui-generis uses which comply with this policy  
  A limited element of ancillary uses such as indoor sports, recreational, crèche  
or café.  
 
The development will need to come forward in accordance with an approved phasing 
plan and promote active travel measu res and o ther than for supporting infrastructure, 
and exceptions noted above planning permission will not be granted for built 
development that comprises of non -business uses.  
 
With its proximity to Exeter Airport the site is well positioned to assist the role of the 
airport. Uses which relate to the aviation sector and its wider supply chain will be 
supported alongside other high value employment uses that facilitate economic 
growth within the area.  
 
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.40.  Land to the east of Ex eter airport buildings is allocated for airport related and 
aeronautical business and commercial activity.    Development of this land will help 
support and reinforce the agenda of high ly skilled, high quality green job growth in 
this part of the District drawing in location benefits and opportunities offered by the 
proximity to the airport and other development sites and existing high quality 
businesses and educational establishments.  
 
The ongoing development and potential for expansion of 
Cranbrook  
5.41.  Cranbr ook is a new town under construction on the western side of East Devon, 
around 5 km from the M5 Motorway and the boundary with Exeter City.  From a East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
57 green field start in 2011 the new town has grown to a town of around 3,000 homes 
(as at end of 2021).  The C ranbrook Plan (a Development Plan Document) for the 
town is expected to be adopted in autumn  2022 and it includes policy to expand the 
town to close to 8,000 homes.  
5.42.  It is not proposed that the new local plan will supersede the Cranbrook Plan.  The 
policies  of the Cranbrook Plan will remain applicable and will be formally saved .  
The Cranbrook Plan does, however, only run to 2031 and this means that the new 
local plan will need to be revised and replaced before this date to ensure policy 
coverage for and at Cranbrook in future years.  There are also some existing local 
plan policies that are applicable at Cranbrook and a view will need to be taken, in 
due course, on whether these are also saved or whether we supersede them with 
new local plan coverage that ma y for selected policies ‘sweep -over’ and include 
land in the Cranbrook Plan area.  
5.43.  Whilst the Cranbrook Plan will remain in place for the Cranbrook Plan Area, beyond 
this defined area (i.e. on land covered by the new local plan), there are land areas 
on the  edge of or close to what is Cranbrook (or will be the edge whe re planned 
development occurs) that could accommodate further Cranbrook related 
development.   
5.44.  However, g iven the sensitivities of assessed sites for development on the edges of 
Cranbrook none are proposed for development in the new local plan.  The options 
for outward expansion of Cranbrook were assessed as part of the Cranbrook Plan 
preparation work and appropriate development areas were identified with a very 
clear steer, therefore, provided on land that was unsuitable or inappropriate.  
Furthermore there is already substantial development planned to happen at 
Cranbrook and it would be far more appropriate to provide for this to come forward, 
over the years ahead, and then to review any potent ial for further outward 
expansion at a much later date through a different plan and its production.  
Relationship with Neighbourhood Plans  
5.45.  The Cranbrook plan DPD boundary overlaps to some extent with a number of 
neighbourhood plan areas, particularly for th e parishes of Rockbeare, which has a 
made neighbourhood plan (2018), and Whimple, where neighbourhood plan 
preparation is underway . 
5.46.  Notwithstanding the identified reasons for not proposing allocation of land for 
development on the edges of the Cranbrook Pl an boundary in this local plan , there 
is and remains the option for Neighbourhood Plans to seek to allocate land and 
bring it forward for development.  
5.47.  The thrust of the Rockbeare plan (and early indications from the Whimple plan  
work ) are however to seek t o ensure that a clear separation remains from the 
development at Cranbrook , and to maintain the individual identity and rural 
character of the  existing villages in those plan areas .  The Rockbeare plan East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
58 expressly supports the green wedge in the adopted Loca l Plan.  There is also a 
close relationship with the advancing Broadclyst parish neighbourhood plan 
(currently at examination) , which seeks better connectivity with Cranbrook to benefit 
its resident population .  As submitted,  it propose s two sites for 
deve lopment/regeneration near the Cranbrook boundary.  
Green infrastructure and a high -quality  environment for the 
western side of East Devon  
5.48.  Green Infrastructure  (GI) is a network of multifunctional green spaces and natural 
areas and includes the footpaths, cy cle ways and other routes that link these 
together to encourage people to enjoy these assets .  GI is capable of delivering a 
wide range of environmental, economic, health and wellbeing benefits for nature, 
climate, local and wider communities and prosperit y. Considerable emphasis has 
been placed on Green Infrastructure provision and enhancement on the western 
side of East Devon in recent years , in particular through provision and development 
of the Clyst Valley Regional Park.  
5.49.  Plan policy seeks to continue with the positive approach to green infrastructure 
provision with better  and enhanced provision . With future strategic scale 
development proposed on the western side of East Devon there is a clear strong 
case for park expansion to ensure a greater and acce ssible green and recreational 
asset is available to residents and employees at any new development and to the 
public more widely.  
 
 
16. Strategic Policy – Green infrastructure and the Clyst Valley 
Regional Park  
 
Development proposals , and specifically larger scale  schemes on the  western side of 
East Devon , will individually and collectively need to contribute to the implementation 
and long -term management of green infrastructure initiatives through appropriate 
contributions and/or on-site provision.  
 
Clyst Val ley Regional Park  
 
Land is allocated, as shown on the policies map, to  show the existing extent of the 
Clyst Valley Regional Park and through future work the intent is to define a boundary 
for an extension to the Park  and associated sustainable transport n etwork, i ncluding 
the Clyst Valley Trail (this work will take place in 2023 an may need to be subject to 
future consultation) . Within the park  (existing and any extended area) , development 
proposals should promote park objectives in this policy .  Any schem es that run East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
59 counter to the objectives  or which would frustrate their implementation  will be refused 
planning perm ission.  
 
The objectives of this policy for the Clyst Valley Regional Park  are to:  
 
a)  To enhance the health and wellbeing of residents throug h the provision of high 
quality publically accessible high quality natural green/blue space and  
cycling/walking infrastructure that is complementary to built development and 
will be a stimulus to encourage commercial and business development of the 
highest  standard.  
b)  Ensure natural ecosystems function and all people of  all abilities have easy 
access to high quality open spaces, with linked benefits to health, education and 
food production.  
c)  Take recreation pressure away from more environmentally sens itive locations . 
We will encourage a park that ‘reaches into ’ surrounding areas . The park offers 
scope to provide mitigation for adverse impacts on protected habitats that could 
otherwise arise through development.  
d)  To protect irreplaceable habitats, re store natural processes, ensure that 
internationally important wildlife sites achieve their conservation objectives and 
increase the size, quality, quantity and connectivity of priority natural habitat and 
populations of key species . Provide new wildlife  spaces and  corridors that 
enhance biodiversity  and p rovide green links, open space and biodiversity 
enhancement areas.  
e)  Promote  cycling and walking opportunities to link habitats and sustainable 
movement networks that promote the overall recreational ex perience . 
f)  Conserve and enhance heritage assets and their setting to reflect their intrinsic 
importance, maximise beneficial outcomes for park users and to encourage use 
of the park and to enrich the cultural identity of the area.  
g)  To create opportu nities for people of all ages and abilities to learn outside the 
classroom.  
h) To rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon in soils and 
vegetation and increase resilience to extreme weather events and rising sea 
levels.  
i) To achieve good ecological status in the River Clyst and tributaries, enhance 
natural flood storage, and restore soil health.  
j) To restore landscape character and promote local distinctiveness and to 
maintain the high landscape setting of Killerton.  
k) Provision of publi c art and the promotion of culture and customs in connection 
with the above objectives.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
60 The park will be designed and managed to the  highest natural green design 
standards.   And major development proposals should make a commensurate 
contributions to the following targets:  
I. Creation and/or restoration of 1,000 hectares of priority natural habitat within the 
Nature Recovery Network  
II. 30% tree canopy cover.  
III. 740 hectares of Public Open Space meeting ‘Building with Nature’ or ‘Green 
Flag Award’ standa rds. 
IV. 80 km of traffic -free trail and quiet way meeting LTN 1/20 design standards  – 
see Cycle infrastructure design (LTN 1/20) - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)  
 
Where development occurs outside of but close to the allocated park any green 
space provision  associated with or required for the development  should be linked to 
and provide  pedestrian and cycle access into the park .  New development may also 
contribute directly  to park provision.  Park provision and delivery will draw more 
widely on developer contributions, the Community Infrastructure Levy and 
agricultural -environmental funding streams . 
 
Justification for policy  
5.50.  The Clyst Valley Regional Park forms an importa nt strategic asset on the western 
side of East Devon.  The park forms a setting for new developments  and was first 
defined and established alongside work on earlier strategic  developments schemes . 
5.51.  A 25-year masterplan for the Regional Park was the subject of public consultation in 
2020 and subsequently approved by EDDC in February 2021. The masterplan won 
the 2021 RTPI South West Award for Planning Excellence  and is a finalist in the 
national RTPI awards 2022.   See 6c.CVRP masterplan FINAL.pdf 
(eastdevon.gov.uk)  
5.52.  The concept of the Regional Park is that a number of greenspaces will be linked by 
predominantly traffic -free trails and good, safe, regular and affo rdable public 
transport. There is no intention that the whole of the Regional Park will become 
accessible to the public, as most of it is in private ownership. In addition, the 
principle of safeguarding sanctuary areas for wildlife has been established. 
However, 762 hectares is currently accessible and the ambition is to increase that 
by a further 740 hectares over 25 years. A large proportion of the Regional Park is 
within the National Trust’s Killerton estate. 40% of the Regional Park is within a 
floodpla in. 
5.53.  An important function of the Regional Park is to ensure that European protected 
wildlife sites continue to meet their conservation objectives. Suitable Alternative 
Natural Greenspace  (SANGS ) can help to mitigate the impact of public disturbance East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
61 on Natu ra 2000  sites). Strategic SANGS may be brought forward by the Council, its 
partners  or by developers. They may be within the Regional Park, but provided they 
meet the SANGS criteria, could also be delivered outside the Regional Park 
boundary.  
5.54.  A multi -partn er Cyst Canopy project has set a 50 -year objective of moving tree 
cover  from 10% to 30%. This expansion of tree and shrub cover will be achieved 
by: (a) ensuring our existing mature trees are retained and sustainably managed; 
(b) natural regeneration of wo odland and  wood pasture; and (c) tree planting. 
Planting could take many forms; mixed species forests, parkland, orchards, 
hedgerows, shelter belts, arable and pastoral ‘agro -forestry’ systems. Urban tree 
cover is also vital.  
5.55.  Delivery of the full suite of Regional Park objectives relies on partnerships across 
public, private and charitable sectors. Capital and revenue funding will also need to 
come from diverse sources, including Community Infrastructure Levy and Section 
106 obligations. EDDC has led two su ccessful bids for funding from the National 
Lottery Heritage Fund, w ith match funding from  different partners.  
5.56.  Separate policies for Biodiversity Net Gain, European Protected Sites, Landscape 
Character and Climate Change apply within the Regional Park , as do other plan 
policies specifically relating  to development in the countryside  and all policies 
should be read in conjunction with the proposed park policy.  
5.57.  The park boundary (through future work) will been defined by work that draws on 
assessment of suita bility of land for inclusion in the park of land areas that fall in:  
 Floodzone 2;  
 Critical Drainage Areas;  
 UK Biodiversity Action Plan Habitats;  
 Habitat Network (England) ;  
 Working with Nature  areas for potential floodplain reconnection; floodplain 
and ri parian woodland ; 
 Scheduled Ancient Monuments and the Historic Environment Record ; and  
 Ordnance Survey Open Greenspace . 
Develop ment north of Topsham and east o f the M5 Motorway  
5.58.  Taking advantage of proximity to the City of Exeter and links with neighbouring  
Topsham, in the city, we are allocating land for an urban extension to the north of 
Topsham .   
 
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
62 17. Strategic Policy – Development next to the M5 and north of 
Topsham   
 
Land shown on the Policies Map is allocated for a strategic development scheme for 
an urban extension to the north of Topsham.  
A mixed use development scheme  is required at this site which will:  
 Require a comprehensive masterplan for the whole site to be produced and 
agreed before specific parcels of land come forward  and allied to this will  be a 
need for an infrastructure needs and delivery plan to ensure required 
infrastructure will be delivered ; 
 Joint working across the City boundary to align development in East Devon 
with that in the City;  
 A range of facilities to meet and address East De von and cross boundary 
needs - needs to be determined in the context of East Devon and Exeter 
collective needs and provision and capacity in Exeter city (existing and 
planned) services and facilities.  
 Around 580 new homes and at this level at least 2.4 hec tares of employment 
land (to be pro -rata increased at 0.4 hectares o f land per 100 extra new 
homes (or part of) should the homes number increase.  
 Transport and especially pedestrian and cycle links including potential for a 
new rail crossing;   
 Require that  any development respects the landscape quality of the lower 
Clyst and provides links with  the Clyst Valley Regional Park.  
Planning permission will not be granted for any individual parcel of land in the 
allocation in the absence of a comprehensive develop ment scheme with clear 
mechanisms outlined for full policy requirements to be met and delivered.  
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.59.  Land at/close to Exeter, to the south of Junction 30 of the M5 offers an exciting 
opportunity for new mixed use development.  This land lies to the east of the M5 
Motorway and offers scope to accommodate a suggestion o f approximately 580 
new homes.   It is noted, however, that capacity could fall with any employment or 
other necessary uses required to support mixed use developmen t.  All figures 
quoted should therefore be taken as a guide and be considered as indicative only at 
this early stage of plan preparation.  
5.60.  This land suggested for development abuts, to the south, land in the City of Exeter 
that is currently being built out for housing development.  There are a range of sites 
and land parcels in the city itself between the city boundary with East Devon and 
Topsham that are being developed or have planning permission.  Any development 
in East Devon should be seen within, and p lanned within, the context of city 
development as well.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
63 5.61.  There is a need for a comprehensive masterplan to be developed to support the 
whole of the proposed East Devon development, but this master planning work 
should also, ideally, extend across the city b oundary and form a wider partnership 
plan for a bigger area that could come forward for development.  
Relationship with t he Neighbourhood Plans for the area  
5.62.  This area is covered by the Clyst St George neighbourhood plan which was ‘made’ 
in January 2019.  Th e sites under consideration for allocation here lie in the vicinity 
of an area identified in the plan as a ‘small but significant part of the parish’, lying to 
the ‘west of the River Clyst and east of the M5, which forms the boundary with 
Exeter’, known lo cally as the Clyst Road or ‘Blue Ball Inn’ area.  The existing 
development here is identified as one of three ‘settlement areas’ in the 
neighbourhood plan area, together with  Ebford and Clyst St. George.  The 
neighbourhood plan  includes policy to highlight  and protect th e ecological 
significance of th e floodplain  and ensure development properly addresses flood 
risk.   
5.63.  The plan conveys concern by residents about any significant scale of development 
and change in the rural nature of the area, particularly in respect of coalescence 
with Exeter and road safety, seek ing future development that meets local needs 
only.   
5.64.  The neighbourhood plan  did not allocate any sites for development, considering this 
unnecessary at the time when the newly adopted Local Plan stra tegy dealt with the 
entire plan area as open countryside (including this entire ‘edge of Exeter area’ a s a 
designated Green Wedge) , such that any development would b e appraised as an 
exception.  T he plan states  that the Parish is “unable to accommodate fur ther major 
development without significant investment in local infrastructure”, citing 
deficiencies with local community services, recreational facilities and the footpath 
and cycle network, and includes policy aimed at encouraging improvements.  The 
plan policies do however set out a suite of criteria/requirements/aspirations which 
could be used to inform any development brief/masterplan if allocations are made  
and seek to ensure the appropriate delivery of infrastructure to support growth .   
Gypsy and tra veller site east of the M5 and south of the Exeter -
Waterloo line  
5.65.  Land has been promoted for development through the HELAA process that is east 
of the M5 and south of the Exeter -Waterloo line .  One option identified in the 
submission was for a gypsy and tra veller site.  
5.66.  There is an unmet need for further gypsy and traveller provision and there are 
strong historic ties with the western side of East Devon and gypsy and traveller 
movement patterns and  homes.  The site would lend it self to an allocation for extra  
provision.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
64  
18. Strategic Policy – Gypsy and traveller site east of the M5 and 
south of the Exeter -Waterloo lin e 
 
Land shown on the Policies Map that lies to the east of the M5 and south of the 
Exeter -Waterloo line is allocated for a  gypsy and traveller site . 
 
Planning permission will be granted for development of a gypsy and /or traveller site to 
address need for provision specifically on the western side of East Devon District .  
The allocated site benefits from good highway access r oads to the south though a ny 
proposal will need to be carefully  designed  to avoid adverse impacts on surrounding 
uses and the high quality of commercial and residential development in this part of 
East Devon.  
 
An area of floodplain covers part of the site and as such built developm ent will need 
to be within central and northerly parts of the site.  Development for non gypsy and 
traveller  uses and occupation, other than for supporting infrastructure, facilities and 
landscaping will be resisted.  
 
 
Justification for plan policy  
5.67.  The m ost recent gypsy and traveller needs study showed  an unmet need for further 
gypsy and traveller accommodation in East Devon .  We are also aware of a 
particular need based on historic travelling patterns and land that in the past has 
provided homes for prov ision on the western side of East Devon.   There is a new 
gypsy and traveller accommodation study that is currently underway and this will tell 
us more about current needs going into the future.  
5.68.  Based on what we do know now we have identified this site for gypsy and traveller 
accommodation.  It has good highway  access  from the south , albeit partly  on a 
quite narrow lane , and provides for pedestrian access to a range of services and 
facilities.   The site used to accommodate a piggery that is now understood to  have 
ceased operating and there are a range of old farm buildings on the site.

65 Chapter 6.  Strategy for deve lopment at 
Principal Centre s, Main Centres , Local Centres  
and Service Villages   
Axminster  
6.1. The Local Plan strategy establishes Axminster as a Tier 2 settleme nt and as such 
as an appropriate location for future growth and development.  Plan policy sets out 
land allocations for development and these are shown on the policies map along 
with other policy boundaries that are at the town.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
66 19. Strategic Policy – Axminste r and its future development  
 
The sites/areas listed below are potential sites for allocation at Axminster  as shown 
on the Policies Map. On the policies map sites are colour coded to indicate whether 
they are preferred or 2nd choices sites and we also show  sites that have been 
assessed and at this stage rejected as possible choices for allocation for 
development . 
 Land east of Lyme Road (GH/ED/79)  and Pestaller Farm, Beavor Lane 
(Part of GH/ED/80  – shown as GH/ED/80a on the Policies Map ) – The 
endorsed Axmin ster M asterplan provides guidance for how this site should 
come forward.  This site is allocated for 293 dwellings and 1 hectare of 
employment land.  This is a preferred allocation.  
 Land east of Chard Road (GH/ED/82)  – This land  was proposed for 
employment u ses in the endorsed Axminster M asterplan with an extensive 
landscaping buffer in the northern part of the site . It is allocated for 2 hectares 
of employment land.  It is a preferred allocation for employment use only.  
 Land west of Chard Road (G H/ED/83)  – this land is proposed for 150 
dwellings and 0.6 hectares of employment land . This is a preferred allocation.  
 Land west of Musbury Road (part of Axmi_01)  – the southern part of this 
site that lies outside of the floodplain is allocated for  2 hectares of emplo yment  
land. This is a preferred allocation  for employment use only . 
 Land east of  Musbury Road  (Axmi_02 and Axmi_08)  – this land is proposed 
for 168 dwellings and 0. 6 hectares of employment land . This is a preferred 
allocation.  
 Land at Axminster Carpets  (Axmi_07) – this land is allocated for mixed -use 
redevelopment to retain the existing employment use and accommodate 50 
dwellings plus additional employmen t uses . This allocation will need to be 
supported by further flood risk assessment and a comprehensive m asterplan to 
secure pedestrian , environmental and other improvements . This is a preferred 
allocation.  The site is already in employment use and the land will not be 
included in the amount of employment land allocated in the plan.  
 Scott Rowe Building, Axmin ster Hospital, Chard Road (Axmi_10)  – this 
land is allocated for 10 dwellings . This is a preferred allocation.  
 Land at Lea Combe, Field End (Axmi_12)  – this land is allocated for 9 
dwellings. It is a preferred allocation . 
 Great Jackleigh Farm (Axmi_09) - this land is allocated for 270 dwellings an d 
1 hectare of employment land.  This is a ‘second choice’ site.  
 Land east of Lyme Close (Part of Axmi_11  – shown as LP_Axmi_11a on 
the Policies Map ) - this land is allocated for 100 dwellings  and 0.4 hectares of 
employment land . This is a ‘second choice’ site.  
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted on 
were allocated this would lead to the following:  
Total new homes proposed for allocation at Axminster  =  1,050  
Total land are a proposed for employment at Axminster  = 7.2 hectares  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022

What the settlement is like  
6.2. Axminster is the fifth largest settlement in East Devon with a population of around 
6,800. About 30% of residents are aged 65 or over (the East Devon average), with 
16% ag ed between 0 -15. There are some 2,800 economically active people and an 
employment density of 1.03, which shows that there is a good balance of jobs and 
workers. In terms of where Axminster residents work, two thirds are within East 
Devon, 44% of which wor k in Axminster itself, showing the settlement is relatively 
self-contained. 11% of workers travel across the border to West Dorset to work, and 
10% to South Somerset.  Not surprisingly, given its location near to the boundary, 
these are the highest proport ions of people travelling to work in Somerset and 
Dorset of any of the East Devon settlements, indicating a reasonably close 
commuting relationship with these counties. The majority (over two thirds) drive a 
car to work, although walking accounts for a sig nificant proportion (44%) in the town 
itself.  
6.3. Axminster is one of only three East Devon settlements that has a full range of 
services and facilities with a secondary and primary schools, a variety of shops, 
sports facilities, a library, GP, hospital, railw ay station and regular bus service The 
A35 Trunk runs just to the south of Axminster and the A358 runs through the town 
centre. The routing of heavy goods vehicles through the narrow winding streets of 
the historic town centre erodes its environmental qual ity and can cause traffic 
management issues.  
6.4. Axminster is set within the beautiful Axe valley, with the East Devon AONB to the 
south of the town and the Blackdown Hills AONB to the north and west. There is a 
significant degree of inter -visibility between t he town and the AONB landscapes. 
Land to the west of the town is constrained by a wide floodplain and there are 
smaller floodplains in the town itself.  
6.5. Axminster is an attractive and long established market town with an historic core of 
great architectural  value. There are significant archaeological remains to the south 
of the town that provide evidence of a Roman fort, and the crossroads of strategic 
Roman roads. There is also a significant group of listed buildings focused to the 
north of the town around Weycroft Hall.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.6. Axminster has a reformed Steering Group which since early 2021 has been actively 
developing a neighbourhood plan for the town and parish.  Previous work on a 
neighbourhood plan had stalle d in 2018  due to the on-going uncertainty regarding 
the proposed eastern urban extension and associated relief road.  An initial public 
consultation for the renewed  neighbourhood plan work was held over summer 
2021 .  The results of this, together with on -going evidence gathering, have informed East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
68 an early working draft neighbourhood  plan. Published results highlight a key 
concern  being to ensure  any new development is matched with improvements in 
infrastructure and facilities provision , and for traffic issues in the town centre to be 
addressed  and not exacerbated .  Support for  new development was primarily 
limited to  more employment, commercial and community use s, as well as affordable 
housing.   
6.7. A further public consultation to test and refine the draft neighb ourhood plan prior is 
being planned currently.   U ndertaking this work as the new Local Plan emerges is  
clearly more  challenging , and there is on -going liaison between the Neighbourhood 
Plan Group and district planning officers.  
Suitability for development  
6.8. Axminster is one of the main settlements in the east of the District and has been 
categorised as a Tier 2 settlement, which is suitable in principle for significant 
growth. It is largely outside of the AONB’s, has a train station, good bus links and 
acces s to the road network.  
6.9. These factors suggest it is a good location to consider for growth, but there are also 
constraints. The River Axe is a Site of Special Scientific Interest /Special Area of 
Conservation  and further housing development could exacerbate  existing nutrient 
management issues . Development in Axminster will need to be able to mitigate any 
detrimental impact on nutrient levels on the River Axe and w ork is ongoing on how 
this can be achieved .  There is a wide floodplain to the west of the town and an 
important group of historic assets to the north. To the south there is a further 
floodplain, the A30 Trunk Road, the East Devon AONB and two Scheduled Ancient 
Monument s, one of which may mark the site of a Roman fort and crossroads: it is 
likely tha t further Roman remains extend beyond the designated area. There is 
attractive hilly land to the east, some of which has limited potential for road access.  
6.10.  The currently adopted local plan allocates a strategic site to the east of the town as 
an urban ext ension and this includes provision for an Axminster relief road. A 
masterplan envisaged the delivery of up to 850 houses, a school, employment land 
and a distributor road. However, there are very significant viability issues 
concerning the delivery of the relief road which would require in the region of 
£15million of public money to deliver. It is very unlikely that such funding will 
become available,  and it would not be possible to de monstrate that allocations  
requiring the relief road are viable and deliv erable . It is not recommended that the 
new local plan includes policy for a relief road to the east of Axminster  because we 
cannot demonstrate that it could be  implemented .  
Exmouth  
6.11.  The Local Plan strategy establishes Exmouth as a Tier 1 settlement and as such as 
an appropriate location for future growth and development.   Plan policy sets out East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
69 land allocations for development at Exmouth and these are shown on the policies 
map along with other policy boundaries  that are at the town . 
 
20. Strategic Policy – Exmout h and its future development  
 
The sites/areas listed below are potential sites for allocation at Exmouth  as shown on 
the Policies Map.  On the policies map sites are  colour coded to indicate whether they 
are preferred  or 2nd choices sites and we also show sites that  have been assessed 
and at this stage rejected as possible  choices for allocation for development . 
 
 Land on the north -eastern side of Exmouth  – this land on the north -eastern 
side of Exmouth is proposed for a mixed -use development to provide arou nd 
258 new homes and 1 hectare of employment land.  The land area is made up  
(parts or all) of  sites under HELAA references – Exmo_04  (the proposal is to 
allocate Exmo_0 4a on the Policies Map) , Lymp_09, Lymp_10  (the proposal is 
to allocate Lymp _10a on the Policies Map) , Lymp_14 – and these sites will 
form an extension to the town which must be master planned as a coherent 
overall development scheme.  Development of sites Lymp_09 and Lymp_10 lie 
to the north of Hulham Road which is a busy road , any developme nt of these 
sites will be dependent upon provision of new and safe pedestrian and cycle 
crossings for this road.  
 Land at Douglas Gardens ( Exmo_06 ) – this land at Douglas Gardens will 
form a small -scale  residential extension on the southern side of Exmouth to 
accommodate around 44 new homes.  
 Littleham Fields ( Exmo_08 and Exmo_16  combined ) – this land close to 
Littleham will form a small -scale  residential extension on the southern side of 
Exmouth to accommodate around 45 new homes.  
 Land to the South of Courtl ands Lane ( Exmo_23 ) – this land south of 
Courtlands Lane will form a small -scale  development on the northern side of 
Exmouth to accommodate around 12 new homes.  
 Land to the South of Littleham ( Exmo_17 ) – this land on the northern 
eastern side of Exmouth is  proposed for a mixed -use development to provide 
410 new homes and 1.6 hectares of employment and community uses land.   
 Land directly to the East of Liverton Business Park ( Exmo_1 8) – this land 
east of Liverton Business Park is allocated for employment us es and will form 
an extension to the existing business park and extends to around 3 hectares in 
size.  
 Land at St John’s ( Exmo_20   the proposal is to a llocat e Exmo_ 20b as 
shown on the Policies Map ) – this land to south of St John’s on the eastern 
side of E xmouth is proposed for proposed for 150 new homes and 0.6 hectares 
of employment land.  
 Land at Courtlands Cross ( Lymp_07 ) – this land at Courtlands Cross is 
proposed for 100 new homes and 0.4 hectares of employment land.  
 Land off Summer Lane ( Lymp_08 ) – this land off Summer Lane is proposed 
as an allocation for 14 new homes.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
70 In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
 
Total new homes  proposed for allocation at Exmouth =  1,033 
Total land area proposed for employment at Exmouth = 6.6 hectares  
 
 
6.12.  On the draft local plan policies  map we identify the sites listed above and we also 
we show alternative site development options where land has been promoted for 
development but  which we do not consider would be appropriate for development.  
What the settlement is like  
6.13.  Exmouth is by some way the largest town in East Devon with a population of 
around 35,700 residents and with 28% of the town’s residents aged 65 plus it has a 
very m arginally lower age profile than East Devon as a whole.  There are around 
18,770 economically active residents in the town with an employment density of 
0.61. This means that there is a substantia l net outflow (around 6,500) of employed 
residents living in  the town commuting to jobs in other locations. Around 3,818 
residents of Exmouth travel to jobs in Exeter.   
6.14.  Exmouth grew rapidly in Victorian times as a popular seaside resort and tourism still 
forms an important part of the town’s economy.  Water sport enthusiasts are drawn 
to Exmouth’s estuary and coastal waters though its sandy beaches and other 
attractions also support a more traditional tourism trade . 
6.15.  Exmouth is very well supplied with services and facilities with a large secondary 
school and primary  schools, a variety of shops, sports facilities, a library, GP, 
hospital, railway station and regular bus services.  The town centre, where most 
facilities are located, is positioned in a south westerly part of Exmouth.  A 
consequence of this is that towar ds the outer edges of the town many residents are 
comparatively remote from some services and as such can be car dependent.  
6.16.  The Exe Estuary on the western side of the town is an internationally important 
wildlife site on account of supporting important bir d populations whilst the 
Pebblebed Heaths to the east of the town are also of international biodiversity 
importance.  Exmouth also has a rich built heritage with a conservation area 
designated around the core commercial centre of the town and many listed 
buildings.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.17.  The parished area of Exmouth is covered by a neighbourhood plan ‘made’ in 
2019.   A number of the sites put forward for allocation to support the expansion of 
Exmouth to the north lie within th e parish of Lympstone , which has its own ‘made’ 
neighbourhood plan (2015).  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
71 6.18.  The Exmouth Neighbourhood Plan highlights concerns that infrastructure provision 
has not kept pace with housing development and places protection of the natural 
environment as its top priority, including the setting of existing development, green 
corridors/networks and green spaces in the built -up area.    Valued green areas  
include the  proposed Littleham/ Maer Valley Park, in which t wo potential sites 
considered for allocation lie (wholly or in part ).    In terms of any new housing 
generally, the Exmouth Neighbourhood Plan highlights the need to ensure a good 
mix is made available, particularly homes suitable for older people or as lifetime 
homes by design.  
6.19.  A high priority is also pl aced on enabling more and better local employment 
opportunities, and improvements in a wide range of community facilities and 
services.   The Plan sets out differing community views regarding the regeneration 
schemes promoted through the adopted Local Plan and 2011 Exmouth Masterplan 
and includes support for the phased regeneration of Queen’s Drive  for 
tourism/leisure uses .   
6.20.  In terms of the Lympstone Neighbourhood Plan  (2015 to 2026), the key message 
here is that this seeks to retain the rural identity of t he parish and has a key aim to 
avoid any steps towards coalescence with Exmouth.  It furthers this aim with policy 
that seeks to reinforce the Green Wedge within the adopted Local Plan, and to 
resist development within it.  Key objectives are also to keep agricultural land within 
the parish available for future food and energy production, and to ensure any 
development in the plan area bring benefits to the Neighbourhood Area.   Several of 
the sites identified for possible ‘second choice’ allocation within L ympstone parish 
that could form a  potential northern extension to Exmouth are within the Green 
Wedge area .  Others  are greenfield sites, some of which are currently in agriculture 
use.    
Suitability for development  
6.21.  Exmouth is by some way the largest town in East Devon and it contains the 
greatest number and range of services and facilities, it has been categorised as the 
only Tier 1 settlement.  There are strategically positive reasons why Exmouth could 
be a good future location for growth and development but it is also greatly 
constrained by areas of environmental importance and sensitivity.  
6.22.  Exmouth sees a significant number of residents commuting out of the town for work 
purposes, in particular travelling to Exeter.  The town is unusual in having a town 
centre that is very much located in its extreme south westerly corner close to the 
seafront.  One consequence of this is that many of the more recent homes built 
(including much of the later 20th and 21st century developments) are remote from 
the town centr e. 
6.23.  Scope for development at Exmouth, specifically including any outward expansion, 
does  see development set some distance from the town centre services and 
facilities but close to nationally important environmental assets.  The built up East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
72 eastern edges of th e town ar e mostly elevated and close to  the East Devon AONB 
and on the north -eastern side of the town is the biodiversity important Pebblebed 
Heaths.  The western side of Exmouth is flanked by the Exe Estuary which is 
designated in the highest tier of wild life sites.  
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
73 Honiton  
6.24.  The Local Plan strategy establishes Honiton as a Tier 2 settlement and as such as 
an appropriate location for future growth and development.  Plan policy sets out 
land allocations for development and these are shown on the policies m ap along 
with other policy boundaries that are at the town.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
74 21. Strategic Policy – Honiton and its future development  
The sites/areas listed below are potential sites for allocation at Honiton  as shown on 
the Policies Map.  On the policies map sites are colour coded to indicate whether they 
are preferred or 2nd choices sites and we also show sites that have been assessed 
and at this stage rejected as possible choices for allocation for development.  
 Land on the western side of Hayne Lane, Gittisham ( Gitti_03 ) -The site is 
proposed for 5.5 ha of employment land  and will form an extension to the 
existing Heathpark Industrial Estate.    
 Land to the West of Combe Garden Centre, Gittisham (Gitti_04 ) - The site 
is proposed for 9.1 ha of employment land and will form an extension to the 
existing Heathpark Industrial Estate.  
 Land to the west of Hayne Lane ( Gitti_05 ) --The western parts of the site will 
form a medium -scale residential development close to the existing urban 
edges of Honiton to accommodate around 100 new hom es.  The extent of the 
allocation is, however, still to be determined through follow work in 2023.  The 
Polices Map currently shows all of the site falling in the Settlement Boundary 
but the expectation is that this boundary line will be subject to refinem ent to 
ultimately include those (easterly) parts of the site that are determined to be  
appropriate for development and exclude those areas that are determined to 
not be appropriate  for development.  
 Hayne Farm at Hayne Lane ( Gitti_06 ) – This land will form a small -scale 
residential development close to the existing urban edges of Honiton to 
accommodate around 31 new homes.  
 Land at Heathfield, East of Hayne Lane ( Honi_01 ) -, will form a small -scale 
residential extension on the South -West of Honiton to accommo date around 79 
new homes.  
 Land to the north and south of King Street ( Honi_05 ) - This site will form a 
small -scale development in the centre of Honiton to accommodate around 40 
new homes.  
 Former Millwater School at Bottom Road ( Honi_06 ) – This land will fo rm a 
small -scale development in the south part of Honiton to accommodate around 
30 new homes.  
 Land adjacent to St Michaels Church ( Honi_07 ) - This land will form a small -
scale residential extension on the southern side of Honiton to accommodate 
around 30 n ew homes.  
 Land at Ottery Moor Lane ( Honi_10 ) - This land will form a small -scale 
residential extension on the northern side of Honiton to accommodate around 
21 new homes.  
 Land at Middle Hill, Church Hill ( Honi_13 ) -This land  will form a small -scale 
residen tial extension on the southern side of Honiton to accommodate around 
10 new homes.  
 Land at Hurlakes, Northcote Hill ( Honi_14 ) -This land  will form a small -scale 
residential extension on the eastern side of Honiton to accommodate around 
30 new homes.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
75  Land s outh of Northcote Hill  (north o f the railway line)  (GH/ED/39 a) -This 
land will form a medium -scale residential extension on the eastern side of 
Honiton to accommodate around 100 new homes.  
 
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd ch oice sites b eing consulted on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
 
Total new homes proposed for allocation at Honiton = 471 
Total land area proposed for employment at Honiton = 14.6 hectares  
 
We are also , in addition,  proposing the allocation of land with in the existing 
Heathpark industrial estate  as shown on the Policies  Map (as referenced in our 
Employment Monitoring report ) with references Plots 11A, 11B, 11D and 11M – 
these  have a total area of around – 3.3 hectares . 
 
What the settlement is like  
6.25.  Honiton is home to around 11,550 people making it the third largest settlement in 
East Devon.  It has an age profile that is very close to the elderly East Devon 
average, with 29% of residents aged 65 or over.  Around 70%, 5,694 residents, of 
the working age p opulation are economically active though the jobs in the town at 
4,766 fall below this level.  There are 0.84 jobs per worker meaning that there is a 
net out -commute of residents to jobs in other locations, most significantly to Exeter.   
6.26.  Honiton has a ver y good range of facilities and lies in a central part of East Devon 
with a railway station on the Exeter –Waterloo line.  The town is also on the A30 
truck road which for the most part forms a northern edge to current built 
development.  The town centre rem ains vibrant and supports retail and commercial 
activities as well as a wide range of social and community facilities.  The secondary 
school lies on the edge of the town centre and towards the western edge of Honiton 
is the Heathpark business and industria l estate.  This estate forms a key 
employment base for Honiton and surrounding areas. There are two smaller 
supermarkets at/close to Heathpark though the biggest supermarket in the town is a 
Tesco store on south -western side of the town.  
6.27.  The town centre is  dominated by its historic and in parts grand east -west running 
High Street which forms the central part of a Conservation Area within which there 
are a number of listed buildings.  The town enjoys an outstanding landscape setting 
with the Blackdown Hills AONB to the north and the East Devon AONB abutting the 
southern built up edges of the town . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
76 Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.28.  The parish of Honiton has been designated as a neighbourhood plan area since 
2015.  An initial survey of resid ents and businesses was undertaken in 2017 .  Plan 
preparation is not understood to have progressed further, but there has been some 
renewed interest in recent times.  
Suitability for development  
6.29.  The well connected and central to East Devon location of Honit on, and the fact that 
the town has a good range of existing facilities and services supporting a large 
surrounding hinterland, points to it being a good  location  in principle for further 
development.  However, the town is heavily constrained by the AONBs a nd its 
outstanding landscape setting.  A number of the sites promoted for development 
(specifically on the southern edge of Honiton) fall in the East Devon AONB and 
sites submitted to the east and west of the town (outside of the AONBs) are 
nonetheless on land that is sensitive to development in landscape terms, 
development could adversely impact on AONB setting.  Furthermore sites to the 
east and west of the town (especially to the west) are quite remote from the town 
centre, especially so at their outer s ides, and fall beyond comfortable walking 
distance to the centre.  
6.30.  On account of development constraints only modest development at Honiton (at 
this stage of plan making work) is proposed, though allocation is made (carrying 
forward an existing local plan a llocation) for a substantive (around 15 hectares) 
area of land for employment uses to the west of the exi sting Heathpark industrial 
estate.  
6.31.  It is stressed that proposed allocations, at the time of drafting, are based on 
currently available evidence and ini tial site assessment work only.  More detailed 
assessment work and evaluation may lead to amendments and refinement.  All 
boundaries are shown as indicative only at this stage of drafting.  
6.32.  Whilst Honiton has many attributes that would point to it being a g ood location to 
look for a higher level of growth, particularly for new housing development, there 
are significant constraints on the outward expansion of the town.  Though the major 
employment allocation for the town, extending to around 15 hectares in ex tent will 
offer scope to support growth into the longer term of a more substantive and 
strategic scale.  
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
77 Ottery St Mary  
6.33.  The Local Plan strategy establishes Ottery St Mary as a Tier 2 settlement and as 
such as an appropriate location for future growth an d development.  Plan policy 
sets out land allocations for development and these are shown on the policies map 
along with other policy boundaries that are at the town.  
 
22. Strategic Policy – Ottery St Mary and its future development  
 
The sites/areas listed be low are potential sites for allocation at Ottery St Mary as 
shown on the Policies Map . On the policies map sites are colour coded to indicate 
whether they are preferred or 2nd choices sites and we also show sites that have 
been assessed and at this stage r ejected as possible choices for allocation for 
development.  
 
 Barrack Farm ( Otry_01 b) – this land at Barrack Farm, on the western  side of 
Ottery St Mary , is proposed for a mixed -use development to provide around 70 
new homes and 1 .25 hectare of employment l and.   
 Land at Thorne Farm ( Otry_09 ) – this land , which lies west of the town , 
adjacent to the sports centre and school, will provide 90 new homes.  
 Land at Salston Barton ( Otry_10 ) – this land , which lies north and south of 
Salston Barton, is proposed for 20 houses .   
 Land at Bylands, Slade Road ( Otry_15 ) – this garden site on the eastern 
side of the town at Slade Road is proposed for 8 houses.   
 Land south of Strawberry Lane ( GH/ED/27 ) – this land lies south of 
Strawberry Lane and is proposed for 60 houses .  
 Gerway Farm ( GH/ED/29 ) – this land at Gerway Farm, off Sidmouth Road, is 
proposed for 40 houses  
 
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted  on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
 
Total new homes prop osed for allocation at Ottery St Mary  = 288 
Total land area proposed for employment at Ottery St Mary  = 1.25 hectares  
 
What the settlement is like  
6.34.  Ottery St Mary is located fairly centrally in the District, with good transport links to 
Exeter. It is outs ide of the AONB’s, and, whilst it doesn’t have a train station, it does 
have good bus links and access to the strategic road network. These factors 
suggest it is a good location to consider for growth, but there are also constraints. 
The town has a large C onservation Area and historic centre with narrow roads East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
78 which create congestion to the north, east and south which would be exacerbated 
by additional traffic from development in these directions. The River Otter runs 
through the town and has a wide flood pl ain, effectively separating the ‘old’ 
settlement from the newer housing estates which have evolved over the past 40 
years and include the secondary school. New development could offer opportunities 
to improve pedestrian and cycle links between land to the west and the town centre 
as well as an employment site to meet the increased need for jobs and 
enhancement to this ‘gateway’ to the town.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.35.  The neighbourhood plan for Ottery, adopted in July 2018, is a jo int plan also 
covering the adjoining parish of West Hill .   This plan t herefore covers  the ‘Tier 2’ 
town of Ottery St Mary as well as the identified ‘Tier 4’ Service Villages of West Hill 
and Tipton St John.  The neighbourhood plan articulates community co ncern about 
the volume and design of new housing development consented in the period 
leading up to the adoption of the existing Local Plan, and a desire  to ensure the 
response to on -going development pressure is balanced and local character 
maintained .  The Plan’s vision se eks to ensure any new developments are 
appropriately sited, well related , and contribute positively to the locality  whilst  
meeting local needs and ensuring delivery of all necessary infrastructure.   
6.36.  The plan is particularly concerned wit h containing the settlements of Ottery and 
West Hill as separate entities , physically and visually .  To this end, the plan 
identifies a ‘settlement containment’ area  linked to policy . The southern section of 
the ‘settlement containment’ area is of much gre ater sensitivity, so it is proposed to 
designate this a Green Wedge in the local plan.  
6.37.  The need to address  traffic issues in the town centre, and capacity of health and 
education provision, are also key concerns of the neighbourhood plan. The site 
adjacen t to the King’s School is safeguarded for education / community use in NP 
plan policy (NP24 ). Devon County Council advise that part of the site may be 
required for education purposes, and therefore this is retained in the local plan, but 
the remainder is a vailable for housing  which is understood to be necessary to help 
fund the education uses . 
Suitability for development  
6.38.  As a Tier 2 settlement Ottery St Mary is considered suitable, in principle, for 
significant growth. The town lies outside of, but close to , the AONB on the south 
and west. Expansion to the north, south and east is heavily constrained by the 
narrow approach roads to the town, the extensive Conservation Area and settings 
of Grade 1 and 2* listed buildings, and the floodplain of The River Otter . Land to the 
west of the town is relatively unconstrained and there is potential for westward 
expansion, recognising that a green wedge has been designated to prevent 
coalescence between Ottery St Mary and West Hill village.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
79   
6.39.  The proposed site for devel opment  land at Barrack Farm lies wholly within the 
‘settlement containment’ area covered by Neighbourhood Plan policy NP4, however 
this development would not be seen in the context of West Hill due to topography, 
and the settlements would remain physically  and visually separate.  
 
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
80 Seaton   
6.40.  The Local Plan strategy establishes Seaton as a ‘Main Centre ’ (Tier 2 settlement ) 
and as such as an appropriate location for significant development  to serve its own 
needs and that of wider surrounding areas .  Plan poli cy sets out land allocations for 
development and these are shown on the policies map along with other policy 
boundaries that are at the town.  
 
23. Strategic Policy – Seaton and its future development  
The sites/areas listed below are potential  sites for allocat ion at Seaton as shown on 
the Policies Map . On the policies map sites are colour coded to indicate whether they 
are preferred or 2nd choice sites and we also show sites that have been assessed 
and at this stage rejected as possible choices for allocation f or development.  
 Land at Barnards Hill Lane (Seat_02)  is allocated  for around 40 dwellings. In 
order to ensure no adverse effect on the integrity of the Beer Quarry and 
Caves SAC, suitable avoidance/  mitigation/compensation measures will need 
to be identifi ed. 
 Land to the south of Harepath Hill (Seat_03)  is allocated for around 70 
dwellings. In order to ensure no adverse effect on the integrity of the Beer 
Quarry and Caves SAC, suitable avoidance/  mitigation/compensation 
measures will need to be identified . 
 Land off Harepath Road  (Seat_0 5) is allocated for around 100 dwellings  and 
2.2 hectares of employment land. The employment land is located  in the field  
immediately north of the existing Harepath Road Industrial  Estate . In order to 
ensure no adverse effect on the integrity of the Beer Quarry and Caves SAC, 
suitable avoidance/mitigation/compensation measures will need to be 
identified.  
 Land at Clay Common (Seat_09)  is allocated  for around 7 dwellings.   
 
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choi ce sites being consulted on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
Total new homes proposed for alloca tion at Seaton = 21 7 
Total land area proposed for employment at Seaton = 2.2 hectares  
 
What the settlement is like  
6.41.  Seaton is home to around 7, 500 people, making it the fourth largest settlement in 
East Devon.  It has one of the most elderly age profiles of any settlement in the 
district, with 45% of residents aged 65 or over.  This is reflected in a relatively low 
potential workforce in Seaton.  Nevertheless, the number of jobs in Seaton is lower 
than the number of workers (0.73 jobs per worker), meaning that many people have East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
81 no option but to commute elsewhere to work. Just over a third of residents work in 
Seaton, with Exeter, Axminster, and Sid mouth being the next most popular places 
to work.  
6.42.  Seaton has a wide range of community facilities, with a variety of shops, sports 
facilities, a library, GP, hospital, and regular bus service around the settlement and 
to areas elsewhere.  However, it is mi ssing some of the strategic facilities found in 
some other larger settlements, such as a train station and secondary school.  The 
A3052 runs to the north of Seaton, with the strategic road network offering wider 
road links around 5 miles away.  
6.43.  Seaton is se t within a stunning natural environment with the coast to the south 
(including the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site), Seaton Wetlands along the 
eastern boundary, and the East Devon AONB located beyond to the east.  Two 
scheduled monuments in close proxim ity indicate the high historic value in the area, 
along with a conservation area and several listed buildings in and around the town 
centre.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.44.  There is no neighbourhood plan available at the present time.   The parish of Seaton 
was designated as neighbourhood plan area in 2016.  Work on plan preparation 
has not progressed  to date , although there has been some renewed interest in 
recent times . 
Suitability for development  
6.45.  The population and range of community  facilities and services in Seaton make it an 
appropriate place to locate a relatively large amount of housing and employment 
development.  The amount of development should be limited to an extent, as new 
residents will need to travel elsewhere to access s ome strategic facilities which are 
lacking in Seaton (train station, secondary school, swimming pool).  The 
environmental constraints around Seaton also limit its growth, with the River Axe 
and associated flood zone to the east,  AONB also to the east,  a rising landscape to 
the west, and sea to south, all limiting the realistic options for future development.

82 Sidmouth  
 
6.46.  The Local Plan strategy establishes Sidmouth  as a Tier 2 settlement and as such 
as an appropriate location for future growth and developme nt.  Plan policy sets out 
land allocations for development and these are shown on the policies map along 
with other policy boundaries that are at the town.  
 
24. Strategic Policy – Sidmouth  and its future development  
 
The sites/areas listed below are potentia l sites for allocation at Sidmouth  as shown on 
the Policies Map. Sites are colour coded  on the policies map  to indicate whether they 
are preferred or 2nd choices sites and also where sites have been assessed and at 
this stage rejected as possible choices for  allocation for development.  
 
 Land south west of Woolbrook Road (Sidm_01 ) -This land  to the north west 
of Sidmouth , is proposed for 127 new homes  and 0.51 hectare of employment 
land.  
 Land west of Two Bridges Road, Sidford (Sidm_06 ) -  The proposed 
allocati on is land to the east of the site (as shown as Sidm_06a on the policies 
map) only with a reduced site area at a much lower capacity than the original 
submitted site.  The site would form a small -scale development to the north of 
Sidford to accommodate arou nd 30 new homes.  
 Peak Coach House, (Numbers 1 -3 Belfry Cottages), Cotmaton Road 
(Sidm_17 ) -This site  to the south west coastal fringe of Sidmouth , is proposed 
for 11 new homes .     
 
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice  sites being con sulted on 
were allocated , this would lead to the following:  
Total new homes proposed for allocation at Sidmouth = 168 
Total land area proposed for employment at Sidmouth = 0.51 hectares  
 
We are also proposing allocation of site Sidm_24 as an employment sit e for a  
further  additional 1.6 Hectares of land.  
 
What the settlement is like  
6.47.  Sidmouth is the second most populous settlement in East Devon, with around 
13,300 people.  43% of residents are aged 65 or over, making it one of the most 
elderly settlements in  East Devon and, consequently, relatively few working age 
people.  There is currently a good balance of jobs to workers in Sidmouth (1 to 1) 
and, although it is relatively self -contained, there remains a significant number of 
residents working elsewhere, w ith nearly one in five workers commuting from 
Sidmouth to Exeter.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
83 6.48.  There are a wide range of community facilities and services in Sidmouth, including 
a secondary school, numerous shops, health facilities, and a swimming pool.  There 
are good bus links to ot her settlements, including three buses an hour to Exeter.  
However, unlike several of the other larger settlements, Sidmouth does not have a 
train station.  The A3052 runs along the northern edge of Sidmouth, providing east 
to west road links; whilst the s trategic road network (A30 and A35) can be accessed 
at Honiton around 10 miles to the north.  
6.49.  The East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty wraps itself tightly around 
three sides of Sidmouth, providing a picturesque setting for the town.  To the south  
lies the beautiful beach, part of which is within the Jurassic Coast World Heritage 
Site.  Sidmouth also has an outstanding historic environment, with much of the 
southern half of the town covered by conservation areas and home to numerous 
listed building s. 
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.50.  Sidmouth is covered by the Sid Valley Neighbourhood Plan which was ‘made’ in 
late 2019.  The plan’s vision is to maintain and promote the rural and coastal beauty 
of the setting and local distinctive  character of place, whilst encouraging a vibrant , 
more balanced and self -sustaining community an d economy.  It supports  
appropriate change that will bring local benefit and tackle key issues , such as lack 
of affordable housing.   
6.51.  The Plan generally seeks to prevent unnecessary encroachment of development 
beyond the settlement boundary.  However, in recognition of the shortage of social 
and affordable homes, particularly for younger people and families, the plan adopts 
a cautiously positive policy stance to  enable small scale ‘exception’ schemes for 
mixed affordable and market schemes .  This is limited to such schemes which  
specifically meet identified local need  and tie occupancy of both affordable and 
market homes to those with a connection to the parish.   Notwithstanding this, the 
plan flags that development adjacent to the built up area at Sidmouth and Sidford in 
particular would require careful consideration, primarily  in terms  of the setting.   At 
Sidford, the neighbourhood plan is also concerned with preventing settlement 
coalescence with Sidbury and the  site considered here for allocation (reference 
Sidm_06) does fall within the identified “Sidford -Sidbury Non -Coalescence Area ”.  
Within this area, plan policy (3) considers development could only be ac ceptable if it 
would  not impact on visual and physical separation of Sidford and Sidbury.   
6.52.  On all housing developments of 11 units or more, the Plan is prescriptive about the 
required make -up of scheme s, by number of bedrooms and type of tenure, in order 
to align to local needs.   
6.53.  On other matters, the plan seeks to : retain existing employment sites ; support the 
town centre to thrive and the redevelopment of the ‘eastern town’/port royal ; 
facilitate home working ; protect designated Local Green Spaces and k ey views ; 
support and enhance community facilities, and the built and natural environment.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
84 Suitability for development  
6.54.  Social and economic factors make Sidmouth a suitable place to locate a relatively 
large amount of development, with a reasonably large po pulation and a range of 
jobs, community facilities and services in the town.  However, the outstanding 
natural environment – AONB to the west, north, and east, and the sea to south – 
presents a major constraint to the amount and location of new development . 
Local Centres  
6.55.  There are five local centres (Tier 3 settlements) that are explicitly identified as 
offering scope for development in the local plan, these are:  
 Broadclyst ; 
 Budleigh Salterton ; 
 Colyton ; 
 Lympstone ; and   
 Woodbury . 
6.56.  Plan policy sets out land al locations for development at the local centres  and these 
are shown on the policies map along with other policy boundaries that are at the 
local centres . 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
85 25. Strategic Policy – Development at Local Centres   
The sites/areas listed below are considered to be pot ential sites for allocation  for 
development in/at East Devon’s Local Centres. On the policies map sites are colour 
coded to indicate whethe r they are preferred or 2nd choices sites and we also show 
sites that have been assessed and at this stage rej ected a s possible choices for 
allocation for development.  
 
Broadclyst  
 Brcl_09 - Land at Heathfield (Southeast of Woodbury View), Broadclyst , is 
proposed for 1 5 new homes.  
 Brcl_12 - Land west of Whimple Road, Broadclyst , is proposed for 136 new 
homes  and 0.54 hec tare of employment land.  
 Brcl_29 - Land to east of Town End, Broadclyst , is proposed for 24 new 
homes and 0. 1 hectare of employment land (Site is adjacent to Brcl_ 12). 
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted on 
were   allocated this would lead to the following:  
Total new homes proposed for allocation at Broadclyst  = 175 
Total land area proposed for employment at Broadclyst  = 0.64 Ha 
 
Budleigh Salterton  
 Budl_01 – Land adjacent to Clyst Hayes Farmhouse  – Small parts of this 
site are a ‘second choice’ site for 50 new homes  and 0.2 hectares of 
employment land .  But which parts are still to be determined through follow on 
work that will need to be undertaken in 2023 and as drafted the Policies Map 
shows all of the site fall ing outside of the Settlement Boundary.  On the 
Policies Map the site is given a “to be determined” shading classification.  
 Budl_02 and Budl_03 – Land at Barn Lane  are proposed as a ‘second 
choice’ allocation for 82 new homes and 0.3 hectares of employment  land.  
 Budl_06 – Budleigh Salterton Community Hospital  is allocated for 20 new 
homes.  This is a preferred allocation.  
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
Total new homes proposed for allocation at Budleigh Salterton = 152 
Total land area proposed for employment at B udleigh Salterton  = 0.5 Ha 
 
Colyton  
 Coly_02 – Land at Hillhead  is proposed for 25 new homes on the northern 
part of the site as a preferred choice w ith a further 24 on the southern part of 
the site being considered as a 2nd choice site.  
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
Total new homes proposed for all ocation at Colyton = 49 
Total land area proposed for employment at Colyton = 0 Ha East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
86  
Lympstone  
 Lymp_01  - Little Paddocks, 22 Underhill Crescent, Lympstone , is 
proposed for 14 new homes.  
 GH/ED/72  - Land at Meeting Lane, Lympstone , is proposed for 1 31 new 
home s and 0.52  hectare of employment land . 
 GH/ED/73  - Land north west of Strawberry Hill, Lympstone , is proposed for 
46 new homes and 0.18 hectare of employment land.  
 GH/ED/75  - Land off Grange Close, Lympstone , is proposed for 6 new 
homes . 
In the event that a ll preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
Total new homes proposed for allocation at Lympstone =  197 
Total land area proposed for employment at Lympstone = 0.7 Ha 
 
Woodbury  
 Wood_10 - Land at Gilbrook  is allocated for around 60 dwellings  and 0.24 
hectares of employment land . 
 Wood_16 - Land south of Broadway  is allocated for around 67 dwellings  and 
0.27 hectares of employment land . 
 Wood_20 - Land east of Town Lane  is allocated for around  28 dwellings  and 
0.11 hectares of employment land . 
 Wood_23 - Ford Farm  is allocated for around 18 dwellings.  
In the event that all preferred allocations and 2nd choice sites being consulted on 
were  allocated this would lead to the following:  
Total new ho mes proposed for allocation at Woodbury = 173 
Total land area proposed for employment at Woodbury =  0.62 Ha 
 
 
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
87 Broadclyst  
What the settlement is like  
6.57.  Broadclyst is a medium -sized village situated approximately 5 miles to the north -
east of Exeter. It is well -known for its rich history being set in the heart of the 
National Trust’s Killerton estate. Much of the village and surrounding land is owned 
by the trust itself.  
6.58.  The village has a range of services and facilities including a primary, secondary 
school and regular bus service into Exeter.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.59.  The preparation of a neighbourhood plan for the entire parish of Broadclyst has 
long been under development and is now well advanced.  The plan is currently at  
examination and is therefore  progressing through the final stages of plan making 
alongside and ahead of the new Local Plan.     
6.60.  Unlike the majority of our neighbourhood plans, and in addition to the significant 
strategic growth the area has seen under the  current Local Plan, the plan proposes 
multiple sites for development (housing, employment, community facilities) in 
various locations across the parish, including the same site (reference Brcl_09)  
proposed for allocation here by the emerging Local Plan at Broadclyst village.  An 
employment allocation at Winter Gardens, Broadclyst is also adjacent to the more 
substantial proposed housing and employment allocation in this emerging Local 
Plan (site references Brcl_12 and Brcl_29).    
6.61.  Whilst also wanting to see local character and landscape protected, the draft Plan 
puts continuing to ‘develop and thrive’ and meet the ‘changing and diverse needs’ 
of its ‘rapidly growing community’ at the centre of its vision.  The plan articulates 
concerns about pressure on servi ces and infrastructure from the level and pace of 
new development in the vicinity.  It is also generally ambitious in nature as it strives 
to maximise opportunities to respond to  climate change and promote sustainability.  
6.62.  If site  Brcl_09  is allocated throu gh the making of the neighbourhood plan  ahead of 
the new Local Plan , it is not expected that the new Local Plan would retain this 
allocation and would instead rely on the neighbourhood  plan policy .  On other sites 
allocated  sites in the Local Plan, the nei ghbourhood plan policies could be utilised 
in helping to shape t he development, including through any master -planning work 
undertaken . 
Suitability for development  
6.63.  Whilst there are sensitivities  to development in respect of Broadclyst , particularly 
with res pect to the historic environment  and the Killerton estate setting , Broadclyst  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
88 is outside the AONB and relatively flat when compared to other parts of East 
Devon. Given these attributes, its close proximity to Exeter alongside nearby large -
scale employment developments in the west -end, the town is considered to be a 
strategically logical and attractive location to accommodate development in the 
Local Plan.  
6.64.  However, any future development needs to be balanced to ensure that local 
services and facilities can a ccommodate an increased population and the special 
qualities of the village aren’t negatively impacted.  
6.65.  Whilst an allocation of around 175 dwellings would represent a sizeable expansion 
to the village, this is not considered unreasonable to accommodate gi ven the 
village’s strategically attractive location and relative insensitivity of the sites 
proposed.  
6.66.  The village currently has approximately one job for every 2 residents of working age 
and unsurprisingly, a large number of residents commute into Exeter given its 
proximity. Whilst this will likely remain an attractive option, if it is considered a 
reasonable approach to accommodate strategic scale development it will be 
important for an element of this to be for employment uses, to discoura ge out -
commutin g where possible.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
89 Budleigh Salterton  
What the settlement is like  
6.67.  Budleigh Salterton is the seventh largest settlement in East Devon with a population 
of around 5,400. About 45% of residents are aged 65 or over (significantly above 
the East Devon average of  30%), with 12% aged between 0 -15. There are some 
1,900 economically active people and an employment density of 0.7, which shows 
that there are fewer jobs than workers.  
6.68.  The Town  has a limited range of strategic, but a full range of local services and 
facilities. There is no railway line and the main road access is via the B3178.  
6.69.  Budleigh Salterton  has an extremely attractive landscape setting, being the only 
town located within the East Devon AONB. It is located on the World Heritage 
coastline, with cliffs designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, as is the 
Otter Estuary, which is also a Marine Conservation Area.  
6.70.  Set within a  very attractive environment, there is  a conservation area around the  
town  centre and around 40 listed buildings. Much of the special character derives 
from Budleigh Salterton's  rich and varied domestic architecture. There are many 
examples of Regency Villas and high quality early Twentieth Century housing, 
some influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and many outside of th e 
conservation area.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.71.  Budleigh Salterton parish has a neighbourhood plan, ‘made’ in 2017 .  The plan 
focuses on seeking to protect and enhance the existing qualities of the area (built 
and natural) and to  further improvements in facilities/services and infrastructure to 
fulfil the wishes  and meet the needs of the local community (primarily via a suite of 
identified ‘community actions’).   
6.72.  The plan supports a ‘modest scale’ of housing to meet local needs, a ligned to the 
adopted Local Plan strategy for the town (to 2031), but does not make any further 
allocations itself.  It does however designate 10 formal Local Green Spaces for 
protection, including the hospital garden, which is adjacent to but not the same  as 
the site proposed for potential allocation for residential use (Budl_06). The 
neighbourhood plan also seeks to support small businesses to sustain themselves.   
6.73.  Overall, however, the plan focuses on seeking to ensure any development 
proposed does not h ave a detrimental impact on the form, character and setting of 
the area, with a particular focus on heritage and natural environment/green space 
designations  (including the surrounding AONB, and current green wedge , within 
which one of the ‘second choice’ proposed allocations (parts of Budl_01) lies ). East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
90 Suitability for development  
6.74.  The exceptional landscape quality and coastal location of Budleigh Salterton 
constrains its potential for development. Furthermore, there is limited potential for 
employment growth to address the existing lack of opportunities for local 
employment, although it is close to Exmouth with good bus links. In terms of the 
scale of the settlement and it’s ‘tier 3’ status there is a case for promoting some 
development in the tow n.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
91 Colyton  
What the settlement is like  
6.75.  Colyton is the ninth largest settlement in East Devon with a population of around 
2,200. About 36% of residents are aged 65 or over (above the East Devon average 
of 30%), with 14% aged between 0 -15. There are some 900 economically  active 
people and an employment density of 0.63, which shows that there are fewer of 
jobs than workers.  
6.76.  Colyton has a limited range of strategic, but a full range of local services and 
facilities. There is no railway line and main road access is via the B 3161 from 
Colyford.  
6.77.  The historic core of Colyton has a very tight grain with over 40 listed buildings in the 
conservation area, which also includes fields to the north of the town.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.78.  A neighbourhood plan for the parish of Colyton was ‘made’  in January this year 
(2022) .  The Plan seeks to support sustainable growth in housing and population, 
including to ensure local needs are met, but does not allocate any sites.  Instead , it 
relies on opportunities within  the current  Built up Area Boundary for Colyton, 
including the redevelopment of the Ceramtec site by Wainhomes .  It is also 
supportive in principle of potential rural exceptions sites to deliver affordable 
housing, within strict criteria.  
6.79.  The neighbourhood  plan has demonstrated strong community support for 
reinforcement of the Green Wedges to prevent coalescence of Colyton, Colyford 
and Seaton .  It also includes  policies to protect and enhance landscape setting, 
biodiversity, local character, and heritage, and to promote development of 
brownfield sites.  
Suitability for development  
6.80.  The good level of services and facilities in Colyton suggest that it would be a good 
location in principle for some growth, although the majority of sites currently 
available for d evelopment are considered to be unsuitable. There is an outline 
planning permission for up to 72 new homes on previously developed land to the 
north west of the town (the Ceramtec site). One additional site is recommended for 
allocation. It is close to the town centre and well related to the existing settlement 
pattern , albeit elevated above the town .  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
92 Lympst one 
What the settlement is like  
6.81.  Lympstone  is the eleventh  largest settlement in East Devon with a population of 
around 1,900. About 2 6% of residents a re aged 65 or over ( below  the Eas t Devon 
average of 30%), with 20 % aged between 0 -15. There are some 809  economically 
active people a nd an employment density of 0.46 , which shows that there are fewer 
of jobs than workers.  
6.82.  Lympstone  has a good range of serv ices and facilities including a regular train into 
Exeter and down to Exmouth.  
6.83.  The historic core of Lympstone has a range of listed buildings covered by a 
conservation area.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.84.  The Lymp stone Neighbourhood Plan (2015 to 2026) seeks to retain the rural 
identity of the parish, whilst supporting and furthering a functioning sustainable 
community.  In recognition of local housing need, particularly for smaller homes for 
downsizers, the plan made its own allocati ons for 40 dwellings across 4 sites over 
the plan  period, within the adopted Built -up Area Boundary  of Lympstone . 
6.85.  The plan is generally supportive of continued small -scale piecemeal growth only, 
preferably on smaller sites (less than 10 dwellings), and to meet identified local 
housing needs.  The plan also seeks an increase in workshop and storage space 
for small businesses, and protection and enhancement of community facilities and 
services.    
6.86.  Key aims of the plan in terms of consideration of future devel opment include: 
preventing coalescence with Exmouth and resisting development in the current 
Green Wedge and Coastal Preservation Area; keeping agricultural land available 
for future food and energy production; furthering flood prevention, and; securing 
high quality, sympathetic and environmentally sustainable design.   
6.87.  Three of the four  sites put forward here as pr oposed  allocations (excepting site 
reference GD/ED/75) were also appraised during the process of preparing the 
neighbourhood plan for allocation  within it and were discounted at that time (save 
for an area already consented at  GD/ED/73 for 15 homes).  
6.88.  An exercise to review the neighbourhood plan was undertaken last year (2021), but 
work has  not yet commenced on any revi sed or replacement plan .  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
93 Suitability for development  
6.89.  Lympstone is a medium -sized village situated along the Exe Estuary 5 miles to the 
south of Exeter. It is well -known for its stunning views over the river and rich 
heritage, with over 70 listed buildings and a little -changed village  core.  
6.90.  The village has a range of services and facilities including a primary school, train 
service and regular bus service into Exeter. It also benefits from being on the route 
of the Exe Estuary trail. Although these offer opportunities for growth, the Exe 
Estuary is a particularly sensitive European protected nature site which presents a 
significant barrier to future large scale development. The A376 also experiences 
significant congestion at peak times.  
6.91.  Taking into account the opportunities and constr aints, the village is considered a 
suitable location for a low to moderate level of growth in the Local Plan.  
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
94  
Woodbury  
What the settlement is like  
6.92.  Woodbury has a population of around 1,700 people, with an age range that is 
slightly younger than the di strict average.  This is shown by the relatively high 
potential workforce in the settlement.  However, there are relatively few jobs 
available in Woodbury compared to the number of workers (jobs to workers ratio of 
0.39), meaning that most people have to c ommute elsewhere to work.  
6.93.  There are a good range of community facilities in Woodbury, with several shops, a 
GP, and a primary school, along with an hourly bus service.  These make 
Woodbury one of the 10% least deprived areas in terms of access to services,  and 
mean that it plays an important local role for the settlement and surrounding area.  
The B3179 runs through the settlement, and is well -used by vehicles, including 
HGVs.  The M5, and Exeter beyond, lies just four miles to the west.  
6.94.  Woodbury is located  in a wider rural landscape, and is of high historic value.  The 
central part of the settlement is designated as a conservation area, with numerous 
listed buildings – the most notable of which is the Grade I listed church.  
Key messages from the Neighbourho od Plan for the area  
6.95.  Woodbury parish was designated as a neighbourhood plan area in 2013.  A pre-
consultation draft was shared informally with EDDC officers for comment in 2021  
and since that time, a health check has been undertaken by an independent 
exami ner.   This document is not yet published  and work by a Steering Group is 
said to be on-going  to finalise a consultation draft .  Whilst it would not be 
appropriate to quote draft content that is not in the public domain, suffice is to say 
that the plan is not currently anticipated to p ut forward land for development.  The  
devel opment put forward in this emerging Local Plan through proposed allocations 
here would likely be at odds with the emerging neighbourhood plan  vision/strategy .   
Suitability for develo pment  
6.96.  The wide range of local facilities and services in Woodbury make it an appropriate 
place for development  to meet local needs and those of immediate surrounds .  The 
current relative lack of jobs in Woodbury provides justification for employment land 
to be delivered  alongside housing .  The central part of Woodbury is of high historic 
value, but there are no landscape or biodiversity designations in the immediate 
vicinity of the settlement.  Beyond this, the East Devon AONB is around 500m from 
the easter n edge of Woodbury.  Further still are the European sites of the 
Pebblebed Heaths 1 .5km  to the east, and the Exe Estuary nearly 3km  to the west.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
95 Service Villages  
6.97.  There are 23 ‘service villages’ that are identified as offering specific scope for 
developme nt in the local plan, these  are: 
 
1. Beer,  
2. Branscombe,  
3. Broadhembury,  
4. Chardstock,  
5. Clyst St Mary,  
6. Dunkeswell,

are shown on the policies map along with other policy boundaries that are at or 
close to these villages .

  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
100 Beer   
What the settlement is like  
6.99.  Beer is an attractive, large, village with around 1300 residents, located on the coast 
between Sidmouth and Seaton. It has thriving tourist and fishing industries and a 
vibrant shopping centre. 66% of the popula tion are economically active, and a lot of 
residents are employed locally. Much of the countryside around the village is 
designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and/or Coastal Preservation Area  
(which is an existing Local Plan designation) . Beer Quar ry Caves (famous for 
providing the local building stone) is home to several species of protected bat and is 
designated a County Wildlife Site, Special Area of Conservation and Site of Special 
Scientific Interest.  
6.100.  The historic core of the village is a desig nated Conservation Area and there are 
numerous listed buildings within and around it. Beyond the centre, housing is a mix 
of cottages, post -war housing and recent development, characterised by its modest 
form and often terraced layout.  
Key messages from t he Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.101.  Beer has had a ‘made’ neighbourhood plan in place since January 2019 .  This 
seeks to sustain Beer as a vibrant and strong community and included the 
allocation of a site for 31 homes  (since successfully  developed by its C ommunity 
Land Trust ).  The Plan is supportive of community -led development and small -scale 
schemes to deliver affordable and accessible housing to meeting local needs .  
However,  this must not compromise  the unique character, landscape and setting of 
Beer .  To this end, the plan  includ es reinforcement of the green wedge to prevent 
coalescence with Seaton together with  protection of the undeveloped coast and 
numerous heritage and environmental assets.  
Suitability for development  
6.102.  Beer has a good range of servi ces and facilities and as such it could, in principle, 
be seen as a positive location to accommodate development.  However the 
steepness of surrounding hills, and those in the village itself place very significant 
constraints on scope for development.  
6.103.  One site was put forward for residential development at Beer (as indicated on the 
map). This site is located within the Are a of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the locally 
designated  Coastal Preservation Area and in close proximity to the Jurassic Coast 
World Heri tage Site Special Area of Conservation and Site of Special Scientific 
Interest. Access to this site is very poor and residential development is considered 
to result in an unacceptable visual impact. Therefore, no sites are currently put 
forward to be allocated for development in the Local Plan although a Built up Area 
Boundary will be designated around the existing village.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
101 Branscombe   
What the settlement is like  
6.104.  Branscombe is a linear village, formed along a valley sid e, and comprising several 
small clust ers of houses linked by narrow, largely unpavemented and unlit rural 
roads. Most facilities are located in the eastern cluster, which is a considerable 
distance from the westernmost housing (residents of which cannot safely or quickly 
walk to the village f acilities). The surrounding landscape is of exceptional quality 
and considerable pressure is placed on local infrastructure by tourists, especially 
those using private cars to access the beach.  
6.105.  Existing housing in Branscombe is of mixed character. There a re a number of listed 
buildings, mainly cottages and farmhouses, which form the core of the village .  
Linear ribbons of housing stretch westwards , compris ing a mix of historic cottages 
and post -war terraced and semi -detached housing. Despite this mix, the houses 
share a similar scale and form and the topography creates a regularity of plot size 
and layout.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.106.  There is currently no Neighbourhood Plan for Branscombe  and no designated 
Neighbourhood Plan area . 
Suitability for development  
6.107.  Branscombe has very limited potential for new development. The topography is 
steep, with a high degree of visibility and prominence .  Existing development is 
spread along narrow roads, so that any extension westwards would prec lude easy 
access to facilities which are located in the easternmost section.  
6.108.  Two sites were put forward for residential development at Branscombe (as 
indicated on the map). Both sites are located within the Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty to the far wes t of the linear settlement, and both are highly visible in the 
landscape due to the steep topography and very rural landscape. Access to 
facilities from both sites is very poor, requiring residents to walk a considerable 
distance along narrow, unlit, un surfaced roads.  Therefore, no sites are put forward 
for allocat ion for development in the Local Plan .  It is however  currently proposed to 
designate  a Built up Area Boundary around the main cluster/s of development 
which form the existing village.  
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
102 Broadhem bury   
What the settlement is like  
6.109.  Broadhembury is a picturesque, historic village of around 730 residents, situated in 
the north centre of the District. Compared to other parishes in East Devon, 
Broadhembury has a high proportion of working age residents, at 72%, although the 
majority commute out of the Parish for work. It has a small but comprehensive 
range of facilities and is compact in form. The village is characterised by thatched 
cottages and numerous listed buildings, set within an extensive conserva tion area. 
More modern development is located on the periphery of the village. Approximately 
half of the village is within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.110.  A neighbourhood area was designated for  the parish of Broadhembury in 2014.  
Work on drafting a Neighbourhood Plan has been undertaken  but paused in recent 
years to allow a Community Land Trust  to be established  and to consider  potential 
sites for affordable housing delivery .   The neighbourhoo d plan has not gone 
through any formal consultation and finding sites for community -led development 
has proven difficult .  However, indications are that the community wou ld prefer a 
small, single site for development primarily aimed at meeting need for sev eral 
affordable houses.   
Suitability for development  
6.111.  Broadhembury is suitable for limited additional development. Whilst i t has a small 
range of services to meet residents everyday needs  most residents are reliant on 
the private car. The high quality lands cape and range of heritage assets mean that 
any development will need to be of a particularly high quality and small in scale. Of 
the sites submitted for consideration for residential development, four are located 
adjacent to the existing settlement and al l perform similarly well in terms of access 
to facilities and visual impact. All are located just inside the AONB.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
103 Chardstock   
What the settlement is like  
6.112.  Chardstock is a small village in a north easterly part of East Devon most of which, 
the westerly two -thirds, falls within the Blackdown Hills AONB.  The historic core of 
the village is designated as a Conservation Area within which are a number of old 
listed  buildings.  There is also more modern development in Chardstock that is 
concentrated on the east  of the village.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.113.  The parish of Chardstock has a neighbourhood plan, ‘made’ in 2017.   Chardstock 
did not have a Built -up Area Boundary under the adopted Local Plan, and so the 
plan was written from the s tarting point of the area being open countryside in 
strategic policy terms .  The neighbourhood plan gathered further evidence at the 
time that supported that position,  although the vision for the plan stressed that 
Chardstock is a viable community and that  it should protect and maintain what it 
has, whilst seeking to sustain itself  for the future .   
6.114.  The plan articulates that local housing needs and economic welfare are major 
concerns (although evidence at that time showed no immediate need for additional 
housing).  
6.115.  Overall, protection of the natural environment, the built heritage and the strong 
sense of community are all given a high priority .  This is coupled with seeking to 
ensur e that there is no further significant stress placed on the parish’s road syst em 
or compromising of the peaceful rural natur e of the area .  The plan envisages and 
focuses on managing development associated with existing premises, rather than 
any expectation of new build on greenfield sites.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
104 Clyst St Mary   
What the settlement is like  
6.116.  Clyst St Mary is a village comprising of approximately 1,000 residents on the 
western edge of the District, approximately one mile from Exeter. The village is split 
between the old village north of the A3052 and the newer estate to the south. It has 
a ran ge of local facilities and is particularly well catered for jobs with the recent 
employment development at Winslade Park. 
6.117.  The settlement has a series of listed buildings located in the core of the village and 
of particular sensitivity is the old bridge acr oss the Exe, which is a scheduled 
ancient monument.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.118.  Clyst St Mary is covered by the neighbourhood plan for the parish of Bishops Clyst 
(Clyst St Mary and Sowton) which was ‘made’ in 2017.  This recognis es the on -
going development pressure in the area, as well as the constraints, and seeks to 
secure a positive impact from any new development.   
6.119.  In respect of Clyst St Mary village specifically, the aim of the plan is to protect the 
surrounding countryside,  green spaces and trees, and retain a village feel with a 
clear separation from Exeter.  Retention of valued facilities/services and 
improvements in provision, flood prevention and management, alleviating issues 
associated with traffic and supporting safe walking and cycling opportunities also 
feature strongly.   
6.120.  Smaller homes was identified as a particular need locally, but at the time of plan 
writing there was no support for further housing development beyond the adopted 
Local Plan allocation for 150 home s at the Winslade Park site during the plan 
period to 2031.  Similarly, whilst existing businesses uses are supported, 
commercial development beyond the existing areas and brownfield sites is not, and 
retention of land in agricultural use is sought.  
6.121.  Work i s currently under way on reviewing the plan , including independent 
consideration of potential  and alternative sites for development.  
Suitability for development  
6.122.  Clyst St Mary is considered an attractive location to accommodate growth due to 
the range of ser vices and facilities it offers alongside its proximity to Exeter and 
other employment opportunities, which could potentially be accessed by 
sustainable modes of transportation.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
105 6.123.  However, this needs to be weighed against the development which it has 
experie nced in recent years and is still to come, alongside proposals for larger 
scale development in close proximity in the form of a potential new town which 
could impact upon the village. The A3052 in particular suffers from long tailbacks at 
peak times to jun ction 30 and this needs to be considered.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
106 Dunkeswell   
What the settlement is like  
6.124.  Dunkeswell is a large village located to the north centre of the District. It has nearly 
1500 residents, of which 64% are of working age.  Perhaps surprisingly, given the 
large employment site in the village, only 180 of the 571 workforce work locally, with 
391 residents out -commuting daily.  The parish  is wholly within the Blackdown Hills 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  
6.125.  Dunkeswell consists of three parts: a modern housing estate (Highfield) with a 
range of facilities to the south, a central historic core with numerous listed buildings 
and a designated conservation area, and an employment estate to the north east 
on a former airfield (some of the original buildings are liste d). 
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.126.  A neighbourhood plan for the Dunkeswell parish  was ‘made ’ in 2017.  The plan was 
written in the context of the whole of the parish being considered as open 
countryside in the adopted Local Plan, wit h no defined settlement boundary and 
new housing limited to exception sites.  The plan expressly supported this 
approach, and the introduction of a settlement boundary would be a key change.   
6.127.  The neighbourhood plan did not identify any sites for housing a nd placed emphasis 
on protecting the character and setting of the area, given its AONB landscape and 
is largely traditional farmland setting.  The built heritage , including the historic core 
of the village and the historic airfield , are also valued in the plan for their significant 
contribution to local character.   
6.128.  The plan articulates a mixed reception of the local community to the more modern 
development in Dunkeswell .  As a result, it  aims to secure a higher quality and 
more sympathetic design to any ne w development.  It also s eeks  to reduce the 
impact of vehicular traffic and secure more opportunities for walking and cycling , 
including between the old, new and industrial parts of Dunkeswell.  
6.129.  Support for the active on -going use of the airfield site for appropriate uses, subject 
to impact, is expressed, as well as small -scale employment provision more 
generally, to enable more people to live and work in the locality.  
6.130.  Support for any new housing development coming forward is limited to that which 
will mee t identified local need, including sheltered housing, shared ownership 
housing for young people and housing suitable for families wishing to remain in the 
Parish.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
107 Suitability for development  
6.131.  Despite the AONB location, Dunkeswell is considered to be a good location for 
some additional residential development, due to the proximity of employment land 
and local facilities. Additional development could be accommodated without a 
significant impact on the landscape or existing development.  The village is located 
some distance away from the nearest town of Honiton, along narrow rural roads, 
and so the opportunity to increase settlement self -containment and reduce out 
commuting should be a major consideration in the mix and layout of new 
development.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
108 East Budleigh   
What the settlement is like  
6.132.  East Budleigh is a compact village of around 680 residents (of which nearly half are 
retired) located to the southwest  of the District. It is wholly within the East Devon 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The village has a hist oric core with a 
designated conservation area and numerous listed buildings and a range of 
facilities. More modern housing has been constructed on the edges of the village 
but is well integrated. A main road borders the village to the east and development 
beyond this road forms a loose ribbon but does not read as part of the main village.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.133.  East Budleigh is covered by the East Budleigh with Bicton Neighbourhood Plan, 
‘made ’ in 2017.  Recognising the settin g within the AONB and the significant local 
heritage, the plan primarily seeks to protect the existing character and  ensure any 
development respects this and does not detract from it.   
6.134.  A range of green areas across the village are formally designated as L ocal Green 
Spaces for the additional protection that brings from development, and protection 
and enhancement of existing community facilities is a key theme to support 
sustainable living and a sense of community.    The constraints of areas prone to 
floodi ng and of high -grade agricultural land in the immediate vicinity of the village 
are also highlighted.  Following a pilot exercise with EDDC, work flowing from this 
neighbourhood plan has also seen local heritage assets meeting specific criteria 
registered on our Local List for additional protection.  
6.135.  Overall, only small -scale development utilising previously developed land and/or to 
meet local needs is supported, subject to this being of minimal impact to, or 
enhancing, the locality.   
Suitability for develo pment  
6.136.  East Budleigh is a self -contained, compact village and the range of services and 
facilities makes it suitable for small -scale additional development. The village is 
located in the East Devon AONB and  has a considerable number of heritage 
assets.  
6.137.  Sites at the village that were assessed are not considered appropriate to 
accommodate growth.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
109 Exton   
What the settlement is like  
6.138.  Around 1,700 people live in Exton.  ONS population data for Exton includes the 
adjoining Lympstone Commando, which explains the hig h proportion of working 
aged people – at 84%, it is the highest of any settlement in East Devon.  On the 
other hand, Exton has the lowest proportion of 0 -15 year olds (just 5%).  There are 
nearly 2,400 jobs in Exton, over twice the number of workers which mean it imports 
workers.  Again, these figures are inflated due to the inclusion of Lympstone 
Commando in ONS data.   
6.139.  There are relatively few facilities in Exton itself, with a shop, pub, children’s play 
area and village hall,  but it benefits from having a train station, a regular bus 
service, and being located on the Exe Estuary Trail.  These provide sustainable 
travel links to a numerous jobs and facilities in Exeter to the north and Exmouth to 
the south.  The A376 runs through the village, linking with Exeter, Exmouth and the 
M5, which is  three miles away.  
6.140.  The Exe Estuary is internationally important for its wildlife, adjoining the western 
edge of Exton. There are also a few  listed buildings, located in the southern part of 
the village . 
Key messages from  the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.141.  Exton lies in the parish of Woodbury which was designated as a neighbourhood 
plan area in 2013.  A pre -consultation draft of the neighbourhood plan was shared 
informally with EDDC officers for comment in 2021 and since that time, a health 
check has been undertaken by an independent examiner.   The document is not yet 
published and work by a Steering Group is understood to be on -going to finalise a 
consultation draft.   Whilst it would not be appropriate to cite the docume nt at this 
stage, suffice is to say it is not currently anticipated to propose any sites for 
development at the village of Exton, and is likely to raise concerns about traffic and 
flooding in this location.  
Suitability for development  
6.142.  Although Exton has go od sustainable travel links to larger places elsewhere, the 
relative lack of facilities within the settlement itself limits the amount of new housing 
that would be sustainable at the village.  The Exe Estuary (Special Protection 
Area/Ramsar ) to the west an d Lympstone Commando to the south, make the north 
and east the only realistic potential locations for new development beyond the 
existing village.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
110 Feniton   
What the settlement is like  
6.143.  Feniton comprises of two settlements.  Old Feniton is small, has buildin gs of historic 
significance and lies in wooded setting, it is not identified as a location for growth.  
6.144.  New Feniton to its west is, however, a different type of settlement and with a range 
of services and facilities does offer realistic development potentia l. The Exeter -
Waterloo railway line runs through new Feniton with a station located in the village.   
6.145.  It was, indeed, the presence of the railway with a now closed branch line running to 
Sidmouth, and then later a line to Exmouth , that accounted for the hi storic 
development of the village in Victorian times.  In the later parts of the 20th century 
the village expanded considerably with new housing and additional services and 
facilities.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.146.  The neighbourhood  plan covering the whole of Feniton parish was ‘made’ in 2018.  
The plan highlights a need for consideration of the adequacy of infrastructure, 
including education and healthcare provision, road network, rail and bus services, 
and flood alleviation/managem ent, if further growth is proposed.  In view of these 
concerns and several  developments allowed on appeal, the plan did not allocate 
any sites for development and expresse d support for a modest level of 
development over the plan period  (to 2031) , of less t han 50 homes every 5 years.  
6.147.  Overall, the plan supported the principle of small -scale development within the 
Built-up Area Boundary in the adopted Local Plan, alongside objectives to preserve 
and enhance the rural character/setting.   
6.148.  It should be noted th at one site put forward for development, but not currently 
proposed for allocation (reference Feni_04), falls partly outside Feniton 
parish/neighbourhood plan area and instead lies in the parish of Ottery St Mary and 
is covered by the Ottery St Mary and We st Hill Neighbourhood Plan, also ‘made’ in 
2018.  In relation to Feniton, the main thrust of th at neighbourhood  plan is to 
support the delivery of the Feniton to Sidmouth Cycle Link, which is identified in this  
draft Local Plan  document as a key strategic route . 
Suitability for development  
6.149.  The railway station at Feniton and relative proximity to Exeter indicates some 
reasonable suitability for development.  However the villages is accessed by 
country lanes and has a history of flooding, albeit there has bee n past alleviation 
work and there are future plans for future work.   In addition, Feniton has the lowest East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
111 ratio of jobs to workers of any settlement, and a level of facilities commensurate 
with its role as a ‘service village’.  Therefore, adding a significa nt number of new 
homes without employment or other facilities may encourage travel to other places, 
contrary to sustainability objectives.    
6.150.  Notwithstanding constraints on development there were a range of sites at Feniton 
that were submitted for developme nt and assessed as second best possible 
options.  These sites could accommodate a substantial number of new homes.  We 
would welcome feedback on whether a more substantial number of homes should 
be accommodated at the village and if appropriate which sites  could be most 
suitable for development.

112 Hawkchurch   
What the settlement is like  
6.151.  Hawkchurch is a small, rural village on the far eastern edge of the District. It has 
around 570 residents , of which 261 are of working age and 109 commute out  daily,  
and a s mall range of services and school. It is located in an attractive, but 
undesignated, landscape. Hawkchurch is accessed via a network of narrow, 
unpavemented and unlit lanes.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.152.  There is currently no neighb ourhood plan for Hawkchurch.  However, the parish of 
Hawkchurch was designated a Neighbourhood Area in 2015 and work restarted in 
2021 with a new Steering Group in place to progress a neighbourhood plan.  
Community consultation and evidence gathering is un derstood to be on -going . 
Suitability for development  
6.153.  Hawkchurch is a suitable village for small -scale housing and employment 
development, particularly if this will increase its potential for self-containment  given 
the narrow, very rural nature of the roads  between it and Axminster. The village is 
not located in a designated landscape and the preferred site for allocation is well 
screened and discreet in the streetscene.  
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
113 Kilmington   
What the settlement is like  
6.154.  Kilmington is a village with a population of a round 930, 38% of the population are 
65+, which is higher than East Devon average, and 44% of the population are 18 -
64.  
6.155.  The village lies south of the A35, the major road running east west that bisects the 
parish. The main settlement developed on the shelt ered eastern slopes of Shute 
Hill and Kilmington Hill. Most of the parish lies within the East Devon and 
Blackdown Hills AONBs.  
6.156.  Kilmington has a good range of community facilities for its size, including church, 
cricket pavilion, village primary school, pu b, filling station and farm shop. Hourly bus 
service available for travelling to Honiton and Axminster.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.157.  Kilmington is the subject of neighbourhood plan for the whole of Kilmington parish  
which has succe ssfully passed examination and referendum stage and is expected 
to be ‘made’ in October this year (2022) .   
6.158.  Objectives of the plan include:  
 ensuring housing growth is of a scale that is appropriate to the village’s role 
and function and does not adversely  impact upon the ability to accommodate 
demand on facilities and infrastructure, and;  
 to support housing development which meets the identified needs of the local 
community across types and tenures, whilst meeting changing demographic 
and social requireme nts.   
6.159.  To this end, the plan allocate s two sites for residential development  to meet 
identified local needs .  These sites both fall within two sites (references Kilm_09 
and Kilm_11) identified in this emerging Local Plan  as pr oposed preferred 
allocations .  The neighbourhood plan policies include specific requirements for 
these sites, including to secure accessible housing for older residents and 
affordable homes, together with enhancements to the green ‘buffer’ along the A35 
and to footpath links within the  village and set out detailed design criteria.   The 
neighbourhood plan is seeking to support continued ‘slow, incremental growth’, 
which will support the vitality of the village, whilst not exacerbating traffic issues.  
6.160.  As the neighbourhood plan is coming forward ahead of the Local Plan, further 
consideration will need to be given to the relationship and the best approach to 
bringing the land forward in these locations, as well as to any phasing.   The 
neighbourhood plan includes requirements that could be u sed in any master -
planning/development briefs . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
114 Suitability for development  
6.161.  Kilmington has a good range of services and facilities that make it suitable for 
limited development in principle. However, most of the parish lies within AONBs, 
which constrained t he development options.  Most facilities are located to the north 
and east of the settlement and access is constrained by the very narrow, unlit, 
unsurfac ed roads to the south and west of the village.   Sites in those directions are 
less accessible and mor e visually harmful, due to topography and designated 
landscapes.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
115 Musbury   
What the settlement is like  
6.162.  Musbury is a village with a population of around 500. About 37% of residents are 
aged 65 or over (above the East Devon average of 30%), with 11% aged be tween 
0-15. There are some 230 economically active people and an employment density 
of 0.81, which shows that there are fewer jobs than workers.  
6.163.  Musbury has a limited range of strategic, but a good range of local services and 
facilities. There is no railwa y line and road access is via the A358. The historic core 
of the village has several listed buildings and is a conservation area. The whole 
village is in the East Devon AONB.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.164.  There is currently no n eighbourhood plan for Musbury and no desig nated 
Neighbourhood Area. 
Suitability for development  
6.165.  Although Musbury is quite a small settlement, it has a good range of local facilities 
that make it suitable in pr inciple for some modest development and  housing 
allocations ar e shown in the draft local plan.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
116 Newton Poppleford   
What the settlement is like  
6.166.  Newton Poppleford is the twelfth largest settlement with a population of around 
1.800. About 31% of residents are aged 65 or over (similar to the East Devon 
average of 30%), with 16% aged between 0 -15. There are some 800 economically 
active people and an employment density of 0.35, which shows that there are far 
fewer jobs than workers.  
6.167.  Newton Poppleford has a very limited range of strategic, but a good range of local  
services and facilities. There is no railway line and road access is via the busy 
A3052, which runs through the middle of the village. This carries a high level of 
traffic, including HGV’s and at the western end of the High Street is constricted in 
width and lacks safe pedestrian refuge. Cycling and walking along this stretch of 
road is dangerous and there are currently no suitable alternative routes. The 
existing Built -up Area Boundary  defined in the Villages Plan  does not extend to the 
west of the villag e because of the constraints of this section of road (as it was found 
not to be suitable for development).  The new settlement boundary proposed also 
excludes this area.  
6.168.  There are around 20 listed buildings in the village, but no conservation area. The 
whole village is in the East Devon AONB. The River Otter floodplain lies to the east 
of the village and there is a smaller floodplain running through the middle of the 
village.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.169.  Newton Poppleford is covered by the neighbourhood plan for the parish of Newton 
Poppleford and Harpford, ‘made’ in 2021.  The plan articulates how flooding and 
traffic -related matters are key concerns for the local community.  It supports the 
current  approach to the Built -up Area Boun dary (BUAB) in the adopted Villages  
Plan, excluding the western end of the village entirely , and seeks to preserve the 
rural character , AONB landscape setting  and local heritage .  Taking into account  
the number of new homes permitted in recent years and th e constraints to 
development identified, the plan f ound  no need to allocate sites.  Instead , it 
supports small -scale incremental development to meet identified local needs, 
particularly of smaller, affordable and/or accessible homes within or adjacent to t he 
current BUAB, subject to meeting an extensive set of design and other 
criteria/requirements for new development.   
6.170.  The vision seeks a vibrant community and as such it also supports increased 
employment opportunities locally and retention and enhancement  of community 
facilities and services.  In particular, the plan seeks improvement in provision of 
local healthcare/medical facilities as well as traffic and pedestrian movement and  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
117 identifies several  valued ‘assets’ for specific protection, including Local  Green 
Spaces, heritage assets, ‘cherished public views’, and community facilities and 
services.  
Suitability for development  
6.171.  Newton Poppleford is one of our larger villages, with a good range of local services 
and facilities and good bus connections. Howev er, it lies within the East Devon 
AONB, is affected by flooding and a lack of safe pedestrian and cycling routes 
further limit development options in the western part of the village. Narrow lanes 
and poor access to the High Street further inhibit developme nt opportunities. No 
suitable sites have been identified for allocation .East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
118 Otterton  
What the settlement is like  
6.172.  Otterton is a village with a population of around 700. About 30% of residents are 
aged 65 or over (same as the East Devon average), with 17% aged between 0 -15. 
There are some 320 economically active people and an employment density of 
0.75, which shows that there are fewer jobs than workers.  
6.173.  Otterton has a limited range of strategic, but a reasonable range of local services 
and facilities. There is no railway line and road access is via a short stretch of 
unclassified road off the B3178. The historic core of the village has numerous listed 
buildings and is a conservation area. The whole village is in the East Devon AONB.  
Key messages from the Neighbo urhood Plan for the area  
6.174.  Otterton is covered by the neighbourhood plan for the whole parish of Otterton, 
‘made’ in 2021.  The plan focuses on protecting and preserving the natural and built 
character of the area, including through the designation of formal  Local Green 
Spaces.  It acknowledges some development will occur over time as Otterton 
continues to evolve and thrive.  However, the plan expects any new development to 
be ‘measured and careful’, of a high design quality and to meet the needs of 
residents  first.   The plan highlights community concern  about flooding and traffic 
volumes (particularly in the summer season) in the village.  
6.175.  The plan was prepared in the context of the village being considered as open 
countryside in the adopted Local Plan, with no defined settlement boundary, so the 
introduction of a set tlement boundary and  proposed  allocation would  be a shift in 
policy con text for the neighbourhood plan.    
6.176.  Should there be a need for further housing at Otterton, the plan seeks that this be 
small in scale, and comprise affordable homes and those suitable for older people 
to downsize, for those with a local connection.  Similarly, small scale economic 
development is supported in principle, providing this involves the use of existing 
buildings/previo usly development land only . 
Suitability for development  
6.177.  Whilst Otterton has some services and facilities that make it suitable for limited 
development in principle, it is heavily constrained by its high quality AONB 
landscape and heritage assets. Three sit es have been identified as ‘second choice’ 
allocations, but further work will be needed on landscape assessment,  flooding, 
highways and  impact on the s etting of heritage assets.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
119 Payhembury  
What the settlement is like  
6.178.  Payhembury  is a village with a populat ion of around 750 with a small range of 
services and facilities . About 26% of residents are aged 65 or over ( below  the Ea st 
Devon average of 30%), with 2 1% aged between 0 -15. There are some 329 
economically active people and an employment density of 0. 52, which shows that 
there are fewer jobs than workers.  
6.179.  Payhembury  has a limited range of strategic, but a good range o f local services and 
facilities including a shop and primary school.  Although rural and attractive including 
a number of listed buildings, it  is outside the AONB.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.180.  Payhembury is covered by the neighbourhood plan for the parish of Payhembury, 
‘made’ in 2019.  The vision is for Payhembury to retain its peaceful rural character, 
whilst continui ng to offer a good range of facilities to serve the local community.    
6.181.  Whilst the plan was prepared in the context of the village being considered as open 
countryside in the adopted Local Plan, with no defined settlement boundary, the 
community chose to i ntroduce their own settlement boundary.  This was defined 
using EDDC criteria and with reference to an earlier boundary that had existed.  
The intention being to support development of a small number of smaller/more 
affordable homes within the boundary, cl ose to the existing village centre/services.  
The p lan also identified a brownfield site adjacent to boundary as a preferred 
location for any future development , as an exception to policy , which is now coming 
forward for residential use . 
6.182.  The proposed intro duction of a set tlement boundary within the new Local Plan for 
Payhembury would therefore appear to align in principle to the neighbourhood plan .  
However, t he identification of Payhembury as a named settlement in the Local Plan 
settlement hierarchy, poten tially goes a step beyond , and the draft boundary using 
the LP methodolog y extends further than the boundary adopted in the 
neighbourhood plan . 
6.183.  On other matters, the neighbourhood plan seeks to support small businesses 
through some changes of use to meet n eeds and protecting current employment 
space, as well as various other strands of policy to support more sustainable and 
connected living, and to address specific issues including high levels of on -street 
parking . 
Suitability for development  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
120 6.184.  Although fair ly small and rural in natures Payhembury has a range  of key services 
and facilities and is consequently considered appropriate to accommodate a small 
level of growth in the Local Plan.  
 
6.185.  Given the fact that the southern section of Payh_01 has already been p ermitted for 
9 dwellings it is not considered appropriate to make any further allocation in the 
village.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
121 Plymtree   
What the settlement is like  
6.186.  Plymtree is a village with a population of around 650 with a small range of services 
and facilities, situated so me 5 miles to the north -west of Honiton. About 26% of 
residents are aged 65 or over (above the Ea st Devon average of 30%), with 19 % 
aged between 0 -15. There are some 343 economically active people and an 
employment density of 0.42, which shows that there a re fewer jobs than workers.  
6.187.  Plymtree has a limited range of strategic, but a good range of local services and 
facilities including a shop and primary school. Although rural and attractive including 
a number of listed buildings, it is outside the AONB.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.188.  There is currently no neighbourhood plan for Plymtree and no designated 
Neighbourhood Area . 
Suitability for development  
6.189.  Although in  a rural location, Plymtree  contains a range of services and facilities an d 
is consequently considered appropriate to accommodate a small level of growth in 
the Local Plan.  
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
122 Sidbury   
What the settlement is like  
6.190.  Sidbury is home to around 500 people, and has a slightly older age profile than the 
district average (35% are aged 65 plus).  The number of jobs within Sidbury is 
relatively low, less than half the number of workers, meaning most people have to 
commute elsewhere to work.   
6.191.  Sidbury has a reasonably good range of community facilities for its size, including a 
primary school , shop, pub, and sports pitch.  There is also an hourly bus service 
running to the larger settlements of Honiton to the north and south to Sidmouth.  
The A375 runs through the centre of the village.  
6.192.  The East Devon AONB washes over Sidbury, and the floodpla in associated with the 
River Sid runs along the east.  A conservation area, with numerous listed buildings, 
covers a large part of the centre of Sidbury.    
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.193.  The village of Sidbury is covered by the Sid Valley neighbourhood plan, for the 
parished area of Sidmouth, ‘made’ in 2019.  The plan’s vision is to maintain and 
promote the rural and coastal beauty of the setting and local distinctive character of 
place, whilst encouraging a vibrant , balanced and sel f-sustaining community and 
economy .  It is supportive of appropriate change that will bring local benefit and 
tackle key issues such as lack of affordable housing.  In respect of Sidbury 
specifically, the plan is concerned with preventing settlement coales cence with 
Sidford and identifies a “Sidford -Sidbury Non -Coalescence Area” .  The possible site 
for allocation  at Sidford (site reference Sidm_06) is largely  within this area . 
Suitability for development  
6.194.  The availability of a decent range of community facil ities and services make Sidbury 
an appropriate place in principle for a reasonable level of development.  However,  
being located entirely in the AONB limits the potential for new development.  In 
addition, the lack of dedicated footpaths in the village mak e it challenging for 
pedestrians, particularly along the A375 which gets busy at times and can be a 
safety hazard for walkers.  The lack of jobs in the village mean the scale of housing 
should also be limited to minimise the potential for unsustainable com muting 
patterns.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
123 Stoke Canon   
What the settlement is like  
6.195.  Stoke Canon is a village with a population of around  670 with a small range of 
services and facilities. About 2 9% of residents are aged 65 or over (below the Ea st 
Devon average of 30%), with 13 % ag ed between 0 -15. There are some 3 37 
economically active people  and an employment density of 1.76 , which shows that 
there are more  jobs than workers  due to the nearby water treatment works.  
6.196.  Stoke Canon has a limited range of strategic, but a good range of l ocal services 
and facilities including a shop and primary school. Although rural and attractive 
including a number of listed buildings, it is outside the AONB.  
6.197.  Despite this, i t suffers from considerable flooding issues from the River Exe, with 
the entirety  of the village covered by flood zones 2 or 3.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.198.  There is currently no neighbourhood plan for Stoke Canon and no designated 
Neighbourhood Area . 
Suitability for development  
6.199.  In principle, Stoke Canon is a r easonable location for a small amount of 
development given it contains a range of services and f acilities.  
6.200.  However, no suitable sites have been  found in Stoke Canon and given the flooding 
issues experienced in the village it is unlikely that a suitable sit e can be  identified .  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
124 Tipton St John   
What the settlement is like  
6.201.  Tipton St John is located between Ottery St Mary and Sidmouth and has a linear 
form, having grown up around a crossroads. The southern half lies within the East 
Devon Area of Outstanding Na tural Beauty. The River Otter has a wide floodplain at 
this point and the village school lies within it, and so is liable to flood. The County 
Council are exploring options to relocate it elsewhere in the Parish.  
6.202.  Tipton St John has an older than average po pulation, with around 40% of residents 
being retired and 289 residents of working age.    
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.203.  The village of Tipton St John is covered by the neighbourhood plan prepared jointly 
for the parishes of Ottery S t Mary and West Hill, which was ‘made ’ in 2018.   Taking 
account of  consented residential development at the time , the plan did not seek to 
make any allocations in the majority of the settlements it covers , including at Tipton .  
Here , the sta ted rationale was that housing needs were  already met and exceeded 
through the grant of permission for a significant development which was also 
considered to provide an element of future proofing.   
6.204.  The neighbourhood plan was also prepared in the context of the village being 
considered as open countryside in the adopted Local Plan, with no defined 
settlement boundary.  The inclusion of Tipton  in the strategic settlement hierarchy 
and the introduction of a settlement boundary would therefore be a key shift.  
However, t he neighbourhood plan does recognise Tipton as one of 2 ‘principal 
villages’ within its area, alongside Alfington, considered  as having ‘good local 
facilities’. Several green spaces at Tipton are formally designated by the plan as 
Local Green Spaces to give a  high degree of protection from development, none of 
which under consideration for potential allocation.   
6.205.  Flooding issues including those affecting the school, and also the playing fields, are 
highlighted.  The anticipated relocation of the school is also  noted and allowed for, 
and support is expressed for the implementation of the strategic foot/cycle route 
from Sidmouth to Feniton, via Tipton St John . 
Suitability for development  
6.206.  Tipton St John is a settlement which is suitable for a very small scale of a dditional 
development due to its rural location (accessed along unlit, un surfac ed rural lanes), 
topography, tendency to flo od and high landscape quality. If the village school 
relocates away from the village then it will fall below the threshold for facili ties and 
services which justify its allocation as a tier 4 settlement . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
125 Uplyme   
What the settlement is like  
6.207.  Uplyme is a quite substantial village on the south easterly edge of East Devon 
abutting Dorset and the town of Lyme Regis.  Whilst Uplyme itself is h ome to a 
good range of services and facilities , the neighbouring centre of Lyme Regis, which 
is an important coastal tourism town, has a far greater range of services.  
6.208.  Uplyme is set in a dramatic valley and hillside setting and is washed over by the 
East D evon AONB.  This AONB also abuts the Dorset AONB which washes over 
Lyme Reg is and is also of national landscape importance.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.209.  Uplyme is covered by the neighbourhood plan for the whole parish of Uplyme, 
‘made’ in 2017.   The plan seeks to preserve and enhance the assets and qualities 
of the area, whilst also responding to community support for some development to 
meet identified needs and further its sustainability.  I n supporting a ‘modest’ level of 
housin g development, particularly affordable housing, the plan includes allocations 
for three sites for rural exception schemes (for a combined total of up to 
approximately 20 dwellings), adjacent/close to the current  Built-up Area Boundary.  
The plan seeks to b enefit the local economy, including through support for live -work 
units and conversions for business use, as well as being encouraging of the 
expansion of community facilities, new and improved recreational and educational 
provision, and community -scale re newable energy.   A range of schemes are also 
supported to address issues highlighted with pedestrian and traffic movement.   
6.210.  Overall, in the context of a desire to maintain the character and setting of Uplyme, 
the plan seeks development at a scale which r eflects incremental historical levels of 
growth.   As part of this, local green spaces/corridors within Uplyme are identified 
for special protection and support lent to the designation of a conservation area 
here.  
Suitability for development  
6.211.  The range of s ervices and facilities in Uplyme and close by in Lyme Regis point to 
potential good in -principle reasons for the village to accommodate development.  
However, landscape constraints are significant and there is very little land in and 
around the village tha t would naturally lend itself to being built on.  Indeed, no 
suitable sites have been submitted in the village at this time.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
126 Westclyst   
What the settlement is like  
6.212.  Westclyst is a settlement on the western edge of the district. Although within East 
Devon, it  is situated adjacent to Pinhoe in Exeter and therefore has access to the 
wide range of facilities located there alongside a new primary school. The area has 
experienced significant development in recent years and formed an important 
feature of the develop ment strategy in the previous Local Plan.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.213.  Westclyst and imm ediate surroundings fall largely within  the parish of Broadclyst, 
the whole of which is the subject of a  submitted  neighbourhood plan currently  at 
examination.   This plan is therefore progressing through the final stages of plan 
making , alongside and ahead of the new Local Plan.     
6.214.  The draft neighbourhood plan  refers to the significant and rapid strategic growth the 
area has seen under the curre nt Local Plan  strategy , which will make Westclyst a 
larger settlement than Broadclyst Village.  It comments on the pressures on 
services and infrastructure and changes in nature/feel of the area that th is has 
brought.   
6.215.  Whilst also wanting to generally see  local character and landscape of the parish 
protected and enhanced, the plan put s forward multiple sites for development 
(housing, employment, community facilities ) in various locations in the parish.  This 
strategy furthers the vision to continue to ‘dev elop and thrive’ and meet the 
‘changing and diverse needs’ of its ‘rapidly growing communit y’. 
6.216.  Although no  development sites  are proposed within the plan a t Westclyst, the draft 
plan co ntain s various  policy clauses and aspirations relating to the Westclyst  area 
specifically, including:  
 Support for provision of active travel links within and beyond the parish 
connecting to/from Westclyst.  
 Support for infill for self -build development  
 Protection of  several wooded areas  as ‘green corridors’  
 A requirement for d evelopment proposals to enhance the urban landsca pe 
through greening and biodiversity measures . 
 Suggestion it  might be a suitable location for a workhub development.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
127 Suitability for development  
6.217.  In principle, given the range of accessible facilities and pr oximity to Exeter the area 
would be an appropriate location for future growth.  
6.218.  However, although development at Westclyst was a feature of the existing local 
plan and in principal could accommodate further development, no suitable sites 
have been presented  and so it is not considered appropriate to make any 
allocations at this point in time.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
128 West Hill  
What the settlement is like  
6.219.  West Hill is a post -war village characterised by large, detached houses in spacious 
plots , interspersed with numerous trees and woodland. Key f acilities  are the primary 
school, village hall and shop , all located close to each other in  the northern part of 
the village . This means that some houses are over a 1 km away  from these 
facilities , often along narrow, steep and unlit roads  that lack pavements . 
6.220.  West Hill has around 2000 residents, with 36.5%  aged  over 65  (higher than the 
district average) . Around 2/3 of workers commute out of the village to work.  
6.221.  The nature of existing housing stock in West Hill makes it amongst  the most 
expen sive settlements to live in East Devon . 
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.222.  West Hill is covered by the neighbourhood plan jointly prepared for the parishes of 
West Hill and Ottery, ‘made’ in 2018.   The plan articulates a community conce rn 
about the volume and design of new housing development consented in the period 
leading up to the adoption of the existing Local Plan, and seeks to en sure the 
response to on -going development pressure is balanced and local character not 
eroded.  The Plan ’s vision sets out a desire to ensure any new developments are 
appropriately sited, well related and contribute positively to the locality, meeting 
local needs and ensuring delivery of all necessary infrastructure.    
6.223.  The plan sets an overall objective for  West Hill to, “Protect and maintain the unique 
character and special qualities of West Hill, whilst enhancing the settlement’s 
sustainability.”  The special qualities are summarised as its ‘unique low density 
wooded character’.  To preserve this, the plan  seeks to resist infill development that 
reduces tree coverage and distances between neighbouring properties, applying a 
criteria -based approach .  It also  includes detailed design policies, informed by the 
adopted Village Design Statement Supplementary Pla nning Guidance.  It is notable 
that the first criteria of the West Hill Design Policy is for new development to 
maintain the existing low density pattern.  The plan also designates a number of 
formal Local Green Spaces at West Hill which provide a high deg ree of protection 
from development, and identifies a range of key views for protection in and around 
West Hill.   
6.224.  Importantly, the plan is particularly concerned with containing the settlements of 
West Hill and Ottery as separate entities and includes a po licy to resist 
developments that would compromise this.   It specifically states  that land to the 
east and north of West Hill, beyond the Built-up Area Boundary in the adopted 
Local Plan, is not supported for development, or at least not without particular  
prescribed conditions being met.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
129 6.225.  The plan also seeks the provision of a safe pedestrian/cycle link between West Hill 
and Ottery and more formal open/recreation spaces to serve West Hill, both of 
which are evidenced as currently lacking . 
Suitability for development  
6.226.  West Hill is a large village, located close to the A30, with easy access to Ottery St 
Mary. It is a suitable location for additional development and the form and layout 
offers opportunities for  relatively  unobtrusive  infilling and rounding off.  It is located 
outside any designated landscape but the high numbers of mature trees and 
hedgerows create a distinct woodland character that would need to be retained in 
any development. The shops and school are located to the north of the settlement, 
with this being a key reason to  the focus new development  in this area .  
6.227.  The current style and type of housing is eclectic but characterised by substantial 
detached houses and bungalows in large plots. New development could offer an 
opportunity to redress the balance and introduce some smaller, more affordable, 
houses  for families and existing older residents wishing to downsize,  whilst 
recognising the importance of new tree planting and screening to retain the 
‘woodland character’ .  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
130 Whimple  
What the settlemen t is like  
6.228.  Whimple falls towards the western side of East Devon. The Exeter -Waterloo railway 
line runs through the village with part of its historic built core, and it’s designated 
Conservation Area, lying to the south of the railway line and a small part t o the 
north.  There is a railway station in a north -eatery part of the village.  
6.229.  The village has expanded outward from its historic core over much of the second 
half of the 20th century to establish what is now a quite large village with a range of 
services  and facilities.  
Key messages from the Neighbourhood Plan for the area  
6.230.  There is no neighbourhood plan for Whimple currently.  However, the whole parish 
of Whimple is designed as a neighbourhood area and work has recently 
recommenced on preparation of a nei ghbourhood plan.  Several r ounds of  
community consultation to inform drafting of the plan have been undertaken .  
Suitability for development  
6.231.  Proximity to Exeter and the presence of a railway station are positive factors in 
respect of potential suitability for future development.  However there are narrow 
lanes in and serving the village and also heritage sensitivities in respect of its 
historic core . 
6.232.  Notwithstanding constraints on development there were a range of sites at Whimple  
that were submitted for de velopment and assessed as second best possible 
options.  These sites could accommodate a substantial number of new homes.  We 
would welcome feedback on whether a more substantial number of homes should 
be accommodated at the village and if appropriate whic h sites could be most 
suitable for development.

131 Chapter 7.  Tackling the climate emergency 
and responding to climate change   
Reducing emissions and promoting zero carbon development  
 
7.1. The climate is in crisis. The latest warnings from the 2021 IPCC sixth assessment  
report 9 are stark. Human -induced climate change is already affecting many 
weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe, the atmosphere 
and seas are warming at rates unprecedented in human history, and some of the 
consequences are irrevoc able. Time is running out and these trends are set to 
continue without drastic cuts in carbon emissions in the next decade. It is clear that 
now is the time for bold collective action.  
7.2. No organisation or individual is exempt from responsibility, and in 201 9 the Council 
declared a climate emergency where it  committed to become carbon neutral by 
2040. The Local Plan has a key role to play and it is imperative that we go further 
than ever before by introducing a suite of ambitious and implementable policies 
which addresses the severity  of the  crisis that we are all facing.  
 
27. Strategic Policy – Climate Emergency  
The East Devon target is to become carbon neutral by 2040, this overarching 
strategic policy for climate emergency require s developments to support East Devon 
becoming carbon neutral by 2040, through : 
a. Delivering net -zero development;  
b. Maximising opportunities for delivery of renewable energy, district heat 
networks, zero -carbon energy and energy storage facilities; and  
c. Calculating the impact of embodied car bon and retaining existing 
buildings where possible.  
 
 
7.3. The policy provides  an overarching view and sets a target of achieving carbon 
neutrality in the district by 2040, in line with the Council’s declaration of a climate 
emergency . The subsequent policies  in this  chapter provide more specific 
deliverables as to how the overarching policy will be met.  
 
                                            
 
 
9 IPCC, 2021, Sixth Assessment Report , https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
132 28. Strategic Policy – Net-Zero Carbon Development  
All new residential and commercial development will deliver net -zero ca rbon 
emissions. Developers will  be req uired to submit a “carbon statement” to demonstrate 
how this will be achieved, in accordance with the energy hierarchy.   
In addition, homes will be required to be future proofed to avoid temperature 
discomfort as a result of rising temperatures.   
There w ill also be requirements to maximise opportunities for renewable energy and 
ensure that in -use energy performance is as close as possible to design intent.  
Finally, there will be a requirement for major development to calculate the whole life -
cycle carbon  emissions, through a nationally recognised Whole Life Cycle Carbon 
Assessment.  
 
 
7.4. Perhaps one of the most fundamental and recognisable ways of reducing carbon 
emissions through planning is to ensure new developments are constr ucted to be 
as energy efficie nt as possible.  
7.5. Evidence undertaken to support the GESP suggests that new development should 
be planned to follow the “energy hierarchy”, which prioritises improvements to the 
fabric of buildings above off -site or on -site implementation of renewable energ y. 
The logic being that once a building is constructed it becomes much harder and 
more expensive to improve its fabric, whereas renewable energy generation can be 
retrofitted much easier.  
7.6. One issue that has been identified is the “performance gap”, i.e. t he gap between 
designed and actual performance. And policy seeks to address this. One possible 
way is by requiring 10% of buildings on major developments to send energy 
performance and carbon emissions data to the local planning authority for a period 
of 5 years although this requires further investigation.  
7.7. The energy hierarchy is laid out as follows and forms the basis for interventions that 
developers will need to prioritise to ensure the net -zero target is met.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
133  
 
FIGURE 8.  The Energy Hierarchy  
 Development location: Minimise need to travel and 
provide access to sustainable transport
Site master planning: Optimise use of natural light 
and heat through solar master planning
Building fabric: Maximise thermal efficiency through 
high performance fabric
Building services: maximise efficiency of fixed 
building services (heating, cooling, ventilation and 
lighting)
Clean onsite energy: Incorporate renewable/zero 
carbon energy to reduce unavoidable emissions
Offsite measures: Finance offsite carbon reduction 
measures where onsite measures are impractical
In-use performance: Ensure actual performance 
aligns with design intent.East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
134 29. Strategic Policy – Promoting renewables and zero carbon 
energy   
 
Development of zero carbon and renewable energy schemes within the District  will be 
supported . We will  encourage the use of community -led schemes and promote their 
use within Neighbourhood Plans.  
The Local Pla n will support renewable and low carbon energy proposals where there 
are no unacceptable impacts on:  
  
 Landscape, visual or residential amenity  
 Noise, air, water, highways or health  
 Biodiversity, the natural or historic environment  
 Radar, telecommunication s or the safety of aircraft operations  
  
Planning permission will only be granted for development of non -renewable forms of 
energy generation where it can be demonstrated that there are clear and compelling 
circumstances that generate the need for the prop osal and that all reasonable 
opportunities for using renewables to supply the need are non -credible and 
exploration of alternative options have been exhausted.  
 
 
7.8. The policy ensures that as much of our energy as possible comes from zero -carbon 
sources . This will play a crucial role in achieving climate objectives. Renewable 
energy makes up an ever -increasing proportion of the energy supply and this is a 
trend which is set to continue.   
7.9. This policy will provide general support for renewable and zero carbon  schemes 
across the District and a framework that only allows non -renewable schemes to 
come forward in exceptional circumstances.   
Solar energy and electricity generation  
7.10.  Solar energy has become increasingly important in supplying electricity and of 
lesser  importance for direct heating in recent years.  Many smaller -scale 
installations, for example on the roofs of some residential dwellings, do not require 
planning permission.  However, large -scale solar farm installations would require 
permission and can b e, unless sensitively sited and designed, intrusive in the 
landscape.   
7.11.  Plan policy sets out considerations with respect to supporting new solar 
installations.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
135 7.12.  The Low Carbon Study UoE-2020 -Low-Carbon -and-Climate -Change -GESP -report -
net-zero-draft-120320.pdf  has identified areas which  are suitable for solar 
photovoltaic development, which excluded the most se nsitive areas of the District, 
such as AONB, greenspace, heritage and natural features. It should be noted that 
the proposed maps do not exclude areas on the basis of 2 km proximity to grid 
connection as the connection can be achieved beyond this range. Al so not factored 
into the mapping is agricultural land classification as reliable information does not 
exist for the vast majority of the district. A full outline of how the layers were 
formulated can be found in the Low Carbon Study.  
7.13.  The policy does not i ntend to cover retrofitting existing residential and commercial 
buildings with solar panels as this can largely be achieved through permitted 
development rights. Where there are schemes that fall outside what is allowed 
under permitted development, these w ould be covered under policy 29.  
 
30. Strategic Policy – Suitable areas for solar energy developments   
 
Solar photovoltaic development will be supported in the identified solar energy 
suitable area, as shown on the Policies Map, where there are no unacceptable  
impacts on  any of the following : 
 Landscape, visual or residential amenity ; 
 Noise, air, water, highways or health ; 
 Biodiversity, the natural or historic environment ; 
 Radar, telecommunications or the safety of aircraft operations ; 
And subject to  not leading  to direct conflict with any local plan policy that 
allocates land for an alternative development type or specifically affords 
safeguarding protection to land (unless development can be accommodated 
within the policy terms of the safeguarding).  
 
 
7.14.  The scal e of resource available for solar energy within East Devon is vast and 
despite some schemes coming forward, remains largely untapped. The intention of 
this policy will be to create an environment which gives certainty to the industry as 
to where schemes wi ll be acceptable, which should translate into a greater number 
of schemes coming forward.  
Energy from wind and wind farms  
7.15.  Windfarms can be found on -shore and off -shore, sometimes many miles out to sea.  
Off-shore windfarms largely fall outside of the remit  of the Council as the relevant 
planning authority, though there may be planning implications associated with any 
on-shore infrastructure or connections that are required.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
136 7.16.  Plan policy sets out considerations in respect to supporting new on shore 
windfarms . 
 
31. Strategic Policy – Suitable areas for wind energy 
developments   
 
Wind energy development will in principle be supported in the identified wind energy 
suitable area , as shown on the Policies Map , where there are no unacceptable 
impacts on:  
 
 Landscape, vis ual or residential amenity  
 Noise, air, water, highways or health  
 Biodiversity, the natural or historic environment  
 Radar, telecommunications or the safety of aircraft operations  
 
And subject to not leading to direct conflict with any local plan policy that  
allocates land for an alternative development type or specifically affords 
safeguarding protection to land (unless development can be accommodated 
within the policy terms of the safeguarding).  
The impacts of any development on key landscape characteristic s must be 
acceptable. Proposals must have regard to the landscape sensitivity and be of a 
scale and type where landscape sensitivity has been identified as being 
low/moderate or moderate.  
 
 
7.17.  Government guidance requires that for on -shore wind energy to com e forward 
suitable areas need to be identified in the develo pment plan. Whilst the scale of the 
area suitable for development is far more constrained than solar, there are still 
some areas of potential.  
7.18.  The a rea suitable for wind energy development has bee n identified in the Low 
Carbon Study. They exclude the most sensitive areas of the District, such as 
AONB, greenspace, heritage and natural features. It should be noted that the 
identified areas do not exclude areas based on 2 km proximity to grid connecti on as 
the connection can be achieved beyond this range. Also not factored into the 
mapping is agricultural land classification as reliable information does not exist for 
the vast majority of the district. A full outline of how the layers were formulated ca n 
be found in the Low Carbon Study.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
137 Energy storage  
7.19.  One of the challenges associated with renewable energy generation is that the time 
when it is  ‘mad e’ is not necessarily  the same time as when consumers want to use 
it.  Much of the electricity consumed b y households is done so in the evening, often 
after sunset, but this of course is the time when solar panels cease to generate 
electricity or at least production starts to rapidly fall.  
7.20.  Policy in  the plan therefore sets out considerations that are relevant  to storage of 
electricity.  
 
32. Strategic Policy – Energy Storage  
Planning permission will be granted for energy storage facilities to help to achieve 
carbon neutrality and support renewable energy production and use in East Devon 
subject to such schemes not having adverse impacts on account of noise, 
environmental consideration s or amenity impacts .  And not being in direct conflict with 
any policy in the plan that allocates land for a  different  specified use or safeguards 
land unless the energy storage facili ty can be accommodated without compromising 
the policy intent of the safeguarding.  
 
7.21.  Energy storage technologies (including battery storage) allow surplus electricity to 
be stored as other forms of energy until it is required when it can be re -released as  
electricity. This will be an essential part of speeding up the replacement of fossil 
fuels with renewable energy. Electricity storage is a key technology in the transition 
to a smarter and more flexible energy system and will play an important role in 
helping to reduce emissions to net  zero by 2050. Battery storage systems will play 
an increasingly pivotal role in responding to changing electricity demands, 
particularly as we make the transition from petrol to electric vehicles and shift 
demand from peak t imes.  
7.22.  Storage encompasses a wide range of technologies. Lithium -ion batteries and 
pumped hydroelectric are the dominant technology types for storage schemes at 
present. Favoured locations have tended to be close to a suitable sub -station in 
order to provi de grid services. In addition, storage co -located with renewables is an 
emerging business model that may see more uptake in the near future.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
138  
FIGURE 9.  Example battery storage facility  
 
Strategic heat networks  
7.23.  Strategic heat networks are created from systems where  a central plant or plants 
will generate heat and this will then be distributed along pipe networks to 
residential, business and other consumers.  Strategic heat networks provide a more 
efficient way of producing heat than individual properties having thei r own separate 
boilers.  
 
33. Strategic Policy – Heat Networks  
For a ll major  development s proposed within 1km of an existing heat network a 
connection will be required in order to secure planning permission . In addition, where 
no heat network currently exists,  a new heat network will be required  for proposals 
above 1,200 homes or 10 ha of commercial floorspace.  
 
 
7.24.  In Denmark 60% of heating in homes is supplied using district heat networks. 
These have been remarkably successful in producing a low cost and highly  efficient 
heat supply. In the UK, heat networks are still in their relative infancy and whilst 
there are currently only a few examples, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
139 suggest that 20% of heating will need to come from district heating by 2050 if 
climate targets are to be met10.  
7.25.  East Devon is well placed to embrace this trend, with networks already operating at 
the west end of the District at Cranbrook and Monkerton in Exeter.  
7.26.  The GESP low carbon study considered the location of many large users of 
electricity and heat within the district that could potentially present opportunities for 
matching heat supply and demand, or otherwise incentivise the formation of a 
district heat network, so that this energy would not be wasted. It also provides an 
evide nce base suggest ing that any large scale development over 1,200 or 10ha of 
dwellings should investigate the potential to depl oy a heat network.  
7.27.  The Local Plan will likely be making large scale allocations within the District to 
meet housing requirements an d these will present opportunities to utilise waste 
heat and connect to existing networks to increase their efficiency and reliability.  
Embodied carbon  
7.28.  One of the major sources of greenhouse gases is the manufacture of building 
materials.  We see, therefo re, real benefits in using all or key parts of the existing 
building stock in development projects.  
 
34. Strategic Policy – Embodied carbon  
All developments shall demonstrate actions taken to reduce embodied carbon and 
developers should retain existing buildin gs, or at least the foundations unless it can 
be demonstrated that refurbishment is either unviable or impractical.  
Replacement of existing habitable buildings  with new developments will only be 
supported in exceptional circumstances and will need to demo nstrate that the full 
lifecycle carbon emissions will be net -zero.  
 
 
7.29.  There is an increasing realisation and awareness of the environmental impact of 
producing the materials required for construction. Making steel, concrete and bricks 
for buildings creates  a vast amount of CO2, with concrete alone causing 8% of 
global emissions. Indeed, The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) 
estimates that 51% of the lifecycle carbon from a typical residential dwelling is 
emitted before the building is even occ upied. The figure for office development is

(theccc.org.uk)  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
140 35%11. Much of that energy goes below the ground into the foundations of the 
buildings .  
7.30.  A recent report steered by the Royal Academy of Engineering has urged for existing 
buildings to be left standing rather than  demolished12 and the Government has 
committed to producing a building strategy which will be looking to tackle this issue.  
7.31.  Examples of exceptional circumstance could be that the footprint of the existing 
building is impractical for the proposed use or the density of development is to be 
greatly increased as a result of the proposed development.  
Adapting to environmental changes and managing environmental 
hazards  
7.32.  Flood risk, coastal change, water supply and pollution are related to dynamic 
natural systems bu t can also be affected by human activities. For example, 
development upstream can increase the likelihood of flooding downstream or 
industrial processes can pollute drinking water supplies. We need to understand 
and plan for environmental change, aspects o f which are likely to be exacerbated 
by climate change.  To inform work on the environmental challenges the local plan 
needs to confront, we have commissioned studies  relating to coastal chan ge, flood 
risk and impacts of development levels on the water cycl e to inform our approach 
and policies.  Our evidence base relating to coastal change is complete , but we are 
awaiting the  water cycle study and strategic flood risk assessment (level 1).  It was 
hoped that initial findings would be available in time to infor m this draft plan, but 
work has been delayed because data requests to South West Water hav e yet to be 
actioned.  Subject to thes e issues being resolved, b oth the level 1 strategic flood risk 
assessment and the water cycle study should be completed early in 2023, in time to 
inform the next stage of plan making. This draft plan uses existing flood mapping  to 
help inform allocations.  
Flood Risk  
7.33.  The NPPF makes clear that development should be directed away from areas at 
highest risk of flooding now and in the fu ture. The  level 1 strategic flood risk 
assessment  will help us to show how this can be done. It will  (amongst other 
things ): set out the relevant issues ; give advice on the need for local policies ; 
highlight any cross -boundary issue s; identify any land nee ded for future flood risk

141 solutions  and map flood risk from all sources for the whole of East Devon . A level 2 
strategic flood risk assessment may be required to inform strategic allocations at 
the next plan making sta ge. T his draft plan  generally avoids a reas currently known 
to be at risk of flooding,  although there are areas within existing settlements that are 
at risk of flooding that may be considered suitable for redevelopment , subject to 
detailed flood risk assessments  (in a level 2 strategic flood ri sk assessment) . 
Additionally, t he settlement boundaries have not been drawn to specifically exclude 
areas at risk of flooding, although the relevant policy is clear that proposals for 
development within the boundaries will need to be assessed against  other  relevant 
plan policies. There is extensive national policy on flooding, which was recently 
updated. We will need to await the outcome of the strategic flood risk assessment 
before finalising flood related policies that are necessary in an East Devon conte xt. 
A draft policy to highlight the issues likely to be covered is included here as an 
interim measure . 
 
35. Strategic Policy  – Flooding  
 
The policy will require development proposals to:  
 
 Meet the sequential and exception tests as set out in the NPPF;  
 Avoid land required for flood management, including natural floodplains;  
 Be safe over its lifetime, taking into account the increased risk of flooding due 
to climate change and without increasing flood risk elsewhere;  
 Ensure that any flooding measures respond to the specific requirements of the 
site and respect the character and biodiversity of the area;  
 Preferably reduce or at least not exceed existing run -off rates;  
 Manage site surface water run -off as close to the source as possible.  
 
Justification for in clusion of policy  
7.34.  There are areas of the District at risk from flooding from a variety of sources such 
as rivers and the sea in addition to local sources of flooding such as surface water. 
With climate change, the risks from these types of flooding are lik ely to be 
exacerbated. The NPPF makes clear that development should be directed away 
from areas at highest risk of flooding now and in the future.  
Water quality and supply  
7.35.  The water cycle study will examine and provide recommendations on a range of 
issue s including : the capacity for wastewater infrastructure to accommodate 
additional development ; the need for improvements to wastewater infrastructure to 
facilitate  additional development;  the impact of development on water supply and 
quality ; the environme ntal impact of development on the water environment  and a 
‘phosphate  calculator’  to show how Natural England’s requirements in the River East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
142 Axe catchment can be met . The results of the water cycle study may feed into site 
allocations and is likely to underpin  plan policies  relating to water quality and 
supply .  
Coastal change  
7.36.  The impact of a changing coastline, particularly through cliff erosion and  increased 
risk of  permanent coastal flooding (inundation) , is a challenging issue for East 
Devon.  We can readily  see along some lengths of the East Devon coastline that the 
cliffs and coastline more generally is eroding.  This is a natural process , though one 
that has and will increase as a result of increasing temperatures and sea level rise. 
In some cases, coastal  defence work may  be appropriate, for example to defend 
parts of coastal towns, though often it is very expensive and can have adverse 
environmental impacts.  Along much of the East Devon coastline, however, the 
appropriate action is not to intervene and le t natural process es happen.  This plan 
needs to identify the impacts of any potential changes  and develop policies to 
ensure that the risks are properly considered  when making decisions on whether 
development proposals will be safe.  We propose  a number of d raft policies relating 
to coastal change.   
Coastal change management areas  
7.37.  We have worked with the University of Plymouth on a way to predict coastal erosion 
and flooding and have published a briefing paper  and a topic paper  on coastal 
change. The University of Plymouth have mapped areas that may be vulne rable to 
coastal change over the next 20, 50 and 100 years using the agreed methodology, 
which takes account of potential impacts from climate change through sea level 
rises. This work has been used to identify coastal change management areas 
(CCMAs) in ac cordance with the National Planning Policy Framework.  
7.38.  This is a highly complex topic, and it is recommended that the local plan is 
supported by supplementary planning guidance to give more details of how the  
CCMA  approach would work in practice.  
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
143  
36. Policy  – Coastal change management areas (CCMAs)   
Within the Coastal Change Management Area (CCMA) defined on the Policies Map, 
proposals for new residential development, including the conversion of existing 
buildings, will not be permitted.   
 
Applications for non-residential development within the CCMA  will be assessed in 
relation to the most up -to-date evidence available for when coastal change can be 
expected so that:  
 In parts of the CCMA expected to be at risk within a 0-to-20-year time horizon, 
only the fol lowing developments will be allowed: - 
o temporary development directly related to the  coast, such as beach 
huts, cafes, car parks or sites used for touring caravan and camping ; 
o temporary modifications to other existing commercial facilities where a 
positive  link can be made to the local economy ;  
o mitigation measures for dealing with coastal change that are in 
accordance with the relevant coastal strategy  or 
o nationally significant  infrastructure projects related to offshore  
development  that are constructed to  withstand the impacts of the 
expected coastal  change . 
 In parts of the CCMA expected to be at risk within a 20 -to-50 year time 
horizon, in addition to the development allowed in  the 0 to 20 years zone  the 
replacement, relocation and adaptation of  infrastru cture, commercial and 
community uses will be permitted, providing they require a coastal location and 
provide economic and social benefits to the local community .  
 In parts of the CCMA expected to be at risk within a 50 to 100 year time 
horizon, in additio n to the development allowed in the 0 to 50 year zones, 
extensions to residential properties and householder applications  may be 
acceptable . 
 
All applications for development within a CCMA must show  that it would not result in 
an increased risk to life or any property  through the submission of  a coastal change 
vulnerability assessment, which should  be proportionate to the scale and nature of 
the development.  
  
Planning permission for all development in a CCMA will be time limited according to 
the risk ident ified in the coastal erosion vulnerability assessment.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
7.40.  The NPPF (paragraph 170) requires plans to reduce the risk of coastal change by 
avoiding inappropriate development in vulnerable areas and to identify  coastal East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
144 change management areas , known as CCMAs  (paragraph 171). CCMAs are not 
necessary in areas where the Shoreline Management Plan policy is to ‘hold the line’ 
and there is evidence that this can be maintained over the lifetime of the plan. 
Generally, the centre s of our main coastal settlements are defended,  and we have  
evidence to demonstrate that we can ‘hold the line’.  We have not therefore  
identif ied CCMAs for any of our town centres. Paragraphs 172 and 173 of the 
NPPF set out the circumstances in which devel opment will be appropriate in a 
coastal change management area. Our policy adds to national policy and we plan 
to provide  greater detail through supplementary planning guidance.  
Relocation of uses affected by coastal change  
7.41.  Where evidence shows that certai n existing uses would be vulnerable to coastal  
change in the short term,  we propose to maintain our current approach of allowing 
relocation in some circumstances to areas where development would otherwise be 
unacceptable.  
 
37. Policy – Relocation of uses affec ted by coastal change  
 
Where there is robust evidence to demonstrate that permanent homes (with 
unrestrictive occupancy) or community facilities, commercial or business uses that 
are considered important to coastal communities are likely to be affected by  coastal 
erosion within 20 years of the date of the proposal, proposals for 
relocation/replacement may be considered favourably subject to the following criteria:  
1. The new development is located in an area at less risk of coastal erosion;  
2. The replacement property is located close to the community from which it is 
displaced and has an acceptable relationship with it in terms of character, 
setting, local amenity and any special landscape designations;  
3. Overall, taking both the existing and proposed buildings  into account, the 
proposal should not have an additional detrimental impact on the landscape, 
townscape or biodiversity  of the area, taking into account any special 
designations;  
4. The existing site is either cleared and restored with enhancements for natu re 
conservation or put to use to benefit the local community within three months of 
the first use of the replacement. The future use of the site should be secured in 
perpetuity and provision made for public access to the coast where 
appropriate;  
5. The devel opment is consistent with the criteria set out in Policy  6 - 
Development Beyond Settlement Boundaries ; and  
6. In the case of a residential proposal, the gross volume of the replacement 
dwelling is no larger than the one it is to replace.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
145 Justification for  inclusion of policy  
7.42.  There is a risk that some buildings and uses may be lost to the sea within the plan 
period, although current evidence suggests that this is not likely to affect large 
areas.  This ‘rollback’ policy provide s a flexible approach if the situation arises.  
Development affecting coastal erosion  
7.43.  The broad national and local approach to coastal erosion (as set out in the 
Shoreline Management Plan  (SMP) ) is to defend the centres of the main 
settlements and allow natural processes to continue in  the more rural areas. Large 
parts of our coastline are designated as a World Heritage Site, the integrity  of which 
would be undermined if  natural processes  were not allowed  to continue.  
 
38. Strategic Policy – Development affecting coastal erosion   
 
Where co mpatible with the most up -to-date coastal policy (as expressed in the SMP 
or a strategy such as a beach management plan), t he Council will promote proposals 
for sustainable coastal change management such as improvements to coastal 
defences or managed realignment, provided  that they would not have an 
unacceptable adverse economic, social or environmental impact, including an 
unacceptable detrimental visual impact on a protected landscape.  
To protect the integrity of the Dorset and East Devon World Heritage Site, the natural 
processes that created it will be allowed to continue, unless the safety and economic 
well-being  of any coastal community would be undermined, provided that the 
implications of this for the World Heritage Site have been fully considered.  
Where there is a conflict between allowing coastal erosion and protecting coastal 
communities from that erosion both interests will be recognised and wherever 
possible impacts will be mitigated where they arise.  Schemes that are incompatible 
with coastal policy are unlikely to be supported.  
 
7.44.  This policy seeks to balance the need for protective measures  to reduce rates of 
coastal change (where these are compati ble with coastal strategy ) with the integrity 
of the World Heritage Site, which relies on coasta l change processes continu ing. It 
is important to set out that both interests will need to be assessed as part of any 
planning proposal . This will help guide decision makers and determine mitigation 
measures that may be undertaken, such as slowing rather t han stopping erosion  or 
displaying materials to aid understanding of the outstanding universal value of the 
World Heritage Site (such as fossil displays in local museums).  An example of 
where this policy would be relevant is in considering any application for rock 
groynes/islands as part of delivering a beach management plan at Sidmouth.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
146 Links to marine planning  
7.45.  The NPPF (paragraph 170) requires local plans to take account of the UK Marine 
Policy Statement and marine plans.  The adopted South Marine Plan i s like the 
local plan in terms of enabling sustainable development, but it covers activities 
within the marine environment such as offshore wind farms, fishing, and submarine 
cables. The intertidal zone between the high and low water marks is where both 
land and marine planning systems overlap, but developments inland can also have 
the potential to have an impact on the marine environment. Links to the wider 
marine environment and the marine plan will need to be further explored, but no 
potential conflicts have been identified so far.  
 
   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
147 Chapter 8.  Meeting housing needs for all  
8.1. People need homes not just for shelter, but for health and well -being. They need 
decent housing that they can afford to live in, where they can be warm, safe and 
secure, that provide stability and meet the household’s needs now and as their 
needs change.  
8.2. This is a strategic policy which addresses the Council’s aspirations towards meeting 
the housing needs of East Devon.  It is an overarching  approach  for the suite of 
policies in this chapter.  
 
39. Strategic Policy - Housing to address needs  
 
1. All proposals for housing, including those affecting the existing housing stock, 
will contribute to creating sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities in East 
Devon. This will be achieved by providing an app ropriate mix of decent, good 
quality homes which meet identified needs for housing over the plan period, at 
locations consistent with the settlement hierarchy and the spatial strategy.  
2. To achieve this the Council will:  
a. Seek to maximise the delivery of a ffordable housing across East Devon in 
order to meet identified needs of people who are not able to access the 
general housing market, and support a range of approaches to delivering 
affordable housing  
b. Support proposals for the development of specialist  accommodation that 
increase choice for older, vulnerable and disabled residents  
c. Seek the use of good quality adaptable housing designs that provide flexible 
internal layouts and allow for cost -effective alterations to meet changing 
needs over a lifeti me and reduce fuel poverty  
d. Work with developers registered providers, landowners and relevant 
individuals or groups to address identified local demand for self and custom 
build homes as identified in the East Devon Self and Custom Build Register  
e. Supp ort the retention and improvement of private rented accommodation, the 
provision of shared accommodation for single people, and proposals for the 
development of community -led housing schemes.  
3. A proposal for housing development will be supported where it br oadens choice 
and reflects and responds to the existing and future needs of the district’s 
households as identified in the Local Housing Needs Assessment or successor 
documents, and in up -to-date local housing need evidence.  
4. A proposal for housing developm ent will provide a mix of house types, tenures 
and sizes appropriate to the area. This will be subject to detailed policies in this 
plan and other Development Plan Documents, as well as evidence of the ability 
of the site to accommodate a mix of housing, a nd relevant, up to date evidence 
of market conditions. Housing mix will be achieved by:  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
148 a. A mix of affordable housing through social rent, affordable rent, and 
affordable home ownership (First Homes and other products) to meet 
affordable housing needs over t he plan period, particularly the needs of 
younger people and key workers.  
b. A range of housing suitable for households with specialist needs, including : 
 Dwellings for older people who want to retain independent living;  
 Adaptable and accessible housing and w heelchair user housing  
 Use Class C2 accommodation including care homes  
c. Market housing for rent as well as for home ownership  
d. Serviced plots of land for self -build and custom housebuilding  
e. Gypsy and Travellers and Travelling Showpeople accommodation  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.3. Planning for a sufficient amount of housing growth in East Devon is essential but it 
is vital that the housing development addresses the needs of the area. The plan 
therefore includes a strategic policy about achieving hou sing mix and high quality 
homes focused on meeting housing needs to support communities.  
8.4. The policy is strategic because it is a commitment to addressing housing needs. 
This is a strategic priority of the area, as recognised in the Council Plan. This polic y 
supports Council priority one ‘Better Homes and Communities for All’, notably:  
 
 The first priority action - to prepare and promote robust policies in the local 
plan to address the need for more and better quality homes and communities 
for all.  
 The secon d priority action - to deliver more affordable housing and explore 
new ways to build more affordable homes.  
 The plan’s emphasis on ensuring that homes are fit for purpose across all 
sectors.  
8.5. Equally important, this policy also aligns with the national pol icy in the NPPF which 
stresses that the local plan should provide a framework for addressing housing 
needs.   The policy encompasses housing matters which national policy requires the 
local plan policies to address. It provides the overarching context for the other 
housing policies and helps to avoid repetition and duplication in those policies.  
8.6. Definitions of key terms and concepts used in the evidence and in this policy and 
the other housing policies are to be set out in either the Plan’s glossary or in th e 
plan’s Reasoned Justification, not in the wording of the policy. This Strategic Policy 
depends on the definitions of housing need types. Some of these definitions are set 
out in NPPF, notably the definition of affordable housing.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
149 8.7. This strategic policy is complemented by the strategic housing policy  about the 
amount of housing to be delivered in the plan period. Together these policies  will 
align with and support the plan’s spatial strategy and the economic strategy, as well 
as strategic policies on clim ate change, energy efficiency, design and accessibility.  
In combination, the two policies provide a clear starting point for the suite of non -
strategic housing policies.  
8.8. Housing needs are diverse and change over time. The non -strategic housing 
policies are  necessarily wide ranging. These policies address local issues relevant 
to East Devon and they fully reflect national planning policies, mindful of the test of 
soundness for consistency with national planning policies. They take account of the 
NPPF and the  24 May 2021 Written Ministerial Statement. Plan policies are also 
informed by national policy on housing, which is complex, particularly the 
approaches to widening housing choice across housing tenures. The policies 
address the Council’s aspirations set o ut in the Council Plan, and the Council’s 
Housing Strategy.  
8.9. The suite of proposed non -strategic housing policies support the p roposed Strategic 
Policies on housing which address needs and delivery of the levels of future 
housing development. Those housing policies work in combination within the spatial 
strategy, focused on:  
 Delivering housing provision through a range of dwelling sizes, types and 
tenures  
 Delivering more affordable homes; and  
 Achieving mixed and balanced places, which have access to service s and 
amenities.  
8.10.  Their purpose is to guide development management decisions on development 
proposals related to housing uses. The 9 policies cover development, of Residential 
Dwellings ( Use Class C3 ), Residential Institutions ( Use Class C2 ), other housing 
such as Houses In Multiple Occupation (HMO) ( Sui Generis  use), and stationing of 
caravans for residential purposes for Gypsies and Travellers, and Travelling 
Showpeople ( Sui Generis  use). 
Evidence  
8.11.  The key evidence about housing need is  provided by the Loca l Housing Needs 
Assessment  2022  – see Report of Findings for East Devon -: East Devon, Exeter, 
Mid Devon and Teignbridge Local Housing Needs Asse ssment 2022 . This provides 
evidence about Local  Housing Need, Affordable Housing Need, and the needs of 
particular groups of people.  The use of evidence to justify the policy is explained in 
the text accompanying each policy.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
150 Audit trail and use of evide nce to justify housing policies  
8.12.  This subject is complex. A full explanation to justify each policy would be too much 
and too detailed for this document. It will be set out in a Topic Paper on housing 
policy. That audit trail document will draw on a wide ra nge of evidence.  
Affordable housing  
8.13.  Affordability and lack of sufficient affordable housing is a major issue in East Devon. 
Some people describe it as a housing crisis. We have a combination of high house 
prices, high private rents and a low proportion o f social and affordable rent 
properties.  With an affordability ratio of 10. 9, this is one of the highest in Devon, 
well above the national average and the south west average.  
8.14.  Additional affordable housing is needed particularly from newly forming, young 
households . National planning and housing policy, and the Council Plan are 
seeking to increase the delivery of affordable housing. The amount of affordable 
housing changes through losses from Right to Buy and demolitions, but also 
through stock additions an d tenure changes.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
151 40. Policy - Affordable Hou sing 
1. To foster balanced and mixed communities, planning obligations will be sought on all 
developments which propose affordable housing or which satisfy the criteria for 
qualifying cases for providing a mix of mark et and affordable housing. The following will 
apply:  
a. The number, size, type and tenure of affordable housing will meet local need in 
accordance with Table 1, the Council’s most up to date evidence of need and supply, 
the provisions of this policy, and the  provisions of other Development Plan 
Documents where the latter have not been superseded by the Local Plan . 
 
TABLE 1      
Location  Affordable  housing as a 
percentage of the site total  Tenure mix of the affordable housing 
requirement  
Second new town  At least 15% (this figure 
and potential for more will 
be dependent on deliver y 
vehicles established for 
the implementation of the 
new town)  
  50% Social Rent  
 10% Affordable Rent  
 30% First Homes at 30% discount  
 10% other affordable 
homeownership products  
Rest of  East Devon 
(excluding 
Cranbrook DPD 
area and existing 
commitments/  
completions ) At least 35%   64% Social Rent  
 0% Affordable Rent  
 36% First Homes at 30% discount  
 0% other affordable 
homeownership products  
b. Wher e development propos als seek to replace  existin g affordable housing, the 
number and mix of tenures and affordable housing types will make efficient use of the 
land consistent with policies on design and housing density , and appropriate to the 
specific circumstances of the site. Where relevant, the mix will facilitate the right of 
return for existing social rent tenants from Council housing into new social rent 
accommodation. Otherwise , replacement of rented affordable housing will be 
provided as affordable rent. Market housing may be included for viabil ity reasons to 
enable affordable housing delivery provided there is little or no net loss of affordable 
housing on site, or as part of a larger scheme.  
c. Affordable housing will remain affordable in perpetuity. Legal agreements may make 
provision for achievi ng clawback on long term, phased schemes if affordable housing 
is converted to another tenure.  
d. Where the requirements and exceptional circumstances set out in this policy are not 
proposed to be met, then the applicant will submit development viability evid ence to 
justify the departure. Where a lower level of provision is initially agreed, developers 
will be required to enter into an agreement that allows affordable housing 
contributions to be increased in the future should higher levels become achievable 
(e.g. through an ‘overage’ clause). The Council will also reappraise viability on 
subsequent phases of large schemes.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
152 2. On all developments for new market housing, including conversions, mixed use 
schemes, and housing development that forms part of a wider dev elopment, but 
excluding Build to Rent and other exemptions set out in this policy, the Council will 
require the provision of affordable housing in accordance with the following:  
a. Affordable housing will be required on residential development schemes of 10 o r 
more dwellings (gross), including specialist housing for older people where the 
site is delivering a net gain of 10 or more self -contained units (C3 and C2), and 
will provide a mix of tenures*:  
b. In cases where the 35% calculation provides a fraction of an  affordable dwelling, 
such provision will be collected through a financial contribution of broadly 
equivalent value to that which would have been required on -site.  
c. Housing provision on major sites (10 or more dwellings) will be made for at least 
10% of aff ordable housing to be affordable home ownership products**, except 
for the following housing development types which are exempt:  
 Solely for Build  to Rent homes;  
 Specialist accommodation for people with specific needs such as purpose -
built accommodation for  older persons***  
 Self-build or custom build housing***; or  
 Solely for affordable housing.  
d. Where affordable housing is required , it will be provided on site and dispersed in 
small clusters across the site, indistinguishable in terms of design and materials  
from any market housing  
e. In exceptional circumstances, the Council may accept a financial contribution by 
way of a commuted sum to an equivalent value in lieu of on -site delivery 
provision for use towards offsite affordable housing provision. For example , 
where no registered provider is willing to manage the affordable units.  
f. Exceptionally, the Council may consider land gifted to the Council in lieu of 
affordable housing provision or financial contribution, subject to site threshold, 
equivalence provision, location, and infrastructure availability.  
g. Developments of 5 to 9 dwellings (gross) located within a parish defined as a 
designated rural area[1] will be required to make a financial contribution based 
on the affordable housing requirement and tenure split of affordable housing 
requirement as set out in Tab le 1 in this Policy.  
h.  Where it can be demonstrated that the requirements above are not viable, due 
to specific site conditions or other material considerations affecting development 
of the site, an alternative dwelling or tenure mix that meets local need o r a lower 
level of provision may be acceptable. Preference will be to reduce the proportion 
of affordable rent home  first, then social rent housing , and finally affordable 
home ownership . 
i. As part of residential development proposals, where vacant buildings  are 
brought back into any lawful use, or are demolished to be replaced by new 
buildings, the affordable housing requirement for the proposal will be discounted 
by a proportion equivalent to the existing gross floorspace of the vacant 
buildings unless the requirement to do so is removed or moderate d by a change 
in national policy or guidance.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
153 3. Unless proposed development falls within one of  the exceptions or exemptions in this 
policy, p lanning permission will be refused where a site is under the relevant dwelling 
number threshold s in Clause s 2a), 2c) and 2g)  and does not achieve optimum 
capacity, or where a larger site has been sub -divided into smaller parcels and so 
avoids developer contributions for affordable housing.  
4. Provide a mix of property sizes and ty pes across the site, demonstrating how the site 
responds to robust, up to date evidence about housing need, including the following 
mix of property sizes for affordable housing shown in the East Devon Local Housing 
Need Assessment 2022:  
 
Property size  Percentage of affordable  housing provided  
1 bedroom  12% 
2 bedrooms  37% 
3 bedrooms  40% 
4+ bedrooms  11% 
           (Source Table 52 LHNA 2022)  
 
5. For all affordable homes that are delivered as First Homes the following will apply : 
a. A discount of 30% against th e market value  
b. The price cap, based on open market values and after the discount is applied, and 
household income caps will be in accordance with national planning policy current at 
the ‘Authority to Proceed’ stage of  the First Homes application process.  
c. ‘Local connection’ eligibility criteria and priority for key workers a re as  set out in the 
East Devon First Homes Interim Guidance Note 2022  and subsequently in an SPD). 
Unless superseded by new national planning policy or guidance, after 3 months of 
market ing if there is no reservation of or offer accepted on a First Home, then the 
local eligibility criteria fall away , and the First Home reverts to national criteria.  
d. The legal agreement will include provisions regarding the sale of First Homes 
without First  Homes restrictions where the circumstances prescribed in Government 
policy and guidance are met.  
6. On Build to Rent schemes, 20% will be affordable private rent homes provided on site 
at a 20% discount, subject to viability. All homes on the scheme will be managed 
collectively by a single build to rent landlord.  
7. The following types of developments are exempt from this policy:  
a. Rural Exception Sites and First Homes Exception Sites (see Policy 48);  
b. Residential institutions, student accommodation, gypsy and tr aveller 
accommodation, live work units where the main use is predominantly employment, 
and non -residential development.  
8. The Local Planning Authority will prepare a Supplementary Planning Document to set 
out details about how this Policy will be implemented .  
 
NOTES :  
Designated rural areas are described under section 157(1) of the Housing Act 1985, 
which includes Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
154 * Table 1) will be refined when viability evidence and affordable housing supply forecasts 
are available. Th is may vary the affordable housing requirement and/or tenure split. 
These may also vary by location . 
** The percentage in this clause  will be refined when viability evidence and affordable 
housing supply forecasts are available to assess the policy’s effec tiveness ( i.e. 
deliverability). It may also be refined when this evidence is also used to assess whether 
the application of the 10% requirement would or would not prejudice the ability to meet 
the identified affordable housing needs of specific groups.  
*** Where specialist housing or self -build or custom build is part of the proposed mix of 
housing on a development scheme then the policy will apply to the residue that is not 
exempted provided that the residue is 10 or more dwellings (gross).  
 
 
8.15.  This policy  focuses on affordable housing delivered through development. It 
supports the Strategic Policies on addressing housing need and affordable housing 
provision aligned with the local plan’s vision, objectives and strategies. The policy is 
needed to help deliv er at least 4, 070 additional affordable dwellings in the plan 
period. This policy is complemented by the Policy on Rural Exception and First 
Homes Exception sites in the countryside which are aimed at extending the 
opportunity to deliver affordable housing  in rural areas.  
8.16.  For the avoidance of doubt, this policy does not supersede Policy CB10 Cranbrook 
Affordable Housing in the Cranbrook Plan DPD.  
8.17.  Some affordable housing will be delivered by Registered Providers.  Currently these 
are primarily by Housing Ass ociations. The District Council is exploring ways of 
increasing social and affordable housing. However, contributions from market 
housing development negotiated through S106 agreements are likely to remain the 
principal mechanism for delivering additional affordable housing for the foreseeable 
future.  
8.18.  NPPF defines types of affordable housing. The May 2021 Written Ministerial 
Statement (WMS) added First Homes as a new type. The preferred policies rely on 
those definitions.  
8.19.  The complicated plethora of afforda ble housing products and routes by which 
households can move from affordable to market housing, has widened and been 
updated by recent national policy. As well as Social Rent, Affordable Rent, Share d 
Ownership, Discounted Market Housing, Rural Exceptions, the local plan considers 
Rent to Buy, Build to Rent, and First Homes Exceptions Homes . 
8.20.  Justifying the local components in this policy  relies on local evidence.  The chief 
evidence about affordable housing need is in the East Devon Local Housing Needs 
Asses sment September 2022 (ORS). It assesses the scale and type of affordable 
housing need in the district over the plan period. In addition, the Council has 
evidence about the supply of affordable housing from completions, commitments 
and potential allocations . More information about how the Council has used this East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
155 evidence to justify this Affordable Housing policy as well as the strategic policy on 
Affordable Housing Requirement is set out the 2022 Housing Need, Supply and 
Requirement Interim Topic Paper . 
8.21.  All th e issues listed in the policy are raised in the NPPF, the W ritten Ministerial 
Statement on First Homes (May 2021)  and related PPG.  The broad approaches to 
affordable housing in the policy reflect national policy. This policy provides local 
policy componen ts relating to the following:  
 The site size threshold s for determining wh ere affordable housing is required  – 
other than exemptions, all housing development over the threshold will need 
to contribute.  
 Percentages of affordable housing sought from a devel opment site, by size 
and type . The 2022  Housing Need, Supply and Requirement Interim Topic 
Paper justifies these percentages of affordable housing mix. The percentages 
are informed by LHNA sensitivity test 3 , moderated by supply forecast 
evidence.  Not all  housing development sites would deliver affordable housing 
due to exemptions, so these percentages relate to sites where policy would 
require affordable housing provision, not to the total district housing 
requirement.  They are the starting point for nego tiations for affordable housing 
to be delivered through planning obligations.  
 The policy makes clear the ex ceptional circumstances where proposals 
departing from policy may be considered , and the requirement for viability 
evidence to justify a  departure.  
 The 30% discount on First Hom es (which the LHNA sensitivity test 3 
encompasses), this is the lowest of the discount rates which national planning 
policy allows th e plan to use.  
 The policy aim for 25% of all affordable housing delivered through planning 
obligations to be First Homes, in line with Government policy  
 The policy aim for 10% of all dwellings being delivered on a site to be 
affordable home ownership, in line with Government policy  
 Reliance on national policy regarding Build to rent  
 Local connectio n eligibility criteria  for First Homes (currently in the Interim 
Guidance Note)  
 The Council ’s commitment to producing an SPD  to guide policy  
implementation .  This will include local connection criteria.  
8.22.  The Council will review the policy when further evide nce relating to housing supply 
delivery and trajectories becomes available.  
 
 
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
156 41. Policy - Housing to meet the needs of older people  
1.  The Council will support development that widens choice by securing a more 
diverse supply of housing where this meets  the identified needs of older people 
in East Devon, and supports healthy, safe and independent lives . 
2.  At least 1,630 net additional specialist dwellings in East Devon to meet older 
person needs is expected to be delivered in the form of a dapted hou sing 
delivered through Policy 41  but the Council aspires to achieve more than this 
amount in the plan period where consistent with plan objectives and the spatial 
strategy.  The Council will monitor the delivery of specialist housing for older 
people.  
3. The C ouncil will determine planning applications for different types of specialist 
housing for older people, on the basis that:  
a. Market accommodation for older people in the form of age restricted general 
market housing, retirement living or sheltered housing a nd extra care 
housing or housing with care is in Use Class C3 (dwellings).  
b. Residential care home and nursing home accommodation (including end of 
life / hospice care and dementia care home accommodation) are in Use 
Class C2.  Local Plan housing policie s on affordable housing  and Exception 
Sites  will not apply to them,  
c. The Use Class of other specialist housing products will be determined taking 
into consideration the level of care and scale of communal facilities.   
 
Consequently, the following will apply w hen determining planning applications:  
4. Suitable locations for specialist older person accommodation will be at 
settlements in tiers 1 to 4 of the settlement hierarchy where the site is within 
400m walking distance of local shops and easily accessible by wa lking or by 
public transport to town centres and to health, care and community facilities.  
5. The Council will support development proposing specialist older person 
housing at suitable locations in East Devon  where this widens choice . 
6. Where there is up to dat e evidence of specialist accommodation need in East 
Devon and subject to viability, development will be required to deliver one or 
more of the specialist types of accommodation for older people as follows : 
a. On local plan site allocations  development proposa ls for 20 to 199 
dwellings  will include at least  20% of those dwellings on -site as specialist 
older person dwelling s (Use Class C3)  
b. On local plan site allocations , development proposals for 200 or more 
dwellings will include at least 20% of those dwellings  on-site as specialist 
older person dwellings as C3 d wellings or C2 equivalents   
7. Exceptionally, a lower percentage of specialist accommodation for older people 
may be considered where there is evidence of abnormal costs or site 
conditions not anticipated b y the plan or the Overall Plan Viability evidence.  
8. For Use Class C2 accommodation, the count of the number of bed spaces  will 
be converted to dwelling equivalents based on the formula used by national East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
157 statistics from the latest Housing Flow Reconciliation Return. Dwelling 
equivalents will be monitored and counted for housing supply purposes.  
9. Specialist older person housing will provide adequate communal facilities, 
including accommodation for essential staff, on site.  
10. Proposals for specialist older person h ousing will demonstrate how design and 
layout addresses  the health and well -being needs of older people including 
those with dementia and other long -term conditions, consistent with Policies 61 
and 62 . 
11. Where a site provides a mix of Use Classes C2 and C3, Policy 40 will apply to 
the C3 element of the development. Applications will need to include Care 
Needs Assessment evidence to justify the development proposal’s scale, 
tenure and accommodation type.  
12. Planning permission will be refused in the following cir cumstances : 
a. On a Local Plan allocation that is expected to achieve 200 or more 
dwellings which does not meet the exceptional c ircumstances set out in 
Clause 8  of this Policy, where the development proposal avoids provision 
of specialist older person housin g because:  
i. The development proposed is under the 200 -dwelling threshold and 
does not achieve optimum capacity, or  
ii. A larger site has been sub -divided into smaller parcels that then are 
below the threshold .  Or  
b. Where the proposed development of a large ret irement scheme would 
exceed up to date identified need or would significantly undermine the 
creation of sustainable, mixed communities; Or  
c. Where development proposed would result in the loss of specialist housing 
for older people, unless evidence demonstra tes that:  
i. There is no longer a need in East Devon for that type of housing; and  
ii. The housing cannot be converted to meet other types of older person 
need, or that conversion, remodelling, or redevelopment to specialist 
housing to meet other  social care and health needs is not viable.  
13. The Local Planning Authority will prepare a Supplementary Planning Document 
to set out details about how this Policy will be implemented . 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.23.  Planning for the housing needs of older people is  important because East Devon 
has an ageing population that is growing. Based on the dwelling -led Local Housing 
Need projection , the LHNA 2022 concludes that the number of over 75s in East 
Devon is projected to increase by around 13,300 in the period 2020 -40; of which 
approximately 5,300 will be over 85 years old.  
8.24.  In addition to the national and local trend of an ageing population, people are 
attracted to East Devon by its environmental qualities, including those looking to East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
158 retire here. This increases deman d for housing and impacts on local house prices 
and affordability.  
8.25.  NPPF specifically identifies older people as one of the groups in the community 
whose assessed needs should be reflected in planning policy. NPPF defines older 
people. All the issues listed  in the preferred policy are raised in NPPF and related 
PPG.  The broad approaches to housing for older people in the policy reflect 
national policy.  
8.26.  Having a local plan policy focused on providing the right type of housing in the right 
place to meet the needs of older people is essential. This policy is one of a suite of 
policies to address the need for more and better quality homes and communities for 
all. It focuses on widening choice, reflecting the Council Plan and complementing 
the Council’s Housing Strategy. Offering older people a better choice of 
accommodation to suit their changing needs helps them live independently for 
longer in their communities.  
8.27.  The needs of older people are diverse. Their health, lifestyles, income and wealth 
differs greatly,  as will their housing needs. Those needs change over time. Many 
older people may not want or need specialist housing but prefer to stay or move to 
general housing that is already suitable, includ ing homes that can be adapted.  
8.28.  The policy recognises that a wide range of dwelling types is needed. Much will be 
general need housing, be it flats, bungalows, smaller or larger homes, which are 
accessible and adaptable, where care can be provided in the home. But there will 
be a need for specialist housing for olde r people, with high levels of care and 
support.  PPG identifies the broad categories of specialist housing. The policy uses 
these broad categories to make clear which types will be subject to affordable 
housing policies, and which will be exempt.  
8.29.  This polic y focuses on types of housing delivered through development that can 
meet the needs of older people. It supports the Strategic Policies on addressing 
housing need and mixed communities aligned with the local plan’s vision, objectives 
and strategies. It ope rates in concert with the policy on accessible and adaptable 
housing. The policy on subdivision of existing dwellings and building creating flats 
therefore works in tandem with this policy, to support the development of housing 
for older people and changes  to the existing dwelling stock.  
8.30.  Adapted housing is expected to be a significant source of housing to meet the 
housing needs of older people , Adapted housing delivered through Policy 40 will 
augment supply general housing in the housing stock that is alrea dy suitable for 
older person needs or homes which can be adapted to meet changing needs . The 
LHNA 2022 shows that the vast majority of the overall net increase of 13, 300 in 
households to 2040, is in households headed by somebody over the age of 65. 
Many ar e already established and living in existing homes but their needs will 
change over time.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
159 8.31.  The LHNA 2022 modelled demand for specialis t older person housing in the district 
in the plan period is 6,224 dwellings . This is an idealised outcome. The LHNA 2022 
states t hat in practice the level of delivery identified as being required is likely to be 
unachievable given that it is about a third of the overall local housing need, If 
current rates of provision were to continue , then a further 1,630 specialist older 
person dwellings would be required, equating to about 9% of the Local Housing 
Need.  The study breaks down the  forecast into types of specialist housing.  
8.32.  Market and affordable dwellings will meet part of the need. Other specialist housing 
will be needed such  as residential care homes and extra care homes (Use class C2 
– Residential institution). In line with PPG, the LPA counts housing provided for 
older people, including residential institutions in Use Class C2, against their housing 
requirement. This takes into account the Government’s formula  used for the 
Housing Flow Reconciliation Return statistics  to convert C2 bed spaces (gains and 
losses) to C3 dwelling equivalents.  
8.33.  The LHNA 2022  does not recommend the number of additional bed spaces needed 
in C2 care homes to meet the needs of elderly people.  But it forecasts the overall 
demand for extra care housing to be 2,473 units to 2040. Nearly all would be C2 
accommodation because of the level of care and access to communal facilities 
required.  The need for sh eltered accommodation is forecast to be 3,751 dwellings.   
However, the amount of sheltered housing and ex tra care units provided if current 
rates are maintained would be 1,590 and 40 respectively.  There is considerable 
uncertainty at this time about how much of the modelled demand would arise, as 
demand depends on the ability of occupiers to afford the  specialist housing 
products and the alternatives available such as assistive technology that helps to 
support people at home for longer.  
8.34.  Given the scale of  need for older persons housing across the District as evidence 
by the LHNA 2022, there is no policy requirement for planning applications to 
demonstrate this need. Planning applications should demonstrate how the 
proposed development  widens choice to meet  the range of needs for older persons 
housing.  
8.35.  The policy identifies where the types of locations where specialist housing is being 
directed. These are places in the settlement hierarchy where there are services and 
facilities.  
8.36.  The policy provides site s ize thresholds , mindful that larger sites will be at the towns 
in tiers 1 and 2, the proposed urban extension north of Topsham, and the proposed 
second new town . The 200-dwelling threshold reflects the likely minimum size of a 
new Use Class C2 care home, i s likely to reflect  current business models, and may 
only be achievable on larger sites.  
8.37.  The plan’s policies relating to high quality and inclusive design will suppor t the 
delivery of this policy.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
160 8.38.  The Council will keep this policy under review through the plan making process, as 
further evidence becomes available, including the evidence about the overall 
viability  of the plan.  
 
42. Policy - Accessible and Adaptable Housing   
 
To ensure that new homes provide quality living environments for residents both now 
and in the future, the following standards from Building Regulations Approved 
Document M: Volume 1 (Access to and use of  dwellings) (or replacement standards) 
will apply to new dwellings, subject to consideration of site suitability and site viability:  
a. 100% o f all new dwellings will meet building regulation M4 (2)  requirements 
(accessible and adaptable dwellings).  
b. 100% of all new specialist accommodation for older people will meet regulation 
M4 (3) requirements (a) or (b) (wheelchair user dwellings).  
c. 100% of new specialist accommodation for older people will meet regulation 
M4 (3) (2) (b) requirements (wheelchair accessible dwellings) for those 
dwellings where  the local authority is responsible for allocating or nominating a 
person to live in a dwelling . 
d. At lea st 15% of all new affordable housing for rent will meet building regulation 
M4 (3) (2) (a) requir ements  (wheelchair adapt able). 
e. At least 10% of all new affordable housing for homeownership will meet 
regulation M4 (3) (2)  requirements (a) or (b) (wheelchair  user dwellings).  
f. At least 10% of all new market housing dwellings will meet regulation M4 (3) 
(2) requirements (a) or (b) (wheelchair user dwellings).  
 
When providing for wheelchair user housing, early discussion with the Council is 
required to obtain th e most up to date information on specific need for this type of 
housing in the local area . 
 
The Local Planning Authority will prepare a Supplementary Planning Document to set 
out details about how this Policy will be implemented.  
 
Justification for inclus ion of policy  
8.39.  The Government’s approach to health and adult social care is underpinned by the 
principle of sustaining people at home for as long as possible. This is reflected in 
building regulations relating to adaptations and wheelchair accessible homes,  with 
3 categories of dwellings:  
 
I. M4(1) Category 1: Visitable dwellings – mandatory, broadly about 
accessibility to all properties  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
161 II. M4(2) Category 2: Accessible and adaptable dwellings – optional, similar 
to lifetime homes, and  
III. M4(3) Category 3: Wheelcha ir user dwellings – optional, equivalent to 
wheelchair accessible standard  
8.40.  The East Devon  Local Housing Need Assessment 2022 provides the evidence in 
relation to need for nationally described standards for accessible and adaptable 
homes (Part M4(2)) and wh eelchair users (Part M4(3)). It demonstrates that need is 
largely driven by a growing population of older persons, as the PPG recognises.  
8.41.  The Council considers that this evidence is robust and can be relied upon to justify 
this policy.  It demons trates that an additional 12,959 households will either need 
adaptations to their existing housing or suitable new housing to be provided by 
2040.   
8.42.  M4(2) Category 2 : The study estimates 76% of households  would live in dwellings 
that can be converted to meet the M4(1 ) Category standard. The study concludes 
that at least 30% of the need for adapted housing could not be met by a daptation of 
existing homes, a total of 5,11 9 households. They would need M4(2) Category 2 .  
However, there is a significant overlap with the 6, 400 older persons dwellings need 
identified by the study.  Nevertheless, the requirement for adapted housing would 
still be high.  
8.43.  M4(3) Category 3 Category 3 wheelchair users housing  Based on gross 
modelled need, t he ORS study forecasts a net additional 1,010 households over the 
plan period in East Devon will need wheelchair adapted housing. This equates to 
about 6% of the local housing need . The 5,119  net adapted need housing already 
encompasses households counted as having a health problems or disability that 
affects their housing need. That figure already includes households with wheelchair 
users so the latter should not be double counted. There’s also a very significant 
overlap between wheelchair users housing need and the forecast additional 6, 224 
speci alist older persons housing need. The study concludes that it may be 
appropriate to adopt a target of 100% wheelchair accessible housing.  This could 
reduce the proportion of general needs housing that would need to meet the M4(3) 
Category 3 requirements.  
8.44.  The LHNA 2022 concludes that  is reasonable that the Council may consider:  
a) a target , for example15%  of all new affordable housing for rent , subject to 
viability)  being wheelchair adapted , to ensure that a situation does not 
arise in which a property is not available for a wheelchair user in 
affordable need  
b) A target , for example 10%  of all new market housing , being  fully 
wheelchair adaptable homes, subject to viability and similar constraint s, 
to avoid there being insufficient market homes that are fully whee lchair 
adaptable to meet the needs of the wheelchair using population . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
162 8.45.  The policy addresse s the identified  need s in the plan period.    All the issues listed 
in the policy are raised in the NPPF and related PPG , in the context of Building 
Regulations A pproved Document M: Volume 1 (Access to and use of dwellings) .  
The broad approaches to housing for accessible and adaptable housing in the 
policy reflect national policy.  
8.46.  The Policy sets out the Council’s approach towards the optional standards 
regarding acce ss to and use of buildings under Regulations M4(2) and M4(3).  This 
approach is consistent with NPPF, and PPG on Housing for Older and Disabled 
People, including the guidance that wh ere an identified need exists, plans are 
expected to make use of the  optio nal technical housing standards  (footnote 46 of 
the NPPF ) to help bring forward an adequate supply of accessible housing.  The 
percentage of dwellings for the categories, and the circumstances where they are 
required  by policy  are guided by the evidence in the LHNA 2022  and the Local Plan 
spatial strategy . 
8.47.  The Council is mindful that its ability to require wheelchair accessible housing  is 
constrained to those dwellings where the Council is responsible for allocating or 
nominating a person to live in th ose dwelling s. These are affordable dwellings for 
social rent or affordable rent which  are and secured through the preparation of the 
S106 legal agreem ent which is an integral part of the development management 
process.  The legal agreement must be completed bef ore planning permission is 
granted.   The planning application should  be accompanied by an Affordable 
Housing Statement indicating the number and types of affordable housing and the 
relevant dwelling units. It should be noted that the Council does not ‘allo cate’ 
affordable home ownership  housing products so cannot require  First Homes, 
Shared Ownership, or Discounted Market H ousing to be wheelchair accessible . 
This does not preclude affordable home ownership products or market housing 
from being wheelchair ac cessible . 
8.48.  Where there is evidence that site conditions or viability preclude the provision of 
specialist housing required by policy, then building regulations require that housing 
is provided to at least M4(1) standard.  
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
163 43. Policy - Market housing mix  
 
To provide choice and meet needs, through achieving a mix of housing types and 
sizes across East Devon, residential proposals for use Class C3 dwellings will : 
1. Be at locations consistent with the spatial strategy and settlement hiera rchy.   
2. The type of market housing for sale or rent will address housing needs in the 
area, and take account of the l ocation and context of surrounding development   
3. Provide a mix of property sizes across  the site, demonstrating how the site 
responds to robust, up to date evidence ab out housing need, including the 
following mix of property sizes for market housing shown in the East Devon  
Local Housing Need Assessment 2022 : 
 
Property size  Percentage of market housing provided  
1 bedroom  5% 
2 bedrooms  19% 
3 bedrooms  53% 
4+ bedrooms  22% 
 (Source Table 52 LHNA 2022)  
 
4. Where the development is not consistent with evidenced needs, the proposal 
will need to demonstrate why the departure is justified, for example : 
 Physical constraints reducing the number of dwellings;  
 Cost and design of co nversions  
 Locations such as town centres where low density development with 
larger, higher value dwellings may not be appropriate  
 Severe site constraints and abnormal costs impacting on viability  
 Particular housing types and forms needed to sustain or enha nce a 
heritage asset or its setting  
 Local up to date evidence of housing need in the parish or parish group  
5. Exceptionally, if a proposal is not meeting policy requirements, applicants will 
need to provide  robust market conditions evidence demonstrating lac k of 
marketability  
6. The Local Planning Authority will prepare a Supplementary Planning Document 
to set out details about how this Policy will be implemented.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.49.  This policy complements the policy on affordable housing m ix. It helps ensure that 
the overall policy approach to mix and balance of housing types and sizes across 
the District can be addressed. It enables a wide choice of homes to address the 
needs for all types of housing of the plan period, meeting the needs o f the whole 
community. It also contributes towards creating more interesting and diverse 
environments. The policy takes account of the current housing stock and projected East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
164 demographic changes which impact on the need to address issues relating to 
market hou sing need and supply with regard to:  
 Housing types ( e.g. houses; flats)  
 Dwelling size (number of bedrooms)  
 Sectors within the private sector market e.g. private rented, ownership  
8.50.  Government policy is for local plans to boost housing supply.  Delivery of 4, 070 
affordable housing requirement  to 2040 in East Devon  means that th e remaining 
14,850 dwellings requirement would therefore be met by market housing for sale 
and rent  in the plan period.  This is about 75% of the total policy requirement.  
8.51.  The LHNA 2022 provide s evidence about the need for a range of housing types and 
tenures in the area.  The Council concludes that this provides robust evidence to 
inform this policy, as well as  the S trategic Policy on levels of future housing 
development (including the ho using requirements) . However, the Council 
acknowledges that when development proposals are submitted they will need to be 
informed by the latest evidence about housing need.  
8.52.  A range of market housing types, tenures and sizes are needed across East Devon, 
to provide choice for the wide range of needs in this area.  The housing markets 
within this District are traditionally buoyant. Recent housing development has been 
greatest at Cranbrook and the West End of the district.  
8.53.  Owner occupied housing is the larges t tenure type in East Devon, accounting for 76 
per cent of dwellings in 2011. This is slightly down on the 78 per cent in 2001. 
Home ownership remains a keystone policy of Government.  The 2019 Government 
manifesto pledge is to  “continue to increase the nu mber of homes being built”.  The 
manifesto also referred to a need to rebalance the housing market towards more 
home ownership: There are a plethora of Government initiatives and housing 
products aimed at extending home ownership, enabling households who as pire to 
home ownership to get on to the property ladder.  
8.54.  Government does recognise that the private rented sector is an important and 
growing part of the housing market in England. Much of the focus is on improving 
management and maintenance.  Private rent ed housing in 2011 rose to 15% of total 
stock in East Devon. Private rent levels are high compared to the rest of Devon with 
average monthly private sector rents almost £700. This policy recognises the role of 
the private rented sector in making housing av ailable for those who cannot afford or 
do not want home ownership, but who can afford market rents.  Separate local plan 
policies on design and on conversion of existing dwellings and buildings, and 
delivery of high quality housing are relevant to private rented housing and market 
housing.  
8.55.  The policy addresses how to secure a mix of market housing  to meet  need in the 
plan period.  All the issues listed in the preferred policy are raised in the NPPF and 
related PPG.  The broad approaches to market housing m ix in the policy reflect 
national planning and housing policy. The policy does not include a size threshold, East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
165 as all market dwellings should be responding to need. The policy therefore 
considers:  
 The percentage mix of dwelling sizes and  
 types of market hou sing for sale and rent  
 Locations – consistent with the settlement strategy  
 Evidence required to demonstrate why proposals cannot meet policy 
requirements . 
8.56.  Build to Rent   The preferred policy does not expressly promote ‘Build to Rent’.  
This is purpose -built housing that is typically 100% rented out.  Government has 
introduced new planning policy and guidance on Build to Rent (defined by NPPF). 
Build to Rent and Affordable Private Rent are different from Social and Affordable 
Rent homes provided by councils an d other registered providers specifically for 
applicants on the councils’ housing registers. Build to Rent is a distinct asset class 
within the private sector. It involves the building of homes specifically for the rental 
market. These developments are typ ically owned by companies (such as property 
companies or pension or insurance investment companies) and let directly or 
through an agent. Typically 100% rented, but it can be a mix of tenures and flats or 
houses. NPPF requires that affordable housing on bu ild to rent schemes should be 
provided by as affordable private rent, a class of affordable housing specifically 
designed for build to rent.  Typically 20% is the level of affordable private rent 
homes to be provided, and maintained in perpetuity, in any bu ild to rent scheme.  
NPPF requires a minimum rent discount of 20% relative to local market rents.  
8.57.  There is a range of demand for purpose built rented housing, mostly flats, in cities 
such as Exeter and Plymouth, and particularly in conurbations like London , 
Manchester and Birmingham. But East Devon is much smaller, demand remains 
focused on owner occupation. Locations suitable for high density, high rise flats are 
few. To justify a specific policy on Build to Rent housing, the Council would need 
evidence fr om stakeholders about:  
 What appetite is there from Registered Providers to develop or manage Build 
to Rent housing (or are they prioritising Affordable Rent)?  
 What appetite is there from developers and investors for Build to Rent 
schemes, including demand appraisal and viability? And can it accelerate 
housing delivery?  
 What kind of products would be delivered? Is the focus on high end projects?  
 What is the minimum size of development for the schemes to be viable (50+ 
units?)  
 What is the target market, parti cularly the age and income group(s)?  
 What locations, design/layout and facilities would renters find desirable?  
8.58.  The LHNA 2022 refers to research by JLL which shows that the average Build to 
rent option is 9.3% more expensive than median rents . Even with di scount the local 
housing allowance is insufficient to cover costs fo r affordable rent units, and would 
seem unlikely to bring forward affordable housing options . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
166 8.59.  There is little or no evidence at this time  that there is demand for  Build to Rent  
products in  East Devon . If there is evidence of need then PPG requires the local 
plan to include policy setting out the approach to promoting and accommodating 
build to rent.  
8.60.  The Council will keep this policy under review through the plan making process, as 
additiona l evidence becomes available, for example the overall plan viability 
evidence and forecasts about delivery of market housing.  
  
44. Policy – Self-Build and Custom Build Housing  
 
As part of meeting housing needs, securing greater housing diversity and 
encourag ing high quality design, proposals for custom and self -build housing, to be 
occupied by those persons commissioning or undertaking the construction , will be 
supported through the following measures : 
1. 5% of dwellings on sites of 20 homes or more, including a ll local plan housing and 
mixed -use allocations,  must be delivered as serviced custom and self -build 
plots 13. The agreed plots  should : 
a. Be actively marketed to individuals and custom build companies (as 
appropriate) in accordance with a marketing and pricing  strategy that shall be 
agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority in advance of a plot/s 
being first marketed.  All plots shall be marketed at a reasonable price to 
reflect market conditions for at least 24 months from being fully serviced and 
developable.  Any plots that have not been sold after 2 years of being 
continuously marketed in accordance with this policy shall be made available 
for development on the open market ; 
b. Have suitable road access delivered at an early stage in the development;  
c. Be made available for sale  before 50% of the dwellings on the site have been 
commenced ; 
d. Be of a size that reflects  local demand  and, where more than one plot is 
provided , a variety of sizes should be offered to reflect the range of local 
demand ; 
e. Be offered f or sale with no legal or physical restrictions that would prevent 
immediate purchase and development ; 
f. On sites of over 250 dwellings , a proportion of plots  must be  made available  
for affordable housing,  to be secured through legal agreement,  subject to 
viability; 
g. On sites of over 100 dwellings, design codes should be used flexibly to 
encourage high quality housing design ; 
h. On sites of over 100 dwellings, the agreed design code should be used to 
provide ‘plot passports’ that provide a simple, succinct summary  of each plot 
as a reference point for the purchaser.  
                                            
 
 
13  A serviced plot is a parcel of land with legal access to a public highway, and at least water, foul 
drainage and electricity supply ava ilable at the plot boundary  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
167 i. Be completed within 3 years of the self or custom builder purchasing the 
serviced and developable plot.  
2. Encouraging communities preparing Neighbourhood Plans to consider identifying 
sites for custom and  self-builders  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.61.  Promoting self -build housing - We want to increase opportunities for people to 
build their own homes in East Devon. This will enable greater diversity of housing 
supply and could lead to improvements in affordability, quality of design and choice.  
8.62.  Custom and self -build is part of the overall housing supply picture. This is additional 
to the mainstream supply housing delivered by large house builders and registered 
providers. Not only is it a route into  home ownership, including affordable 
homeownership, but it  also enables housing to be tailored to meet individual needs 
and specifications. It  can benefit individuals and communities.  For example, s elf-
build  can lead to savings relative to buying a ‘ready -made’ product because there is 
no developer profit (often at least 20% of the cost of a new home).  It  also has the 
potential to boost and accelerate the supply of housing  and can diversify the land 
supply , widen ing choice.  
8.63.  Communities benefit from homes  with a better design, build quality and 
environmental footprint and a more diverse and resilient housing supply. By using 
modern methods of construction and build ing to high specifications , self-builders 
often improv e the sustainability of the housing sto ck.  Self -build can also be good 
for local businesses and provide additional employment opportunities. It can form  
an attractive market to small and medium house builders because there is less risk , 
since  contracts are settled earlier in the development pr ocess. This enables 
construction to be financed through the customer’s mortgage stage payments, 
which reduces business finance and improves profitability. Supporting smaller 
builders can help local economies by using more local supply chains than volume 
house builders and creating opportunities for local tradespeople.  
8.64.  Under the Self Build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015, the Council is required to 
keep a register of those seeking to acquire serviced plots in the area for their own 
self-build and custom ho use building. There are also duties to have regard to this 
and to give enough suitable development permissions to meet the identified 
demand. The 2015 Act (as amended) contains a legal definition of Self -Build and 
Custom Build housing.  
Need  
8.65.  People wishing to commission or build their own homes are a component of the 
local housing need. The assessment of housing need by the Local Housing Need 
Assessment includes this type of  need.  Self -build and custom build housing East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
168 contributes to meeting the housing requir ement identified in the Strategic Policy on 
the levels of housing development .  
8.66.  The policy addresses the issue of housing need from people wishing to commission 
or build their own homes, consistent with national planning policy in the NPPF. The 
plan recogn ises that self -build and custom build housing have a role to help boost 
the supply of housing and helping to deliver a wide choice of high-quality  homes. 
This type of housing  can widen opportunities for home ownership and create 
sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities.   
8.67.  This policy does not apply to off-plan housing, which are homes purchased at the 
plan stage prior to construction but without input into the design and layout from the 
buyer.  
Supply  
8.68.  To date all self -build plots have been provided throu gh ‘windfall’ opportunities.   
Some of the initial owners are self-house  builders where the individual directly 
organises the design and construction of their new home. Other delivery models 
could include independent community collaboration where a group o f people 
acquire a site and split it into plots for self-build  homes, sharing labour and 
expertise.  Supported community self-build  is another delivery model where a social 
landlord or supportive body helps people build a group of homes together. The 
policy can apply to self -build and custom build development by different 
organisations such as Community Led Housing Groups, Community Land Trusts, 
Co-operatives and Cohousing groups.  
8.69.  Evidence in the annual self -build monitoring report indicates that the Counci l has so 
far met its legal requirements to provide plots to meet the demand shown on our 
register. However, we want to  do more  and there is already a  self-build policy in the 
Cranbrook Plan.  The Council has also made £500,000 available for capital spend 
from the 2020/21 budget for a pilot project for the direct provision of self -build plots 
through purchasing suitable land, servicing the land and ma rketing it for self -build 
plots . There are specific policies in emerging and made Neighbourhood Plans to 
help deliver more plots for self -build and the Council supports the Neighbourhood 
Plan work on this.   
8.70.  The new local plan represents a n opportunity to increase custom and self -build 
opportunities further  and the  policy applies everywhere,  except for the Cranbr ook 
Plan area which has its own policy.  
8.71.  The minimum site size for this policy is 20 dwellings, where a 5% rate can achieve 
at least 1 custom or self-build  dwelling , but it  does not preclude smaller sites from 
providing self -build or custom build dwellings .   
8.72.  A mix of service plot sizes helps to meet the range of demand and affordability. 
Larger sites provide the opportunity for affordable dwellings . We plan to provide East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
169 additional guidance on elements of this policy, including a defini tion of affordable for 
custom and self -build housing. The expectation is that the development makes 
provision for on -site service plots.   
8.73.  Policy criteria on Rural Exception and First Homes Exception sites would need to 
be met if custom or self-build  housing were to be proposed on those sites.  
Evidence  
8.74.  Since 2016 we have kept a register of people who want to build their own home in 
East Devon. This gives us a general indication of the level of inter est in self -build  
and we also collect information on things like how much people h ave to spend on a 
plot and their location preferences.   The latest Self -Build Monitoring report 
published February 202 2 shows that  around 190 individuals joined the self -build 
register from its launch in March 2016 to the end of October 2021.  It is assumed  
that if opportunities for self -build are increased , more people will b uild their own 
home tha n have joined the self -build register , but our policy includes provision for 
alternative delivery mechanisms if plots remain undeveloped .  
8.75.  We will need to assess  through our viability study the impact  of the policy on 
housing site viability, particularly the percentage of self -build on and the 20 dwelling 
threshold.  
Sub-dividing or replacing existing dwellings  
8.76.  Self-contained flats resulting from house conversions can be a valuable addition to 
the housing stock. They can be effective in meeting some households’ changing 
needs for housing.  The r euse of existing dwellings and building conversions 
significantly reduce s the embodied carbon footprint of the development, as well as 
re-using existing resources, and locating development within existing communities.   
8.77.  The replacement of existing buildings is restricted by the proposed policy on 
embedded carbon.  This seeks to promote the  retention of  existing buildings, so tha t 
their r eplacement will only be supported in exceptional circumstances.  The 
following  policy sets out the criteria that should  be met if a replacement dwelling 
meet s the exceptional cir cumstances set out in the embedded carbon policy.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
170 45. Policy – Residentia l Sub-division of Existing Dwellings and 
Buildings and Replacement of Existing Dwellings  
 
Any residential Sub -division of existing dwellings or buildings  should:  
 Avoid  any materially adverse impact on the character and amenities of the 
surrounding area or  on the existing building ; 
 Minimise  hard surfac ing of front gardens and ensure hard surfaced areas are 
permeable and/or discharge to a soakaway (subject to soil conditions being 
suitable);  
 Ensure that adequate  space  is provided  for bicycle/mobility scoote r storage ; 
and 
 Provide an a dequate external area for  car parking,  waste/recycling storage and 
for any shared use area such as outdoor drying of washing . 
Outside of a settlement boundary , any applications for residential subdivision or 
conversion  that inv olves extensions to accommodate the conversion will be judge d 
against the relevant criteria set out below  for replacement dwellings outside of a 
settlement boundary . 
Replacement of existing dwellings  
Exceptionally, where replacement dwellings can be justifie d (including under the 
embedded carbon policy)  all the following criteria should be met : 
 Prior to the first occupation  of any replacement dwelling , the dwelling which is 
to be replaced must be demoli shed ; 
 The replacement  dwelling must be  positioned on the footprint of the existing 
dwelling, unless there is a clear planning or environmental benefit to justify an 
alternative location within the existing curtilage ; and  
 The height of the replacement dwelling should be no higher than the dwelling 
to be replaced unless it can be demonstrated that an increase in heigh t will be 
compatible with neighbouring residential amenities, the street scene or the 
wider landscape . 
Additionally, outside of a settlement boundary , the following criteria  should also be 
met: 
 The foo tprint of any replacement dwelling (or subdivided building) must not 
exceed by more than 30%  of the external volume  of the dwelling to be 
replaced  (or the building to be converted/subdivided) and 
 The curtilage of the proposed replacement  (or sub -divided/co nverted)  building 
should be  no greater in area than that of the existing dwelling /building . 
A Supplementary Planning Document  will be produced  to set out details about how 
this Policy will be implemented.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
171 Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.78.  This policy supports the Council’s Housing Strategy  and is also part of the local 
plan’s strategy for supporting the transition to a low carbon future, in line with  the 
NPPF.    
8.79.  For this policy, a dwelling is a building with planning permission for use class C3 
(residential) or its residential use is evidenced as lawful; and ‘existing’ means the 
dwelling is habitable and permanent (meaning the planning permission is not 
temporary, i.e. the dwelling approved is not conditioned to be removed or subject to 
a legal agree ment requiring removal; or the unit cannot be moved i.e. not a caravan 
or mobile home).  This avoids creating a new dwelling in a place where a dwelling 
does not exist, including derelict and abandoned properties.  
8.80.  The policy does not impose a specific rest riction on the size of conversion or 
replacement dwellings within settlement boundaries , but outside of this restrictions 
are pro posed so that smaller dwell ings are retained , mindful that larger dwellings 
are generally more expensive,  and affordability is a significant issue, particularly  in 
rural areas . The strategy of the plan only to define settlement boundaries for  certain  
settlements  means that there will be settlements where the scale of replacement 
dwellings/sub -divisions/conversions will be limited in line with the criteria proposed . 
We could take a more ‘relaxed’ approach and not impose additional restrictions 
unless the site was ‘isolated ’ from a ny settlement and views are sought on the 
relative merits of such an approach and how criteria could be worded to avoid 
inappropriate development in rural areas and to maintain a stock of smaller homes.   
8.81.  For the avoidance of doubt, the preferred local plan Policy 4 6 on Exception sites 
addresses the specific issue of conversion or replacement of dwellings on  
Exception sites, to avoid the potential loss of affordable housing to market housing 
over time.   
8.82.  Some forms of housing development in the countryside such as re -use of 
redundant or disused buildings in the countryside and  Use Class Q permitted 
developmen t (for change of use from agricultural building to residential use, 
covered by GPDO legislation), are not replacement dwellings so are not subject to 
this policy, although other local plan policies may apply.  
Subdivision/Conversion  
8.83.  Part of this policy rela tes to the  subdivision of existing dwellings  and conversion of 
other buildings , to create self -contained dwellings which add to the dwelling stock.  
There is a separate policy in the plan on multiple occupancy of housing, a type of 
development which genera lly does not create net additional self -contained 
dwellings.  
8.84.  NPPF makes clear that the local plan should promote an effective use of land in 
meeting the need for homes.  This policy aligns with the broader strategy in the plan East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
172 for accommodating objectivel y assessed needs in a way that makes as much use 
as possible of previously developed land, boosts housing supply through 
subdivision , and meets need. Most subdivisions/ conversions would be below the 
one hectare or less than 30 dwellings threshold in NPPF f or small sites delivery. 
The net increase in dwellings on these sites would count towards the percentage 
target for small sites in the Strategic Policy on the level of housing development.  
8.85.  This part of t he policy aligns with Policy 32  on embodied carbon w ithin an existing 
building, and with NPPF which encourages the reuse of existing resources . By 
allowing subdivision/ conversion, t his approach also reduces the risk of dwellings 
being left vacant, becoming derelict over time, and eventually being lost from the 
dwelling stock. This helps to avoid the need for additional housing to be built 
elsewhere to replace that loss.  
8.86.  The policy also supports local plan policy on design. Conversions of buildings 
through change of use from non -residential use are also subje ct to other policies in 
the plan relevant to those uses, including retention of use subject to specified 
circumstances. Separate local plan policy covers conversions of listed buildings to 
residential and other uses.  
8.87.  The policy focuses on reducing and miti gating the impact of conversions.  For 
example, conversion to flats can have undesirable environmental effects such as 
hard surfacing of garden areas, external staircases and unattractive refuse storage 
areas that can damage the area’s character and amenit y. 
Replacement dwellings  
8.88.  Another part of this policy focuses on replacement dwellings th at are an exception 
to Policy 32  on Embodied Carbon, a policy which generally restricts replacement of 
existing dwellings.   Replacement involves the demolition and rem oval of one or 
more existing dwelling s and building the same number of new dwellings, not 
necessarily on the same footprint, but in the same curtilage. The NPPF does not 
define ‘replacement ’, so the policy draws on case -law.  
8.89.  Replacement of a dwelling can be beneficial where it improves the quality of the 
housing and is sensitive to the area’s characteristics and qualities.  However, the 
cumulative impact of development that replaces existing dwellings can lead in the 
long term to the urbanisation and erosi on of the character of countryside areas.  
8.90.  The policy focuses on reducing and mitigating the impact of replacement dwellings, 
such as the impact on neighbours.  Not all replacement dwellings occupy the same 
footprint as the existing dwelling,  so the policy  also ensure s there is a mechanism 
to avoid the risk of creating a second dwelling or planning unit on the site, for 
example by requiring the existing dwelling is demolished before the replacement 
dwelling is occupied.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
173 8.91.  The policy addresses issues related t o the conversion of existing dwellings and 
buildings to residential use and the replacement of existing dwellings.  All the issues 
listed in the preferred policy are raised in the NPPF and related PPG. The policy 
reflects national planning and housing poli cy, particularly regarding the opportunity 
to boost housing supply and mix of housing to meet needs. The main matters 
where the Council relies on a local policy component are:  
 Appropriate locations – consistent with the settlement strategy  
 Requiring demoli tion where replacement dwelling development is proposed  
 Avoiding adverse impacts on neighbours and the surrounding environment  
 Avoiding creating sub -standard housing in terms of private amenity space and 
communal areas, such as storage and car parking . 
8.92.  No specific local evidence is needed to justify this policy, but the plan will need to 
identify what appropriate evidence will need to be provided by developers regarding 
the character and amenities of the surrounding area. Detailed guidance would need 
to be provided in a Supplementary Planning Document, on matters such as layout 
and density, spacing, scale, massing, form detailing and materials as well as 
internal space standards, accessibility, privacy, daylight and ventilation, amenity of 
occupiers, safety and security.  
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
174 46. Policy  – Householder Annexes, Extensions, Alterations and 
Outbuildings  
  
Proposals for ancillary or incidental  annexes, extensions, alterations, and 
outbuildings , relating to existing dwellings shall:  
 provide a written justification det ailing the existing use of the main dwelling and 
the proposed use and requirement for the development; and  
 be of a subordinate scale, form, and mass to the main dwelling and curtilage, 
and shall accord with the design principles of the Local Plan; and  
 be located entirely within the existing curtilage of the main dwelling; and  
 not increase the habitable Gross Internal (floor) Area1 of the original dwelling 
by more than 30%, unless the increase is required to enable the host dwelling 
to conform to nationally  described technical housing standards2 for its original 
intended use. In exceptional circumstances, development may be considered 
where a minor increase above 30% is justified to improve design  standards . 
  
The development of annexes, extensions, alterati ons, and outbuildings, will not 
usually be permitted where the host dwelling is:  
 an affordable dwelling  
 an agricultural worker’s dwelling  
 in use as a dwelling  house permitted only by virtue of The Town and Country 
Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 or any 
subsequent version of that order  
 
A condition and/or legal agreement may be required to control future use as 
incidental or ancillary to the use of the main dwelling, preventing subdivision or use as 
a separate planning unit, i n perpetuity. Permitted development rights for future 
extensions or outbuildings may also be re stricted  by condition.  
    
1. Technical housing standards – nationally described space standard - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)  
2.Technical housing standards - nationally described space standards Technical housing standards – 
nationally described space standard - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)   
 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.93.  The Council receives many planning applications for householder  extensions and 
alterations, and for annexes  and outbuildings .  This type of development enables 
occupiers to meet their changing needs and lifestyles without the need t o move.  
8.94.  This policy contributes to meeting the changing housing needs of households. It 
aligns with the NPPF and PPG on making effective use of land. It is part of the local East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
175 plan’s strategy for supporting the transition to a low carbon future, in line wit h the 
NPPF.  Continuing the use of existing dwellings reduces the embodied carbon 
footprint of the development by avoiding the need for additional new build, as well 
as re -using existing resources, and locating development within existing 
communities.  The  policy also aligns with the approach that all  developments 
should maintain acceptable living standards.  
Annexes  
8.95.  Residential annexes can also provide genuinely flexible, accommodation that can 
be adapted and re -adapted to meet the changing needs of family circumstances 
over time. Creation of an annexe to an existing dwelling, whether the main dwelling 
is located inside or outside settlement boundaries, can often create a useful facility 
for the support and care of family members.  
8.96.  This is a type of residenti al accommodation which might reasonably be construed 
as being self -contained and capable of being occupied without undue call upon the 
principal residence/ host dwelling. An annexe might provide bathroom and kitchen 
facilities and sufficient space for livi ng and sleeping. To avoid creating an additional 
dwelling or separate planning unit the use of the annexe needs to be restricted to 
being an ancillary and subordinate part of the principal residence/host dwelling. The 
annexe size should not undermine its s ubordinate role. Nor be so large that it is 
impractical and is then let separately from the main dwelling, creating sub -standard 
accommodation with inadequate access, amenity and space.  
Residential extensions , alternations , and outbuildings .  
8.97.  This type of development adds to diversity and flexibility in the housing stock but it 
needs to respond positively to the context and character of existing areas. 
Extensions , alterations  and outbuildings  are part of the principal residence/host 
dwelling. Some developme nt create s ancillary accommodation which provides 
habitable rooms but does not extend to such an extent that it can be construed as 
providing facilities that would enable its independent occupation without call upon 
the principal residence/ host dwelling.  
8.98.  There can be concern that extensions in combination would lead to an increase in 
the proportion of larger dwellings, reducing the availability of smaller housing and 
creating an imbalance in the local dwelling stock.  There are additional concerns 
that ext ensions and subsequent subdivision can create additional dwellings in the 
countryside, and not be consistent with policy.  A further complication can arise with 
Class Q permitted development, where the approval is implemented, changing the 
use to residenti al, swiftly followed by a full application to extend the unit creating a 
larger dwelling. This can be very difficult to resist.  
8.99.  Permitted development rights allow house extensions  and outbuildings  without 
needing to apply for planning permission if specifi c limitations and conditions are East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
176 met.  This policy addresses the issues for those extensions , alterations , and 
outbuildings  that exceed the specific limitations and conditions. In many cases an 
application for householder planning permission will be requir ed. Occasionally other 
types of pla nning permission are necessary.  
8.100.  The policy addresses the relevant issues. All the issues listed in the preferred policy 
are raised in the NPPF and related PPG. The policy reflects national planning and 
housing policy, par ticularly regarding the mix of housing to meet needs and housing 
quality. The main matters where the Council relies on a local policy component are:  
 Appropriate locations – consistent with the settlement strategy  
 Avoiding adverse impacts on neighbours and impacts of cumulative 
extensions  
 Avoiding unplanned creation of additional dwellings or separate planning 
units . 
8.101.  No specific local evidence is needed to justify this policy, but the plan will need to 
identify what appropriate evidence will need to be provi ded by developers regarding 
the relationship with the principal residence/host dwelling and matters related to 
over-development and impacts on neighbouring uses. Detailed guidance would 
need to be provided in an SPD. Annexes, e xtensions, alterations and outbuildings  
should not cause unacceptable impacts for the occupants in the main building , 
annexe or outbuilding , or for neighbours from e.g. amenity, light, noise, odour, 
smoke, dust, privacy, visual impacts, overbearing, over -shadowing, scale, form, 
mass, design, material and any other pollutants. It will need to address layout and 
density, spacing, detailing and materials as well as internal space standards, 
accessibility, privacy, daylight and ventilation, safety and security. The physical and 
functional links between an annexe  or outbuilding  and the principal residence/host 
dwelling will also be relevant.  
8.102.  For the avoidance of doubt, proposals for annexes , residential extensions , and 
outbuildings  on Exception sites will be subject to the local plan policy on Exception 
sites.  
 
47. Policy - Hostels and Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO s) 
 
In circumstances where planning permission is required for the conversion or change 
of use of existing homes and buildings in other uses to shared accommodation 
including host els and houses in multiple occupation, permission will be granted on 
sites at locations that are suitable for the use, where it can be demonstrated that 
there will be no significant impact on the following:  
1. Privacy of existing homes and gardens of neighbou rs - must be maintained 
and ensured for new occupiers. The existing home or building must be capable 
of conversion without causing harm to the amenities of future occupants, 
neighbours and the wider area;  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
177 2. Vehicular access or car parking – both in terms of highway safety or visual, 
noise or light impact on neighbours . Provision must be made for on -site car 
parking and cycle storage facilities, unless it can be demonstrated that the site 
is sustainably located with access to regular public transport or is wit hin a n 800 
metre walking distance of a defined town centre ; 
3. Service provision – there should be sufficient space for communal areas at an 
appropriate standard, to accommodate adequate bin storage and collection, 
and accommodate other ancillary functions fo r the increased number of 
residents;  
4. Internal standards for living space and good communal facilities are suitable 
for the intended occupiers, individually and in total  
5. Housing stock – to protect the existing small family housing stock, and to allow 
for adequate residential space standards in the proposed subdivided dwelling. 
The subdivision of existing properties of less than 4 bedrooms will not be 
permitted.  
6. Applicants will be expected to submit evidence to demonstrate that there will 
be no significant i mpact on the criteria outlined above.  
7. Hostels and Houses in Multiple Occupation will need to evidence how a good 
standard of management will be provided.  
8. A financial contribution towards affordable housing will be sought from large 
HMO development of 20  or more  units, subject to negotiation and viability  
9. The Council will resist the loss of existing hostels and HMOs, unless there is 
evidence of a lack of demand for this type of accommodati on within the 
settlement, or  there is viability and building condition  evidence to demonstrate 
that retention and improvement of the accommodation is not viable or 
achievable.  
10. A Supplementary Planning Document will be produced to set out details about 
how this Policy will be implemented . 
 
Justification for inclusion of pol icy 
8.103.  Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) are properties occupied by unrelated 
individuals who share basic amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom. The 
traditional source of HMOs tends to be larger, older single family dwelling houses, 
located in areas with  good access to public transport (in particular bus routes) and 
local services as well as large single dwelling houses that can be sub -divided into 
much smaller and more affordable accommodation.  
8.104.  The NPPF does not define Houses in Multiple Occupation or ho stels. The definition 
of HMO used by the plan is listed in the Glossary.  HMO development is subject to 
the use class order:  
 Larger HMOs housing more than 6 people . These are classified as sui generis  
use and require planning permission.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
178  Class C4 (Small ho uses in multiple occupation) .  Small shared dwelling 
houses occupied by between 3 and 6 unrelated individuals, as their only or 
main residence, who share basis amenities such as a kitchen or bathroom.  
Change of use between C3 (residential use) and C4 use classes is permitted 
development and does not require planning permission (unless an Article 4 
direction applies).  New build C4 or change of use from non -C3 use to C4 (and 
vice versa) requires planning permission.  
8.105.  Hostels are a type of HMO providing no si gnificant element of care. They fall into 
the sui generis use class for the purposes of planning.  
8.106.  The LHNA 2022 ORS study does not provide specific evidence on HMOs in East 
Devon regarding the need for HMOs or the level of stock.   HMOs are part of the 
private rented housing market, so are included within the ORS analysis of private 
rented housing need.    
8.107.  However, the LHNA 2022 provides evidence that from the demographic data for 
East Devon is that single person households aged 15 -24 years are projected to  fall 
to a rounded f igure of zero by 2040 . At the same time, the number of ‘Other’ 
households headed by someone aged 15 -24 years is projected to rise by 220 
households in the same timeframe. Therefore, there is going to be a significant 
decline in headship  rates for single persons aged 15 -24 years in East Devon. At the 
heart of this issue is that the increasing pressures for social housing and rising 
private rents have seen fewer young households living on their own and more living 
in HMO type accommodation . Changes to the benefit system introduced in the past 
10 years have seen these pressures amplified.  
8.108.  Whilst co -housing may be a part solution to this, the LHNA 2022 concludes that this 
type of property is more suited to university areas. T he situation in East Devon is a 
declining headship rate among younger households who are more likely to be 
seeking affordable housing. As a result of the declining headship rate, and 
information drawn from Figure 30, there is no strong evidence suggesting studio 
apartment s are required for younger persons.  
8.109.  Consequently, the Council expects the need for hostels and Houses in Multiple 
Occupation to continue to meet the need for low cost, private rented housing. Many 
people living in this type of housing will only be able to  afford shared accommodation, 
and so  they are important for people on low incomes and those seeking temporary 
accommodation. This policy addresses the development issues related to this type 
of housing.  Loss of HMOs through conversion to self -contained dw ellings will be 
resisted unless the applicant can demonstrate the absence of need for this type of 
accommodation.  
8.110.  The policy does not include a size threshold as this is subject to the Town and 
Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) relatin g to change of use.  
8.111.  As well as planning requirements, some HMOs require an HMO licence. The 
Council determines HMO Licences in order to protect the health, safety and welfare East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
179 of the occupying tenants of such residential premises. The mandatory HMO 
licensin g scheme  covers properties occupied by five or more people making up two 
or more households.  The District Council maintains a register of all HMOs in East 
Devon that are licenced by the Council under the 2004 Housing Act. Licencing 
relies on a different de finition and more details are on the Council’s website.  There 
are currently 38 licensed houses in multiple occupation on the Council’s register, 
permitted to house 318 occupiers. HMOs with less than 5 people are not covered 
by this scheme so are additional . Work is in progress to estimate the number of 
smaller HMOs, and to understand if there are particular HMO stock condition 
issues.  Licencing of HMOs is not part of the planning regime.  
8.112.  Unlike some Districts, for example in towns with a large student popu lation, East 
Devon does not have an Article 4 Direction to withdraw permitted development 
rights for the change of use from dwelling houses (Use Class C3) to small -scale 
HMO (Use Class C4).  At this time there is no evidence that there are particular 
conce ntrations of HMOs or hostels, where the potential scale or concentration 
would warrant the use of this mechanism to avoid or mitigate impacts from further 
development.  
8.113.  The policy addresses the relevant issues. All the issues listed in the preferred policy 
are raised in the NPPF and related PPG. The policy reflects national planning and 
housing policy, particularly regarding the mix of housing to meet needs and housing 
quality.  
8.114.  The Council will keep the policy under review, and any additional evidence about  
the concentration of shared housing and housing stock conditions wi ll be 
considered when available.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
180 48. Strategic Policy – Provision  for Gypsy and Travellers, and 
Travelling Showpeople Sites   
At this stage we are awaiting the findings of the Gypsy and Travell er Needs 
Assessment . A detailed po licy setting out the level of need and criteria  to be 
considered in determining pl anning applications  will be produced in due course.  
 
This proposed policy will need to address the following issues : 
 Making provision for th e plan period for Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling 
Showpeople site accommodation, specifying District targets for: gypsy and 
traveller pitches, disaggregated into permanent and transit; and for plots for 
travelling showpeople.  
 An identified five year sup ply of gypsy and traveller pitches on deliverable 
sites within East Devon to ensure that the predicted need for traveller sites 
will be met. A further supply of developable sites or broad locations for growth 
to be identified equivalent to another ten year s of predicted growth, meeting 
need  
 Identifying the overall scale of site allocation(s) of Gypsy and Travellers and 
Travelling Showpeople sites in the local plan if evidence demonstrates a 
supply shortfall against the need to be met in East Devon  
 
New Site s 
 Where there is demonstrable need to be met in the District, specifying the 
number of gypsy and traveller pitches to be provided, as part of the mixed 
use development at the  New Settlement in East Devon  
 Locations for sites (allocated and/or permissible) , subject to site suitability, 
assessed against relevant policies in the plan and satisfying requirements of 
the following criteria:   
o Suitable location, to be inside or adjoining a settlement boundary, or within 
15 minutes travel time by safe, walking, cy cling or public transport 
providing access to a range of services including school and health 
services  
o Sites proposed in the countryside to require evidence that proven District 
need cannot be met elsewhere in East Devon  
o Size of site and number of pitches  is appropriate in scale and size to the 
nearest settlement in the settlement hierarchy and its range of services 
and infrastructure  
o Preference for site expansion and intensification, subject to maximum site 
threshold. If expansion or intensification is i mpractical, then take account of 
the cumulative impacts of additional sites on the character of a local area 
and on a local community  
o Assimilate sites into surroundings /landscape without significant adverse 
effect  
o Requirement for acceptable vehicular acces s, on site turning, parking and 
servicing  
o Avoid sites vulnerable to flooding or affected by any other environmental 
hazards that may affect the residents’ health and welfare  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
181 o Site to access essential utilities - water supply, sewerage, drainage, waste 
disposal 
 
Safeguarding Sites  
Safeguard existing authorised sites, new permissions,  allocations for Gypsy and 
Traveller Use and for Travelling Showpeople use for the number of pitches/plots 
permitted . This includes safeguarding provision already made for servic ed 
permanent pitches at the Cobdens and Treasbeare Expansions Areas in the 
emerging Cranbrook Plan DPD  
 
Only exceptionally permitting changes of use or redevelopment to uses other than 
for residential use by Gypsy and Travellers or by Travelling Showpeople  on new, 
allocated or authorised sites and requiring alternative provision if proven need 
exists . 
 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.115.  National planning policy14 requires the LPA to assess the accommodation needs of 
Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling S howpeople and to set pitch and plot targets for 
Gypsies and Travellers and for Travelling Showpeople that address the likely 
permanent and transit site accommodation needs of travellers in the District, 
working collaboratively with neighbouring local autho rities.  
Need 
8.116.  Evidence of the needs for Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Show people 
accommodation is provided by a Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment, 
not by the 2020 LHNA.  Previous evidence in the GTAA 201515 established that 
there were existi ng pitches distributed throughout East Devon, mainly concentrated 
in western areas of the District, close to main travel routes, particularly the A30. 
Most of the immediate need arises from overcrowding of, and newly formed families 
(usually children reach ing maturity and having their own children), on existing sites 
who wish to stay close to their extended family.  
8.117.  Work is being commissioned to produce a new GTAA. The four Councils of East 
Devon, Exeter, Mid Devon and Teignbridge are collaborating in produ cing a joint 
evidence document to identify the level of accommodation needs for each District, 
to 2040 and beyond. That evidence will inform the Regulation 19 Publication Plan

182 stage of the East Devon Local Plan.  This evidence will enable the Council to re ach 
conclusions about whether there is unmet need for permanent, serviced pitches, 
transit pitches or stopping places, which the plan can address. Or any related 
strategic matter raising Duty to Cooperate issues.  
Supply    
8.118.  Work is in progress on the supply assessment.  Planning policy requires the LPA, in 
producing a local plan, to identify and update annually a supply of specific 
deliverable sites sufficient to provide 5 years’ worth of sites against locally set 
targets; and identify a supply of specific, d evelopable sites, or broad locations for 
growth for years 6 -10. If an LPA cannot demonstrate an up -to-date 5 year supply of 
deliverable sites then this is a significant material consideration in any subsequent 
planning decision  
8.119.  Existing planning permission s - The plan will require up to date evidence about the 
supply of pitches available from sites with planning permission that h ave not yet 
been implemented.  It is needed both for plan making and for assessing the 5 year 
supply position for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople accommodation.  
The latest evidence is published in “Status of Traveller Sites” March 201916 when 
there were 49 pitches (1 being temporary) on authorised permanent sites, and 5 
pitches on authorised transit sites.   
8.120.  Allocations   - Sites providing pitches for gypsy and traveller and travelling show 
people use can be allocated in the development plan.  The Cranbrook local plan 
provides for 15 pitches on the Cobdens and Treasbeare Expansion Areas in 2 site 
allocations on land being ma de available by the East Devon New Community 
partnership.  These sites would contribute to supply in the 2020 -2040 plan period 
and enable families on the overcrowded Sowton and Broadclyst sites to remain 
living locally as family groups. 15 pitches would fu lfil almost all of the immediate 
District need for 16 pitches identified by the previous 2015 GTAA. Whilst these sites 
are available now and offer a suitable location, they do not yet have planning 
permission. For the present they are regarded as developab le. When there is 
evidence that there is a realistic prospect of delivery in the next 5 years, the Council 
will count them as deliverable for the purposes of the 5 year supply assessment 
required by NPPF.  
8.121.  Call for Sites - The 2021 Call for Sites for HELAA resulted in only 2 sites being put 
forward as available for Gypsy and Traveller use.  When the GTAA evidence is 
available, if there is need for additional sites to be identified, t he Council will assess 
site suitability, availability and achievability, and  consider whether sites should be 
proposed to be allocated  in the local plan .

183 8.122.  Bricks and Mortar housing  - As well as a need for sites providing pitches and plots 
for Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople, the re will be some requirement 
for bricks and mortar housing to meet their needs.  The new GTAA will identify 
need. The Council considers that this will be met by the provision requirement for 
general housing in Strategic Policy 4.  
8.123.  Travelling Showpeople sites supply  -   Prior to 2009 there was one  established 
Travelling Showpeople site in East Devon for a single family which predates the 
planning system.  One site in East Devon close to Exeter and the M5, was granted 
planning permission for 9 plots in 2011 (09/1486/MFUL at Clyst St Mary). This 
acco mmodated  three displaced plots in Teignbridge and a further 6 plots for 
extended family members on other, overcrowded, sites in south west England. At 
the time of the adoption of the East Devon Local Plan 2011 – 2031 the Council 
considered that East Devon  had exceeded the requirement for provision in Devon 
and would not need to identify any further sites during the Plan period.  The new 
GTAA will reconsider the supply of sites and plots for Travelling Showpeople.  
8.124.  The policy addresses the relevant issues. A ll the issues listed in the preferred policy 
are raised in national planning policy. The policy reflects national planning policy. 
The main matters where the Council relies on a local policy component are:  
 Plan period targets for the scale of provision to be made  
 Maintaining a 5 year supply  
 Site allocations  
 Appropriate locations  
 Safeguarding  
8.125.  Additional evidence will be needed to justify local components of the policy  
 GTAA 2022 (being commissioned)  
 Supply assessment, including the 5 year supply position (w ork in progress)  
 Site assessments and selection (if allocations are needed) . 
Dwellings in the countryside  
8.126.  The plan’s spatial strategy directs most housing development to settlements, based 
on the settlement hierarchy.  Sustainable  development should be loc ated where it 
will enhance or maintain the vitality of rural communities and avoid building new, 
isolated, homes in the countryside.  
8.127.  Strategic Policy 9 sets out the strategic approach to developmen t outside of 
settlement boundaries . Two policies set out t he circumstances where limited 
housing development in the countryside would be appropriate.  These policies 
support the strategic policy on development outside settlement boundaries as well 
as the two strategic policies on housing. One policy is about exce ption sites which 
are adjacent to or abutting settlements. The other policy  applies  to development 
adjoining settlements but would also be one of the few circumstances where new East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
184 isolated dwellings in the countryside may be appropriate. It addresses housing  for 
rural workers.  
8.128.  The plan does not propose additional policy regarding the other few circumstances 
where isolated dwellings in the countryside are appropriate. Instead the LPA relies 
on national policy, currently the NPPF paragraph 80.  
 
49. Policy – Rural Exception Sites and First Home s Exception Sites   
 
Rural Exception Sites   
A development proposal  for a Rural Exception site will be supported , provided that:  
1) the site is less than 15 dwellings or 0.5 hectares  
2) It provides a m ix of types of affordable hous ing meeting proven, unmet need of 
the local community, evidenced by  the latest East Devon Local Housing Needs 
Assessment, Housing Needs Surveys produced by Devon Communities 
Together, and other local data such as a Neighbourhood Plan, Parish Survey 
or Pari sh Plan ; and  
3) Occupiers to have a local connection with the settlement or group of 
settlements  
 
First Home s Exception Sites  
A development proposal for a First Homes Exception site will be supported subject to 
the provisi ons for First Homes in Policy 39  (Affordable housing) including local 
eligibility criteria, provided that:  
1) The site is not allocated for housing and is beyond, and either abutting or 
physically closely related to, the settlement boundaries of villages, or physically 
very well related to the built form of villages where there is no settlement 
boundary;  
2) The site is n ot in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and not at settlements 
in Designated Rural Areas  
3) The site size is proportionate to the existing settlement , that is no more than 10 
per cent of the number of households  at the time of the planning application  
4) The affordable housing meets proven, unmet needs of the District,  as 
evidenced by the latest LHNA ; and  
5) There is only a small proportion of other types of affordable housing included 
on the site  
 
For Rural Exception Sites and First Home s Exception Sites  
A development proposal for a First Homes Exception site will be supported , provided 
that; and provided that :  
1) evidence demonstrates secure arrangements will be achieved ensure the 
housin g will remain affordable and available to meet the continuing needs of 
local people  
2) A small element of market housing may be included, to provide sufficient cross -
subsidy to enable the delivery of affordable homes without grant f unding. At 
least 66% of dwellings proposed must be affordable dwellings.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
185 3)  If occupiers meeting the relevant local connection criteria cannot be found 
then a cascade approach is applied  [details of local connection criteria to be 
set out in the Supplementary Planning Document]  
4) The po licy applies to conversion or replacement of dwellings on these sites  
5) Preclude extensions of dwellings on Exception sites where this would result in 
the affordable housing on the site becoming too expensive compared to 
disposable incomes in the area, or wh ere proven need exists for smaller 
affordable dwellings . 
6) The dwellings are retained in perpetuity, subject to national policy provisions.  
 
A Supplementary Planning Document will be produced to set out details about 
how this Policy will be implemented , including clarifying what is meant by close 
proximity, and abutting or physically close to a settlement boundary . 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.129.  Exception sites are sites brought forward outside of development plans, beyond 
settlements, in order to d eliver affordable housing.  Exception sites deliver housing 
as an ‘exception’ to other policies in the development plan which otherwise restrict 
development.  Following the change in Government policy which came into effect in 
June 2021, there are now two t ypes of exception sites:  ‘Rural Exception ’ sites and 
‘First Homes’ Exception sites.  
8.130.  The policy is essential in this rural area, where affordability is such an issue. It 
enables the local plan to support the Council Plan’s aim to deliver more affordable 
housing and aligns with the East Devon Housing Strategy, offering new 
opportunities for the emerging models for affordable housing delivery. As the local 
plan’s response to NPPF  2021 and the Written Ministerial Statement (WMS) of 24 
May 2021 , the policy supp orts opportunities to bring forward exception sites 
providing affordable housing to help meet identified needs. It complements  the 
policy  on affordable housing for on affordable housing needs in East Devon.  
8.131.  Government policy towards Rural Exception sites d iffers from that towards First 
Homes Exception Sites, and the local plan policy reflects this.  They vary in  the 
following matters:   
 The type of affordable housing. First Homes Exception sites focus on First 
Homes which the Government defines as affordable  housing, and only a small 
proportion of other affordable housing may be included. Rural Exceptions 
aren’t limited although they should include 25% First Homes . 
 The level of discount for discounted market housing. First Homes are 30% 
discount, and a maximu m £250,000 first sale price. The  discount could be 
40% or 50% if this is set out in the local plan policy, and can be justified 
(including viability evidence) .  Informed by t he LHNA 2022, the Council 
proposes that this policy uses a 30% discount for First Homes in East Devon 
and justifies this in the explanation set out in the 2022 Housing Topic Paper . East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
186  Location.  First Homes exception sites could only be adjacent to Exmouth, 
Sidmouth, Honiton and Seaton ( i.e. outside the. Designated Rural Area), not in 
the AONB.  Rural Exceptions sites are not precluded from the AONB or DRA .  
 Site size - Rural Exception sites are ‘small’ (the previous local plan has a 15 
dwellings threshold) but First Homes Exception sites are ‘proportionate to the 
settlement size’ . 
 Occupier  restriction/Eligibility. There is a local connection test for Rural 
Exception sites. The Council has previously applied a cascade approach with 
no time limit. A local connection test can be applied to First Homes Exception 
sites but only for 3 months, bef ore reverting back to national policy which 
doesn’t have a local connection requirement . 
 Perpetuity. Use of S106 agreements to retain affordable housing in perpetuity 
is similar for both sites but mechanisms are available to vary or remove 
restrictions. Di fferences are due to the mix of affordable housing. First homes 
are an affordable home ownership product. On Rural Exception sites the 
issues of staircasing for example can impact on Shared Ownership if no grant 
funding occurred.  
8.132.  National policy allows a s mall amount of market housing on both types of sites. This 
acts as a cross -subsidy, enabling affordable housing delivery without the need for 
grant funding. The proportion of market homes allowed on the site is at the LPA’s 
discretion, and can be specified  in the plan policy. The Council has previously 
applied a minimum 66% affordable housing requirement to Rural Exception Sites 
and that level of cross -subsidy has been sufficient to meet policy requirement.  The 
proportion of market housing to apply to Firs t Homes Exception Sites will need to 
be justified, mindful that there could be other affordable housing types on the site. 
The Council has previously taken the view that unlike the policy on A ffordable 
Housing, exceptions sites are, by definition, an excep tion to the standard housing 
delivery, so the option to make a viability argument in this case does not apply.  
8.133.  The policy addresses the relevant issues. All the issues listed in the preferred policy 
are raised in NPPF and related PPG. The policy reflects n ational planning and 
housing policy, particularly regarding the mix of housing to meet needs and housing 
quality.  
8.134.  This policy provides detail by : 
 Defining what is meant by ‘small site’ (a maximum 15 dwellings site threshold) 
and what is meant by ‘proport ionate’   
 Setting a minimum percentage of affordable housing on the site   
 Tying the issue of site location to details in an SPD which will make clear what 
is meant by ‘abutting or physically closely related to’, the settlement 
boundaries of villages, or ‘ph ysically very well related’ to the built form of 
villages where there is no settlement boundary in East Devon.   
 Addressing the issue of retaining affordable dwellings in perpetuity but leaving 
details of how this is achieved to be set out in the SPD.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
187 8.135.  The E ast Devon Local Housing Need Assessment 2022 provides evidence about 
the scale of need for affordable housing and  the scale of need  for First Homes. The 
LHNA 2022 does not provide evidence about affordable housing supply .  The 
Council has evidence on affor dable housing supply. The Council has relied on this 
evidence  as well as the LHNA 2022  to justify the Affordable Housing Policy in this 
plan.  More inform ation about how the Council has used the evidence to justify 
policies about affordable housing is set o ut the 2022 Housing Need, Supply and 
Requirement Interim Topic Paper.   It should be noted that the  Council does not 
forecast plan period supply that might be achieved from either Rural Exception or 
First Homes Exception sites. For housing supply purpose s these would count in the 
housing supply either as Neighbourhood Plan allocations, if allocated in made 
plans, or otherwise as windfalls  when granted planning approval. . 
8.136.  Additional evidence will be needed to justify local components of the policy, notably 
what is meant by ‘small’ and ‘ proportionate . The Council can consider whether 
there should be local criteria relating to First Homes. This would need evidence to 
justify any higher discounts, higher percentage of First Homes and any local 
connection criteria . 
8.137.  The May 2021 Written Ministerial Statement allows LPAs to introduce local 
requirements relating to First Homes through a policy statement in advance of the 
local plan.  The Council produced an Interim Guidance Note in February 2022 on 
First Homes in East  Devon ahead of this local plan. When adopte d, this policy and 
the related Supplementary Planning D ocument will supersede that guidance.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
188 50. Policy – Housing for rural workers  
 
1. Applications for rural workers dwellings outside settlement boundaries will be 
permitted where:  
a. It can be demonstrated that the nature and demands of an existing rural 
business are such that a full time worker has an essential need to be 
permanently resident at or near their place of work so they are available at 
most times;  
b. The need c annot be met within a nearby settlement, or by existing housing 
at or near the site or through the conversion of a suitable redundant or 
disused rural building at the site;  
c. The size and scale of rural workers dwellings will be commensura te with 
the scale of the operati on and designed to reflect the location and setting of 
the proposed site;  
d. The development will minimise the visual and environmental impact by 
locating the dwelling close to existing buildings /dwellings, where practical 
for its purpose;  
e. The dwelling size is a maximum of 150 sq.m  (gross internal area). 
Exceptionally a larger dwelling may be considered where evidence 
demonstrates that this is commensurate with the scale of the established  
functional need; and  
f. The rural enterprise has been esta blished for at least three years, is 
currently financially sound based on functional and economic tests, and the 
business has clear prospects of remaining viable.  
2. The Council will take into account the history of the holding, the recent pattern 
of land use  and building and, recent disposals of land and property  when 
determining  a planning applicatio n for housing for rural workers.  
3. Where an agricultural, horticultural, forestry or other rural business is not yet 
established or the need is unproven, then a te mporary dwelling such as a 
mobile home or caravan, may be permitted for a time limited period of up to 
three years, until the economic viability of the enterprise is established, subject 
to: 
a. Meeting the criteria of 1b) to 1e) above;  
b. A firm intention and ab ility to develop the enterprise; and  
c. The business has realistic prospects of meeting functional and economic 
tests.  
4. Permission for a rural worker dwelling will be subject to an occupancy condition 
to ensure that it cannot be sold on or sublet for general a ccommodation 
unrelated to the enterprise. Removal of such a condition will only be permitted 
where there is clear evidence that there  is no need for the condition  to remain 
in place.  
5. Any permission granted will be tied through legal agreement to the busine ss 
holding.  
6. Extensions to or replacement of agricultural or forestry or rural business -related 
dwellings will require a reassessment of need, excluding minor works.  
7. Exceptionally, t emporary or seasonal accommodation requirements to serve 
rural enterprises  will be considered on a case -by-case basis.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
189 A Supplementary Planning Document will be produced to set out details about 
how this Policy will be implemented.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
8.138.  Housing need includes the need for new dwellings for rura l workers. For the 
purposes of this policy, a  rural worker is a person whose place of work is located in, 
and related to, the countryside  and is a person employed in agriculture, forestry or a 
similar, land -based  rural enterprise . Employment on an assembly  or food packing 
line, or the need to accommodate seasonal workers  for example , will generally not 
be sufficient to justify building isolated rural dwellings.  
8.139.  To promote sustainable patterns of development rural workers will usually be 
expected to find hou sing in existing rural towns and villages. However, an exception 
can be justified where it can be demonstrated that a rural worker has an essential 
need to be available at most times as part of the operation of a rural business in 
accord ance  with national policy  and PPG regarding the need for isolated homes in 
the countryside for essential rural workers.  
8.140.  This policy supports enterprises in the rural economy whilst limiting sporadic 
development in the countryside . From time to time, there may be special 
circumstances that justify this taking place; for example, it may be essenti al for a 
rural worker to live pe rmanently at or very near their place of work. Whether this is 
essential depends on the needs of the enterprise and not on the personal 
preferences or circumstances of any of the individuals concerned.  Need can 
include those taking majority control of a farm business. The preferred policy does 
not set out detailed policy on ‘succession’ need, and the Council considers this is 
more appropriate to the det ailed guidance on policy implementation that an SPD 
can provide.  
8.141.  When considering such proposals, the history of the holding, the recent pattern of 
land use and building and, recent disposals of land and property, will be taken into 
account. The recent sa le of land and property could constitute evidence of lack of 
need. Any existing or permitted dwelling serving or closely associated with the 
holding has been sold or changed from residential use, or separated from the 
holding or agricultural buildings conv erted to unrestricted residential development 
(including Use Class Q) within the previous three years will count against the need 
assessment . 
8.142.  The policy proposes a maximum size of dwelling , at 150 sq.m  of Gross Internal 
Area floorspace, which has been  informed by planning precedent in East Devon, 
including appeal decisions . Internal living space including internal 
areas/circulation/ stairs and storage, plus garage (internal or detached)  are counted 
in that area.  This threshold recognises that housing for an agricultural worker may 
include additional space requirements, such as a boot room, utility and ground floor 
shower room; and only in respect of the principal dwelling on a holding further East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
190 space may be required to accommodate an office.  Only exceptionally  might  the 
Council consider a dwelling above the threshold  size, and evidence will be required 
to demonstrate why the additional floorspace is essential for the proper functioning 
of the enterprise.  For the avoidance of doubt, any uplift from the floorspac e 
standard would not be supported, if proposed simply to provide additional living 
accommodation.  
8.143.  Robust evidence will need to be provided by applicants regarding functional and 
economic tests, and occupancy/eligibility criteria.  This will require a busin ess plan 
to set out projected future operations, rural business financial assessment, and 
demonstrate future operational viability.  The detailed tests  and criteria  will be set 
out in an SPD ]. 
8.144.  The approach of permitting a temporary dwelling on the holding f or a limited time 
allows time for evidence to be gathered to demonstrate the viability of a new 
enterprise. Renewal of the temporary dwelling is only considered where it would 
provide continued occupation whilst a permanent dwelling is constructed on the 
holding.  
8.145.  Exceptionally, t emporary or seasonal accommodation proposals may be 
considered. They would need evidence to demonstrate a proven business case for 
accommodation; that there is no appropriate accommodation available in nearby 
settlements; and the mi tigation of impacts . 
8.146.  The policy addresses the relevant issues , including those  raised in NPPF and 
related PPG. The policy reflects national planning and housing policy, particularly 
regarding the need to avoid sporadic development in the countryside.  
Other  housing matters  
8.147.  There are three topic areas where the draft plan does not propose a preferred 
policy and there are no alternative options for additional policy:  
 
Residential Moorings, Marinas and Houseboats  
8.148.  There is no proposed local plan policy on this matter as this type of development is 
rare in East Devon, and therefore policy is unnecessary.  
 
Empty Homes.  
8.149.  Bringing long term empty homes back into residential use is a priority for the 
Council, but provided the empty home was last used for residential purposes (with 
planning permission, or lawful use) then further planning approval for it to be used 
for housing should be unnecessary. Planning approval may still be needed for other 
reasons. Other policies would guide redevelopment, conversions, extension s and 
alterations or changes to other uses, enabling buildings to be brought back into 
beneficial use.  Design and heritage policies may also be relevant.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
191 Principal Residence Requirement.  
8.150.  Parts of the District but not all face high rates of second homeown ership, notably in 
some coastal areas. The Council Plan identifies the need for a study about second 
homes in East Devon. Concerns include the extent of second home ownership 
adversely impacting on the affordability of housing for local residents in East D evon. 
The perceived adverse impact of properties left empty for much of the year, 
reducing the vitality of local communities, with seasonal impacts on the local 
economy is another issue. Current information suggests that this issue is limited to 
a small nu mber of coastal settlements  and that the scale  of the issue  is not such 
that it warrants a local plan policy. The Council will keep this matter under review 
throu gh the plan making process, so that the Plan can be informed by relevant 
evidence, when availa ble.

 Chapter 9.  Supporting jobs and the economy 
and vibrant town centres  
 
9.1. Earlier in the plan we set out the preferred Economic Vision and Economic Strategy and 
the Strategic Policy  on employment land, address es the strategic employment priorities 
of the area and  any relevant cross -boundary issues. They cover the scale and 
distribution strategy for future employment development in the plan period, and 
employment site allocations.  
 
FIGURE 10.   A crowded and vibrant Sidmouth town centre.  
9.2. This chapter includes the Strategic P olicy on the town centre hierarchy and retail 
provision. Those policies are supported by a suite of non -strategic policies which 
provide a clear basis for development management and the determination of 
employment and other economy related development prop osals.  
9.3. For this Chapter, unless otherwise stated, ‘employment use’ refers to any use where 
employment is required for that use to effectively function. This includes the following 
Use Classes: B2, B8, E, C1, F1, F2, and Sui Generis.  
Employment development within settlement boundaries  
9.4. The local plan promotes larger scale development on the western side of the District but 
elsewhere most new development will occur within settlement boundaries and as such 
will be focussed in and at the existing main centres of  population.  We have included 
plan policy that specifically addresses development with in boundaries and which seeks 
to be supportive of employment growth.  
 
51. Policy – Employment development within settlement 
boundaries   
 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
193 Within defined settlement boundari es, as shown on the Policies Map,  development for 
employment uses will be permitted  where proposals are compatible with neighbouring 
developments and land uses and will not give rise to adverse amenity impacts or not 
undermine plan strategy or  specific pol icies directly relevant  to the use of the land in 
question.  
On existing employment and business parks , and on employment allocated land , 
uses other the E(g), B2 and B8 (offices, research and development, industrial 
processes and storage and distribution) will not be permitted unless they can be 
shown to be subordinate to, directly compatible with and complementary to the overall 
business use and will enhance job provision and the effective operation and business 
appeal of the park or site.  
 
 
Justification  for inclusion of policy  
9.5. The Council Plan’s third priority is for a resilient economy. The Council promotes and 
supports job growth in the District. There are employment opportunities in the traditional 
employment land use categories of business use, gener al industrial use and 
storage/distribution use and “Sui Generis” industrial uses. Tourism, retailing, health 
care, education and leisure facilities are significant employment generators.  Although 
jobs in these sectors are typically lower paid, they are no netheless important to the 
functioning of the district’s economy and the well -being of local communities. Our 
preference moving forward is to support the creation of new higher value jobs.  
9.6. East Devon benefits from significant employment opportunities in th e western side of 
the district, more strongly associated with a wider sub -regional functioning economic 
market area (FEMA). This includes the Science Park and at Exeter Airport and related 
sites. But East Devon is also a rural and coastal district. There a re around 60   
traditional business parks and industrial estates across the district, with most being 
located within and adjacent to the towns. Some employment growth has taken place 
away from traditional business parks and industrial estates, and will con tinue to do so, 
for example through the diversification of the rural economy, the growth of leisure and 
tourism and the increase in home/remote working.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022

FIGURE 11.  Light Industrial Units  offer opportunities for growth.  
9.7. The local plan will provide for new employmen t provision to meet the future needs of the 
District. In the western side of the District, we will respond to increased demand for 
higher density, high value jobs, encouraging strategic inward investment and 
transformational sector development. We will als o aim to meet the strong unmet 
demand for industrial premises, particularly for industrial and logistics occupiers in the 
West End of East Devon . Elsewhere in the District, higher value investment 
opportunities will also be promoted, though it is more like ly that new employment will 
serve local needs with jobs being provided close to existing and proposed homes so 
that people have the option of not needing to commute long distances to work.  
9.8. The policy focuses on planning for sufficient employment sites for industry, offices and 
warehousing across the District, with appropriate flexibility through a range of available 
land and premises that can accommodate the changing needs for business start -ups, 
local employer expansions, relocations and inward investment .  New supply for the plan 
period would be achieved from employment development on local plan site allocations, 
existing commitments not yet delivered and windfall development.  
9.9. The preferred policy option is to focus employment development within settlement  
boundaries. The aim is to continue to meet a high proportion of the level of need for 
employment land (in Use Classes E(g), B2, B8 ) with sufficient supply flexibility, at 
locations that support settlement self -containment, consistent with the settlement 
hierarchy and the network of centres.  These are the places with supporting services 
and facilities.  The EDNA  and Employment Land Review will provide evidence about the 
mix of sites needed to support businesses. It is expected that as well as sites suitab le 
for transformation and high value employment, there will continue to be a need for a 
wide mix of sites in terms of size and quality to suit the needs businesses now and as 
they change over time.  There will still be a need for traditional industrial est ates and 
business parks.  There is a separate local plan policy on the retention of these sites and 
existing business parks and industrial estates over the plan period.  
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
195 9.10.  New sites  - The ability for new sites to meet need is subject to the Council’s evidence 
(work in progress) to demonstrate that there is a need for specific employment uses and 
providing this will allow for sustainable growth in suitable locations. The EDNA will 
identify the scale of need for employment land in East Devon over the plan period.  The 
HELAA will provide further analysis about availability, suitability and achievability of 
sites put forward for development through the Call for Sites.  Employment Land 
Reviews will provide further evidence about sites’ availability and suitability for  
employment uses. The Council’s site selection process identifies potential sites for 
allocations a s employment or mixed use sites.  
9.11.  Policy on employment development at Cranbrook is set out in the Cranbrook DPD, now 
at an advance d stage of plan -making.  
9.12.  Office development  is subject to a sequential test, but is primarily directed to the town 
centres identified on the policies map.  
9.13.  Warehousing  - The plan will make provision for warehousing, informed by the 
emerging evidence on employment development need. Warehousing for storage and 
distribution is a part of the local and regional economy. Efficient distribution 
infrastructure is essential, supporting the supply chains of modern manufacturing and 
retailing through ‘just in time’ systems. This depends on transp orting goods and 
materials, much of it by road in HGVs and can lead to significant traffic movements in a 
locality.  Good access to the strategic road network is critical for distribution nationally 
and internationally. Warehousing is a relatively low dens ity use of land, in terms of the 
number of jobs available for local people, and generally not high wages. Warehouses 
can be substantial buildings on large plots, with considerable visual impact, particularly 
if concentrated along roadside locations.  The plan directs  warehousing to the 
allocations and existing employment sites suitable for warehousing to tier 1 and 2 
settlements and the new settlement. The plan takes a restrictive approach towards large 
windfall proposals, and does not support their develop ment elsewhere in the District, 
particularly in the countryside or if it would reduce the land available for high value and 
transformational employment development.  
9.14.  Previously Developed Land  - The plan supports the reuse of previously developed 
land, and o pportunities for regeneration within the settlement boundaries.  However, at 
this time the scale, type and areas for potential regeneration is unlikely to be 
substantial. The plan therefore does not propose significant areas of ‘opportunity zones’ 
for mixe d use regeneration, with the flexibility to respond to the challenges of attracting 
businesses to such areas.  Where regeneration opportunities arise, they will need 
master -planning to help integrate new development with the adjoining area, and provide 
a quality environment, respecting historic assets.  
9.15.  It may be necessary to consider new build development where no suitable buildings 
exist or reuse or extension is impractical or unviable.  
9.16.  Changes of use - Some changes between uses can already occur on emplo yment 
sites, for example if the planning approval includes a range of employment uses, 
subject to conditions and legal agreements.  Furthermore, permitted development rights 
provide flexibility. For example they allow a unit of up to 500 square metres floo rspace 
in ‘General Industrial’ use (Use Class B2) to be changed to a ‘Storage and Distribution’ East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
196 use (Use Class B8).   The Council is also mindful of recent changes to the Use Class 
Order permitting changes between specific categories of use, allowing sites to be used 
more flexibly. If a building or other land is being used in a way that previously was in 
Class A1 (shops), A2 (financial and professional services), A3 (restaurants and cafés) 
or B1 (business) then it is treated as though it is being used for a purpose specified in 
the new Class E. Change of use to another use within Class E will be allowed without 
the need for planning permission.  This does not impact on Class B2 and B8, but could 
lead to loss of business uses, weakening the mix of employment o pportunities.  This is 
exac erbated by the introduction of  new Use C lass MA which removes the need for 
planning perm ission for changes of use of  Class E “commercial, business and service 
uses” which meet certain criteria to “dwelling houses” (superseding  the former Class O), 
subject to legislation details.  
9.17.  Mixed use within existing employment sites , focuses on Use Classes E(g), B2, B8, 
but the  plan recognises  that a small amount of other employment uses may be 
appropriate. It will need to indicate the types that are acceptable, and justify any limit on 
their development. The changes to the Use Class order brings additional flexibility but 
could potentially result in a broadening of employment mix, reducing the availability of 
land and premises for Use Classes  E(g), B2, B8.  This emphasises the need to ensure 
that the plan ensures sufficient supply flexibility to provide a range of sites and choice 
for bu sinesses as their needs evolve.  
9.18.  On larger development allocations there are opportunities for mixed use, so that 
employment development to accommodate businesses and new jobs will be required to 
be provided alongside new housing. The employment will therefore be Use Class E(g) 
suitable for location in or adjoining residential areas.  Retaining Class E(g) on the site is 
potentially undermined by permitted development rights.  If there is evidence on loss of 
business uses to resident the Council could consider an Article 4 direction applying to 
one or more specific sites, to control development by requiring a plann ing application .  
9.19.  Other locations generating  employment .  It is recognised that in this rural district, 
modest employment growth will also take place away from traditional business parks 
and industrial estates – for example through the diversification of t he rural economy, 
and the growth of leisure and tourism and increase in home work.  This preferred 
approach does not support widespread dispersal of large scale employment generating 
uses in the countryside.  
Employment development in the countryside  
9.20.  Whilst  existing settlements, and the western side of East Devon, will remain the focus 
for future for future employment development there are cases where business located in 
countryside areas that need to expand.  Policy provides for such expansion and for 
quali fied starts -ups of new businesses.  
 
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
197 52. Policy – Employment development in the countryside   
 
Intensification of existing employment businesses in the countryside  
 
Building on land within the existing operational site boundaries of a business for 
Intensificat ion of that business  and its works and  outputs   will be allowed in the 
countryside  where the business : 
o Is operating in premises that are  at or close to full occupancy , OR 
o The business h as a need arising from new or expanding operational 
functions . 
But only  if  
It  can be demonstrate d that there are no suitable alternative site s that the 
business can use that are  available in a nearby settlement with a 
development boundary , or that are allocated for employment use  or that are 
otherwise clearly suited for em ployment use.  
to be acceptable under plan policy the:  
o  Expansion will need to be proportionate to the existing size and scale of site 
operations  and 
o  The proposal will need to prioritise reuse or adaptation of existing buildings to 
reduce the need fo r addi tional buil t development . 
Noting these two considerations:  
o  Extending existing buildings  or new buildings will only be acceptable if 
evidence demonstrates that re -use or adaptation of current buildings is not 
viable or practical  
 
for this policy developmen t includes  any of the following  : 
o Development of new buildings for any use ; 
o Spatial intensification through development of extensions to existing buildings 
increasing the footprint, or vertical expansion from raising the height of the 
building, or adding f loorspace in additional storeys or in mezzanines ;   
o Development that leads to longer hours or more 24 hours of operation ; 
o Development increasing HGV and other vehicular movements on local roads ; 
o Development through higher density such as replacement buildi ngs 
extending on to current outdoor storage areas . 
 
 For avoidance of doubt this policy applies to specific companies or businesses and 
their operational premises and is not applicable to business parks, industrial estates 
or similar where the business in question is the operation of that park or site.  
 
Re-use of existing rural buildings  
Proposals for small scale employment development through re -use and adaptation 
of existing rural buildings not currently used or last used for employment, will be 
permitted  where the buildings are  
o readily accessible to the Tier 1 and 2 settlements via a range of modes of 
transport ; 
o of sound and permanent construction,  
o capable of adaptation or re -use without major re -building, alteration, or 
extension ; and  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
198 o where compatible with overall plan strategy and other local plan policy 
considerations.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
9.21.  Employment needs to be available in the countryside to support rural communities, 
focused on existing sites, and small scale development. Plan p olicy defines the 
countryside as the areas outside of the settlement boundaries, as defined on the 
Policies Map. This policy balances protection for the character and qualities of the 
countryside with promoting appropriate scale employment.  There is separ ate policy on 
farm diversification  and rural shops . 
9.22.  It is important for East Devon to develop its employment base and where established 
sites are successful, an intensification of employment uses or extension of an existing 
employment site can be considere d if this supports additional employment accessible to 
local communities. This enables development to make use of existing sites and 
infrastructure.  ).  
9.23.  Where sites are extended  there is the need  to ensure that development is sensitive to 
its surroundings , is of an appropriate type and scale and will not result in harm to local 
amenity.  Where there is evidence of particularly high demand for employment 
development, we expect that any adverse aesthetic impacts stemming from that 
proposed development will be  considered relative to the expected economic, social and 
environmental benefits stemming from that proposed development. Additional 
consideration will be given to existing East Devon employers, where the proposed 
development will safeguard valuable existi ng jobs.  
9.24.  Hill Barton and Greendale Business Parks are large, free -standing, historic employment 
areas within the countryside, not attached to or directly supporting the self -containment 
of any particular settlement.  Accessing their locations for employmen t is primarily by 
motorised vehicles, with limited opportunity for more s ustainable modes of transport. 
Development leading to i ntensification of use or site extension is not supported as it 
could compound and exacerbate the adverse environmental and socia l impacts.  This 
approach will however need to be kept under review specifically in the context of policy 
for the new community  
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
199 53. Policy – Farm Diversification  
 
Farm diversification will be supported through the introduction of new E(g), B2 and B8 
emplo yment uses onto established farm holdings. Where such uses would not be 
viable or would lead to adverse impacts then other uses, such as tourism, leisure, 
recreation, other employment uses may then be appropriate subject to this 
constituting sustainable de velopment and ensuring the development supports the 
long term financial sustainability of the farm holding.   
Criteria on what should be considered in the viability statement will be published and 
available online via the Council’s website.   
  
Proposals fo r farm diversification will be permitted providing they meet the following 
criteria:   
 the proposal is compatible with, and an ancillary and subordinate component 
of, an existing and active farm enterprise and contributes to the continuing 
viability of the  farm as a whole, retaining existing or providing new employment 
opportunities and services for the local community;   
 the scale, siting and appearance of buildings and activities associated with the 
proposed development is appropriate to the rural charact er of the area and will 
not adversely impact local amenity  
 development, in terms of its scale, nature, location and layout, does not detract 
from or prejudice the existing agricultural undertaking or its future operation;  
 any existing suitable buildings are re -used or adapted and, where appropriate, 
redundant buildings which are derelict or offer no opportunity for beneficial use 
are removed;  
 any new building (and parking and other structures/storage) is modest in scale, 
sited in or adjacent to an existi ng group of buildings, compatible design and 
blends into the landscape (design, siting and materials), enclosed with an 
appropriate boundary feature, taking into account the special characteristics of 
the farmstead and local area;  
 no unacceptable adverse impacts arising from vehicle movements and where it 
is likely to create significant vehicular movements to and from the site it should 
be well located in relation to sustainable tier 1 -4 settlements  
 foul drainage facilities are adequate;   
 no adverse impa cts arising from increased noise, smells, or other form of 
pollution. It may be necessary, for example, to limit the scale of on -farm 
anaerobic digesters;   
 no adverse impact on the character of surrounding natural or historic 
environment;  
 no adverse impa ct on protected species and opportunities to improve 
biodiversity are maximised    
  
Any adverse impacts stemming from employment development will be considered 
against any positive economic, environmental and social impacts gained from that 
development.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
200  
Justification for inclusion of policy  
9.25.  Agriculture underpins the District's rural economy and supports a considerable number 
of ancillary businesses. The agricultural industry and the rural economy in general have 
undergone considerable changes in recent y ears, remaining a  very important sector for 
the East Devon  economy . Agriculture not only provides direct jobs but also underpins 
many other economic activities in rural areas. Agriculture remains the major user of 
rural land in East Devon and the use that most influences the physical appearance and 
character of the countryside.  
 
FIGURE 12.  Agriculture  remains central to the character of East Devon.  
9.26.  The Council recognises the importance and changing role of agriculture and the need 
for new employment in rural areas.  Changes in agriculture have made diversification 
increasingly important for the ec onomic viability of farm holdings . 
9.27.  NPPF doesn’t define agricultural diversification.  However, as well as alternative 
agricultural products, increasingly it involves diversifi cation out of agriculture, into non -
agricultural business within  the holding.  This adds business activities to traditional 
farming to develop new sources of income.  
9.28.  The main driver  for diversification  is to support farm income.  Diversification offers  
additional income streams and add s variety to current business models. As well as 
making better use of a farm’s physical resources and characteristics; by branching out 
successfully, farmers can secure the long -term health and prosperity of their farm and 
their income. This adds stability to a business in times of uncertainty and can also 
optimise assets and unlock entrepreneurial skills.   Many farmers are having to find new 
and imaginative ways of diversifying their business in order to survive. More 
entrepre neurial strategies are helping farms face pressures when confronting a decline 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
201 in core income or changes in the policy landscape .  The change in farming, moving 
away from subsidies, and towards grants could stimulate the drive to add value to the 
farms’ ag ricultural and forestry products, and tackling climate change.  There is 
considerable potential synergy between a greener economy and farm diversification.  
9.29.  The preferred policy option focuses on development where the scale and type is 
appropriate to the ex isting business and the rural character of the area. The priority is 
for making use of available and suitable buildings on a holding. New buildings, where 
justified and acceptable, should be well integrated with the existing holding to help them 
harmonise with the surrounding environment.  
9.30.  The continued viability of farm holdings is important to the rural economy. Diversification 
proposals should therefore contribute effectively to the  farm business and more 
generally to the rural economy while integrating n ew activities into the environment and 
the rural scene.  Development proposal s need to avoid conflict with and be well 
integrated into existing farming operations  of the farm or estate.  
9.31.  Diversification proposals should be seen within the context of the fut ure business plan 
for the holding as a whole.   Where proposals affect a significant part of the farm 
holding, information may be requested on its extent, and what is proposed for the 
remainder of the holding. This may include evidence that, after developm ent, the 
holding will continue to operate viably.  
9.32.  There is a need to carefully consider the appropriateness of new uses, their impact 
upon the surrounding area, the implications of public access, and their relationship to 
continuing agricultural operations .  The range of diversification proposals is varied. 
Initiatives aimed at ‘adding value’ to food and goods produced on farms through 
processing and packaging initiatives are encouraged. It can also include tourism 
accommodation and attractions, events and festivals, distilleries and breweries, farm 
shops/cafes and specialist outlets, education and training/ experiences.  New crops and 
renewable energy development are other avenues for income streams. Like many other 
businesses, these new types of diversific ation have been reshaping their offer to keep 
the business afloat during the pandemic. We expect other innovative activities and 
income streams to be conceived and trialled throughout the plan period.  These 
contemporary approaches to diversification are co nsistent with Government planning 
policy and other policies towards farming and the countryside.  
9.33.  Exceptionally, residential conversion of a building may be part of a farm diversification 
project.  The Council is mindful of the flexibility already provided  through Permitted 
Development Use Class Q for the conversion of agricultural buildings to residential use.  
 
54. Policy – Resisting the loss of Employment sites  
 
Loss of employment sites to other uses will not usually be permitted. Employment 
sites are consid ered to be those currently in employment use , last used for 
employment  and those which are  allocated , permitted or conditioned for employment 
development . 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
202 Exceptionally, those sites in B2 and B8 uses will only be permitted for other types of 
employment us e, if it can be demonstrated that:  
 Development relates to ancillary services which will support an employment 
area by making it more sustainable, viable and/or attractive; or  
 Development results in mixed use urban regeneration designed to maintain or 
increase net job opportunities through alternative employment uses, guided by 
master -planning; or  
 The site is no longer viable for the current type of employment use but is viable 
for an alternative type of employment use, evidenced by a viability statement; 
or 
 There is a lack of demand for the current type of employment use at the site, 
evidenced by a marketing statement showing that the site has been 
appropriately marketed; and that a suitable supply of available (actively 
marketed) comparable employment site s/land can be demonstrated within the 
local area, evidenced by a supply statement; and  
 The alternative use is in accordance with or does not undermine the plan’s 
overall Spatial Strategy.  
 
Exceptionally, the use of employment sites for non -employment uses will be permitted 
if it can be demonstrated that:  
 The site is no longer viable for any employment use but is viable for an 
alternative use, evidenced by a viability statement; or  
 There is a lack of demand for any employment use at the site, evidenced by a  
marketing statement showing that the site has been appropriately marketed; 
and that a suitable supply of available (actively marketed) comparable 
employment sites can be demonstrated within the local area, evidenced by a 
supply statement; and  
 The alternat ive use is in accordance with or does not undermine the plan’s 
overall Spatial Strategy.  
 
Criteria on what will be considered an adequate viability, marketing and supply 
statement will be published and available online via the Council’s website.  
 
If an alt ernative use is acceptable, then applicants will be required to demonstrate 
that they have endeavoured to incorporate an appropriate (in terms of scale and type) 
element of employment floor space as part of the new development  
 
Justification for inclusio n of policy  
9.34.  Land is a finite resource and land suitable for employment is a relatively scarce 
commodity.  Competition for land from higher value uses can make delivering 
employment development very challenging, whether new build or for redevelopment.  
The plan therefore includes a policy aimed at retaining existing or proposed 
employment sites and land provided that they are available, suitable and achievable East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
203 over the plan period.  The EDNA and supporting analysis of employment sites will 
provide vital info rmation in justifying the identification of existing and proposed 
employment sites in East Devon.   
9.35.  This policy focuses on protecting employment land in order to maintain sufficient supply 
of employment land, providing a range and choice of sites over the plan period.  
9.36.  Existing employment sites and proposed employment allocations in East Devon are 
nearly all in places where housing accommodates or is planned to accommodate much 
of the labour supply, and where future housing on new local plan allocations will  be 
concentrated. This enables settlements to be more self -contained and better able to 
support local communities, as well as reducing the need to travel.  
9.37.  The EDNA will provide the evidence about the amount  of need for employment land. 
Given the low level of brownfield sites available in East Devon, then the need for 
additional employment land is likely to be on greenfield sites. To avoid the risk of 
needing to identify even more sites to mitigate loss of employment land to other uses, it 
is essential that existing Employment Areas within the existing settlements are 
protected to maintain the quantity and enhance the quality of the employment capacity 
they provide.  The plan will need to identify the Employment areas to be protected. They 
could be identified  on the Policies Map and listed as an Appendix in the plan.  
9.38.  Some ancillary uses complement and support employment uses, so may be appropriate 
on the existing and planned Employment Areas.  
9.39.  As the economy transforms, not all existing Employment Areas will r emain viable or 
suitable for new types of employment uses.  Alternative uses of these sites may then be 
appropriate if there is no realistic prospect of the site being used for employment.  
Planning applications would need to provide proportionate evidence about viability for 
continued employment use and the alternative use being proposed. Alternatively, where 
a site is viable for employment use, there may be a lack of demand for employment 
uses. In this case planning applications would need to provide propo rtionate evidence 
about robust and effective site marketing for employment uses and an availability of 
similar sites and land in the local area.  If an alternative use is appropriate then 
opportunities to include an element of employment provision should b e considered.  
9.40.  This policy is consistent with the NPPF. The policy is part of the policies package for 
creating the conditions in which businesses can invest, expand and adapt. The plan 
places significant weight on the need to support sustainable and inclus ive economic 
growth and to be flexible enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, 
allow for new and flexible working practices, and to enable a rapid response to changes 
in economic circumstances.   
 
55. Policy – Employment and Skills Statements   
 
At this stage we are still gathering evidence to inform detailed policy wording. It is 
intended that the proposed policy will address the following issues:  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
204  Requiring developments over a certain threshold to commit to maximising the 
provision of skills and employment opportunities, to benefit the local population 
as well as the employer  
 Evidencing the commitment through a statement to be submitted with the 
planning application for development  
 Thresholds relating to this requirement - to be determined b ut could be applied 
to proposals of 100 houses or more, or employment development of 1000sqm 
or more  
 Exceptionally, making a financial contribution in lieu of the employment and 
skills obligation (if circumstances justify it),  
 Implementation of the commi tment to be sought through a planning obligation  
 Commitment to producing a Supplementary Planning Document to guide 
implementation of the policy  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
9.41.  Development provides opportunities for employment and improving skills  within East 
Devon, not just in from the building of the development but from the local supply chains, 
and the opportunity for apprenticeships and extended skills in the local labour supply.   
9.42.  As the economy transforms, development provides an opportunity to improve access to 
employment and to widen and raise skills in the local workforce. This policy supports the 
increase employment opportunities by  
 helping local businesses to improve, grow and take on more staff  
 helping businesses to find suitable staff  and suppliers, especially local ones  
 Improving the skills of local people to enable them to take advantage of the 
resulting employment opportunities  
 helping businesses already located in East Devon to grow and attract new 
businesses into the area  
9.43.  The wo rkforce in East Devon shows a good level of education with a mix of academic 
and vocational skills. The proportion of the working age resident population with no 
qualifications in East Devon is low, compared to national levels. However, the 
proportion of t he working age resident population qualified to NVQ level 4 and above in 
East Devon in 2018 was 35.8%, lower tha n the 38.7% in the South West and 39.3% 
nationally.   
9.44.  The Economic Vision and Economic Strategy support economic growth and prosperity 
in East D evon, but it also emphasises the need for growth to be inclusive, so that 
residents can access higher value employment opportunities. Raising skills in the 
District is part of a wider approach, aligned with the Levelling Up White Paper and Heart 
of the Sou th West Local Industrial Strategy. The LIS supports a skilled workforce 
through the Skills Escalator to enable a skilled workforce fit for the opportunities of the 
future. This approach focuses on  
 championing STEM courses (including T levels) to increase take-up 
 ensuring all residents have the employability skills they need to progress  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
205  increasing the take up of technical qualifications, and improving retention and 
recruitment of those with technical and higher -level skills  
 increasing employer investment in  workforce development  
 working with institutions to ensure that the Heart of the South West’s learning 
facilities and teaching capacity are fit for purpose and meeting future need; and  
 mainstreaming an inclusive approach so all residents can benefit from f uture 
prosperity.  
9.45.  This policy focuses on certain types of planning applications, for larger developments 
(where the size thresholds will need to be justified) committing the development to 
employment and skills provision. The pledges would relate to local labour, 
apprenticeships, workforce training and work experience, and local supply chain 
contracted in the construction process.   The commitment is set out in an Employment 
and Skills Statement, submitted with the planning application.  Once the statement is 
agreed with the LPA its implementation is controlled through a S106 Agreement.  
9.46.  An SPD is the appropriate way to provide detailed guidance to aid policy 
implementation.  A mechanism to monitor whether the companies are honouring their 
commitment would be  necessary. This means assessing whether the commitments are 
relevant, proportionate and measurable, and requiring the provision of data capturing 
the actions and results.  
 
56. Strategic Policy – Town centre h ierarchy, sequential approach 
and impact assessment  
 
The tier one and two town centres will be the preferred location for the development 
of main town centre uses as defined in the NPPF. Proposals must be appropriate in 
terms of their scale and design to the centre in which they are proposed, as well as 
the function of the centre and accord with other policies in the plan.  
 
The hierarchy of centres in East Devon is defined as follows:  
 Tier one Town Centre: Exmouth  
 Tier two Town Centre: Axminster, Cranbrook, Honiton, Ottery St Mary, 
Seaton, Sidmouth   
 Tier t hree Local Centre: Broadclyst, Budleigh Salterton, Colyton, Lympstone, 
Woodbury   
 Tier four Village Centre: Clyst St Mary, Uplyme, Beer , West Hill, Newton 
Poppleford, Feniton, Whimple, Kilmington, Otterton, East Budleigh, Stoke 
Canon, Tipton St John, Musbur y, Sidbury, Chardstock, Broadhembury, 
Payhembury, Branscombe, Plymtree,  Dunkeswell, Hawkchurch, Exton.  
 
Settlements shown in bold text have defined Town Centre Areas to which town centre 
development policy will apply.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
206 Applications for main town centre us es that are not proposed in the defined town 
centres and are not allocated for development through other policies of this Plan will 
only be permitted where the applicant can demonstrate that:  
 The proposal accords with (satisfies) the sequential test as set  out in the 
NPPF, and flexibility has been demonstrated on issues such as the format and 
scale of development.  
 For retail proposals greater than 500sq.m , and other town centre use 
proposals greater than 2,500sq.m , an impact assessment has been 
undertaken, which shows that the proposal will not have a significant adverse 
impact in line with requirements set out in the NPPF, either alone or 
cumulatively. Neighbourhood Plans may set different thresholds where local 
considerations, supported by evidence, indica te this is appropriate.  
 Retail development will not only be allowed on sites allocated for other uses if 
equally suitable alternative provision can be accommodated in the immediate 
locality . 
 
Edge -of-centre17 and out -of-centre sites, which satisfy the seque ntial test, should be 
accessible by public transport, bicycle and foot and well -connected to the centre. In 
order to ensure that land is retained for the benefit of the local economy, permitted 
development rights allowing changes to alternative uses will b e withdrawn.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
9.47.  East Devon’s town and village centres provide more than just retail opportunities, they 
function as the heart of the community offering a wide range of facilities often including: 
leisure and entertainm ent; sport and recreation; offices; cultural spaces and tourism 
development. The vitality and viability of these centres is fundamental to the support 
that they provide for local communities in the settlement and in adjoining areas, who 
rely on those centr es.  The NPPF is clear that planning policies for town centres should 
be positive, promote competitive town centre environments and set out policies for the 
management and growth of centres over the plan period.   
9.48.  This is a strategic policy because it estab lishes the network and hierarchy of centres. 
Maintaining the vitality and viability of the town centres in East Devon is a strategic 
priority in the plan.  This policy is also the starting point for the suite of non -strategic 
policies on town centres and p rimary shop ping frontages, local shops and services, and 
rural shops.  
                                            
 
 
17 Edge -of-centre locations are defined for retail purposes, as locat ions that are well 
connected and within 300  metres of the Primary Shopping Area. For all other main town 
centres uses, it is a location within 300 metres of a town centre boundary, however for 
office development this includes locations outside of the town centre but within 500 
metres of a public transport interchange. Local circumstances should be taken into 
account when determining whether a site falls within the definition of edge -of-centre.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
207 9.49.  The NPPF requires the LPA to define a network and hierarchy of centres that is resilient 
to anticipated future economic changes. This policy draws on the evidence in the 
Council’s Role a nd Functions of Settlements Study produced by the Council in July 
2021, which categorised the roles of existing settlements in the District by taking into 
account their differing sizes, offer, functions and accessibility by sustainable transport 
modes.   The Role and Function of Settlement Study was reported to Strategic Planning 
Committee of the Council on 5 October 2021, see item 38 - 1a. Role and Function of 
Settlements_report_v3 final draft for SPC.pdf (eastdevon.gov.uk)  
Town centre Hierarchy  
9.50.  East Devon contains a number of centres fulfilling residents and visitors diverse leisure 
and retail needs as part of a wider hierarchy. Village facilities will cater for basic 
everyday essentials but East Devon residents will use the main town centres to meet 
their convenience goods shopping needs and to access a wider range of services. None 
of the towns act as major comparison goods shopping destinations. In general, 
comparison goods expenditure flows out of the District, mainly towards Exeter but also 
to Taunton, Dorchester and further afield, as well as a significant and growing 
expenditure online.  
9.51.  Within the  District the settlement hierarchy and centre type is as follows:  
 Tier one : Exmouth (town centre with an extensive range of shops and services.)  
 Tier two:  Axminster, Cranbrook, Honiton, Ottery St Mary, Seaton, Sidmouth (town 
centres with a wide range of sh ops and services)  
 Tier three : Broadclyst, Budleigh Salterton, Colyton, Lympstone, Woodbury (local 
centres with multiple shops and services)  
 Tier four:  Clyst St Mary, Uplyme, Beer, West Hill, Newton Poppleford, Feniton, 
Whimple, Kilmington, Otterton, East B udleigh, Stoke Canon, Tipton St John, 
Musbury, Sidbury, Chardstock, Broadhembury, Payhembury, Branscombe, 
Plymtree, Dunkeswell, Hawkchurch, Exton, Westclyst (village centres with a 
limited range of individual shops and service s, although note that Beer has  a more 
extensive range than other tier 4 settlements)  
9.52.  As well as encouraging new shops and facilities in these locations it is important that 
existing provision is retained, especially in the tier three and four and more rural 
settlements where there are only likely to be one or two of each type of shop or service 
and total loss would be severely damaging.  It should be noted that, in addition to the 
town centres, the towns may also have neighbourhood shopping parades and individual 
stores and facilities t o serve the local communities on the outskirts. In policy terms, 
applications affecting these shops and facilities will be treated on the same basis as 
those in Tier four settlements as they are similarly important in meeting the basic 
everyday needs of re sidents. Outside of the settlements listed above, residents have 
few facilities so are forced to travel elsewhere, resulting in a less sustainable travel 
pattern.  Focussing new development on locations with good access to community 
services and facilities  helps to reduce traffic congestion, reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions, improve air quality, and improve both physical and mental health.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
208 Sequential Test  
9.53.  The Council must apply a sequential test to planning applications for new retail and 
retail related dev elopment, for example drive -through restaurants. The sequential 
approach will be applied so that development is located in the centre to which it is most 
appropriate, with preference being given to those centres higher up the hierarchy, and 
then identifies  preferred locations which must be considered before out -of-centre sites. 
The first preference is for town centre locations (within the Town Centre Area, as 
identified on the Policies map), followed by edge -of-centre sites and only then by out -of-
centre si tes provided that they can be made accessible by a choice of means of 
transport and will not adversely impact upon nearby centres. It is however, recognised 
that existing out of town stores will continue to provide a form of retailing which both 
adds to lo cal shopping choice and is popular with the public. Proposals for the 
refurbishment and redevelopment with small scale extensions of out of centre stores 
may be acceptable where there is insufficient net gain in retail floorspace to have an 
adverse effect on other established centres. Sequential testing is not required for small 
scale rural development (including office development) at or below 2,500 square metres 
of gross floorspace.   
9.54.  The NPPF also requires local plans to set a proportionate, locally set floorspace 
threshold above which planning applications for main town centre uses that are not in 
an existing centre and are not in accordance with an up -to-date Local Plan should be 
assessed for their impact. The scope of the Sequential Test and Retail Imp act 
Assessment required to be submitted in support of a planning application should be 
discussed and agreed between the applicant and the Council at an early stage in the 
pre-application process. The level of detail included within the assessments must be 
proportionate to the scale and type of retail floorspace proposed and shall be 
determined on a case by case basis. The PPG sets out detailed requirements for 
carrying out such assessments.  
9.55.  In determining the scale at which retail impact assessments are re quired the Council 
have taken advice and established a threshold figure of 500 square meters above which 
assessment will be needed.  For other types of development a default threshold of 
2,500sq.m. (gross) is identified by the NPPF.  
Town Centre Development   
9.56.  With the exception of Cranbrook, where the town centre is embryonic, the District’s town 
centres are compact, have a retail offer that focuses on convenience and service 
provision, and are characterised by a predominance of independent shops fringed by 
supermarkets. Regular street markets  in Honiton and Axminster, and occasional 
farmers or artisan markets in all of the towns, draw in trade and along with street 
performers and other temporary events in the public realm create vibrancy and are to be 
encoura ged. In addition to the town’s identified in tier one and tier two, the smaller 
settlements of Budleigh Salterton, Beer and Colyton contain a similar range of shops 
and other uses typically found in the larger towns, albeit at a smaller scale, and so 
Polic y 56 w ill also be applicable to them.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
209 57. Policy  - Town Centre development  
 
Town Centre Areas and Primary Shopping Areas  are defined for the tier one and two 
towns and the settlements of Budleigh Salterton, Beer and Colyton.  
  
Proposals for development withi n the town centre areas, as defined on the Policies 
Map, will be permitted where they improve the quality and/or broaden the range of 
retail and leisure facilities, enhance the role of the town centres as sustainable 
shopping and leisure destinations and s trengthen their vitality and viability. Proposals 
must not undermine the shopping character or visual amenity of the town centre, 
either alone or cumulatively, or adversely affect the amenity of the surrounding area 
through noise, smell, litter, traffic or  disturbance arising from operating hours. 
Development proposals should make a positive contribution to the townscape of the 
centre in which it is proposed.   
  
The Primary Shopping Areas as defined on the Policies Map will be the focus for 
retail and appr opriate leisure uses. Development proposals for other town centre uses 
within the Primary Shopping Areas will only be permitted where the majority of the 
total ground floor units are facilitating retail or leisure uses. Unless it can be 
demonstrated that t here is no longer a retail or leisure demand, other town centre 
uses will not be permitted on the ground floor within the Primary Shopping Areas. 
Unless it can be demonstrated that there is no demand for any town centre use . 
Residential uses will not be pe rmitted on the ground floor within the Primary Shopping 
Areas. Evidence of demand should be outlined in a marketing statement. Criteria on 
what will be considered an adequate marketing statement will be published and 
available online via the Council’s webs ite. 
  
Where change of use of a shop is permitted within the town centre and the shopfront, 
entrance or other features are considered to be of architectural or historic merit they 
should be retained and incorporated into the new development scheme.   
  
Throughout the Town Centre Area appropriately designed development proposals for 
residential or community use of upper floors will be encouraged. Such use should be 
independently accessed, have provision for refuse storage and should not result in 
adverse imp acts on any retail use of the building.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
9.57.  In line with Paragraph 86 of the NPPF, the council supports the role that town centres 
play at the heart of local communities, by taking a positive approach to their growth, 
management and adaptation. As part of a positive strategy for the future of each town 
centre, the Local Plan defines their extent and makes clear the range of uses that are 
acceptable within them.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
210 9.58.  Primary shopping areas  are the defined areas where retail will be concentrated.  The 
NPPF requires these to be identified on the  policies  map with the intention that retail 
use and access to convenience goods continue to draw in trade and maintain the vitality 
and viability of the High Street. The scale of the to wn centres covered by this policy is 
such that for each town centre, the Town Centre area and the Primary Shopping Area 
are one and the same. This means they share the same boundaries for the purpose of 
the local plan’s town centre and retail policies. The  Town Centre Areas are to be shown 
on the Policies Map.  
9.59.  Historic environment of town centres  - The established town centres all contain listed 
buildings and designated conservation areas, so development proposals will need to be 
sensitively designed to pro tect, preserve and where appropriate enhance the character 
and appearance of any conservation area or listed building affected. Particular care 
should be given to the design of shopfronts, advertisements and signage. This also 
helps to create attractive, l egible centres that encourage people to regularly use the 
centres and retain retail and leisure spend within East Devon.  
9.60.  Town centre uses - All of the town centres contain a mix of town centre uses including 
retail, leisure, community uses and residential housing, and benefit from public transport 
services (including rail services from Honiton, Axminster , Cranbrook  and Exmouth) and 
bus services to the surrounding areas and to Exeter. The Local Plan provides a positive 
strategy for the future development of town centres and their health is regularly 
monitored   to ensure that, if evidence suggests that they are in decline, the Council is 
able to implement further measures, along with relevant stakeholders, to support their 
vitality and viability.  
9.61.  Although al l the established town centres have historically experienced low vacancy 
rates, they are some way from meeting their full potential as retail and leisure centres 
and would benefit from the development of an enhanced offer. To address this issue the 
Council  has produced masterplans for Exmouth and Cranbrook, with the aim of 
regenerating the former and stimulating private sector interest in both.  
9.62.  Given their close proximity to transport networks and local shops and services, town 
centre and edge of centre si tes may be particularly suited to locating specialist housing 
for different groups including older people.  
Flexibility   
9.63.  Due to competition from on -line retailing and increased flexibilities in changes of use 
introduced via the General Permitted Developme nt Order (GDPO ) (The Town and 
Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 
(legislation.gov.uk) , there is a risk that the number of retail units within the town c entres 
will reduce. This policy therefore seeks to retain as many retail units as necessary  within 
the town centres to ensure they remain attractive destinations. The GPDO allows for 
change of use of retail units to various other uses. The amount of floors pace which can 
be changed under permitted development is restricted. Applicants are advised to 
consult the GPDO prior to submitting a planning application to check whether planning 
permission is required. For the avoidance of doubt, this policy only applie s to proposals 
which would fall outside the permitted development regime.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
211  
58. Policy  – Local shops and services   
 
Provision of new shops or services  
Proposals for shopping and service development (including Public Houses and Post 
Offices) will be supported in tier 3 and 4 settlements, villages and neighbourhood 
centres provided it enhances their retail or service role and is accessible by walking 
and by bicycle and will not result in excessive traffic generation. New shops should 
sell predominantly convenienc e goods, be of a scale to serve the local area without, 
alone or cumulatively, impacting on the vitality or viability of any nearby centre18.  
The operation of the shop or service must not be detrimental to the amenity of 
neighbouring residents by reason of  undue noise, smell or traffic.  
 
Loss of existing local shops or services  
Proposals which would result in a significant or total loss of shops, Post Offices, 
Public Houses or other services to the community will not be permitted except where 
the existing p rovision of a use of this nature is no longer viable and there is no market 
for the business as a going concern . This will apply to stand -alone facilities or 
services and to those operating within or as part of a different use.   
 
A marketing statement is required to evidence that there is insufficient demand and 
no market for the shop or service to be sustained, including under community 
acquisition/operation  or wit hin, or as part of, a different use . Criteria on what will be 
considered an adequate marketi ng statement will be published and available online 
via the Council’s website. Permission to change the use of a shop will be subject to 
the retention of the shopfront.  
 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
9.64.  Throughout the District there are small gro ups of shops and services which are 
invaluable in meeting the basic, everyday needs of the communities they serve. These 
vary greatly - from the more comprehensive offer in the tier three and four town and 
village centres, to neighbourhood shops outside the  urban centres of the towns, and 
village shops in the rural communities. The extent and diversity of provision makes it 
impractical to define neighbourhood or local centres on the Policies m ap (or provide 
specific measures that could be used to define them ) but these are areas where a group 
of shops and facilities, typically supplying a range of everyday goods and services is 
                                            
 
 
18 As a guide to the scale and location of shops in the smaller s ettlements, Use Class F.2 (of the 1st 
September 2020 General Permitted Development Order) relates to shops not more than 280sqm mostly 
selling essential goods, including food and at least 1km from another similar shop.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
212 located. There is some scope for improving the local centres and for the provision of 
new shops, post offices and services in those a reas which lack retail facilities. The 
opening hours of shops and services within residential areas may be restricted to 
ensure that local amenity is safeguarded.  
9.65.  Given the importance of existing shops and services in providing for the essential day to 
day convenience shopping needs of the local community it is vital that they are retained 
wherever possible  and are able to adapt to changing local ised need . They offer 
important facilities in particular for the elderly and less mobile. Village public houses 
often provide a focus for community life and shops and post offices enable those 
without transport to remain living rurally by reducing reliance on the private car, 
especially as public transport is limited in these areas. The Council will seek to resist th e 
loss of local shops and services where this would result in a significant or absolute loss 
of facilities to a community.  
9.66.  It is difficult to reinstate shops, in the same or other premises, when they have changed 
to other uses. It is not however, always po ssible to prevent their closure when it is 
uneconomic for their use to continue. Therefore proposals involving the loss of local 
shops or services will only be permitted where the District Council is satisfied that the 
existing use is no longer viable and there is no market for the business as a going 
private or voluntary sector concern . In order to demonstrate this, the Council will seek 
information regarding the marketing of the business and its accounts. The Council will 
seek to retain the shop front in circumstances where permission is granted to enable the 
premises to be reinstated as a shop should the future opportunity arise.  
9.67.  It is important that the community function and role of shops and services in creating 
sustainable places is recognised, both b y supporting new ones and by resisting the loss 
of existing ones. This conforms to the guidance in paragraph 84 of the NPPF relating to 
the rural areas which requires “the retention and development of accessible local 
services and community facilities, suc h as local shops, meeting places, sports venues, 
open space, cultural buildings, public houses and places of worship.” This policy takes a 
cautious approach towards the loss of important shops and services, to ensure that the 
needs of communities can conti nue to be met in the future, but allows for change of use 
when the viability or use of the shop or service to the local community can no longer be 
demonstrated. Proposals will have to provide evidence that the current use, or an 
alternative use of similar value to the local community, is not viable through relevant 
marketing information and viability studies.  
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
213 59. Policy  – Rural shops  
 
In order to support local rural businesses whilst protecting the viability of town centres  
and shops available to  the local  community , retail development in rural areas, outside 
villages, will be permitted only where it directly relates to an existing rural business  
(such as a farm or plant nursery) , subject to:  
a) a minimum of 50% of the produce/products for sale being produ ced on the 
premises or holding, and:  
b) the majority of the remaining produce/products for sale being sourced and 
produced from within a 30 mile  radius of the business ; or 
c) there being an essential functional need or relationship betw een the production 
process  or the products to be sold and the rural business location  which 
demonstrably increases the overall sustainability of the business. (Examples 
could include a wood powered smokery located within a fuel producing 
coppice ; equestrian  equipment sold at  a riding school ). 
 
and provided that:   
1. The scale and type of retail shop proposed will not adversely affect easily 
accessible convenience shopping available to the local community.  
2. The proposal does not harm the rural character of the surrounding n atural or 
historic environment,  or the amenities of the locality.  
3. The local road network and access to the site can safely accommodate the 
extra traffic generated by the proposal.  
4. The car parking will be proportionate to the scale of the developmen t and 
the layout and siting will be sympathetic to the surroundings.  
5. The scale and scope of any additional services will be restricted to ensure 
that they are ancillary to the main use.  
 
Applications for extensions or additional facilities will be subj ect to a retail impact 
assessment to ensure that existing town centres and local shops are not adversely 
affected to an unacceptable degree.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
9.68.  Rural shops (including farm shops and plant nurseries) are defined as shop s in which 
the majority of goods sold are produced on the premises. This is suggested as being 
defined as a minimum 50% to ensure that any shop is reasonably linked to the use of 
the land instead of forming a general retail outlet. Farm shops can provide a  valuable 
local facility, an additional source of income for farms and can help sustain the rural 
economy. However, they should not become an alternative to shops which are better 
located and more accessible and convenient in town and village centres.  
9.69.  Without restrictions on size and the type of goods to be sold, rural shops, garden 
centres and nurseries can become large commercial enterprises, supplementing locally 
made products sold on a small scale with general retail products without a local tie sold 
on an inappropriately larger scale , potentially drawing trade from local centres . This will 
be controlled to prevent the sale of general retail goods and additional services such as East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
214 cafes will only be permitted where they are ancillary to the sale of goods or products 
produced on the property to which the shop or nursery relates. Rural shops, garden 
centres and nurseries may develop an urban appearance as they expand and the 
number and size of buildings increase, hard surfaced display areas are extended and 
additional car parking is required. Such developments would generally be harmful to the 
high quality East Devon landscape and would generate additional traffic which may not 
be safely accommodated on local roads. Any proposals for the provision of new farm  
shops, garden centres or nurseries or the expansion of existing enterprises must 
therefore ensure that such development does not adversely affect the valued character, 
qualities and assets of the surrounding natural or historic environment to an 
unaccepta ble degree.  
9.70.  In accordance with paragraph 84 of the NPPF, the Local Plan will promote retail 
development in rural areas where products are sourced or manufactured locally as this 
will allow diversification in agricultural businesses and promote local food p roduction, 
supporting the rural economy. The criteria set out in the policy will aim to restrict the 
scale of development and  origin  of goods to be sold to reflect the countryside location 
and ensure that the vitality and viability of town centres in the D istrict is not undermined 
in line with the Local Plan strategy. This ensures that town centres are the focus not 
only for retail but service trades, leisure facilities and other public amenities, serving 
more than just their immediate locality and their pr otection is important for those 
accessing services from the surrounding areas.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
215 60. Policy  – Sustainable Tourism  
 
This policy seeks to ensure that  the Council’s strategic vision for tourism, that East 
Devon be the leading, year -round tourism destination in Devo n, whose diverse 
ecosystem of outstanding natural environments, distinctive, high -quality businesses, 
towns and villages, all thrive and grow through a commitment to Net Zero, 
accessibility and collaboration, is supported.   
  
Applications for the provision  of high quality, sustainable and accessible appropriately 
located accommodation, visitor facilities and attractions will be supported and 
encouraged. In this Policy "visitor accommodation" means serviced tourist 
accommodation (Class C1 use) and un -service d tourist accommodation, as well as 
ancillary staff buildings to support the provision of tourism services.    
  
Proposal s for new Tourist Attractions/Facilities or Accommodation  
In line with the Council Plan’s focus on ‘green tourism’ capitalising on the  breadth of 
the natural environment and biodiversity within the area, the development of new 
permanent and temporary visitor accommodation and attractions will be permitted in 
locations where reliance on the private car is minimised, where there is evidenc e to 
show customer demand and a commitment to:   
 Developing facilities of high quality;   
 Working towards Net Zero; and   
 Improving accessibility provision  (accessibility in terms of providing suitable access 
to those with physical and non -physical impairm ents/disability )    
   
In order to provide such evidence, applicants will be required to submit a Sustainable 
Tourism Statement outlining their commitment to the above criteria.  Criteria on what 
should be addressed in the Sustainable Tourism Statement wil l be published and 
available online via the Council’s website.  
  
Within the protected landscapes designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, 
Coastal Pre servation Areas or Green Wedges and  outside of the settlement 
boundaries, new buildings to provi de overnight visitor accommodation will not usually 
be permitted, although temporary structures such as yurts, glamping pods, towing 
caravans and tents may be acceptable. In exceptional circumstances, if a new 
building is permitted it would need to be buil t to the highest passive/green building 
standards and clearly outline how impact on the natural environment will be 
minimised.    
 
Any proposal for new tourist attractions, facilities or accommodation should meet the 
following criteria in full:  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
216  the scale, siting, intensity and appearance of buildings and activities associated 
with the proposed development is appropriate to the character of the area and 
will not adversely impact local amenity;   
 any existing suitable buildings are re -used or adapted and, whe re appropriate, 
redundant buildings which are derelict or offer no opportunity for beneficial use 
are removed. If existing buildings cannot be reused or adapted then this should 
be fully justified;   
 no unacceptable adverse impacts arising from vehicle mov ements or parking and 
where it is likely to create significant vehicular movements to and from the site it 
should be well located in relation to sustainable tier 1 -4 settlements and local 
public transport provision  
 foul drainage facilities are adequate;   
 no unacceptable adverse impacts arising from increased noise, smells, or other 
form of pollution  
 no unacceptable adverse impact on the character of surrounding natural or 
historic environment;  
 no adverse impact on protected species and opportunities to i mprove biodiversity 
are maximised    
  
Tourism development in the countryside  
 Outside settlement boundaries new development must positively contribute to the 
natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the District.  Development will need 
to be close ly associated with other attractions/established tourism uses, including 
the public rights of way network; or be a subordinate part of farm diversification 
schemes.   
 Where visitor accommodation or attractions are to be located in the countryside, 
developm ent must be located very close to the main dwelling from which it will be 
serviced/managed (e.g. as part of a farm diversification scheme) to avoid the need 
for a permanent new managers dwelling or multiple daily car journeys to manage 
the site. Criteria w ill address matters such as transport, amenity, bio -diversity net -
gain, staff accommodation and landscaping.  
   
Policy will support and encourage the development of a year -round visitor economy, 
while ensuring the facility remains for visitor use only.  
  
Loss of Existing Visitor Accommodation  
 The loss of visitor accommodation to other uses will only be permitted in 
exceptional circumstances. For example, converting holiday accommodation into 
low-cost staff accommodation (rented residential accommodation for local 
workforce), which will address recruitment challenges for the tourism sector.  
 Where loss is proposed, applicants will need to demonstrate that the site/land is no 
longer viable for visitor accommodation, cannot be refurbished or redeveloped for 
visitor accommodation but is viable for an alternative type of employment use, 
evidenced by a viability statement. Criteria on what will be considered an adequate 
viability statement will be published and available online via the Council’s website.  
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022

FIGURE 13.  The popular village of Beer.  
Justification for Policy  
9.71.  Tourism is a key part of East Devon’s economy and it is important that visitors continue 
to be drawn by the unique environment and offered good quality accommodation and 
services to meet their needs and encourage longer stays. Policy aims to secure a high 
quality, sustainable tourism experience for the wide range of visitors to East Devon, and 
ensure that proposals benefit local communities and businesses, whilst conserving, 
enhancing and promoting th e natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the District.   
9.72.  A significant proportion of visits are day trips from those living in the District or in the 
villages, towns and city surrounding East Devon. For those holidaying in the District, 
visitor accommodation takes a number of forms - from seaside hotels and bed and 
breakfasts, to farmhouse bedrooms and holiday lets, glamping and camping to caravan 
sites and holiday parks. The tourism sector is largely leisure driven but evidence is 
presently lacki ng as to the levels of demand for different types of accommodation.  
9.73.  While the Council supports growth in sustainable tourism, there are associated 
challenges for the environment and local communities. High numbers of visitors can put 
pressure on some locat ions or ‘hot -spots’, for example, by impacting on tranquillity, 
increasing traffic and parking congestion, or causing physical erosion. The Council will 
support proposals for sustainable attractions and recreational activities, which avoid 
undesirable impa cts, and contribute to the conservation and enhancement of the natural 
environment whilst providing for the needs of users and bringing benefits to the local 
economy.  
9.74.  Landscape character and built form are central to the attractiveness of East Devon as a 
destination for visitors and therefore, in the first instance, proposals should retain and 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
218 utilise existing buildings. If existing buildings are not available, or are causing harm to 
the special qualities, then proposals for any new buildings should be acco mpanied by 
justification and evidence that the proposals are sensitive to the site and its wider 
context. New buildings for visitor accommodation will not usually be permitted within the 
designated landscapes. Proposals for temporary, seasonal, accommodati on, such as 
tents, towing caravans and movable glamping pods, may be permitted within the 
designated landscapes in accordance with policy. Favourable consideration will be 
given to the removal of existing buildings which produce net gains for landscape.  
9.75.  The Council will resist the loss of permanent visitor accommodation and applicants will 
be required to demonstrate that it is financially unviable, by providing evidence in 
accordance with the marketing requirements set out in on our website . The minimum 
marketing period required is 12 months but a longer marketing period may be required 
to cover more than one season or where the existing use is located in close proximity to 
established tourist attractions or the rights of way network. Redevelopment of visito r 
accommodation, visitor attraction, recreation facilities or associated development which 
is currently resulting in harm to the special qualities of the District (for example the 
visually prominent static caravans within the Coastal Preservation Area) sho uld, in the 
first instance, be redeveloped for other more suitable tourist or community uses.  
9.76.  The purpose of this policy is to foster the responsible and sustainable delivery of 
tourism and visitor recreation development in East Devon in line with the Coun cil Plan 
aims to increase and support ‘green tourism’ capitalising on East Devon’s natural 
environment. Proposals for visitor accommodation, attractions, recreational activities, 
environmental education and interpretation should provide opportunities for v isitors to 
increase their awareness, enjoyment, and understanding of East Devon’s natural 
environment. They should also foster guardianship of the special qualities, for example, 
by promoting and incorporating the District’s natural beauty, wildlife, cultu ral and built 
heritage. There are many diverse and creative ways in which development proposals 
could address this, which should be tailored to the context of the proposals.  
9.77.  There is a fine balance to be reached between encouraging provision of 
accommodat ion to enable visitors to enjoy the coast and countryside and damaging the 
rural character due to a proliferation of new buildings, noise and additional car -based 
traffic. The high number of planning applications for conversions of existing rural holiday 
accommodation to other uses (particularly housing) due to a lack of demand/viability 
indicates that some sectors of the industry are at saturation point and that, rather than 
permitting new permanent buildings in the open countryside, policy should encourag e 
the conversion of existing buildings to holiday accommodation and temporary, seasonal 
structures such as yurts and glamping pods  
9.78.  In line with Government guidance development proposals for visitor accommodation, 
attractions and recreation facilities shoul d be located sustainably. Locating such tourism 
development within existing tier 1 -4 settlements give most opportunity for access to 
sustainable transport and other facilities, helping to minimise use of the private car.  
9.79.  Given the nature of some tourism -related and recreational activities, a more rural 
location or proximity to a geographically specific feature, such as the coast or a river, 
may be required. Policy will seek to ensure that these are planned for appropriately and East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
219 contribute positively to the  natural environment, particularly within designated 
landscapes.  
9.80.  Every opportunity for sustainable travel should be utilised including access to the site 
and/or subsequent travel, for example bicycle hire provision, as part of visitor 
accommodation. This is to ensure that the proposals align with the Council’s net -zero 
targets and do not harm the special qualities of the area.  
 
61. Policy  – Holiday Accommodation Parks in designated 
landscapes  
 
Within the District’s most sensitive landscape areas , including A reas of Outstanding 
Natural Beauty, Coastal Preservation Areas and Green Wedge s, new caravan, chalet 
or other  holiday parks will not be permitted.   
 
Proposals for the extension  of, or related and ancillary facilities on , existing sites will 
be permitted p rovided they meet the following criteria in full:  
 
1. No additional permanent pitches or accommodation are to be provided.  
2. The proposal relates sensitively in scale and siting to the surroundings and 
includes  extensive landscaping and visual screening t o mitigate against adverse 
impacts.  
3. The proposal  would not have an adverse impact on local character or the amenities 
of adjoining residents.  
4. The proposal  would not use the best and most versatile agricultural land.  
5. The  proposal  will be provide d with adequate services and utilities  
6. Traffic generated by the proposal can be accommodated safely on the local 
highway network and safe highway access to the site can be achieved.  
7. The proposal  will be subject to the provisions of plan policy in t erms of sustainable 
construction , on site renewable energy production  and biodiversity net gain. 
8. Any structures beyond the existing boundary of the site are temporary and any 
visual or other harm can be satisfactorily mitigated.   
 
Justification for Po licy 
9.81.  The majority of East Devon lies within one or more designated landscapes. Holiday 
accommodation parks, comprising static caravans, chalets and/or lodges and 
associated facilities, are a key feature within the tourism sector and the expansion of 
existi ng parks, and potential development of new parks will have a positive effect on the 
economy of East Devon. This should not, however, be to the detriment of the natural 
environment or local communities and so a policy is required to establish how 
applicatio ns will be determined. This is particularly important given the large scale, East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
220 range of facilities, lengthy operational hours and prominent coastal locations of many 
existing parks and their detrimental impact on both the seascape and the landscape.  
9.82.  Outside designated landscapes, new or expanded parks for holiday accommodation 
purposes will be acceptable in principle, in accordance with the Sustainable Tourism 
policy.  
9.83.  Within the designated landscapes no new holiday parks comprising static caravan, 
chalet, lo dge or other similarly (semi) permanent accommodation will be permitted. 
Existing parks will be encouraged to upgrade and improve their accommodation and 
other facilities where this will lessen their existing visual, environmental and amenity 
impact. Exten sions to, and intensification of development within, existing sites will not 
be permitted unless this is to provide related, non -permanent ancillary facilities and any 
adverse impacts can be satisfactorily mitigated  
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
221 Chapter 10.  Designing beautiful and healthy 
spac es and buildings   
Introduction  
 
10.1.  The design of spaces and buildings is fundamental to  how we experience place s, and 
the impact development has on the natural environment.  The design of space has a 
direct impact on peoples’ health, safety, security, inclusi on, travel choices , cost of living , 
and general quality of life. Design can influence the impact development has on the 
environment through the method and quality of construction, integration with the context 
of the local area, and the extent to which spac es and buildings address both immediate 
and future demands of the climate emergency.  
10.2.  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) makes clear that the creation of high 
quality  places and buildings is a fundamental requirement of the planning and 
developme nt process. It highlights that good design is a key aspect of sustainable 
development  and helps make development acceptable to communities. Local Plan 
policy is intended to ensure well designed proposals come forward for approval in 
accordance with  the NPPF and national design guidance, contained in the National 
Design Guide, National Model Design Code, and Guidance Notes for Design Codes.   
10.3.  The Local Plan includes site allocations to enable  appropriate levels of development to 
meet  housing  targets set at th e national level.  The design of these strategic allocations 
is key to safeguarding the character and appearance of our valuable landscapes.  It is 
particularly important that we focus our attention on the most sensitive sites including 
allocations within Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)  or affecting a heritage 
asset. To address this requirement, and as steered by national guidance, d esign codes 
will be produced  for a number of allocated sites , and for specific areas,  to inform future 
proposals . Our policies , supported by design codes, will guide the decision making 
process to ensure that all new development is fit for purpose, being both resilient and 
well integrated into the natural, built and historic environment.  
10.4.  Whilst good design is often as sociated with the physical appearance or functionality of 
buildings, it is increasingly concerned with achieving more sustainable and energy 
efficient buildings. These aspects of design are considered in detail under the tackling 
climate change chapter. Ev ery development provides an opportunity for good design 
and many of our policies contain a design element. For example:   
  
 Ensuring climate change resilience;   
 Encouraging healthy and active lifestyles and travel patterns; and  
 Encourage green infrastruc ture, including green space and landscaping.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
222  
FIGURE 14.  Considered green infrastructure is vital to create healthy places.  
10.5.  New development should create a high standard of amenity for existing and future 
users. The quality of a home is a determining factor in hea lth outcomes and the need for 
accommodation which is of a suitable size and layout to meet the needs of the 
occupier/s is key to this.  The Government’s nationally described space standard23 
(NDSS) sets minimum standards for the size of new dwellings, base d upon the number 
of bedrooms, storeys, and occupancy. The NDSS provide a common standard that local 
planning authorities may choose to adopt through local plan policies, subject to 
evidence of need and viability.   
10.6.  Evidence on the size of new dwellings be ing built in East Devon over recent years 
indicates that just 29% are meeting the NDSS in relation to gross internal floor area . 
Further assessment of a selection of new homes against bedroom area and widths 
suggest ed far fewer homes achieve the other requ irements of the NDSS. There is a risk 
that these new dwellings are not providing a reasonable level of internal space to 
undertake typical day to day activities, with potential impacts including a lack of space to 
prepare and eat food, store possessions, s ocialise, study, work, relax, or adapt in case 
of changed circumstances. In applying the NDSS, it will be considered that every 
habitable room which does not function as the main living room, dining room or kitchen 
will be regarded as a bedroom. The impact  of adopting the NDSS will be considered in 
the viability assessment that accompanies the East Devon Local Plan 2020 -40, to 
demonstrate that the Plan can be delivered in a viable manner.      
 
62. Policy – Design and Local Distinctiveness  
 
In order to ensure  that new development, including the refurbishment of existing 
buildings to include renewable energy, is of a high quality design and locally 
distinctive, a formal Design and Access Statement, should accompany applications 
setting out the design principles  to be adopted. Proposals should clearly respond to 
local policy and guidance including Neighbourhood Plans, Village Plans, Design 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
223 Guides, Design Briefs, and Design Codes, whether adopted as Supplementary 
Planning Documents or promoted through other means.   
 
Proposals will only be permitted where they:   
1. Identify opportunities for design that minimises risks associated with climate 
change, including consideration of a fabric first approach, the use of 
appropriate materials, techniques, and technologies to r educe carbon 
emissions over the lifetime of the development.  
2. Include measures to secure the management of waste in accordance with the 
waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse, recycle, recovery, disposal) during the 
construction and operational phases.  
3. Ensure the  appearance of buildings, including scale, massing, density, height, 
fenestration, and materials, relate well to their context.  
4. Do not adversely affect :  
 The distinctive historic or architectural character of the area.  
 The urban form, in terms of signific ant street patterns, groups of buildings 
and open spaces.  
 Important landscape characteristics and prominent topographical features.  
 Trees and hedgerows worthy of retention.  
 The amenity of occupiers of adjoining residential properties.  
 The operation of e xisting uses outside of the proposed development.  
 The future amenity of occupants of proposed residential properties, with 
respect to access to open space; protection from noise and pollution; 
provision of adequate internal light; storage space for bins, bicycles, 
prams, and other uses.   
5. Provide biodiversity enhancement appropriate to the scale of development in 
accordance with Local Plan policy. Where possible, development proposals 
should include landscaping that prioritises habitat creation.  
6. Meet natio nally described space standards1.  
7. Provide:  
 Secure and attractive layouts with safe and convenient access for the 
whole community, including disabled user s. 
 Measures to create a safe environment for the community and reduce the 
potential for crime.  
 Neces sary and appropriate street lighting and furniture and, subject to 
negotiation with developers, public art integral to the design.  
 Features that maintain good levels of daylight and sunlight into and 
between buildings to minimise the need for powered ligh ting.  
 Appropriate ‘greening’ measures relating to landscaping and planting, 
open space provision and permeability of hard surfaces.  
8. Mitigate potential adverse impacts, such as noise, smell, dust, arising from 
developments, both during and after construct ion.

 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
224  
Justification for inclusion of policy  
 
10.7.  Paragraphs 126 to 136 of the NPPF establish the mandate for planning authorities  to 
create policy that facilitates the creation of high quality , beautiful and sustainable  places 
and buildings. Paragraph 27 states  ‘plans should, at the most appropriate level, set out 
a clear design vision and expectations, so that applicants have as much certainty as 
possible about what is likely to be acceptable ’. The NPPF makes clear that in order to 
provide maximum clarity about design expectation s at an early stage, all local planning 
authorities should prepare design guides or codes consistent with the principles set out 
in the National Design Guide and National Model Design Code, and which reflect local 
character and design preferences.   
10.8.  This policy is  an updated version of Policy D1 – Design and Local Distinctiveness of the 
adopted local plan , one of the policies most often quoted i n decision notices and 
appeals. In addition to the design specific policy, the plan policies  embed good design 
throughout  the Local Plan.   
 
 
63. Policy – Housing Density and Efficient Use of Land  
 
Proposals for residential development will be permitted provided that the development 
optimises the density of the site in a manner that conserves  or enhances the 
character of the area and makes efficient use of land.  
In further refinement of this policy , we intend to set minimum density standards to 
support  the efficient use of land .  
 
Proposal s for major development schemes and those in environmentally or heritage 
sensitive l ocations will be required to be supported by a design code  agreed with or 
produc ed by the council as planning authority.  Codes, amongst other matters, will  
specify density recommendations for key allocations,  
Further design codes may be produced to address more generic area specific design 
and density concern s.  This work is dependent on t he final selection  of site  
allocations , to be  informed by the outcomes of the consultation process.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
10.9.  Paragraphs 119 – 125 of the  NPPF deal with making effective use of land and achieving 
appropriate densities. In order to meet our sustainability goals we need to ensure that 
we make efficient use of land and build at the maximum density that is compatible with 
the character of the s urrounding area. Where there is an anticipated shortage of land for 
meeting identified housing needs, the NPPF (paragraph 125) advocates minimum East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
225 density standards for town centres and other locations well served by public transport 
that significantly incre ase the average residential density of such areas. The NPPF also 
suggests that a range of densities could be set to reflect the accessibility of different 
areas. Further work is needed to provide evidence of what the minimum density 
standards should be.  
Advertisements  
10.10.  The display of advertisements is controlled in a similar way to the need to apply for 
planning permission for some development, but under a separate legal system . It is 
appropriate to have a pol icy to guide decision makers on how to deal with applications 
for advertisement consent . 
 
64. Policy – Display of Advertisements  
 
Applications for the display of advertisements will be considered in terms of amenity 
and public safety, taking account of cumulative impacts . Advertisements should  be: 
1. Appropria tely positioned and scaled in relation to their context;  
2. Safe in terms of highway safety;  
3. Sympathetic to the character of the area;  
4. Designed with colours and materials compatible with the building and area; and  
5. Where illuminated, the type and level of illu mination should reflect the general 
level of lighting in the area.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
 
10.11.  The NPPF highlights that the character of an area can be undermined when 
advertisements are poorly sited and designed but  should only be controlled  in the 
interests of amenity and public safety, taking account of cumulative impacts (paragraph 
136). The proposed policy will help to protect amenities and public safety.  
 
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
226 Chapter 11.  Prioritising Sustainable travel and 
providing the transport and communications  
facilities we need  
Introduction  
11.1.  East Devon is a largely rural district and travel patterns  generally  reflect this, with 
relatively low levels of walking, cycling and public transport; and higher levels of car 
ownership than the national average.  Neverth eless,  there is a difference between 
urban and rural areas in East Devon .  There are  many villages and hamlets  with limited 
jobs and services, where a degree of car travel is a necessity; but there are also lots of 
urban areas that  offer a range of jobs, f acilities, and services, suitable for day -to-day 
life, which can be accessed using sustainable travel modes.   The spatial strategy in 
chapter 3 reflects this distinction.    
11.2.  Exmouth, Honiton, Seaton and Ottery St Mary all have bespoke bus services that trav el 
around these towns, and there are several high frequency bus routes linking East 
Devon settlements to Exeter.  East Devon has many  train stations for its size (nine in 
total), across two lines, and usage has increased significantly over the last 20 year s.  
There are also some high quality active travel corridors, notably the Exe Estuary Trail 
and proposed Clyst Valley Trail.   
11.3.  Sustainable transport is defined as “any efficient, safe and accessible means of 
transport with overall low impact on the environm ent, including walking and cycling, low 
and ultra -low emission vehicles, car sharing and public transport”.19   
 
 
FIGURE 15.  New cycle and walkways facilitate sustainable travel.  
 
 
                                            
 
 
19 NPPF Annex 2: National Planning Policy Framework - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)  
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
227 11.4.  Promoting sustainable transport in new development has multiple benefits – these 
include less traffic congestion, lower carbon dioxide emissions, better air quality, and 
improved physical and mental health.  In addition, where sustainable travel is not 
prioritised, those without access to a car ( which can include  young people, older people,  
those with disabilities, low-income  households) can suffer from social exclusion and 
difficulty in accessing jobs, shops, leisure, education and other activities.   
11.5.  It is important to note that, whilst electric cars help tackle climate change by lowering 
carbon dioxide emissions,  they are far from zero carbon due to emissions  arising  from 
their construction, and they do not reduce congestion or address issues relating to 
social exclusion discussed above.  
Walking, Cycling and Public transport  
11.6.  The spatial  strategy in Chapter 3 of this plan focusse s development  on those places 
which are or can be made sustainable, through limiting the need to travel to jobs, 
facilities, shops, schools and leisure; and offering a genuine choice of transport modes.  
National pol icy makes clear that the Local Plan should identify and pursue opportunities 
to promote walking, cycling and public transport.  Much Government guidance has been 
published in recent years on designing places to promote sustainable travel .20 More 
locally, De von County Council’s Cycling and Multi -Use Trail Network Strategy21 
proposes strategic cycle network schemes from Cranbrook to Exeter  (section in East 
Devon now delivered) , Seaton to Colyton, and Feniton to Sidmouth.  
11.7.  Studies have shown that most people will  choose to walk only if their destination is less 
than 1.6 km ( a mile away ), with 800m (half a mile) being a typical distance.22  
Nevertheless, distance is just one of several factors to consider – others include 
topography, surveillance, directness, attrac tiveness of the environment, and the 
intended destination.  Given the rural nature of much of East Devon, it is not realistic to 
require all new development to be within 800m of a range of uses, but this should be the 
aim at the larger settlements and with in larger scale developments.   
11.8.  The idea of “20 -minute neighbourhoods”23 has been gaining momentum for several 
years.  Interest in this idea has grown as the COVID -19 pandemic meant people spent 
more time locally working at home, using public open space, an d walking and cycling.

FIGURE 16.  Features of 20 -minute neighbourhood24 
11.9.  The National Model Design Code makes clear that walking and cycling should be the 
first choice for short local journeys, particularly those of five miles or less.  Indeed, 
figures show that 43 % of journeys in the south west are under two miles – these shorter 
journeys offer the greatest potential for people to get out of their car and walk or cycle 
instead.25  Securing access to high quality public transport from new development is 
another impor tant way of promoting sustainable travel.

East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
229 65. Strategic Policy – Walking, cycling , and  public transport  
 
New development should  incorporate the features of  a “20 -minute neighbourhood” 
either within the site at larger scale development , or through links to features outside 
the site  for smaller scale development .  
 
Walking and cycling links should be prioritised in new development – such links 
should be  coherent, direct, safe, comfortable and attractive.  Cycle paths should be 
segregated from pedestrians to reduce the potential for conflict.  
 
New development should facilitate  access to high quality public transport  through  its 
location, layout, and , where necessary , contributions to public transport services 
and/or facilities  (e.g., bus stops, bus priority me asures) .  
 
It is recognised that opportunities to deliver this policy will be more challenging in rural 
areas compared to urban areas.  
 
Protecting transport sites and routes  
11.10.  Where there is robust evidence, the Local Plan  should identify and protect site s and 
routes which could be critical in developing infrastructure to widen transport choice and 
realise opportunities for large scale development.26  Such sites and routes could include 
park and ride/change sites, train stations and/or routes, bus priority measures, and 
walking/cycling routes.  The focus will be on protecting sites and routes that promote 
sustainable travel, consistent with national policy, but there may also be a need to 
protect land for road schemes that realise opportunities for large sca le development.  
Evidence27 indicates protecting the sites/routes listed in the following  policy,  but we are 
seeking comments on this through public consultation.   At the next stage (the 
‘publication’ Local Plan), the sites and routes that remain in this po licy will be shown on 
the Policies map.

66. Policy – Protecting transport sites and routes  
The following sites and routes  will be protected from other development :  
Strategic  cycle network schemes:  
 Seaton to Colyton  
 Feniton to Sidmouth  
 Clyst Valley Tr ail 
 Sidford to Sidbury  
Public transport:  
 Railway passing loops as necessary at Axminster; Honiton; and Whimple to 
Cranbrook  
 Bus priority route at A3052/A376 to M5 Junction 30  
 Park and Ride areas of search at A30/Heavitree Road corridor; A376/A4052 
Clyst St  Mary corridor; and A377 Cowley Bridge Road corridor  
 
Travel plans, Transport Statements and Transport Assessments  
11.11.  The spatial strategy and preferred policies that prioritise sustainable transport should 
limit the need to travel and offer a genuine choic e of transport modes.  Nevertheless, 
new development will still generate car travel, particularly given the rural nature of much 
of East Devon.  Therefore, it is important to include policies to ensure that new 
development addresses the impacts of developm ent on transport networks.  For 
example, western parts of East Devon in parti cular experience congestion at peak 
times, including at M5 junctions 29 and 30 , the A3052 corridor,  and the A376 
northwards from Exmouth, resulting in queuing and delay.  Although  outside of East 
Devon, the main road links in the eastern parts of Exeter suffer from congestion which 
affects those living and working in East Devon, particularly at peak times.  
11.12.  National policy states that all development that will generate significant amounts of 
movement should provide a travel plan and  be supported by a transport statement or 
transport assessment so that the likely impacts of proposals can be assessed.28  Travel 
plans are long -term management strategies for integrating proposals for sus tainable 
travel into the planning process.  Transport assessments are thorough assessments of 
the transport implications of development, whilst transport statements are a lighter -
touch approach where there are limited transport impacts.  “Significant” is not defined in 
national policy – our preferred policy approach is to set a threshold on when a transport 
statement or assessment and travel plan  is required, to provide greater certainty.  
Alternatively, it may be more appropriate not to set a threshold to allow greater 
flexibility.   We will gather evidence and consider public consultation responses before 
finalising this policy .

67. Policy – Travel Plans, Transport Statements, Transport 
Assessments  
 
Where development schemes, in the absence of mitigating acti ons, would 
generate substantive scales of additional vehicle movements planning permission 
will not be granted for development unless submissions are accompanied by a 
Transport Assessment and subsequent Travel Plan that identifies measures to 
secure new su stainable travel arrangements  taking into account:  
 the scale of the proposed development;  
 availability of public transport;  
 proximity to environmental designations; impact on promoting walking and 
cycling;  
 cumulative impacts of multiple developments in  the area; and  
 whether there are particular types of impacts  that require further evaluation . 
Through future work the plan will establish size or quantity thresholds at which 
policy will apply.  
 
Parking Standards  
11.13.  The NPPF sets out five issues to take int o account if setting local parking standards:  
 The accessibility of the development  
 The type, mix and use of development  
 The availability of and opportunities for public transport  
 Local car ownership levels  
 The need to ensure an adequate provision of spaces  for charging plug -in and 
other ultra -low emission vehicles.  
11.14.  We are preparing evidence to cover these issues, which will inform parking standards.  
As previously highlighted, whilst there are many settlements which offer good access to 
jobs, facilities and  services, overall East Devon is largely rural and car ownership levels 
are higher than the national average.  
11.15.  In order to promote cycling, new residential development should provide bicycle parking 
spaces.  
11.16.  In the UK, total emissions from surface transport  in 2019 were more t han one -fifth of the 
total UK Greenhouse Gas  emissions . Cars and vans account for 77.9% of surface 
transport emissions.29   In East Devon, total CO2 emissions from road transport in 2019 
were more than one -third of East Devon total CO2 e missions.  
                                            
 
 
29 The Sixth Carbon Budget Surface Transport : Sector -summary -Surface -transport.pdf (theccc.org.uk)  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
232 11.17.  The government announced its intention to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars 
and vans in the UK from 2030, and with all vehicles being 100% zero emissions from 
2035. Thus, the numbers of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles and electric vehicles a re 
expecting a significate increase in the next decade. EDDC will contribute to the 
reduction of emissions and support a low carbon future through smarter choices, 
including electric vehicle infrastructure . 
 
68. Policy – Parking standards  
Residential car park ing standards  
New residential developments will be required to provide parking provisions to an 
average of not less than 1.6 car parking spaces per dwelling a nd 2 cycle parking 
spaces per dwelling  (rounded up to the nearest whole number in individual 
appli cations). In town centres where there is access to public car parks and/or on -
street parking lower levels of parking and in exceptional cases where there are also 
very good public transport links, car parking spaces may not be deemed necessary.  
 
Electric V ehicle Charging points  
All new residential developments (for one or more new or replacement dwelling) will 
be required to pro vide Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging points, the E V charging points 
in accordance with the Building Regulations 2010  (Part S of Sch edule 1) and any 
other relevant latest Government guidance.  
  
Non-residential Parking Standard  
At this stage, we are still gathering evidence to inform detailed non -residential parking 
standards and policy. The proposed policy will set the parking standard  for different 
land use in East Devon.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
11.18.  The methodology for calculating the provision is based on guidance set out in 
Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) Residential Car Parking 
Research (May 2007)  and East Devon car ownership data from the census 2011. The 
calculation has considered the local car owners hip and the visitor space needs.  The 
result shows a minimum standard  of 1.6 parking spaces . For example, a development 
of 100 dwellings , 160  parking  spaces should be provided. In town centres where there 
is access to public car parks and/or on -street parking lower levels of parking and in 
exceptional cases where there are also very good public transport links, car parking 
spaces may not be deemed nece ssary.

11.19.  To facilitate the reduction in traffic congestion along main shopping streets it is an aim 
to improve rear service provision for shopping and commercial areas where 
opportunities for doing so arise.  This may involve improvements to existing highway s. 
 
69. Policy - Rear Servicing of Shopping/Commercial Development  
 
In determining applications for shopping and commercial developments, including 
redevelopment in town centres, development proposals, where possible, should seek 
to provide rear service acces s.  Adverse congestion, amenity or safety impacts will 
form material considerations in determining planning applications where dedicated 
service spa ce is not provided or available and could lead to refusal of planning 
permission  
 
Vehicular access to site s and land  
11.20.  Many new development schemes will need to have safe road and vehicle access and 
working with the relevant highway authority (Devon County council and/or National 
Highways) development proposals will be scrutinised to ensure safe and effective 
access can be achieved.  
 
70. Policy – Safe vehicular access to sites  
 
Where development proposals will attract or accommodate new or additional vehicles  
proposals for development must demonstrate how safe access will be achieved.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
234 Planning permission will not be granted where safe access to a site cannot be 
achieved.  
 
 
Aerodromes and Safeguarding  
11.21.  The Civil Aviation Authority has identified a safeguarded area around Exeter 
International Airport and Dunkeswell Airport in East Devon.  In addition, a further 
safeguarded area around a MoD facility in Mid Devon affects the Northern part of the 
plan area.  In these areas the Council will consult with the Civil Aviation Authority and 
airport operator s on planning applications for developments that could compromise 
operation and safety of the airfield,  in accordance with guidance set out in ODPM 
Circular 1/2003.  Built development involving high structures, buildings which may 
interfere with radio signals, or development which may create a bird strike hazard may 
be subj ect to restrictions  or refusal of planning permission .  
 
71. Policy - Aerodrome Safeguarded Areas and Public Safety Zones  
 
Within aerodrome safeguarded areas and the Public Safety Zones planning 
permission will not be granted for development that would prejud ice the safe 
operation of protected aerodromes or give rise to public safety concerns.  
Planning permission will not be granted for developments in the vicinity of an 
airport (or that could impact on safe operation of aeroplanes) that would 
compromise air s afety by creating physical obstructions that could interfere with 
flight paths or navigational aids.   
 
Built development involving high structures, buildings which may interfere with 
radio signals, or development which may create a bird strike hazard may be 
subject to restrictions.  
 
 
11.22.  Public Safety Zones have been identified by the Department for Transport on land 
adjoining the runways to Exeter International Airport.  A Public Safety Zone is an area 
within which the annual risk of fatality to a permanent  present individual due to an 
aircraft accident is not less than 1 in 100,000.  Within this area there is a smaller zone, 
where the individual fatality risk is 1 in 10,000. There is a general presumption against 
new or replacement development or changes of  use of existing buildings within Public 
Safety Zones. In particular no new or replacement dwellings, mobile homes, caravan 
sites or other residential buildings should be permitted within a Public Safety Zone.  
Other forms of development may be acceptable,  provided they do not reasonably 
expect to increase the number of people living, working or congregating in the area  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
235 Other transport  issues  
11.23.  The NPPF also states that planning policies should provide for any large -scale transport 
facilities that need to be located in the area; and recognise the importance of providing 
adequate overnight lorry parking facilities, taking into account any local shortages.  At 
the current time, there is a lack of evidence of these being particular issues in East 
Devon that shoul d be addressed in the Local Plan, but we  keep this under review as 
further evidence comes forward and  invite comments through public consultation to 
consider these points.  
Communications  
11.24.  The NPPF guides local authorities to facilitate the development of a  high-quality 
communications infrastructure in support of economic growth and social well -being. The 
NPPF makes clear that planning policies and decisions should support the expansion of 
electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technologies 
(such as 5G). Further, the NPPF sets out how these policies should be balanced with 
other considerations, including conserving and enhancing both the natural and historic 
environment.  
Digital Connectivity  
11.25.  East Devon faces challenges in deliver ing communications infrastructure in a rural area. 
East Devon is part of the Connecting Devon and Somerset (CDS) programme. CDS 
comes under the Government’s Superfast Broadband Programme to deliver next -
generation broadband infrastructure to areas where th e commercial market has failed to 
invest.  
11.26.  According to Ofcom, in 2021 89.5%30 of the address es in East Devon have super -fast 
broadband coverage and 35.7%31 have ultra -fast broadband coverage,  in comparison  
the mean for all English district local aut horities  are 94.55% and 48.02%.  
11.27.  East Devon District Council would support further digital connectivity and high -quality 
communications improvements in the district by liaising with delivery partners and 
operators in the area and supporting the community engagement  of their programmes.

236 72. Strategic policy – Digital Connectivity  
 
Planning permission for new development (size thresholds and development types at 
and which policy will apply need to be established)  will not be granted unless the 
scheme will have access t o superfast broadband and high -quality communications .  
Superfast broadband is looked upon as the fifth utility  and is identified as an essential 
requirement.  
 
All new  ducting to serve new developments must be installed with capacity for more 
than one prov ider and other provisions to enable the delivery of multi -operator fibre to 
the premises and sufficient mobile connectivity.  
 
Developers are encouraged to have early discussions with strategic providers or 
Connecting Devon and Cornwall  for major developmen t and continuing to support the 
expansion of full -fibre broadband connections in the district.   
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
11.28.  Paragraph 114 of the NPPF , planning policies and decisions should support the 
expansion of electronic communications n etworks, including next generation mobile 
technology (such as 5G) and full fibre broadband connections.  
11.29.  The Government launched a technical consultation seeking views on legislative 
proposals to ensure that new build homes have access to gigabit -capable co nnections. 
The consultation has closed for response in February 2022, and currently analysing the 
feedback. The policy should reflect the latest Government guidance.  
Wireless connectivity and te lecoms  infrastructure  
11.30.  Fast and reliable wireless connectivity and telecoms infrastructure supports the use of 
smart technology where people live, work, and travel.  Businesses rely on robust 
communications infrastructure to connect with their customers, suppliers, employees, 
and to ensure operational processes functi on efficiently. Wireless connectivity is reliant 
on a robust telecoms infrastructure including freestanding or building -based masts and 
antennas, ground based cabinets and compounds.  
11.31.  There are three types of planning permission that cover the installation of wireless and 
telecoms infrastructure in England:  
 permitted development with the requirement to notify;  
 permitted development with the requirement for prior approval;  
 planning permission that requires a planning application to be submitted to the 
releva nt planning authority.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
237 Where proposals require an assessment of the siting and appearance of development, 
the authority will rely on the policies of the Local Plan and on any local design codes or 
guidance to inform determination.  
11.32.  The provision of telecom s infrastructure is guided by The Code of Practice for Wireless 
Network Development in England (2022)*. The Code of Practice covers all forms of 
wireless infrastructure development, including telecommunications  masts and cabinets.  
11.33.  Applicants will be requi red to demonstrate how proposals accord with the principles of 
good practice established under The Code of Practice for Wireless Network 
Development in England (2022).  
 
* Code of practice for wireless network development in England - GOV.UK 
(www.gov.uk)  
 
73. Policy – Wireless connectivity  and telecoms infrastructure  
 
1. Proposals will only be permitted where they  accord with the principles of good 
practice for wireless network development, including, but not limited to:  
 Site sharing and use of existing infrastructure or buildings to house new 
development  
 Consultation with the local plan ning authority, local communities and other 
stakeholders  
 Considered siting and design, avoiding harm to landscape character, heritage, 
environment, and bio -diversity  
 Compliance with guidance laid out in the International Commission on Non -
Ionizing Radiatio n Protection (ICNIRP) public exposure levels guidance  
 
2. Proposals within AONBs or at sensitive locations must  provide a Landscape and 
Visual Impact Assessment and, where appropriate , a Heritage Impact 
Assessment.  
 
A condition will be imposed  to ensure the removal of equipment, supporting 
apparatus, and the restoration of the site to its former condition, or to a standard to be 
agreed with the Authority, as soon as reasonably practicable after it is no longer 
required for electronic communications purposes.  
Where appropriate, future permitted development rights will be restricted by condition 
to prevent harm to landscape character, heritage, environment, and bio -diversity . 
 
Justification for Policy  
11.34.  Section 10 of the NPPF sets out planning guidance for commu nications development in 
England, and states that advanced, high quality and reliable communications 
infrastructure is essential for economic growth and social well -being.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
238 11.35.  The Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) and the National Infrastructure 
Strategy set out the government's long -term strategy for meeting its digital connectivity 
targets and delivering high quality, reliable digital infrastructure that works across the 
UK. 
11.36.  The Code of Practice for Wireless Network Development in England (2022) c overs all 
forms of wireless infrastructure development, including mobile masts and cabinets. Led 
by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the Code of Practice 
was developed in collaboration with representatives of the mobile network industry, 
other government departments and public bodies, local planning authorities, and 
protected landscapes bodies. The Code of Practice replaces the previous Code of Best 
Practice on Mobile Network Development, which was published in 2016, and serves a s 
guidance for Local Plan Policy.  
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
239 Chapter 12.  Caring for our outstanding 
landscape   
 
12.1.  East Devon has a beautiful natural environment, which makes the District an attractive 
place to live and work. This environment also attracts visitors who contribute to the local 
economy.  
 
FIGURE 17.  East Devon’s outstanding landscape  
 
74. Policy  – Landscape Features   
East Devon’s l andscape, countryside and rural areas will be protected against 
harmful development. Development will only be permitted where the applicant is able 
to demonstrate tha t it will protec t and  enhance  features that contribute to the nature 
and quality of East Devon’s landscapes, in particular:  
a. trees (including individual trees, groups of trees and woodlands), 
hedgerows and field boundaries;  
b. irreplaceable habitats such as an cient woodland and aged or veteran trees 
found outside ancient woodland;  
c. best and most versatile agricultural land;  
d. rivers, tributaries and flood plains;  
e. other watercourse s and water bodies;  
f. seascapes and coastline;  
g. the landscape setting of settlements;  
h. topographical features;  
i. areas or features of cultural and historic value;  
j. important views and visually sensitive skylines;  
k. dark skies; and 
l. aesthetic and perceptual factors such as tranquillity , wildness, intactness, 
rarity and enclosure.  
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
240 The Council will s eek the retention of important hedgerows. Where retention is not 
possible and a proposal seeks the removal of a hedgerow, the Council will require 
compensatory planting with a mixture of native hedgerow species.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
12.2.  This overarching policy aims to protect important features in the landscape, whether 
designated or not.  The landscape of the District includes deep valleys, wooded hills, 
ancient woodlands, historic parkland, low -lying farmland, riverside meadows and a 
variet y of urban forms. The whole of East Devon is rich in biodiversity, including 
international, national and locally protected sites and habitats and forms a part of a 
wider ecological network across the County. Maintaining sustainable agricultural land 
and pr actices is important in preserving the district’s rural character and landscape.  
12.3.  Proposals should be accompanied by a Landscape Appraisal, which should be 
proportionate to the size and likely impacts of the scheme. Landscape Appraisals 
should be carried o ut in accordance with the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual 
Impact Assessment32 and successor documents. If the proposals require a full 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) then a Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment (LVIA) undertaken by a Chartered L andscape Architect will be required.  
 
75. Policy  - Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty  
The highest level of protection will be given to the landscape and scenic beauty of the  
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) in East Devon:  
 Development in an AONB , or outside but affecting its setting or appearance,  
will only be permitted where it conserves and enhances the character and 
natural beauty of the AONB;  
 Development in an AONB will only be permitted where it is appropriate to the 
economic and environmental  wellbeing of the area or promotes understanding 
or enjoyment of the AONB;  
 Major development in an AONB will only be permitted in exceptional 
circumstances and where it can be demonstrated to be in the public interest; 
and 
 Development proposals that could affect the special qualities of an AONB 
(including its setting or appearance ) either individually or in combination with 
other developments, should be accompanied by a proportionate Landscape 
and Visual Impact Assessment.  
AONB Management Plans will be a m aterial consideration in decision making.

Institute & IEMA, 2013)  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
241   
 
FIGURE 18.  East Devon has significant Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  
Justification for inclusion of policy  
12.4.  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty account for around two thirds of the District and 
cover a number of v illages as well as the small town of Budleigh Salterton. There are 
two AONBs in East Devon, the East Devon AONB occupies much of the south of the 
District, and the Blackdown Hills AONB (which although mostly in East Devon also 
extends into neighbouring mid  Devon and Somerset) covering much of the north of the 
District. It should be noted that a very tiny part of the Dorset AONB extends into the 
extreme east of the District. These areas have the highest level of landscape protection 
in England, equal to that  of National Parks and are designated by the Secretary of 
State, so the boundaries and statutory protection cannot be amended through the local 
plan process.  
12.5.  Policy is required to ensure that the District’s AONBs are protected and conserved in 
accordance with the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW Act) and the 
NPPF.  
 
 
76. Policy  - Coastal Preservation Areas   
Land around the coast and estuaries of East Devon, as identified on the Policies 
Map, is designated as a Coastal Preservation Area. Development  or any change of 
use will not be allowed if it would damage the undeveloped/open status of the 
designated area or where visually connected to any adjoining areas.  
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
242 The coastal Preservation Area is defined on the basis of visual openness and views 
to and f rom the sea . Appropriate proposals which increase public access to the coast 
will be supported.  
 
 
12.6.  The Coastal Preservation Area boundary is currently under review to take account of 
development and other changes wh ich have occurred since the boundary was  defined 
in the adopted  Local Plan. This will ensure that it continues to be based on visual 
openness and views to and from the sea.  As this work is not yet complete the Policies 
Map shows the currently adopted  CPA boundary but this may change.  
Justificati on for inclusion of policy  
12.7.  The majority of the coastline of East Devon is inscribed by UNESCO as being of 
international importance, recognised by its status as part of the Jurassic Coast World 
Heritage Site. Whilst the WHS was chosen for the outstanding va lue of its rocks, fossils 
and landforms the wider setting of the cliffs contribute significantly to the landscape 
(which is, itself, part of the landform). The NPPF (para. 174 c) requires local authorities 
to “maintain the character of the undeveloped coas t, while improving public access to it 
where appropriate”. Policy in the plan  protects the character of the undeveloped coast 
(including the WHS) and designates a Coastal Preservation Area. This local designation 
is based on a detailed character assessment  of undeveloped coast in terms of 
openness and views to and from the sea. (Note - the boundary of the CPA is currently 
under review) . 
 
77. Policy – Areas of Strategic Visual Importance  
 
Development proposals will only be permitted where they preserve the visua l 
integrity, identity and scenic quality of the District , in particular by conserving and 
enhancing key views and views of local landmarks . 
  
The following view types are considered to be particularly important:  
a. Landmark views to and from viewpoints and to urism and recreational 
destinations , including the coast, woodland and open countryside ; 
b. Views from publicly accessible areas which are wi thin, to and from 
settlements which contribute to the viewers’ enjoyment of the local area ; 
c. Views from public rights o f way and other publicly  accessible areas;  
d. Night -time views of dark skies, particularly where lighting is to be 
introduced in areas of low existing light pollution; and 
e. Views which include or otherwise relate to specific features relevant to East 
Devon an d its special qualities, such as key landmarks, heritage assets 
(either in view or the view from) and biodiversity features .  
 
Development proposals should  conserve and enhance sequential views, and not 
result in adverse cumulative impacts within views.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
243 Justification for inclusion of policy  
12.8.  The purpose of the policy is to ensure that development does not harm important views 
or landmarks, to encourage conservation and enhancement of key view types and 
patterns, and to ensure development does not detract from the visual integrity, identity 
and scenic quality that are characteristic of much of East Devon. Appropriate site based 
assessment should be undertaken in  accordance with the Landscape Institute & 
Institute of Environmental Managements most up to dat e guidelines for Landscape and 
Visual Impact Assessment33. A LVIA should be carried out in accordance with these 
guidelines, and should be proportionate to the size and likely impacts of the scheme. If 
the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of th e local planning authority that an 
LVIA is not required, a simple landscape assessment may be appropriate.  
 
12.9.  There are many sources of information which may inform the Assessment including The 
East Devon and Blackdown Hills Landscape Character Assessment ( 2019)34, What 
Makes a View (2013)35, the Devon historic environment record36, Village Design 
Statements, Conservation Area Character Appraisals and Management Plans, Local 
Landscape Character Assessments and Neighbourhood Plans may provide evidence 
on views a nd should inform development proposals. This information, together with 
essential field and desktop studies which are undertaken at an appropriate level to the 
application, should be provided at the earliest possible stage in the planning application 
proce ss and would form part of LVIA.  
 
78. Policy  – Green wedges  
Within Green Wedges, as defined on the Policies Map, development will not be 
permitted if it would conflict with the purposes of the Green Wedges, which are to:  
1. prevent the coalescence of settlements  and maintain a sense of place and 
identity for neighbourhoods  
2. maintain the open character of a green lung contributing to health and 
wellbeing for residents and visitors  
3. provide accessible formal and informal recreation, sport and play  space   
4. provide valu able wildlife corridors and habitat  
5. protect areas of landscape importance and visual amenity  
 
Within the Green Wedge s permission will only be granted for development where:  
a. it cannot be located elsewhere; and

244 b. it would not compromise, individually or cumul atively with other existing or 
proposed development, the integrity of the green wedge, either by 
diminishing its physical extent or through visual intrusion.  
Community, o pen sports , play  and recreational uses will be supported in principle . If 
granted, any  associated built development must be kept to a minimum, essential, 
small in scale and be necessary to support the main use. It should also be well 
related to adjacent built form  and sensitively located to retain openness of the area.  
 
Proposals for policy  compliant development that include measures that will create or 
enhance wildlife habitats and biodiversity within the Green Wedges, or will improve 
the quality of the Green Wedges by providing high quality public amenity space will 
be supported.  
 
 
12.10.  The G reen Wedge locations and boundaries are currently under review to take account 
of development and other changes which have occurred since the boundaries were 
defined in the adopted Local Plan. The review will ensure that the identities of 
settlements at ri sk of physical or visual coalescence are suitably protected  and ensure 
that Green Wedges are not so excessive as to unnecessarily restrict development that 
would otherwise  be acceptable .  As this work is not yet complete the Policies Map 
shows the currentl y adopted Green Wedge boundaries, excluding any sites now 
proposed for allocation, but noting the number and extent of green wedges may change 
following the review.  
Justification for inclusion of policy  
12.11.  Green wedges are a long -standing local landscape desi gnation that recognises the 
importance of maintaining open green networks between settlements in close proximity, 
for wildlife, flood storage capacity, leisure and recreation and preventing settlement 
coalescence in order to maintain a sense of place and i dentity for local communities. 
New buildings within the Green Wedge will be restricted to ensure that the openness, 
role and function of these landscapes are not adversely affected. There are a number of 
functions, supported by the NPPF, which they can ful fil: 
 Preventing the coalescence or merging of settlements and preserving the separate 
identity and character of settlements;  
 Providing a green lung into urban areas;  
 A recreational resource;  
 Protecting and enhancing ecological value and linkages;  
 Flood storage capacity.  
12.12.  Green wedges are identified on the p olicies  map (note - this map shows current green 
wedges,  excluding site allocations, but these are under review so the map is subject to 
change ).  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
245 12.13.  Proposals for new buildings will be assessed to ensure t hat they are proportionate in 
size and scale in relation to their intended use; in most circumstances, including 
proposals for new agricultural buildings, evidence may be required to demonstrate the 
requirement for a building of the size proposed.  
12.14.  Essentia l infrastructure, such as sewage or water connections, power sources, waste 
water recycling/treatment sites, electricity substations, emergency services or 
telecommunications will be permitted within the green wedge provided it must be 
situated in the loca tion proposed for connection purposes and the benefits will override 
the impact on the designation. Local transport infrastructure is defined as being 
infrastructure that must be situated in the location proposed such as a Park and Ride 
facility, new roads  and bridges.  
12.15.  Buildings for outdoor sport and recreation will include stabling for horses. Cemeteries, 
with ancillary buildings, and allotments are also acceptable in principle. The size and 
scale of these types of development will be judged on a site -by-site basis in relation to 
their intended use. The Council also recognises that there can sometimes be a need for 
outbuildings within residential properties because the size or location of the building falls 
outside of the remit of permitted development. Th ese types of buildings may be used for 
purposes incidental to the enjoyment of the dwelling house; it is not intended for the 
policy to provide new planning units or non -domestic uses within a residential site in the 
Green Wedge.  
12.16.  The Council supports, in p rinciple, the provision of new buildings for community use 
including educational facilities that can demonstrate a requirement for a Green Wedge 
location. This is likely to be due to the location of the community or facility in which it 
serves.  
12.17.  Economic g rowth in the Green Wedge, and the re -use of existing buildings for 
employment purposes is encouraged but new buildings will only be permitted in 
circumstances where the proposal supports the sustainable growth and expansion of an 
existing, authorised and v iable rural business. The need for the building and its Green 
Wedge location should be justified. New buildings for start -up businesses will not be 
permitted in the Green Wedge in order to avoid the proliferation of new buildings which 
are unconnected to e xisting sites and uses and may result in harm to the openness and 
landscape character.  
12.18.  Redevelopment of previously developed land, or replacement of lawful existing 
buildings, will be permitted where the development would not have a greater impact on 
the characteristics and attractiveness of the landscape and the purpose of including 
land within the Green Wedge than the existing development and also represents 
sustainable development. To avoid the replacement of shacks, caravans, sheds or other 
structures which, through the passage of time have blended into the landscape 
buildings must be of permanent and substantial construction.  
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
246 79. Policy – Land of Local Amenity Importance  or Local Green 
Space   
 
This policy will apply to Local Green Spaces, designated th rough Neighbourhood 
Development Plans or SPD (and identified on maps in those documents), and to the 
Land of Local Amenity Importance areas (as shown on the Policies  Map).  
 
Within the Local Green Space or Land of Local Amenity Importance areas, 
development  will be restricted to those limited types of appropriate development set 
out below, unless very special circumstances can be demonstrated.  
 
Appropriate development, compatible with the reasons for which the land was 
designated, is considered to be:  
1. provision of appropriate facilities for outdoor sport, outdoor recreation and for 
cemeteries, provided they do not conflict with the purpose of the LGS/LLAI 
designation;   
2. the extension or alteration of a building provided that it does not result in a 
dispropo rtionate addition over and above the size of the original building;   
3. the replacement of a building, provided the new building is in the same (or a 
preferable, community) use and not materially larger than the one it replaces.  
 
All development proposals s hould be carefully designed and managed to minimise 
visual impact, respect the reasons for which the site was designated, and ensure the 
continued integrity of the site.  
 
Development proposals outside LLAI or LGS,  but conspicuous when viewed from it, 
shou ld minimise any detrimental impacts to the visual amenity and respect reasons 
for which the site was designated. Development proposals which improve 
accessibility to, or enhance the use of L LAI/LGS  will be supported.   
 
Justification for inclusion of pol icy 
12.19.  The policies in this plan provide important protection to the natural environment within 
East Devon and are likely to help preserve the character and integrity of important 
green areas within and around the District. However, there is potential for development 
pressure to erode and impact upon smaller green areas which are particularly important 
to local communities. This policy seeks to give added protection against development to 
locally valued green areas or open spaces.    
12.20.  The Land of Local Amenity Importance designation will convey protection separate to 
(and in some cases in addition to) the Local Green Space designation which some East 
Devon communities have identified through Neighbourhood Plans.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
247 12.21.  Land of Local Amenity Importance is highly valued by local communities. The Local 
Plan recognises the particular visual, and other, importance of 14 sites within 5 of the 
District’s towns and restricts development that is not for a community purpose or that 
would undermine the open character of the area. The sites are deemed to be locally 
significant, with opportunities of enhancement to provide multiple benefits, including 
improved water quality, access, biodiversity, recreational, health and educational 
benefits.  
12.22.  The designation of land as Local Green S pace through local and neighbourhood plans 
allows communities to identify and protect green areas of particular importance to them. 
Designating land as Local Green Space should be consistent with the local planning of 
sustainable development and complement  investment in sufficient homes, jobs and 
other essential services. As outlined in national policy, Local Green Space designation 
should only be  used where the green space is  in reasonably close proximity to the 
community it serves; Demonstrably special to  a local community and holds a particular 
local significance, for example because of its beauty, historic significance, recreational 
value, tranquillity or richness of wildlife; and local in  character and is not an extensive 
tract of land.  
12.23.  As additional Local Green Spaces may be identified during the life of the Local Plan it is 
not possible to identify these areas on the Policies Map, but the policy will apply to LGS 
in made Neighbo urhood Plans and SPD.  
12.24.  Development within, or in close proximity to the Loca l Green Space  or Land of Local 
Amenity Importance , should respect reasons for which the site was designed and 
minimise any impacts on it.    
Contaminated Land and its Remediation  
12.25.  East Devon is fortunate in not having large amounts of contaminated land but where 
present the safe decontamination of such land can be a desirable outcome that 
development can help facilitate.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
248 80. Policy - Contaminated Land  
Where it is anticipated that contamination may be present on or near to a 
development site, the granti ng of planning permission will require that a contaminated 
land assessment is submitted.  The assessment must:  
a) Identify and characterise the contamination;  
b) Identify the risks; and  
c) Identify remediation and/or mitigation measures.  
Where identified a s necessary, agreed measures must be taken to remediate the site 
prior to or during development.  
Development on or in close proximity to active or former waste sites will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that there will be no harm to future o ccupiers 
of the site from leachate or landfill gas or other waste arising.  
 
12.26.  The natural and local environment of East Devon will be enhanced by remediating and 
mitigating despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated or unstable land.  The effective 
re-use of land that has been previously developed (brownfield land) will be encouraged.  
An application for planning permission  must demonstrate that the site is suitable for its 
new use, taking into account the ground conditions, natural hazards or former activ ities, 
the proposals for remediation or mitigation and impacts on the natural environment.  As 
an absolute  minimum, after remediation, land must not be capable of being determined 
contaminated land under Part 2a of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.  
Potentially Hazardous Developments  
12.27.  Certain sites and pipelines are designated as notifiable installations by virtue of the 
quantities of hazardous substance stored or used.  The Plan area already contains a 
number of high -pressure natural gas pipelines and o ther sites where hazardous 
substances are stored or used.   
 
81. Policy - Potentially Hazardous Developments and Notifiable 
Installations  
Proposals for development within a notified consultation zone around a hazardous 
installation will be permitted only if t here is no health and safety risk to that 
development.  
 
12.28.  Whilst they are subject to stringent controls under existing health and safety legislation it 
is considered prudent to control the kinds of development permitted in the vicinity of 
notified consulta tion zones.  For this reason the Planning Authority has been advised, East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
249 by the Health and Safety Executive, of consultation distances for each of these 
installations. Planning permission for development involving the use, movement or 
storage of a hazardous s ubstance will not be granted if it would increase the risk to the 
health and safety of users of the site, neighbouring land or the environment.  
Pollution control  
12.29.  Pollution in the environment has significant implications for people's health and quality 
of life.  The possible pollution effects from proposed development can be a material 
consideration in determining planning applications in  so far as they affect development 
and the use of land.  Where the Council considers a proposal may raise such issues the 
relevant statutory pollution control authorities will be consulted at an early stage.  
 
82. Policy - Control of Pollution  
Permission will not be granted for development which would result in unacceptable 
levels, either to residents or the wider environment of:  
1. Pollution of the atmosphere by  gas or particulates, including:  smell, fumes, dust, 
grit, smoke and soot.  
2. Pollution of surface or underground waters including:  
a) Rivers, other watercourses, water bodies and wetlands.  
b) Water gathering grounds inclu ding water catchment areas, aquifers and 
groundwater protection areas.  
c) Harbours, estuaries or the sea.   
3. Noise and/or vibration.  
4. Light intrusion, where light overspill from street lights or floodlights on to areas not 
intended to be lit, particula rly in areas of open countryside and areas of nature 
conservation value.  
5.    Fly nuisance.  
6. Pollution of sites of wildlife value, especially European designated sites or 
species.  
7.    Odour.  
 
 
12.30.  Where a development proposal may raise potential polluti on outcomes the relevant 
statut ory pollution control authority  will be consulted at an early stage.  Wi thin the 
powers available to it  the Council will control and reduce pollution in the environment.  
Where external lighting is required as part of a devel opment proposal full details of the East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
250 proposed lighting scheme will be required to demonstrate that this is the minimum 
needed for security and working purposes and minimises light pollution from glare and 
spillage (particularly in areas of open countryside and areas of nature conservation 
value) and that it will not detract from residential amenity or highway safety.  Pollution or 
nuisance caused by new developments can have significant implications for the health 
and quality of life of residents.  Decision on planning applications will seek to control 
and reduce environmental impacts or detriment to health or amenity. In particular:  
a) Existing developments must not be put at risk from unacceptable levels of soil, air, 
water or noise pollution arising from a  new development.  
b) New development must be appropriate for the location and the effects of pollution 
on health, the natural environment and amenity will be taken into account.  
c) An increase in noise level shall not give rise to significant adverse impac ts on 
health, quality of life, or, where appropriate, tranquillity.  
d) The cumulative impacts on air quality shall be taken into account, and 
developments within Air Quality Management Areas shall be consistent with the 
local air quality action plan.  
e) The impact of pollution from artificial light on local amenity, intrinsically dark 
landscapes and nature conservation shall be minimised.  
 
12.31.  Where a development proposal may raise potential pollution outcomes the relevant 
statutory pollution control authority will be consulted at an early stage.  Within the 
powers available to it the Council will control and reduce pollution in the environment.  
Where external lighting is required as part of a development proposal full details of the 
proposed lighting scheme wi ll be required to demonstrate that this is the minimum 
needed for security and working  purposes and minimises light pollution from glare and 
spillage (particularly in areas of open countryside and areas of nature conservation 
value) and that it will not de tract from residential amenity or highway safety.   
Best and most versatile agricultural land  
12.32.  East Devon  contains a substantial amount of agricultural land, much of which is of high 
quality. Some of the areas of highest quality land are in close proximity  to settlements 
where pressures for development are amongst the greatest. Local Plan policy 
specifically seeks to conserve and protect the high est grades of agricultural land though 
this aspiration is balanced against the recognition of the need to accommo date 
development . 
 
83. Policy -   Development on High Quality Agricultural Land  
The best and most versatile agricultural land (Grades 1, 2 and 3a) will be protected 
from development not associated with agriculture or forestry. Unless allocated for 
development  under another plan policy Planning permission for development affecting 
such land will only be granted if there is an overriding need for the development and 
either:  
1. Sufficient land of a lower grade (Grades 3b, 4 and 5) is unavailable or available 
lower grade land has an environmental value recognised by a statutory wildlife, East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
251 historic, landscape or archaeological designation and outweighs the agricultural 
considerations. Or  
2. The benefits of the development ju stifies and clearly outweighs the loss of  high 
quality agricultural land.  
If best and most versatile land needs to be developed and there is a choice between 
sites in different grades, land of the lowest grade available must be used except 
where other sustainability considerations, including int rinsic nature conservation value 
of a site, outweigh land quality issues . 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
252 Chapter 13.  Protecting and enhancing our 
outstanding biodiversity  and geodiversity  
 
13.1.  East Devon benefits from an exceptional abundance of biodiversity and geodiversity 
interest. From our Int ernationally Designated Sites to our extensive network of priority  
habitats and protected species, East Devon recognise the value of these resources for 
nature conservation, health and wellbeing, education, climate change mitigation, flood 
risk management,  air and water purification and the economy.  
13.2.  Our biodiversity and geodiversity is intrinsically linked to and often threatened by a 
range of factors, including climate change, agriculture, pollution, land use change, 
urbanisation and increasing human popul ations. These impacts can arise through 
complex direct and indirect mechanisms.  
13.3.  The value and importance of wildlife and the natural world is increasingly recognised by 
Government, as evidenced by the Environment Act 2021, which itself followed on from 
the Government paper ‘A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment’ 
– see

Biodiversity value and importance  
13.4.  The policies of this new local plan seek  to protect existing features of biodiversity val ue, 
increase protection of biodiversity features, enhance and expand existing features of 
biodiversity value, improve the quality and accuracy of ecological information submitted 
for assessment, and improve avoidance, mitigation and compensation outcomes 
resulting from permissions.  
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
253 Protection of wildlife sites  
13.5.  Many sites are protected on account of their intrinsic importance and value for the 
wildlife they support.  At the highest level sites can be national designated and there is 
considerable legal prote ction that is afforded to them, though such protection is 
expanded on and further articulated through planning policy.  There are, however also 
local sites that are afforded wildlife protection.  
 
84. Policy – Protection of Internationally and Nationally import ant 
wildlife sites  
 
Protection of Internationally and Nationally important wildlife sites  and locally 
important sites  
Proposals and plans that would cause a direct or indirect adverse effect upon 
internationally and nationally designated sites will not be  permitted unless all of the 
following criteria are met:  
1. They cannot be located on alternative sites that would cause less or no harm.  
2. The public benefits of the proposal clearly outwe igh the impacts on the features  
of the site and the wider network of nat ural habitats and designated sites.  
3. Suitable avoidance, mitigation and compensation measures are proposed, in 
accordance with the mitigation hierarchy.  
4. Where permanent or long -term temporary habitat loss or direct reduction of 
habitat condition is identifi ed, suitable biodiversity net gain of at least 20% is 
proposed, which should be ecologically relevant and connected to the site 
affected as to not result in a net reduction of the condition of the site.  
5. In respect of internationally designated sites, the i ntegrity of the site will be 
maintained.  
 
Sites falling under this aspect of policy include : 
 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)  
 Special Protection Areas (SPA)  
 Proposed SACs  
 Potential SPAs  
 Ramsar sites  
 Areas secured as compensation for damage to an interna tionally or nationally 
designated site  
 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)  
 Marine Conservation  Zones (MCZ)  
 National Nature Reserves (NNR)  
 
It should be noted that there is also specific policy, where applicable, in this plan in 
respect of Habitats  Regulation Assessment requirements.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
254  
Protection of Regionally and Locally important wildlife sites and features  
Development proposals that would cause a direct or indirect adverse effect upon 
Regionally and Locally important wildlife sites and features w ill not be supported 
unless all of the following criteria are met:  
1. They cannot be located on alternative sites that would cause less or no harm.  
2. The public benefits of the proposal clearly outweigh the impacts on the features 
of the site and the wider netw ork of natural habitats and designated sites.  
3. Suitable avoidance, mitigation and compensation measures are proposed, in 
accordance with the mitigation hierarchy. Destruction of habitats of principle 
importance should be avoided as fully as possible. When d estruction of these 
habitats is proposed, proof of there being no satisfactory alternative should be 
provided. Suitable mitigation and compensation measures should then be 
identified.  
4. Where permanent or long -term temporary habitat loss or direct reduction of 
habitat condition is identified, suitable biodiversity net gain of at least 20% is 
proposed.  
 
Such sites include:  
 Local Nature Reserves (LNR)  
 County Wildlife Sites (CWS)  
 Special verges  
 Habitats of Principle Importance, as listed under Section 41 of the Natural 
Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006 (identified through site 
survey work or as identified through existing mapped resources)  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.6.  Statutory designated wildlife sites (those of international and nati onal importance) 
benefit from substantial protection under national legislation. This local plan policy does 
not seek to duplicate existing protecti ons, but does provide  clarification as to existing 
legislation and government guidance, and seeks to add det ail on when impacts may be 
permitted, expectation of enhancement of biodiversity interest, and an indication of 
which designations are included within the policy scope.  
13.7.  A more specific Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) policy is included in this 
chapt er detailing requirements for HRA and existing East Devon mitigation strategies 
relating to impacts on European sites.  
13.8.  Non-statutory sites (those of regional and local importance) benefit from little protection 
under national legislation, and typically rel y on local planning policy and the NPPF for 
protection. The council  recognizes the biodiversity value and strategic importance of 
locally designated sites of ecological importance, as well as and priority habitats. These 
features and areas are ecologically  important, are often irreplaceable, and will play a 
major part in ecosystem resilience and nature recover y in coming years. T he value  is East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
255 recognized  of these often -fragmented habitats within the current biodiversity crisis, and 
seeks to afford these featur es with a high level of policy protection and consideration 
within the planning process.  This local plan policy provides clarification as to when 
impacts may be permitted, expectation of enhancement of biodiversity interest, and an 
indication of which desi gnations are included within the policy scope.  
Irreplaceable habitats and important features  
13.9.  Whilst many sites are designated for the species and habitats the support there are also 
areas and features that are not specific designated and have not necessar ily been 
surveyed and assessed but none the less are of great importance to wildlife interest.  Of 
particular importance and value are trees and hedgerows and plan policy seeks to 
afford specific protection to these assets.  
 
85. Policy – Protection of irreplac eable habitats and important 
features  
 
Ancient Woodland, Veteran Trees, and other irreplaceable habitats  
Proposals which result in the destruction or degradation of irreplaceable habitats will 
be refused, unless an absolutely exceptional reason and except ional 
mitigation/compensation strategy exists. This includes impacts through direct or 
indirect pathways, including lighting and pollution. The evidence burden for this would 
be high.  
 
Such habitats include ancient woodland, ancient and veteran trees (with in and 
outside of ancient woodland), very mature trees showing early signs of veteranisation, 
blanket bog, mires, sand dunes, salt marsh and lowland fen.  
 
Hedgerows  
Important hedgerows (as defined by the Hedgerow Regulations 1997) are considered 
to have ve ry high intrinsic biodiversity value. Proposals resulting in the loss of 
important hedgerows, or sections of important hedgerows, will only be permitted 
where the mitigation hierarchy has been applied and evidenced in earnest.  
 
Impacts should first be avo ided, and where this is not possible, justification for 
impacts should be provided in full. Following this, suitable avoidance and mitigation 
measures should be proposed, followed by compensation measures as a last resort.  
 
With all hedgerows types, hedge row translocation should always be considered first, 
as a preferential option to hedgerow destruction followed by compensation.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
256 Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.10.  Some habitats are considered to be irreplaceable due to the fact that they are  incredi bly 
technically difficult (or take a very significant amount of time) to restore, recreate or 
replace once destroyed, taking into account their age, uniqueness, species diversity or 
rarity. Planning permission will not be granted for proposals which could result in the 
destruction or degradation (through direct or indirect impacts) of irreplaceable habitats, 
unless an absolutely exceptional reason and exceptional mitigation/compensation 
strategy exists, as per section 180c of the NPPF 2 021.  
13.11.  An exceptional reason could include nationally significant infrastructure projects, or 
development which is clearly in the public (not private) interest, but only where the 
benefit is substantial and clearly outweighs the harm to receptor. A suitable, exceptional 
mitigat ion strategy would still be required in any circumstance where habitat 
degradation or destruction is proposed. Natural England will be consulted where these 
impacts are proposed.  
13.12.  Hedgerows are incredibly valuable biodiversity resources, which often come un der 
threat by development. Devon boasts the largest hedgerow network in England. East 
Devon’s Hedgerows are typically very old, and contain specific soil conditions, 
understorey vegetation communities and structural niches. These conditions support a 
wide range of wildlife, including protected and notable species. These factors are 
difficult and sometimes impossible to recreate once lost. It is therefore imperative to 
protect and enhance these features, and promote their appropriate consideration during 
the planning process, including promoting the proper application of the mitigation 
hierarchy.  
13.13.  Compensatory hedgerow planting takes a considerable amount of time to establish 
(more than 10 years) and leads to varied results. Where appropriate, translocation o f 
existing hedgerows can decrease establishment time, retains some of the original soil 
conditions and biota, retains some ecological niches, retains the understorey seed bank 
- resulting in a better quality hedgerow following works. The council will suppo rt and 
promote hedgerow translocation, rather than replacement.  
Habitat Regulation Assessment  
13.14.  The most significant wildlife sites in East Devon benefit from an international 
designation and for these sites and where adverse impacts may be possible from 
development there is a need for assessment under the Habitat Regulations to 
determine the acceptability of proposals.  Plan policy set out details of the approach to 
be taken.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
257 86. Policy – Habitats Regulations Assessment  
 
HRA process and requirements  
Proposed plans or projects must not adversely affect the integrity of sites protected 
under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017. These sites 
consist of:  
1. Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)  
2. Special Protection Areas (SPA)  
3. Proposed SACs  
4. Potential  SPAs  
5. Ramsar sites  
6. Areas secured as sites compensating for damage to a European site  
 
The proponent of the plan or proposal must provide all necessary information to allow 
the planning authority to carry out Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) of the 
proposal.  
 
Where potential adverse impacts are identified, suitable avoidance, mitigation and 
compensation measures will be required. The mitigation hierarchy and precautionary 
principle should be applied and evidenced by proponents when assessing impacts, 
and proposing avoidance, mitigation and compensation measures.  Mitigation 
measures are to be secured for the lifetime of the proposed impact. In practice, this 
often means that mitigation measures have to be secured in perpetuity.  Legislation 
and governmen t guidance requires the planning authority to be confident beyond 
reasonable scientific doubt that the proposals will not result in an adverse effect on 
the integrity of the site. Consequently, we will require evidence of a high quality and 
accuracy to inf orm HRA.  
 
Adverse impacts that cannot be avoided or adequately mitigated will not be permitted 
other than in exceptional circumstances.  
 
Specific HRA mitigation strategies and guidance  
 
Plans and proposals should take into consideration and be in accordanc e with the 
latest versions of all council and wider HRA guidance documents and strategies. 
These documents and strategies are intended to inform HRA assessment and 
mitigation requirements, improve the quality of proposals and provide a strategic 
Council  response to carrying out HRA and providing coherent mitigation, where 
applicable. These documents include (existing and pending production):  
 South -East Devon European Sites Mitigation Strategy (existing  – undergoing 
review ) 
 Beer Quarry Caves SAC Guidance Doc ument (existing)  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
258  Exmouth Imperial Recreation Ground Events Protocol (existing)  
 River Axe SAC Mitigation Strategy  (proposed)  
 
The South -East Devon European Sites Mitigation Strategy (SEDESMS)  
Of particular note is SEDESMS. In respect of the Exe Estuary SPA and the East 
Devon Pebblebed Heaths SPA/SAC (and Dawlish Warren SAC in Teignbridge 
District) an over -arching strategic approach to HRA mitigation has been established. 
All residential development schemes within a straight line 10 kilometers distance of 
any part of the European sites will be required to provide mitigation to offset increased 
recreational pressure associated with new development. Developers must clearly 
demonstrate that mitigation can and will be provided to ensure no adverse effect on 
the in tegrity of the European sites, and identify and secure mechanisms through 
which delivery will be achieved, secured in perpetuity, and delivered within agreed 
timescales. All mitigation is to be delivered in accordance with the latest version of the 
strateg y and supporting guidance.  
Mitigation will include on -site and off -site measures, to include:  
 Improved wardening and management of sites;  
 Information and education;  
 Changes to access arrangements and points;  
 Habitat improvements and provision ; and  
 Provisi on of Suitable Alternative Natural Green Space (SANGS).  
Current key EDDC policy requirements for SANGS are  
 8ha of SANGS are required to be provided per 1000 new population  
 SANGS are required to be provided and fully operational in advance of 
housing occup ation  
 Securement of financial contributions in perpetuity are required from the 
developer to ensure ongoing maintenance and replacement of SANGS 
infrastructure, to ensure continued functioning of the SANGs in perpetuity.  
SEDESMS is currently undergoing rev iew. The review of SEDESMS will evaluate 
mitigation provided to date, set defined HRA compliant mitigation standards and 
inform future revisions of this new local plan policy - to be incorporated during 
development of this new local plan.  
The SEDESMS revi ew will seek to review the suitability of the above SANGS 
requirements and provide amendments where considered necessary to ensure HRA 
compliance. The review will also seek to add clarity in relation to:  
 What size of development will be required to provide  their own SANGS  
 Policy HRA requirements for developments which do not meet the 
minimum threshold (i.e., financial contributions towards strategic SANGS)  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
259  Enforcement of the “polluter pays principle” – such as requirement for 
developers to own provided SANG S and not offload burdens onto other 
parties. This includes arrangements which seek to place ongoing 
management costs onto parish or district councils.  
Specific HRA policy requirements in relation to avoiding, mitigating and 
compensating for HRA impacts  
 
Nutrient neutrality and r equired water efficiency measures from proposals in 
the River Axe SAC catchment, as a result of HRA requirements and nutrient 
neutrality.  
 
In order to reduce phosphate discharge into the River Axe SAC, East Devon District 
Council r equires development  proposals  within the River Axe catchment to 
demonstrate how nutrient neutrality will achieved.  The Council will seek to provide 
mitigation measures that developers can buy into, or mitigation can be secured 
through other provider’s ser vices or directly through or by development.  
 
Water efficiency measures can form a positive way to help work toward and could in 
exceptional cases secure nutrient neutrality and are required to be incorporated into 
all new dwellings, overnight accommodatio n, and any other proposals which result in 
grey water and/or black water discharge where waste water efficiency measures 
could be applied.  
 
Protection of Beer Quarry Cave SAC bat pinch points between Seaton and 
Colyford, and between Colyford and Colyton  
 
In order to protect the pinch points and secure their long term suitability for the SAC 
bat species, planning permission will not be supported for any development proposals 
within the pinch points, and the council will not support any applications which re duce 
the quality of the bat foraging and commuting habitats within these pinch points. The 
objective is for these pinch points to be retained in perpetuity, and enhanced where 
possible in order to guard against potential future development pressure  
 
Devel opment within 400 m of the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths SPA  
 
Predation of birds by domestic cats is already identified as a particular concern on the 
East Devon Pebblebed Heaths. Any increase in the number of homes could result in 
increased cat numbers, whi ch would further exacerbate adverse impacts and 
predation. To help preserve the integrity of the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths, 
specifically on account of the impacts of domestic cats through bird predation, new 
dwellings will not be allowed on or within 400  meters  of the Pebblebed Heaths.  
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
260 Justification for inclusion of policy  
Habitat Regulations Assessment  
13.15.  As a Competent Authority, the planning authority  has a duty to carry out Habitats 
Regulations Assessments (HRA), in accordance with the Conservation o f Habitats and 
Species Regulations 2017 (as amended) and the Conservation of Offshore Marine 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended). European Sites and European 
Offshore Marine Sites identified under these regulations are referred to as ‘habita ts 
sites’. These are sites of international importance for wildlife.  
East Devon Contains 6 Habitats sites:  
 Exe Estuary Special Protection Area (SPA) (also a RAMSAR site)  
 East Devon Pebblebed Heath Special Area of Conservation (SAC)  
 Beer Quarry and Caves S AC 
 River Axe SAC  
 Sidmouth to West Bay SAC  
 Lyme Bay and Torbay SAC  
 
 
FIGURE 20.  Low tide on the Exe Estuary /the sea  
13.16.  All plans and projects (including planning applications) which are not directly connected 
with, or necessary for, the conservation management of a habi tats site, require 
consideration of whether the plan or project is likely to have significant effects on that 
site. This consideration – referred to as the ‘Habitats Regulations Assessment 
Screening’ – should take into account the potential effects both of  the plan/project itself 
(direct and indirect) and in combination with other plans or projects. Where the potential 
for likely significant effects cannot be excluded, the council must make an Appropriate 
Assessment of the implications of the plan or projec t for that site, in view the site’s 
conservation objectives.  Natural England are a statutory consultee on all Appropriate 
Assessments. Planning permission may be granted for a plan or project only after 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
261 having ruled out adverse effects on the integrity of  the habitats site. Where an adverse 
effect on the site’s integrity cannot be ruled out, and where there are no alternative 
solutions, the plan or project can only proceed if there are imperative reasons of over -
riding public interest and if the necessary avoidance, mitigation or compensation 
measures can be secured.  
13.17.  This policy is proposed to provide clarity to proponents of plans or projects as to the 
specificities of HRA, and the evidence burden required of them. The policy details 
specific proposed poli cy elements which avoid and mitigate impacts on specific habitats 
sites.  
13.18.  The South -East Devon European Sites Mitigation Strategy (SEDESMS)  
13.19.  In respect of the Exe Estuary and the Pebblebed Heaths (and Dawlish Warren in 
Teignbridge) an over -arching strategic  approach to habitat mitigation measures has 
been established. All residential development schemes within a straight line 10 
kilometres distance of any part of the SAC and/or SAC designated areas of the Exe 
Estuary or Pebblebed Heaths will be required to p rovide mitigation. The onus will rest 
on developers demonstrating that mitigation can and will be provided and granting of 
planning permission will be linked to clear evidence that delivery will actually happen to 
agreed timescales.  
13.20.  The South -East Devon E uropean Site Mitigation Strategy and associated assessments 
will typically negate the need for residential development schemes to be subject to 
individual Appropriate Assessment. Through this strategic approach monies collected 
through CIL, negotiated sepa rately through Section 106 agreements and/or potentially 
otherwise paid or contributed through other means will address mitigation requirements.  
13.21.  Non-residential development schemes within the 10 kilometres catchment (and 
potentially beyond) will need to be  subject to project level assessment to establish 
potential need for and form of any mitigation. The Council has commissioned technical 
advice in respect of tourism accommodation development that will parallel that for 
residential schemes.  
13.22.  Mitigation measu res identified as “infrastructure” will require payment as part of the CIL 
contribution. This will typically be the expected approach for such mitigation and this  
will form the first draw on CIL funds. However, mitigation will also require measures 
identi fied as “non -infrastructure”, such as the provision of staff. Therefore, the Strategic 
approach to mitigation includes both on -site and off -site measures, to include:  
 • Improved wardening and management of sites;  
 • Information and education;  
 • Changes t o access arrangements and points;  
 • Habitat improvements and provision ; and  
 • Provision of Suitable Alternative Natural Green Space (SANGS).  
13.23.  On-site (referring to the protected sites) mitigation measures are combined with off -site 
provision in the form of SANGS. SANGS are required to achieve  a target level of 
provision of 8 hectares of open space provision for every net new 1,000 residents 
accommodated through development. At a residential density averaged at 2.2 persons East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
262 per each new home built this will  equate to around 176 SqM of SANGS space per each 
net extra dwelling. However actual space standards will depend on the quality, 
character and location of provision.  
13.24.  SANGS will need to include substantial open space areas ideally of semi -natural 
character  and should specifically be appealing to dog walkers. They can utilise land 
previously inaccessible to the public or arise from improvements of currently accessible 
but under -used spaces. SANGS sites are required to encompass land acquisition, 
establishmen t and provision of ongoing management in perpetuity. Schemes which look 
to utilise service charges or increases in resident precepts will not be considered.  
13.25.  To help ensure and secure timely delivery of mitigation, specifically SANGS, the Council 
has the op tion of exercising Compulsory Purchase Order powers to ensure availability 
of land.  
13.26.  Developments on the western side of the District – including in the West End, Ottery St 
Mary, Budleigh Salterton, and Sidmouth will all fall under the coverage of this poli cy. 
13.27.  To help preserve the integrity of the East Devon Pebblebeds Heath, specifically on 
account of the impacts of domestic cats through bird predation, new residential uses will 
not be allowed on or within 400 metres of the Pebblebed Heaths Special Protecti on 
Area.  
13.28.  The mitigation proposals, including those of the ‘South -east Devon European Site 
Mitigation Strategy’, must provide for mitigation in perpetuity to ensure that development 
does not have a net adverse impact on the integrity of European designated wildlife 
sites. This will include provision of on -site, off -site and cross -site measures and 
monitoring. Provision of developer -led SANGS are required to be fully implemented 
ahead of development being occupied, in order to deliver mitigation ahead of impa ct. 
Strategic SANGS delivered by the local authority will be commensurate with the levels 
of housing growth.  
13.29.  The delivery and success of mitigation will be monitored alongside development 
(specifically new housing development) and changes in population. Wh ere mitigation 
lags behind development it will be a potential indicator that the worth and integrity of 
European sites could be being eroded. This will provide a policy basis and justification 
for resisting further development or occupation until effective  mitigation is delivered in 
accordance with past development/occupancy.  
13.30.  A review of SEDESMS is currently being undertaken. The findings of this review will be 
used to further inform and revise this policy, as per the wording of the policy text.  
River Axe SAC Waste Water Efficiency Measures  
13.31.  The River Axe Special Area of Conservation (SAC) is being negatively impacted by 
poor water quality, largely due to increased phosphate levels. Proposals which result in 
increased phosphate levels in the River Axe SAC re quire HRA, with mitigation of the 
proposed increases in phosphate levels being secured in perpetuity through the HRA 
process. Such proposals include new residential units and overnight accommodation, 
as well as many others. This will be described and addre ssed fully in the proposed East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
263 River Axe HRA Mitigation Strategy document. As part of this strategy, East Devon 
District Council are required to follow the mitigation hierarchy and apply a precautionary 
approach to carrying out HRA, within policy, strategy and  when carrying out individual 
HRAs.  
13.32.  In terms of new proposals, the increases in phosphate loading of the River Axe SAC are 
from two sources – increased surface water runoff, and increased grey and black water 
discharge. East Devon District Council therefor e require all new proposals within the 
River Axe SAC catchment to have water efficiency measures incorporated to all new 
dwellings, overnight accommodation, and any other proposals which result in grey water 
and/or black water discharge. This reduces the a mount of grey and black water (and 
thus phosphate) discharged from waste water treatment works as a result of 
development, in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy, i.e., avoiding and reducing 
impacts prior to mitigating and compensating for impacts.  
13.33.  Whilst the above regulatory procedures under the Habitat Regulations do not apply to 
other rivers in East Devon the council are, none the less, aware of and concerned by 
high nutrient levels across watercourses in East Devon and the adverse impacts they 
are causing.  We will therefore carefully assess development proposals and planning 
application in respect of any possible increases in nutrient levels that could occur and 
will encourage measures to protect and where possible enhance water quality.  
Beer Quarr y Caves SAC Pinch Points  
13.34.  The areas of semi -natural habitats between the northern edge of Seaton and Colyford, 
and between Colyford and Colyton are known commuting routes for the three species of 
bats which form the qualifying features of the Beer Quarry an d Caves SAC (greater 
horseshoe, lesser horseshoe and Bechstein’s bats). These areas consist of mosaics of 
commuting and foraging features suitable for use by these species, and are used to 
facilitate dispersal into the wider landscape, as well as foraging.  
13.35.  These pinch points are limited in size due to urban encroachment. Further restriction of 
these pinch points could severely impact on the movement of the SAC bat species in 
the local area and hinder dispersal to important roosts in the wider landscape and local 
foraging resources such as Seaton Marshes. Development within the pinch points is 
likely to irreversible.  
Biodiversity Net Gain  
13.36.  Biodiversity net gain is the principle that the net result (the end position) after 
development had occurred is that the b iodiversity or wildlife value is greater than that of 
any site that is being developed.  The Government support biodiversity net gain and in 
East Devon we recognise the importance and are seeking to exceed minimum national 
levels.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
264 87. Policy – Biodiversity Ne t Gain  
 
Develo pment proposals will need to r esult in a Biodiversity Net Gain  of at least 20% , to be 
calculated and reported in ac cordance with published best practice local and national 
guidelines  at the time of the application (except where published exem ptions apply, de 
minimis or otherwise).  
 
This is in recognition of:  
 The combined biodiversity and climate emergency  
 The large volume of development predicted within the district (particularly within the 
west end of the district) during the period of this l ocal plan, and the potential 
significant biodiversity impact of this volume of development  
 Requirement to identify measures to further the biodiversity objective under the 
Environment Act 2021  
 The intrinsic health and well -being community benefits of habit at creation  
 The flood risk mitigation benefits of habitat creation  
 The water and air purification benefits of habitat creation  
 Requirement to implement and support the Local Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS)  
 Commitments to implementing the recommendations of  the Lawton Report  
Where off -site habitats are created or enhanced in order to provide 20% BNG, these 
should be located within East Devon District, unless proven and evidenced to be 
undeliverable.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.37.  The Environment A ct 2021 requires all development proposals (except where 
exemptions apply) to result in a Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) of at least the relevant 
percentage (currently set at 10% by the regulations). The Environment Act 2021 also 
requires identification of me asures to further the biodiversity objective (i.e., measures to 
enhance nature recovery in the district) and act on those measures.  
13.38.  The planet is facing an ecological emergency. Globally, wildlife populations have 
declined by over half in the past 50 year s (Living Planet Report 2018). Over 1 million 
animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, and the planet is currently 
is undergoing the sixth mass -extinction event in history, as a result of human activities 
and behaviour (Intergovernmenta l Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services (IPBES) 2019I). Within the UK, 13% of England’s species are 
under threat of extinction, with 35% having declined in number and 133 species made 
extinct since 1970 (State of Nature Report, 201 9). 
13.39.  The Lawton Report (2010) recommended “a step -change in our approach to wildlife 
conservation, from trying to hang onto what we have, to one of large -scale habitat 
restoration and recreation, under -pinned by the re -establishment of ecological 
processes and ecosystem services, for the benefits of both people and wildlife.”. This East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
265 report concluded that in order to establish a coherent and resilient ecological network, 
habitats need to be “bigger, better, and more joined up”.  
13.40.  Nature recovery through habitat creation can lead to a myriad of interlinked benefits for 
society. Natural and semi -natural habitats (such as those delivered through biodiversity 
net gain) can be intrinsically linked to sustainable development, mitigation of climate 
impacts (flooding, he at extremes), carbon storage, and improvement of mental health 
and well -being.  
13.41.  East Devon contains a high diversity of ecologically important sites and habitats, 
however, many of these are sporadic and small, and exist in isolation without 
connection to o ther similar habitats. In order for the council to further the biodiversity 
objective, make progress towards halting biodiversity loss and aid biodiversity recovery 
in the district, East Devon District Council recognise the need to take action to 
implement  the recommendations of the Lawton Report (increasing the area of 
natural/semi -natural habitats, improving the quality of existing habitats, and connecting 
isolated habitats. Biodiversity net gain provides a mechanism to achieve some of these 
goals.  
13.42.  Biodiv ersity net gain is a new system. Habitats are to be secured and maintained for at 
least 30 years through legal obligations, in order to meet a target habitat type and 
condition. Delivery and long -term security of habitats is not yet fully tested, which lea ds 
to uncertainty in outcomes. Delivery and aftercare of compensatory habitat is complex, 
both in terms of physical management and legal obligations. When uncertainty exists 
within environmental decision making, the precautionary principle should be applie d. 
The precautionary principle is a basic tenet of environmental decision making. The 
precautionary principle proposes taking preventive action in the face of scientific 
uncertainty and shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity. It need s to 
be recognized that the Council must apply the precautionary principle to avoid trading 
certain biodiversity losses for uncertain biodiversity gains.  
13.43.  The DEFRA Evidence Base and Impact Assessment Report for biodiversity net gain 
(2017) made an assessme nt of the potential cost of biodiversity net gain to government 
and developers. Table 27 (page 60) estimates that increasing the net gain percentage 
to 20% from 10% results in an increase in initial biodiversity net gain delivery cost of 
~18%, and a corres ponding 29% increase in the area (ha) of habitats created.  
13.44.  Swale borough Council used the DEFRA viability study to evidence that 10% BNG costs 
developers approximately £948/dwelling, and 20% costs approximately £180/dwelling 
more. The majority of biodiver sity net gain cost to developers is within the first 10% of 
delivery, with reduced cost to deliver additional net gain.  
Local Nature Recovery Strategy and Nature Recovery Network  
13.45.  Local nature recovery is the concept that environmental quality and biodivers ity can be 
enhanced by improving areas for wildlife and creating green links between habitats to 
allow wildlife value to be enhanced and increase.  The concept of nature recovery is 
increasingly gaining ground and is being actively promoted across Devon.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
266 88. Strategic Policy – Local Nature Recovery Strategy and Nature 
Recovery Network  
 
In accordance with the LNRS and Environment Act 2021, all proposals must 
contribute to the strategic objectives of the LNRS in order to facilitate meaningful, 
strategic nature r ecovery where possible.  
 
In practice, this means that development within the mapped NRN areas (including the 
proposed nature recovery areas) will not be supported, unless it is proven that the 
need cannot be met elsewhere in the district, is of overriding  public interest, and that 
the proposals will result in a significant net gain to biodiversity, in excess of  the 
standard  policy requirement. Retention and enhancement of habitats in these areas is 
therefore considered to be of strategic significance, and must be entered inputted as 
such within the biodiversity net gain metric tool.  
 
Proposals which result in enhancement of existing NRN features, expansion of 
existing features within NRN areas, and increase landscape scale connectivity of 
ecological feature s within NRN areas will be supported. Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) 
credit creation and BNG delivery within NRN areas is encouraged. BNG delivery in 
these areas is therefore formally identified as being in an area of strategic 
significance within the biodive rsity net gain metric tool.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.46.  The Environment Act 2021 requires a Local Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS) to be 
produced for every area of England. Devon County Council (DCC) are the “responsible 
authority” for deliveri ng the LNRS, but local authorities, such as EDDC, must have had 
input to the LNRS. The LNRS contains a statement of biodiversity priorities and a local 
habitat map for the strategy area, which will take the form of Nature Recovery Network 
(NRN) mapping. ED DC has contributed to the Devon Local Nature Recovery Strategy 
(LNRS), through identifying specific priorities for East Devon and inputting to NRN 
mapping.  
13.47.  The LNRS and NRN work is intended to implement the principles for nature recovery 
identified in the Lawton Report (2010) – “Bigger, better, more joined up” (in reference to 
ecological networks and habitats). Nature recovery in the district will be focused on 
landscape scale features and mosaics of habitats, in order to improve quality of existing 
feature s, expand existing features and connect isolated features. This will provide 
ecological resilience and provide a landscape scale strategy area within which to focus 
nature recovery.  
 
13.48.   The LNRS contains:  
 A description of the biodiversity of the strategy are a. East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
267  Opportunities for recovering and enhancing biodiversity in the strategy area.  
 Priority habitats and species for recovering and enhancing biodiversity (taking into 
account the contribution that recovering or enhancing biodiversity can also make 
to other environmental benefits).  
 Details of measures proposed to achieve the recovery and enhancement of priority 
habitats and species.  
13.49.  The NRN map has been created through a process of combining existing identified sites 
of wildlife value, and then extending/conn ectivity habitats in accordance with suitable 
underlying geology/soil conditions in order to identify areas within which nature recovery 
should be focused.  Links to the current NRN mapping version can be found on the 
EDDC website.  
13.50.  Existing sites of wildli fe value which were combined to create the NRN are:  
 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)  
 Special Protection Areas (SPA)  
 Ramsar sites  
 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)  
 Marine Conserva tion Zones (MCZ)  
 National Nature Reserves (NNR)  
 Local Nature Rese rves (LNR)  
 County Wildlife Sites (CWS)  
 Special verges  
 Ancient Woodland Inventory sites (AWI)  
 Mapped Habitats of Principle Importance, as listed under S41 of the Natural 
Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006  
Ecological Impact Assessment  
13.51.  Ecologic al Impact Assessment is a n exercise undertaken, to support development 
proposals, to understand the impacts that schemes may have on biodiversity assets 
and to ensure adverse impacts are minimised and opportunities for enhancements are 
gained.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
268 89. Policy – Ecological Impact Assessment  
 
To ensure that potential ecological impacts and mitigation measures are properly 
considered, Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) should be carried out in 
accordance with published best practice guidance, such as the published Cha rtered 
Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) EcIA guidelines.  
 
Protected species survey work should follow published best practice guidelines. Any 
deviation from best practice should be clearly stated within the EcIA, with reasoning 
as to why best practice guidance has not been followed. Cost of survey effort and 
potential for delays are typically  not valid reasons to deviate from best practice 
guidelines.  
 
Deviations from best practice can include (but are not limited to):  
 Surveying ou tside of designated optimal survey periods.  
 Insufficient frequency/number of surveys to inform an accurate categorisation 
of the ecological feature.  
 Insufficient equipment, i.e., use of equipment which does not meet the 
standard required.  
 Surveys carried o ut by insufficiently experienced staff.  
 Inability to access key areas of the site in order to carry out survey.  
 Lack of consideration of ecological links with nearby features of ecological 
importance.  
 
Proposals should contain all relevant ecological surve y information required for the 
council  to make an informed decision. Surveys should not be conditioned as part of a 
granted permission, as doing so would mean that the council has not fully considered 
and assessed the ecological impacts of the proposal pri or to granting consent, and 
have therefore not fulfilled our biodiversity duty - to have regard to conserving 
biodiversity. Any necessary avoidance, mitigation, compensation or enhancement 
measures could have an impact on the layout of the site, and theref ore should be 
included within the applications in a suitable level of detail according to the type of 
application.  
 
The mitigation hierarchy  
 
All proposals should be developed in line with The Mitigation Hierarchy. This is a 
hierarchal process whereby prop osals should first seek to avoid biodiversity impacts. 
Where impacts cannot be avoided, measures should be proposed to mitigate (lessen 
the impact) of the proposals. Where residual impacts exist (following mitigation), 
impacts should be compensated for. Co mpensation is a last resort and should only be 
considered once avoidance and mitigation measures have been fully considered and 
are reasoned to be unachievable.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
269  
The precautionary principle  
 
The precautionary principle is a tenet of environmental decisio n making. The 
precautionary principle has four central components: taking preventive action in the 
face of scientific uncertainty; shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an 
activity; exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful act ions; and 
increasing public participation in decision making.  
 
The precautionary principle should be applied to decision making within planning 
applications, particularly where non -standard survey work or mitigation/compensation 
is proposed (i.e., decision s relating to ecological impacts and mitigation/compensation 
where guidance does not exist or is lacking in specificity or certainty). This is to 
ensure that positive outcomes to biodiversity are likely to occur where there is 
scientific uncertainty as to the accuracy of ecological impact assessments, baseline 
information provided, or the likely success of proposed mitigation/compensation 
measures.  
 
In practice, this means that where there is reasonable doubt  as to the certainty of 
ecological impact s, or t he success of mitigation/compensation measures, then EDDC 
decision makers will err on the side of caution . This could mean requesting further 
ecological survey information or improving mitigation/compensation design in order to 
remove or reduce scientific doubt.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.52.  This policy ensures proper adherence to ecological impact assessment method and 
also affords EDDC some backing in decision making situations where distinct survey 
and mitigation guidelines do not exist, but w here we have concerns over likely impacts 
and success of mitigation measures proposed. This policy shows EDDC’s commitment 
to fulfilling their biodiversity duty within decision making, and shows that EDDC are 
considering non -standard impacts, the mitigatio n hierarchy and the precautionary 
principle.  
Protected and notable species  
13.53.  A number of wildlife species are especially important and are afforded particular 
attention.   Plan policy highlights how this protection will be applied in practice in respect 
of planning applications and their determination.  
 
 
 
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
270  
90. Policy – Due consideration of protected and notable species  
 
Protected and notable species  
Proposals should adequately consider all relevant direct and indirect impacts on 
protected and notable species, in order to maintain and enhance the conservation 
status of these species at the relevant geographic scale.  
 
For avoidance of doubt, these species include (but are not limited to):  
 European Protected Species (species listed under Annex II and IV of the 
Habitats Directive).  
 Section 41 species of Principle Importance (those listed under Section 41 of 
the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006).  
 Species listed under schedules 1, 5 and 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 
1981.  
 Red and Ambe r listed birds within Birds of Conservation Concern 5  
 Any Red Data Book, Nationally or Regionally Notable species.  
 In all circumstances the mitigation hierarchy should be applied, and the 
precautionary principle applied to the provision of suitable avoida nce, 
mitigation and compensation measures.  
 
Development that is likely to have an adverse impact on European Protected Species 
will only be permitted if the three relevant licensing tests are likely to be met:  
 That there is not satisfactory alternative  
 That there is a purpose and genuine need for the proposal  
 That the proposal, including mitigation, is considered to have no impact on the 
favourable conservation status of the species concerned.  
 
Invasive species  
 
Proposals should adequately consider their i mpacts on invasive non -native species, 
such as those listed under Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. 
Where Schedule 9 species are present within an application boundary, EDDC expect 
that the proposal would include a full invasive species removal plan, in order to 
remove the species from the site in perpetuity and guard against future spread on 
site, prevent re -establishment following removal, and prevent potential colonization of 
adjacent habitats.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
 
Protected and notable species  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
271 13.54.  East Devon supports a wide range of protected and notable species, in part due to our 
excellent diversity of priority habitats and designated sites. This policy recognizes the 
biodiversity duty placed on EDDC and provides cla rity as to the expectation of the 
council.  
 
Invasive species  
13.55.  It is an offence to allow or cause plants listed under Schedule 9 of the wildlife and to 
spread into the wild. This  policy is a measure to further the biodiversity objective as per 
our requirem ents under the Environment Act 2021. Invasive species are stated to be 
one of the most detrimental environmental impacts caused by humans, and are 
predicted to have cost the UK between £5.4 – £13.7 billion in reported losses and 
expenses since 1976 (Econom ic costs of biological invasions in the United Kingdom 
(pensoft.net Economic costs of biological invasions in the United Kingdom (pensoft.net) )  
– although this is acknowledged within the paper tha t this is like ly to be an under -
estimate. EDD C should be prescribing that developers remove invasive species from 
their land to reduce abundance and prevent future spread into the wild. This is not 
totally prescriptive – hence the use of the word “expect”,  for use in circumstances where 
this may not be achievable.  
Design feature for wildlife enhancement  
13.56.  Through new development it is very sensible to seek to create new areas and feature in 
which wildlife can thrive.  We have therefore established policy to p romote wildlife 
enhancement in development proposals.  
 
91. Policy – Ecological enhancement and incorporation of design 
features  to maximize the biodiversity value of proposals  
 
In addition to any features provided as part of required mitigation or compensatio n 
measures, all proposals are required to include functional features of biodiversity 
value which are tailored to specific proposals and relevant local receptors. These 
features should be proposed in accordance with best practice, in locations which 
maximi ze the potential benefits of the provided features, such as areas with high 
habitat connectivity, low human disturbance and low lighting levels.  
 
As a minimum, the following features are required within new proposals where 
relevant:  
 
a. Integrated bird boxe s in suitable locations at an average of one per 
dwelling, or a relevant number to be agreed with EDDC for flats or non -
dwelling applications, to be provided in accordance with BS42021:20221.  
b. A range of integrated bat boxes in all locations suitable for us e by bats (i.e., 
adjacent to suitable habitats and not significantly impacts by artificial 
lighting).  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
272 c. An integrated bat loft within all Major planning applications, if ecologically 
relevant (i.e., if the site is a suitable location for a bat loft be constr ucted - 
not too isolated or within unsuitable habitat such as heavily urbanized well -
lit areas).  
d. Overhanging eaves suitable for nesting house martins in all Major 
applications  
e. Gaps in the bases of garden fences (between gardens, and within fences 
between gardens and wider ecological networks, to facilitate movement of 
hedgehogs and other protected and notable species).  
f. Other features that should be included where relevant include (but are not 
limited to):  
 Reptile/amphibian hibernacula.  
 Brash piles.  
 Invert ebrate bricks.  
 
The location and specification of biodiversity features should be designed with input 
from a qualified ecologist. Bat and bird boxes should be integrated within the fabric of 
the building to ensure longevity and retention when ownership cha nges (i.e., to avoid 
removal by new owners).  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.57.  Over the plan period, East Devon will see significant development growth, which will in 
turn place greater pressure on the natural environment. This growth can also provi de 
opportunity for nature recovery, if carried out appropriately.  
13.58.  This policy is  mechanism for EDDC to further the biodiversity objective, in accordance 
with the requirements of the Environment Act 2021, and is seen to be essential to the 
potential recover y of certain receptors, such as swifts. This is increasingly important in 
the current biodiversity crisis, within which the majority of new homes offer no value to 
wildlife.  
13.59.  Paragraph 179b of the NPPF states that plans should promote enhancement of 
ecolog ical networks and recovery of priority species, and identify and pursue 
opportunities for securing measurable net gains for biodiversity. The measures in this 
policy are designed to carry out this purpose. The priority species concerned (priority 
bird spec ies, bats, reptiles, hedgehogs etc.) would benefit from the proposed measures. 
Many priority species can thrive in urban and semi -urban locations, as well as within 
man-made structures themselves, if facilitated. Examples include swifts, bats, 
hedgehogs an d common reptiles.  
13.60.  The recent BS42021:20221 guidance  has provided evidence of the high occupancy 
rates of integrated bird boxes, and has been adopted and endorsed by the RPSB, as 
well as several large housing developers. EDDC endorse this guidance and prom ote its 
use throughout the district.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
273 Trees in East Devon  
13.61.  Trees form a hugely important wildlife assets and are attractive features in their own 
right.  We are promoting enhancement of trees and tree coverage in the district.   
 
92. Policy – Tree policy  
 
East Devon District  Council has recently committed to contributing to the Devon Tree 
Strategy, which is a Devon wide  strategy being prepared by all Devon Authorities 
(except Plymouth). The Tree strategy will outline high level tree objectives which will 
be spl it by district. The strategy will be used to inform future redrafting of tree policy:  
 
Development schemes should seek to:  
 Protection of existing tree stock and new landscaping schemes via tree 
preservation orders.  
 Provide increased tree planting within p roposals, including street tree planting 
minimum specification.  
 Provide Potential net gain in canopy cover and contribution towards local 
canopy cover goals (to be confirmed by the tree strategy) as a result of 
development.  
 Provide Minimum standard tree nu mbers for new hedgerows in proposals  
 Encourage appropriate natural or enhanced natural regeneration  
 Deliver Expectation for tree retention during development  
 Take into account climate change and local characteristics within selection of 
appropriate trees  
 Take into account appropriate consideration of Ash dieback within internal 
practice and developments, including potential retention of trees and 
deadwood, and consideration of appropriate replacement stock.  
 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.62.  Plan pol icy addresses objective s identified in respect  of climate change resilience, 
addressing the biodiversity crisis, health and wellbeing, a greener East Devon, better 
quality of developments and increased access to nature.   Critical importance is attached 
to the relevance of trees to human welfare and well -being and their role in enhancing 
built and living environments.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
274 Geology and Geodiversity  
13.63.  East Devon has a varied and important geology that has helped shaped the district, built 
natural features and human  made buildings and structures over many years.  Perhaps 
most notably this is can be recognised along the East Devon coastline which is 
internationally recognised for its geological importance.  
 
The Dorset and East Devon Coast World Heritage Site  
13.64.  Most of t he East Devon coastline forms part of the Dorset and East Devon Coast World 
Heritage Site (often referred to as the Jurassic Coast).  This coastline was given 
international recognition in 2001 on account of its exceptional geological importance 
and as such  joined a global family of unique and exceptional places that illuminate 
humanity’s collective history, identity and relationship with nature.  
 
93. Policy – Protection and enhancement of the Jurassic Coast 
World Heritage site  
 
Development with in the Jurassic  Coast World Heritage site, or that could adversely 
impact on its setting, will only be permitted if it can be demonstrated that the 
Outstanding Universal Value of the coastline and  specifically its geological  
importance, will not be adversely affected.   
 
Applications for planning permission that could give rise to adverse impacts , will be 
assessed in respect of :  
 The setting and importance of the site;  
 The inherent attributes and geological qualities of the site, specifically relating 
to the its  ‘Outstand ing Universal Value’;  
 The grounds and reasons for its inscription; and  
 Its overall integrity (including possible incremental loss) and local impacts of 
development.  
 
The international importance of the site and its setting is such that development 
proposa ls will be rigorously reviewed in determination of planning applications and 
this policy will sit alongside other affording coastal and countryside protection and 
enhancement.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.65.  The Jurassic Coast is a hugely diverse a nd beautiful landscape underpinned by 
incredible geology of global importance.  In 2001 it was inscribed as a  World Heritage 
Site by UNESCO for the outstanding universal value of its rocks, fossils and landforms. East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
275 It remains England’s only natural Wo rld Her itage Site though it is not a statut ory 
designation site and as such is no t afforded national policy protection that statutory 
designations are offered.   
13.66.  The Jurassic Coast begins at Orcombe Point at  Exmouth in East Devon, and continues 
eastward for 95 mi les to  Old Harry Rocks near  Swanage in Dorset and its clearly and 
visibly presents a continuous and time stepped range of geological exposures along its 
entire length.  
13.67.  The Jurassic Coa st Partnership Plan 2020 -2025; see 7e0ff0f0 -426f-523d -bd45 -
cc1fe4d60fac (dorsetcouncil.gov.uk) identifies the ‘Outstanding Universal Value’ (OUV) 
of the World Heritage coastl ine and identifies the following OUV attributes:  
 Stratigraphy (the rock record) and structure;   
 Palaeontological record;  
 Geomorphological features and processes;  
 Ongoing scientific investigation and educational use, and role in the history of 
science; and   
 Underlying geomorphological processes in the setting of the Site  
13.68.  The Partnership Plan highlights the geological value of the WHS, and identifies a 
significant opportunity to promote the role of geodiversity within the area’s landscapes; 
with an emphasis  on the presentation of the site and people’s ability to use and enjoy it.  
13.69.  A key characteristic of the WHS is its high rate of erosion, creating a dynamic coastline 
which maintains rock exposures.  Development requiring increased coastal defences 
would th erefore be harmful to the OUV of the site. Likewise development at or on the 
inscribed area that could adversely impact on the site and be contrary to reasons for 
inscription will be closely assessed and unless schemes can be accommodated in an 
acceptable manner planning permission for development will be refused.  
Sites designated for their geological importance  
13.70.  Geological sites may benefit from national designation, specifically as Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest (putting them equal to wildlife sites with the same designation) on 
account of their geological value and importance.  Plan policy specifically seeks to 
afford protection to these designated sites.  
 
94. Policy – Protection of designated geological sites  
 
Proposals and plans that would cause a dir ect or indirect adverse effect upon 
nationally designated geological sites will not be permitted unless all of the following 
criteria are met:  
a. They cannot be located on alternative sites that would cause less or no harm.  
b. The public benefits of the proposal  clearly outweigh the impacts on the features 
of the site and the wider network of natural habitats and designated sites.  
c. Suitable avoidance, mitigation and compensation measures are proposed, in 
accordance with the mitigation hierarchy.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
276 d. Where possible the  integrity of the site will be maintained.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
13.71.  Geological sites are designated because of their importance and intrinsic qualities.  
They can be of both scientific and educational value and will also be supportive of an d 
complementary to wildlife interests.  Indeed it is the underlying geology that can be or 
often is the determinant of wildlife species present and value.  Some sites may be 
designated as SSSIs for both geological and wildlife value  
13.72.  Statutory designated g eological sites, specifically Sites of Special Scientific Interest, are 
recognised for their geological importance.  Local plan policy seeks to complement 
existing legislation and government guidance, and seeks to add detail on when adverse 
impacts may be permitted.  
Regionally Important Geological and Geomorphological Sites  
13.73.  At the local level there are sites or areas that are designated as Regionally Important 
Geological and Geomorphological Sites (RIGS).  These sites are identified for their 
scientific and  educational value and provide a valuable local asset to complement 
nationally designated or recognised sites.  
 
95. Policy – Regionally Important Geological and Geomorphological 
Sites  
 
The granting of planning permission for development or land -use changes th at may 
have an adverse effect, either directly or indirectly, on Regionally Important 
Geological and Geomorphological Sites will only be permitted if the justification for the 
proposed development clearly outweighs any harm to the intrinsic scientific or 
educational value of the site.  
 
Where development is permitted mitigation will be required to minimise the negative 
impacts and where this is not possible adequate compensatory enhancement or new 
site creation schemes will be required .  
 
Justification fo r inclusion of policy  
13.74.  Regionally Important Geological and Geomorphological Sites (RIGS) are places in 
Devon that are considered to be especially important for the geology they exhibit. The 
Devon Regionally Important Geological and Geomorphological Sites Gr oup was 
established in 1991 and is a voluntary organisation exclusively concerned with 
geological conservation in Devon.  The Group is composed of a wide selection of 
individuals from professional geologists to amateurs interested in conserving the East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
277 county’ s important geological history. The group establish and define RIGS and they are 
an important educational, historical, and recreational resource. The following criteria are 
used for site selection, taken from the Nature Conservation Committee (NCC) strateg y: 
 Education – for fieldwork in primary and secondary schools, at undergraduate 
level, and in adult education courses.  
 Scientific Study/Research – by professional/amateur Earth scientists. These sites 
demonstrate the geology/geomorphology of an area, eithe r alone or as part of a 
network.  
 Historical – for their important advances in Earth science knowledge or economic 
important.  
 Aesthetic – qualities to the landscape, particularly for promoting public awareness 
and appreciation of Earth Sciences  
13.75.  RIGs are mos tly old quarries, pits, roadside cuttings and other excavations which 
expose rocks normally covered by soil and vegetation.  Some sites are, however, 
natural exposures of interesting rocks in river banks and cliffs, and others are fine views 
which demonstr ate how the underlying geology and forces of erosion have shaped the 
landscape.  
13.76.  It is notable, therefore, that RIGS are often ‘created’ through the processes of 
development and can often result as an action of human intervention.  Where 
development offers  scope to show or expose geological features in an interesting and 
informative way we would welcome inclusion in planning applications submission about 
how such potential can be realised.  
13.77.  By recognising localities as County Geological Sites, activities wh ich might damage or 
destroy their geological value will be avoided. The group, working together with local 
authorities and other public bodies, try to safeguard sites from harm and inappropriate 
development through the planning system. In addition, by work ing with the 
owners/occupiers of sites, the group hopes to promote their positive management.  
 
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
278 Chapter 14.  Open space and sport s and 
recreation facilities  
The importance of open space and sport and recreation facilities  
 
14.1.  Having ready and easy access to attractive open spaces for all people at all stages of 
life is critical  for mental and physical wellbeing.  In East Devon we are blessed with an 
exceptionally attractive environment with many high quality and accessible open space 
areas.  However,  this does not trans late to everyone  having readily accessible open 
space available to use and enjoy.    
14.2.  We have, therefore, set out  an over -arching strategic policy position in respect of open 
space and sports facility provision.   Policy seeks to set an agenda for provision o f open 
space and recreation provision to match and be aligned  with new development coming 
forward and if or where possible to address deficits in current provision.  
 
96. Strategic Policy – Access to open space and recreation facilities  
 
Support will be given for the provision of new and enhanced access to high quality 
open space and sports and recreation  facilities . 
 
A key consideration in accommodating new development will be to ensure that 
residents, visitors to or users of any new scheme must be able to acc ess open 
spaces  and sports facilities and  enjoy the benefits that such spaces and facilities 
offer.  Such an outcome will require that availability of space and safe and easy 
access for all to it for all  will need to be fully taken into account at the outs et of 
designing any development scheme or proposal .   
 
Qualitative (how good it is) and q uantitative (how much there is of it) assessments of 
open space provision, in respect of what exists now and what is planned will be 
determining considerations in the decision -making  process .  Securing  planning 
permission for developme nt will requiring meeting and ideally exceeding s pecified 
standards of provision.  
 
Justification for policy  
14.3.  Open spaces and there use and availability can be divided between those that a re used 
for informal recreational activities, for example as simple as just going for a walk in a 
nice green environment, through to those used for formal sport or recreation activities, 
such as playing a game of football.   
14.4.  For informal activities the exp ansive open spaces area of East Devon , including  the 
coast and  countryside and parks , gardens and other open areas form spaces that are East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
279 widely enjoyed.  In some areas, especially the more urban, and for people with limited 
mobility access such spaces can, however, be challenging and concerns are 
compounded for those without access to a car or private vehicle.  When it comes to 
formal recreation facilities, specifically playing pitches for sport and recreation , 
accessibility can be more challenging with the availability and quality of pitches and 
facilities being variable across the District but with a general picture of high demand for 
facilities a nd many be used at levels that at or exceed c apacity.  
14.5.  The Council has a draft Leisure Strategy that was compete d in summer 2022 , this 
document is still to be finalised  (at September 2022) but it will help inform and guide 
overall planning policy  and it also contains the Built Sports Facility Strategy , see:  
70622 East Devon District Council Leisure Strategy.pdf  
14.6.  A new Playing Pitch Strategy , that is currently in production,  will supersede  a strategy 
that was approved in  2015, see:  
 
Open Space - Playing Pitch Strategy - East Devon  
 
 
FIGURE 21.  Playing pitch at Ottery St Mary  
14.7.  The new P laying Pitch strategy will assess availability, access and use of pitches used 
for football, cricket, hockey, rugby and tennis , but in this draft local plan we refer to 
previous study outputs.  
14.8.  Assessment work  for indoor and outdoor facilities  will identify  where improvements to 
existing facilities may be desirable and where extra facilities may be needed, or perhaps 
(and exceptionally) if there may be an existing over provision.  The strategy documents, 
specifically from a planning and planning policy persp ective, will help inform policy that 
seeks to protect existing facilities from loss and provide for additional facility in 
association with new development.  More widely, and typically beyond the remit or role 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
280 of planning, the strategy documents may be use d by the Council and other bodies to 
inform decisions on maintenance and enhancement of existing facilities and bidding for 
monies for new or enhanced facilities.   
Quantified open space standards applicable for new development  
14.9.  Where new development schemes  come forward, especially for housing development, it 
will be essential that they have access to appropriate levels of existing open space (and 
will not in their own right generate a shortfall through using up spare capacity) or that 
they will provide or c ontribute to new open space provision.  
14.10.  Plan policy sets out quantified open space standards.  
 
97. Policy –Land and buildings for sport, recreation and open space 
areas in association with development  
 
Planning permission for new housing development will only  be granted where there is, or 
there will be, land and space of at least the quantified levels as set out in this policy.  
Noting that levels set out in this policy are a guide to provision from a now dated study that 
will need to be updated in the light o f updated assessment on supply ad needs.  
 
Developments proposing net new dwellings will be expected to provide for open space on -
site in line with the table below where there is a demonstrable need for such open space in 
the vicinity. Developments will be assessed against existing provision in the parish in which 
they are proposed. Where existing provision of specific typologies exceeds quantity 
standards, on -site provision will only be required where the existing open space typology is 
of poor quality or i s in some other manner deficient such as not matching up to the 
accessibility standard.  
  
Developments will be expected to provide open space on -site through a Section 106 
Agreement in line with the following thresholds:  
 9 dwellings or less will not be req uired to provide any specific open space typologies 
on-site, however developers may choose to make such provision.  
 10 – 49 dwellings will be required to provide amenity open space on -site as per the 
standards below.  
 50 – 199 dwellings will be required to p rovide amenity open space, and children’s 
and youth play space on -site as per the standards below.  
 200+ dwellings will be required to provide for all open space typologies on -site as 
per the standards below.  
  
Developments which do not meet policy requirem ents will be refused planning permission 
though there will be scope through negotiation to vary types and quantities of space if the 
net benefits achieved can be clearly shown to be greater than the tabulated need figures,  
  
Provision of outdoor sports pit ch requirements (grass and artificial) will be guided by work 
that is to be completed on a new Playing Pitch Strategy.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
281   
Urban standards apply to the operative town (Parish) council areas of Axminster, Budleigh 
Salterton, Exmouth, Honiton, and Ottery St M ary. Rural standards apply to developments 
everywhere else in the district. Existing open space sites will be protected and, where 
appropriate, new sites designated .

 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
282 Justification for inclusion of policy  
14.11.  New development, specifically including where this gives rise to an increased 
population, can generate a need for additional facilities, unless under exceptional 
circumstances there is a demonstrable surplus of  provision in the locality.  Policy of the 
plan will require new facilities to match changes occurring in the local population.  This 
policy will be most typically relevant where new housing is proposed.  It may, however, 
have relevance where other forms o f development could lead to changes in population 
or people in a locality.  For example it could have applicability where a new commercial 
development results in a new concentration of workers in a given locality.  
14.12.  Facilities under this policy will include  those for sport and recreation as well as more 
general open space areas.  
14.13.  We have a now dated Open Space Study  from 2012   (Bennett Leisure & Planning Ltd & 
JPC Strategic Planning & Leisure Ltd (2012) East Devon Open Space Study - Final 
Report and Appendix A and Appendix B - Assessment of Fixed Sports Facilities for East 
Devon)  that will be  reviewed and updated in the coming months.  We use the outputs 
from the dated study to guide the potential direction of planning policy .  The work 
identified  and mapped  open spaces  by differing area types across East Devon to 
quantify existing levels of provision . 
14.14.  Policy seeks to deliver new open space and enhancements to existing facilities in step 
with new residential development.  Sites of less than 9 dwellings will no t be expected to 
provide open space on -site as it is unlikely that sites of this scale will have a gross 
development area large enough to host meaningful facilities. This does not mean that 
such sites would not be permitted to have open space on -site. Site s of 10 to 49 
dwellings should provide amenity open space on -site. Sites of 50 to 199 dwellings 
should provide some open space on -site - a meaningful size/value could be delivered 
on such sites but depending on the site specifics and local needs it may be more 
appropriate to deliver other open space typologies instead. Sites of above 200 dwellings 
should provide the full suite of open space typologies on -site. Developments of 
specialist accommodation such as for the active elderly will be considered using t he 
same methodology as above, however where demands of occupiers can be shown to 
vary from normal/average demands alternative provision will be negotiable. On -site 
requirements for such housing will therefore be subject to negotiation during the 
planning a pplication process in order to provide the most appropriate typology.  
14.15.  Population increase will be used to determine the relative demand created by different 
developments. For residential development contributions these will be on a per -dwelling 
basis and t he level of contribution will be higher for larger housing than for small houses 
or flats. This will be determined by the average occupancy rates where the average 
occupancy acts as a multiplier reflecting population increase.  The assumed average 
occupanc y rates are as follows:  
 a 1 bed dwelling = 1.5 persons,  
 a 2 to 4 bed dwelling = 2.22 persons,  
 a 5+ bed dwelling = 2.5 persons.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
283 Contributions will only be sought towards the open space typologies for which there is 
an established deficiency in the quant ity, quality or accessibility of open spaces within 
the parish in which a development takes place. Money collected may  be pooled to fund 
publicly accessible open space projects  
 
Location for new facility provision  
14.16.  New facilities for formal and informal re creation should be located where they will meet 
needs, are accessible to the population and where the uses proposed and types of 
activities that wi ll be accommodated will be compatible with neighbouring  uses and any 
wider plans for a general area.  Providi ng safe and attractive  links between ope n space 
areas can be an especia lly beneficial  outcome of p lan policy.  
 
98. Policy  – Location of facilities for sport and recreation, open 
spaces and allotments  
 
Within or adjoining urban or built -up areas, planning perm ission will be granted for 
new open space areas, allotments, sports facilities and parks and  for the upgrading or 
enhancement of existing facilities provided that unacceptable adverse amenity or 
environmental impacts do not arise from development . 
 
Any new  or enhanced provision should be readily  accessible  to all people  with a 
particular emphasis attached to ensuring safe pedestrian and bicycle accessibility and 
any building works should be at most modest in scale and within or well related to the 
built for m of settlements or development boundaries.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
14.17.  New facilities and open space can typically be expected to be accommodated on and 
within development sites, especially so for larger developments.  In such cases th ey 
shou ld be located in accordance with detailed design proposals for any specific 
development scheme taking into account design policies in this plan as well as specific 
characteristics of the development site.   
14.18.  Where they otherwise come forward for development , they should be accessible to 
close by residential populations and centres and avoid adverse impacts.   Typically, new 
facilities can be  expected to be close to built -up areas though but less formal open 
space uses can be more flexible  in where and how they are accommodated with what 
could be limited scope for possible adverse impacts.  
Avoiding the loss of existing facilities  
14.19.  Facilities used for sport and recreation can come under pressure for reuse or 
redevelopment for non -sporting and recreational uses or  changes from one type of East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
284 sporting use to another.  Policy of the local plan will seek to resist such losses unless, 
under plan policy, there is clear justification.  
 
 
99. Policy – Retention of land and buildings for sport and recreation 
use 
 
Proposals that would result in the loss of open space currently or previously used for 
recreation and/or sports uses, play areas or playing fields will not be permitted unless 
at least one of the tests below is satisfied:  
1. Local Plan policy compliant alternative provis ion of equivalent community 
benefit is made available and will be appropriately laid out by the applicant as 
a replacement.  
2. Sports and recreational facilities can best be retained and enhanced through 
the redevelopment of a small part of an overall sit e.  
3. Locally (within the parish where it is located) there is an excess of public 
open space, children's play areas or sports pitch provision – the excess will 
be measured on the basis of a generic space type reference – e.g. grass 
area suitable for team  sport – rather than a space for a specific sport.  
 
New allotment s and avoiding the loss of existing ones  
14.20.  Allotments are a valuable asset in promoting greater sustainability within local 
communities and are recognised as being of particular importance in  urban areas, 
especially where individual gardens may be small in size.  
14.21.  The need for additional allotments depends on local factors  though the council would be 
supportive of new provision .  Proposals involving the development and thus resulting in 
the loss  of allotments must have regard to considerations of demand and conveniently 
located alternative sites.  
 
100. Policy  – New allotments and avoiding the loss of existing ones   
 
New allotments will be granted planning permission where they are well related to 
settlements and will avoid adverse environmental or amenity impacts.  
 
Planning permission will not be gra nted for developments that would result in the loss 
of existing allotments unless at least one of the test set out below is satisfied : 
 A development propo sal will create a new provision that is equal to or better 
than that being lost: or  
 There is a demonstrable over -supply in a locality (need to define what we 
mean by locality).  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
285 Justification for inclusion of policy  
14.22.  Allotments form a valued community ass et and are increasingly important to many local 
communities and people.  Demand for allotments has risen over recent years with 
waiting lists frequently becoming longer.  
Sport and recreation facilities in the countryside  
14.23.  The changing nature of agriculture and the need for rural diversification has focused 
attention on alternative uses of land within the countryside.  In this respect the provision 
of outdoor recreation facilities is of particular relevance. This type of development can 
have a significant vis ual impact on the character of the landscape and the surrounding 
countryside.  It is also acknowledged that proposals can provide opportunities to 
improve the environment and to create wildlife habitats.  
14.24.  Some uses, such as horse riding, will be encouraged where they can be accommodated 
safely and are not detrimental to the countryside but their associated services and 
paraphernalia will need to be controlled. Dwellings in the open countryside will not be 
justified on the basis of a recreational need.  
 
101. Policy – Leisure and recreation developments  in the countryside  
 
Planning permission will be granted for outdoor recreation facilities in the countryside 
and on the coast provided that the nature of the activities undertaken or the space 
requirements of the p roposal require a countryside or coastal location and  all of the 
following tests are met : 
1. The facilities or development proposals are in scale with the character, 
environmental characteristics and setting of the area and do not conflict with 
countryside, n ature or landscape policies, nor detract from the amenities of the 
area.  
2. The proposals allow for safe access and discreet parking arrangements, 
particularly in environmentally sensitive areas, and do not result in the loss of or 
cause unacceptable disrupti on to existing public rights of way.  
3. On site facilities are appropriate to meet the needs of the proposal and links with 
adjacent footpaths and bridleways should be suited to any proposed site uses.  
The clear policy expectation is that low impact uses only  will be accommodated and 
such uses should be countryside related activities   
Any building work should be small scale and subservient to wider site use and where 
possible existing building reuse rather than new development  shou ld take place,  
Any new buildi ngs and necessary extensions should be limited in scale and be in close 
proximity to existing groups of buildings or an existing settlement.   
 
Where it is proposed to extend or intensify an existing use the proposals and any net 
cumulative additional impa cts will be considered in the context of and be required to be 
compatible with all of the above.

286 Justification for inclusion of policy  
14.25.  Many leisure activities, especially of a low key or informal nature, take place in 
countryside locations and away from  settlements.  Often such activities don’t take place 
in paces or use facilities that have been developed (that is not developed in the 
planning sense and in terms of where planning permission may be or have been 
required).  However proposals for commercia l or other leisure facilities often associated 
with tourism attractions or accommodation sites may come forward for development.  
 
 
 
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
287 Chapter 15.  Our outstanding historic 
environment  
 
15.1.  A heritage asset is defined by central government in the NPPF as:  
“A building, monu ment, site, place, area or landscape identified as having a degree of 
significance meriting consideration in planning decisions, because of its heritage 
interest. It includes designated heritage assets and assets identified by the local 
planning authority (including local listing).”  
 
15.2.  East Devon is fortunate in having a rich heritage and distinctive vernacular architecture 
which makes it a unique place to live in and visit. Local materials such as chert, cob, 
thatch and clay tiles are used extensively as wel l as local limestone and Beer stone. 
East Devon’s historic environment isn’t just limited to man -made buildings, monuments, 
standing stones and archaeological sites, but landscapes and wildlife habitats resulting 
from millennia of human interaction with na ture. 
15.3.  National policy emphasises the importance of heritage assets for their contribution to 
quality of life, and as an irreplaceable resource which should be conserved in a manner 
appropriate to their significance. Local planning authorities are required to set out in 
their plans, “a positive strategy for the conservation and enjoyment of the historic 
environment, including heritage assets most at risk through neglect, decay or other 
threats” and to make information on the historic environment, gathered as  a part of 
policy -making or development management, publically accessible. Policy 
implementation will be informed by the East Devon Heritage Strategy, which presents a 
summary of the District’s heritage, its significance and its benefits whilst developing 
objectives for the future, with an action plan for the delivery of recommendations. The 
strategy runs for 12 years from 2019 – 2031 and will be updated during the life of the 
local plan. The strategy focuses on the heritage assets of the district where the  Council 
has a direct role and responsibility, or influence, in the decision making or management 
process. However broader designations that inform the strategy are also considered, 
such as the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which have a positive inf luence on 
the enhancement and management of the district’s heritage.  
15.4.  Non-designated heritage assets may be identified by a local planning authority as 
having a local heritage value that should be taken into account when considering any 
planning application  that affects either the asset or its setting. National policy further 
advises that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their 
significance. In weighing an application that may affect a non -designated asset, a 
balanced judgement i s required regarding the scale of any harm or loss and the 
significance of the asset.  
 
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
288 102. Policy  – Historic Environment   
 
Proposals for new development that may affect heritage assets should take account 
of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of those assets and 
putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation.  
Particular encouragement will be given to schemes that will help secure the long term 
conservation of vacant and under -used buildings and bring them back into 
appropriate use. Heritage assets include statutorily designated Scheduled 
Monuments, Listed Buildings or structures, Conservation Areas, Registered Parks 
and Gardens, Registered Battlefields, archaeology of national and local interest and 
non-designated bu ildings, structures or historic landscapes that contribute to local 
historic and architectural interest of the district’s historic environment, and also 
includes those heritage assets listed in the Devon Historic Environmental Record.  
  
Prop osals for new development must  be sensitively designed and not cause harm to 
the historic environment. Proposals that have an impact on heritage assets (whether 
they are designated or non -designated) will only be supported where they:  
a. conserve or enhance the significanc e of the heritage asset and its setting. The  
more important (or significant ) the heritage asset, the greater the weight that will 
be given to its conservation;  
b. make a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness (through high 
standards of d esign, reflecting its significance, including through the use of 
appropriate materials and construction techniques);  
c. make a positive contribution towards wider public benefits;  
d. provide a viable future use for a heritage asset that is consistent with the 
conservation of its significance; and/or  
e. protect a heritage asset that is currently at risk.  
 
Non-designated heritage assets, where identified through local or neighbourhood 
plan-making, Conservation Area Appraisal or review or through the planning 
applicati on process, will be recognised as heritage assets in accordance with national 
guidance and any local criteria. Development proposals that directly or indirectly 
affect the significance of a non -designated heritage asset will be determined with 
regard to th e scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the asset.  
 
Applicants will be required to describe, in line with best practice and relevant national 
guidance, the significance of any heritage assets affected including any contribution 
made by their se tting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the asset’s 
importance. In some circumstances a planning condition will require further survey, 
analysis and/or recording.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
289 Alterations to historic buildings, for example to improve energy efficiency or  reduce 
carbon emissions, should respect the integrity of the historic environment and the 
character and significance of the building.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
15.5.  Heritage assets may be classified as either ‘designated’ or ‘non -designated’ and  the 
importance of both can be taken into account through the planning process. Heritage 
assets can include Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments, Conservation Areas, 
Registered Parks and Gardens, archaeological sites and other assets. The majority of 
heritage assets in East Devon, whether buildings, archaeological sites or areas of 
historic landscape character, do not have a statutory designation and so their 
conservation relies on the planning system and positive management by land and 
property owners.  
15.6.  In preparing development proposals, applicants should refer at an early stage to 
sources of information on the historic environment such as The Devon Historic 
Environment Record, The National Heritage List for England, any local Heritage Impact 
Assessments, and, where relevant, Conservation Area Character Appraisals to ensure 
that proposals are based on an understanding of the significance of any heritage assets 
that may be affected. Development proposals should also accord with the Heritage 
Strategy, take in to account the principles set out in any Supplementary Planning 
Documents and other relevant guidance.  
15.7.  In some circumstances, further surveys and analysis may be required prior to any 
application being determined. Heritage Statements, Statements of Signif icance, and 
Impact Assessments should be produced in line with current best practice and relevant 
national guidance.  
15.8.  The Council will monitor buildings or other heritage assets at risk through neglect, decay 
or other threats, proactively seeking solutions for assets at risk through discussions with 
owners and willingness to consider positively development schemes that would ensure 
the repair and maintenance of the asset, and, as a last resort, using its statutory 
powers. The Council will work with relevant stakeholders to encourage better 
understanding of the heritage assets on the Historic England “Heritage at Risk” 
Register. Where appropriate the Council will encourage Heritage Partnership 
Agreements, particularly for Listed Buildings on any ‘at risk’ regi ster. 
15.9.  The Council will support Neighbourhood Development Plans where they seek to assess 
their heritage assets and add to the evidence base.  
 
 
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
290 103. Policy  – Listed buildings   
1. Proposals for development, including change of use, that involve any alteration of, 
addition to or partial demolition of, a listed building or within the curtilage of, or 
affecting the setting of a listed building will be expected to:  
i) conserve, enhance or better reveal those elements which contribute to the 
heritage significance an d/or its setting;  
ii) respect any features of special architectural or historic interest, including, where 
relevant, the historic curtilage or context, such as burgage plots, or its value 
within a group and/or its setting, such as the importance of a stree t frontage or 
traditional shopfronts; and  
iii) be sympathetic to the listed building and its setting in terms of its siting, size, 
scale, height, alignment, materials, building methods and finishes (including 
colour and texture), design and form, in order to retain the special interest that 
justifies its designation  
2. Development proposals affecting the significance of a listed building or its setting 
that will lead to substantial harm or total loss of significance will be refused unless it 
can be demonst rated that the substantial harm or loss is necessary to achieve 
substantial public benefits that demonstrably outweigh that harm or loss or where the 
applicant can demonstrate that:  
i) the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the si te; and  
ii) no viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term 
through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and  
iii) conservation by grant -funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public 
ownership is  demonstrably not possible; and  
iv) the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.  
3. Development proposals that would result in less than substantial harm to the 
significance of a listed building will be expected to:  
i) minimise harm and avoid adverse impacts, and provide justification for any 
adverse impacts, harm or loss of significance;  
ii) identify any demonstrable public benefits or exceptional circumstances in 
relation to the development proposed; and  
iii) investiga te and record changes or loss of fabric, features, objects or remains, 
both known and unknown, in a manner proportionate to the importance of the 
change or loss, and to make this information publicly accessible.  
4. Changes of use will be supported where it  can be demonstrated that the new use 
can be accommodated without any adverse effect on the significance of the building 
and its setting.  
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
291 Justification for inclusion of policy  
15.10.  Within East Devon around 4 ,600 buildings and structures are “listed” (include d on a 
register known as the List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest) due 
to their special architectural or historic interest at a national level. When a building or 
structure is listed, it is listed in its entirety, which means tha t both the exterior and the 
interior are protected which includes interior features and fabric such as staircases, 
panelling, roof structures, floors, walls, fireplaces, doors etc. In addition, any object or 
structure fixed to the building, and any object or structure within the curtilage of the 
building, which although not fixed to the building, forms part of the land and has done so 
since before 1 July 1948, are treated as being part of the listed building. Occasionally 
land will form part of the setting of a heritage asset despite lying some distance away, 
for example where there is a historical or functional association.  
15.11.  Many listed buildings, due to their age and construction, have features which could 
support roosting bats. To ensure compliance with r elevant legislation, species survey 
information will be required, and ecological conditions applied to consents granted, in 
instances where proposed works to listed buildings would be reasonably likely to impact 
roosting bats .  
 
104. Policy  - Conservation Areas   
1. Proposals for development within or affecting the setting of a Conservation Area 
must conserve or enhance its special interest, character, setting and appearance. 
Development will be expected to:  
i)  contribute to the Conservation Area’s special inte rest and its relationship within 
its setting. The special characteristics of the Conservation Area (such as 
existing walls, buildings, trees, hedges, burgage plots, traditional shopfronts 
and signs, farm groups, medieval townscapes, archaeological features , historic 
routes etc.) should be preserved;  
ii)  take into account important views within, into or out of the Conservation Area 
and show that these would be retained and unharmed;  
iii)  respect the local character and distinctiveness of the Conservation A rea in 
terms of the development’s: siting; size; scale; height; alignment; materials and 
finishes (including colour and texture); proportions; design; and form and 
should have regard to any relevant Conservation Area Character Appraisal;  
iv)  be sympatheti c to the original curtilage of buildings and pattern of development 
that forms part of the historic interest of the Conservation Area;  
v)  be sympathetic to important spaces such as paddocks, greens, gardens and 
other gaps or spaces between buildings which  make a positive contribution to 
the pattern of development in the Conservation Area;  
vi)  ensure the wider social and environmental effects generated by the 
development are compatible with the existing character and appearance of the 
Conservation Area; an d/or East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
292 vii)  ensure no loss of, or harm to any building or feature that makes a positive 
contribution to the special interest, character or appearance of the 
Conservation Area.  
2. Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to or total loss of  
significance of a Conservation Area, consent will only be granted where it can be 
demonstrated that the substantial harm is necessary to achieve substantial public 
benefits that outweigh that harm or loss.  
 
3. Where a development proposal will lead to les s than substantial harm to the 
significance of a Conservation Area, this harm will be weighed against the public 
benefits of the proposal.  
 
4. Wherever possible the sympathetic restoration and re -use of structures which 
make a positive contribution to the special interest, character or appearance of the 
Conservation Area will be encouraged to prevent harm through the cumulative loss of 
features which are an asset to the Conservation Area.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
15.12.  There are 33 Conservation Ar eas in East Devon, covering parts of all the main towns 
(except Cranbrook) and the historic cores of many smaller settlements. Section 69 of 
the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 describes 
Conservation Areas as “areas of special a rchitectural or historic interest, the character 
or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance”. Inevitably, these areas 
will vary greatly. Attractive groups of buildings, open spaces, trees and hedgerows, an 
historic settlement pattern, or  features of archaeological interest, may all contribute to 
the special character of an area, and it is that character, rather than individual buildings, 
which Conservation Area legislation seeks to preserve and enhance.  This does not 
mean that they cannot  develop; change is often necessary to accommodate the 
demands of modern living as our historic towns and village centres are always likely to 
attract new development. Any development would, however need to preserve or 
enhance the character of the area and  may require planning permission and/or planning 
permission for demolition in a conservation area.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
293  
FIGURE 22.  Colyford Conservation Area buildings  
15.13.  A feature in some town centres are ‘burgage plots’. Surviving patterns of burgage plots 
have considerable historic an d archaeological significance and contribute much to the 
character of the market towns, Honiton in particular.  
15.14.  When undertaking Conservation Area Appraisals the opportunity will be taken to 
produce and update lists of locally important non -designated heri tage assets and 
identification of any heritage assets ‘at risk’ in order to encourage better understanding.  
 
105. Policy  – Archaeology and Scheduled Monuments   
1. Development must protect the site and setting of Scheduled Monuments or 
nationally important desi gnated or undesignated archaeological remains, including 
ancient routeways and milestones.  
 
2. Applicants will be expected to undertake an assessment of appropriate detail to 
determine whether the development site is likely to contain archaeological remain s. 
Proposals must show how the development proposals have had regard to any such 
remains.  
 
3. Where the assessment indicates archaeological remains on site, and development 
could disturb or adversely affect archaeological remains and/or their setting, 
applicants will be expected to:  
i)  submit an appropriate archaeological desk -based assessment; or  
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
294 ii)  undertake a field evaluation (conducted by a suitably qualified archaeological 
organisation), where necessary.  
 
4. Nationally important archaeological remai ns (whether scheduled or demonstrably 
of equivalent significance) should be preserved in situ. Non -designated 
archaeological sites or deposits of significance equal to that of a nationally important 
monument will be assessed as though those sites or deposi ts are designated.  
 
5. Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to or total loss of 
significance of such remains consent will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that the substantial harm or loss is necessary to achieve substan tial 
public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss.  
 
6. Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the 
significance of such remains, this harm will be weighed against the public benefits of 
the proposal.  
 
7. For other archaeo logical remains, the effect of a development proposal on the 
significance of the remains, either directly or indirectly, will be taken into account in 
determining the application.  
 
8. In exceptional cases, where harm to or loss of significance to the asset  is 
considered to be justified, the harm should be minimised, and mitigated by a 
programme of archaeological investigation, including excavation, recording and 
analysis. Planning permission will not be granted until this programme has been 
submitted to, an d approved by, the Council and development should not commence 
until these works have been satisfactorily undertaken by an appropriately qualified 
organisation. The results and analysis of findings subsequent to the investigation 
should be published and ma de available to the relevant local and county authorities.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
15.15.  East Devon has a significant archaeological heritage which is a finite and non -
renewable resource with great social, economic, cultural and educational valu e. Around 
200 archaeological sites and monuments are designated as Scheduled Monuments and 
are legally protected under the terms of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological 
Areas Act.   
15.16.  The Devon Historic Environment Record, maintained by the County Council , also 
includes numerous other sites of local interest but, due to their size, form and the large 
numbers added to the record annually, it is not practical for the P olicies  Map to identify 
them.  The record is available for applicants to view.   East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
295 15.17.  A network of  historic routes also exist as archaeological features in the district, ranging 
from pre -historic tracks, Roman roads, sunken lanes to later turnpike roads. These 
routes are integrated into the district’s landscape and serve an important function in 
linkin g settlements and forming a unique setting for the district’s distinctive landscape 
features and will therefore be protected.  
 
106. Policy  – Historic Landscapes, parks and gardens  
1. Proposals should conserve or enhance the special historic interest, character  or 
setting of a park or garden on the Historic England Register of Historic Parks and 
Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.  
 
2. Any harm to or loss of significance of any heritage asset requires clear and 
convincing justification. Substantial h arm to or loss of these assets should be wholly 
exceptional in the case of Grade I and Grade II* Registered Historic Parks and 
Gardens and exceptional in the case of Grade II Registered Historic Parks and 
Gardens.  
 
3. Where a proposed development will lead  to substantial harm to or total loss of 
significance of a designated heritage asset, consent will only be granted where it can 
be demonstrated that the substantial harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial 
public benefits that outweigh that harm or  loss. All other options for their conservation 
or use must have been explored.  
 
4. A balanced judgment, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the 
significance of the heritage asset, will be required in assessing proposals affecting 
non-desig nated historic parks and historic landscapes (including historic routes and 
battlefields).  
 
5. Applicants will be required to describe, in line with best practice and relevant 
national guidance, the significance of any heritage assets affected including an y 
contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the 
asset’s importance. In some circumstances planning conditions will require further 
survey, analysis and recording.  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
15.18.  Historic la ndscapes, parks and gardens are an important part of East Devon’s heritage 
and environment. They comprise a variety of features including the open space itself, 
views in and out, archaeological remains and, in the case of parks or gardens, a 
conscious desi gn incorporating planting and water features, and frequently buildings. 
Historic landscapes are also important for their green infrastructure and biodiversity 
value. There is a need to protect such sites and their settings and to encourage 
sympathetic mana gement wherever possible.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
296 15.19.  The most important sites have been included on the “Historic England Register of 
Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England” and/or on the 
National Heritage List for England. In addition to the nationally important registered sites 
the district has several other sites of regional or local importance that should also be 
protected from harm, and enhanced where possible.  
  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
297 Chapter 16.  Ensuring we have community 
buildings and facilities  
 
16.1.  Thriving communities are reliant on  having spaces and buildings to meet and for 
community based activities to take place. Without such spaces many communities 
would not survive and would not provide the support mechanisms that are needed for 
the health and wellbeing of their residents.  
 
FIGURE 23.  Littleham Leisure Centre  
 
107. Policy  – New or extended community facilities  
Planning permission for new community spaces and buildings  will only be granted 
where all of the tes ts set out below are satisfied:  
 Provision must  be within or adjoining or physically close to and well related  to 
the built up areas or edges of a settlement  or new development at that 
settlement or development proposed under plan policy or land allocation.  
 Development will be designed  to serve a local community need and will be 
proportion ate to the needs of that community.  
 Where possible development proposals should promote the sharing of spaces 
and facilities  with a range of uses and activities .  
 
Justification for inclusion of policy   
16.2.  Facilities such as schools, libraries, halls, heal th and sports centres and Places of 
Worship fulfil an important role as a focus for social activities taking place in the local 
community. Community centres and village halls are already established in many 
settlements in East Devon, and where appropriatel y sited or proposed the Council will 
encourage the expansion of or new provision of these types of uses.   
16.3.  It is essential that in areas where substantial new development is proposed, and in 
areas lacking facilities, that provision be made for community an d education facilities. 
Consideration should be given to the establishment of multi -purpose buildings that 
East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
298 accommodate a variety of uses and users.  Examples include Post Office, cyber -cafe, 
health visitor, playgroup, facilities for the elderly and a range  of clubs and societies. The 
definition of community facilities does not include residential development, either in 
isolation or as a means of providing community facilities.  
16.4.  The Council will encourage the temporary use of a residential house or other 
appropriate building for community activities in the following instances:  
 Where there is a perceived demand which needs to be proven prior to the 
construction of a permanent community facility.  
 Where a large development is proposed and a building is required t o encourage 
an embryonic community facility to establish at an early stage of construction. In 
this case the developer will be required to make the provision.  
16.5.  The Council will not permit the construction of a new residential house to be used 
temporarily fo r community purposes, where a residential use would conflict with other 
policies of the Local Plan.  An instance of this is outside Built -up Area Boundaries, 
within open countryside.  Any planning permission for new community facilities may be 
granted on a  temporary basis.  It may limit the type of activity carried out in the building 
and/or the hours of operation.  
Loss of community facilities  
16.6.  Given the importance of existing community facilities it is seen as essential that we seek 
to retain existing facil ities and avoid their loss to other forms of development.  
 
108. Policy  – Loss of community facilities  
 
Planning Permission will not be granted for developments that would result in the loss 
or closure of a community facility unless at least one of the tests se t out below is met:  
 the community facility is no longer needed or is not viable;  
 an alternative facility of equal or higher value is being provided  as an explicit 
replacement for that facility . 
 
Justification for inclusion of policy  
16.7.  Policy of the local p lan will resist the loss of community facilities unless they are clearly 
not needed, not used or surplus to requirements.  
 
 East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
299 Chapter 17.  Implementation and monitoring of 
the local plan   
Infrastructure provision  
 
17.1.  The delivery of infrastructure alongside housing and econ omic development is vital in 
creating sustainable communities.  Transport, flood risk measures, utilities connections, 
and habitat mitigation are often critical to allow new development to take place; whilst 
people should be able to access facilities such as education, health, open space and 
play areas on a day -to-day basis.  
17.2.  Infrastructure can be funded and delivered in a variety of ways.  New development is 
required to address its direct impacts by directly providing infrastructure or paying for it, 
throug h planning obligations, also known as section 106 agreements and where 
relevant under legal agreements for highway works. Under legislation there are specific 
tests that need to be met.  The council also charges Community Infrastructure Levy, 
which is coll ected when new homes are built and put into a ‘pot’ for future infrastructure 
projects.  Sometimes grants or loans to fund infrastructure from national or local 
government may become available.  Infrastructure may also be funded by organisations 
that have statutory powers and funding drawn from charges to customers (e.g. utilities 
companies), or central Government (e.g. works to protect existing development from 
flooding).  
17.3.  As local plan making progresses we will need to undertake detailed assessment of 
infrastructure needs and how we p lan for provision.  
Monitoring  
17.4.  It is essential that the Local Plan is capable of being delivered and isn’t just a wish list of 
proposals that have little chance of being implemented. Every policy in this Local Plan 
recognises th at there is an issue or consideration to which the council needs to 
respond. Accordingly, for each policy the council needs to set out the intended 
outcomes for its implementation, and how the policy’s success can be measured.  
17.5.  Monitoring is a key means to assessing the success of any given policy. To ensure this 
is the case, each year the council will produce a series of report which, in total, will 
comprise its statutory Annual Monitoring Report.  
17.6.  These will include, but not be limited to, the following doc uments:  
Housing Monitoring Update (HMU)  
17.7.  The NPPF states that “to maintain the supply of housing, local planning authorities 
should monitor progress in building out sites which have permission”; this report will 
include housing completions figures for the p revious 12 months, including:  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
300  Total net completions district wide (including by parish, settlement and Built -up 
Area);  
 Breakdown of completions on brownfield and greenfield sites;  
 Affordable housing.  
17.8.  The NPPF also stipulates that “local planning authoritie s should identify and update 
annually a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide a minimum of five 
years’ worth of housing against their housing requirement set out in adopted strategic 
policies”. Therefore the HMU will also include:  
 Hous ing projections and a trajectory for the Local Plan period;  
 Five Year Housing Land Supply calculations (for the western side of East Devon , 
the rest of East Devon and the district as a whole);  
 Housing Delivery Test results.  
Employment Land Review (ELR)  
17.9.  This report will provide an assessment of employment land availability at a given point 
each year in East Devon. It will identify the major employment sites and business parks 
in the district and within these employment areas record and highlight:  
 Plots of la nd and building floorspace that has been developed;  
 Vacant or undeveloped plots of land that could be suitable for future business 
development.  
17.10.  The ELR will also include:  
 A district wide analysis of Non Domestic Rated (NDR) and Vacant NDR units at 
employme nt sites, commenting on identified uses of units, numbers and 
distribution across the district;  
 Information on wage levels;  
 Unemployment rates;  
 Employee/job numbers.  
Self and Custom -Build Demand and Supply monitoring report  
17.11.  This report will set out both t he demand for self -build in East Devon, as shown by the 
numbers on the council’s self -build register, and the supply of self -build plots in the 
district, assessed by the number granted planning permission throughout the year.  
Brownfield Land Register  
17.12.  The N PPF requires the council to encourage the effective use of land within settlements 
by reusing land that has been previously developed (brownfield land).  
17.13.  Since December 2017, the council has been legally required to prepare, maintain and 
publish a brownfiel d land register of sites. Registers help builders to identify potentially 
suitable brownfield sites for housing development, whilst data on sites is ‘harvested’ 
nationally.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
301 17.14.  To be included on the register, sites must be:  
 Suitable for residential developmen t, in accordance with policies in the adopted 
Local Plan and the NPPF;  
 Free from adverse impacts on the natural environment, habitats or built heritage 
that cannot be mitigated;  
 Viable and capable of being delivered within 5 years;  
 At least 0.25 hectares i n size or capable of supporting five or more dwellings;  
 Available for residential development (meaning that there is no impediment to 
development in terms of either ownership issues or legal constraints on the land).  
Additional monitoring  
17.15.  Other areas that will require monitoring include:  
 Section 106 / CIL Developer Contributions;  
 Heritage Strategy;  
 Gypsy and Traveller Sites;  
 Neighbourhood Plans;  
 Planning Appeals.

302 Chapter 18.  Have we missed anything?   
 
18.1.  In this draft plan we have tried to cover all of the key matters t hat come up on a 
reasonably regular basis and that need to be addressed through planning policy.  We 
cannot, however, be expected to cover every single possible issues or matter  or every 
single type or form of development that might be proposed, to do so w ould make the 
plan far too long and complicated.  Very occasionally, therefore there may be planning 
applications that need to be determined where there is no direct or limited direct policy 
coverage.  In such cases applicat ions may need to be determined o n the basis of what 
policy there is and also a balanced judgment of relevant factors that apply to a proposal 
and other material considerations that can be drawn on.  
18.2.  We would, however, welcome your thoughts on any matters that you think we have 
failed to a ddress and which are of sufficient importance to need inclusion of a policy in 
the plan.

303 Chapter 19.  Glossary of terms  
 
 
The Government issue s planning guidance in the form of the National Planning Policy 
Framework (publishing.service.gov.uk)  
 
The NPPF includes a glossary of planning terms  which is reproduced below  
 
Affordable housing: housing for sale or rent, for those whose nee ds are not met by the  
market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is 
for essential local workers); and which complies with one or more of the following 
definitions:  
a) Affordable housing for rent: meets all of the following conditions: (a) the rent is set in 
accordance with the Government’s rent policy for Social Rent or Affordable Rent, or is 
at least 20% below local market rents (including service charges where applicable); (b) 
the landlord is a registered provide r, except where it is included as part of a Build to 
Rent scheme (in which case the landlord need not be a registered provider); and (c) it 
includes provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households, or for 
the subsidy to be recycl ed for alternative affordable housing provision. For Build to Rent 
schemes affordable housing for rent is expected to be the normal form of affordable 
housing provision (and, in this context, is known as Affordable Private Rent).  
b) Starter homes: is as s pecified in Sections 2 and 3 of the Housing and Planning Act 
2016 and any secondary legislation made under these sections. The definition of a 
starter home should reflect the meaning set out in statute and any such secondary 
legislation at the time of plan -preparation or decision -making. Where secondary 
legislation has the effect of limiting a household’s eligibility to purchase a starter home 
to those with a particular maximum level of household income, those restrictions should 
be used.  
c) Discounted mar ket sales housing: is that sold at a discount of at least 20% below 
local market value. Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local house 
prices. Provisions should be in place to ensure housing remains at a discount for future 
eligible  households.  
d) Other affordable routes to home ownership: is housing provided for sale that provides 
a route to ownership for those who could not achieve home ownership through the 
market. It includes shared ownership, relevant equity loans, other low cos t homes for 
sale (at a price equivalent to at least 20% below local market value) and rent to buy 
(which includes a period of intermediate rent). Where public grant funding is provided, 
there should be provisions for the homes to remain at an affordable pr ice for future 
eligible households, or for any receipts to be recycled for alternative affordable housing 
provision, or refunded to Government or the relevant authority specified in the funding 
agreement.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
304 Air quality management areas: Areas designated by local authorities because they are 
not likely to achieve national air quality objectives by the relevant deadlines.  
Ancient or veteran tree: A tree which, because of its age, size and condition, is of 
exceptional biodiversity, cultural or heritage value. A ll ancient trees are veteran trees. 
Not all veteran trees are old enough to be ancient, but are old relative to other trees of 
the same species. Very few trees of any species reach the ancient life -stage.  
Ancient woodland: An area that has been wooded cont inuously since at least 1600 AD.  
It includes ancient semi -natural woodland and plantations on ancient woodland sites  
Annual position statement: A document setting out the 5 year housing land supply 
position on 1st April each year, prepared by the local pl anning authority in consultation 
with developers and others who have an impact on delivery.  
Archaeological interest: There will be archaeological interest in a heritage asset if it 
holds, or potentially holds, evidence of past human activity worthy of expe rt 
investigation at some point.  
Article 4 direction: A direction made under Article 4 of the Town and Country Planning 
(General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 which withdraws permitted 
development rights granted by that Order.  
Best and most v ersatile agricultural land: Land in grades 1, 2 and 3a of the Agricultural 
Land Classification.  
Brownfield land: See Previously developed land.  
Brownfield land registers: Registers of previously developed land that local planning 
authorities consider to be  appropriate for residential development, having regard to 
criteria in the Town and Country Planning (Brownfield Land Registers) Regulations 
2017. Local planning authorities will be able to trigger a grant of permission in principle 
for residential develop ment on suitable sites in their registers where they follow the 
required procedures.  
Build to Rent: Purpose built housing that is typically 100% rented out. It can form part of 
a wider multi -tenure development comprising either flats or houses, but should  be on 
the same site and/or contiguous with the main development. Schemes will usually offer 
longer tenancy  agreements of three years or more, and will typically be professionally 
managed stock in single ownership and management control.  
Climate change ada ptation: Adjustments made to natural or human systems in 
response to the actual or anticipated impacts of climate change, to mitigate harm or 
exploit beneficial opportunities.  
Climate change mitigation: Action to reduce the impact of human activity on the climate 
system, primarily through reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
Coastal change management area: An area identified in plans as likely to be affected by 
physical change to the shoreline through erosion, coastal landslip, permanent 
inundation or coastal  accretion.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
305 Community forest: An area identified through the England Community Forest 
Programme to revitalise countryside and green space in and around major 
conurbations.  
Community Right to Build Order: An Order made by the local planning authority (unde r

recognised relevant qualification, s ufficient experience in dealing with the type(s) of 
pollution or land instability, and membership of a relevant professional organisation.  
Conservation (for heritage policy): The process of maintaining and managing change to 
a heritage asset in a way that sustains and, where appropriate, enhances its 
significance.  
Decentralised energy: Local renewable and local low carbon energy sources. 
Deliverable: To be considered deliverable, sites for housing should be available now, 
offer a suitable location for devel opment now, and be achievable with a realistic 
prospect that housing will be delivered on the site within five years. In particular:  
a) sites which do not involve major development and have planning permission, and all 
sites with detailed planning permissi on, should be considered deliverable until 
permission expires, unless there is clear evidence that homes will not be delivered 
within five years (for example because they are no longer viable, there is no longer a 
demand for the type of units or sites have  long term phasing plans).  
b) where a site has outline planning permission for major development, has been 
allocated in a development plan, has a grant of permission in principle, or is identified 
on a brownfield register, it should only be considered deli verable where there is clear 
evidence that housing completions will begin on site within five years.  
Design code: A set of illustrated design requirements that provide specific, detailed  
parameters for the physical development of a site or area. The graphi c and written 
components of the code should build upon a design vision, such as a masterplan or 
other design and development framework for a site or area.  
Design guide: A document providing guidance on how development can be carried out 
in accordance with  good design practice, often produced by a local authority. 
Designated heritage asset: A World Heritage Site, Scheduled Monument, Listed 
Building, Protected Wreck Site, Registered Park and Garden, Registered Battlefield or 
Conservation Area designated unde r the relevant legislation.  
Designated rural areas: National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and areas 
designated as ‘rural’ under Section 157 of the Housing Act 1985.  
Developable: To be considered developable, sites should be in a suitable loca tion for 
housing development with a reasonable prospect that they will be available and could 
be viably developed at the point envisaged.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
306 Development plan: Is defined in section 38 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase 
Act 2004, and includes adopted loca l plans, neighbourhood plans that have been made 
and published spatial development strategies, together with any regional strategy 
policies that remain in force. Neighbourhood plans that have been approved at 
referendum are also part of the development pla n, unless the local planning authority 
decides that the neighbourhood plan should not be made.  
Edge of centre: For retail purposes, a location that is well connected to, and up to 300 
metres from, the primary shopping area. For all other main town centre u ses, a location 
within 300 metres of a town centre boundary. For office development, this includes 
locations outside the town centre but within 500 metres of a public transport 
interchange.  In determining whether a site falls within the definition of edge of centre, 
account should be taken of local circumstances.  
Entry -level exception site: A site that provides entry -level homes suitable for first time 
buyers (or equivalent, for those looking to rent), in line with paragraph 72 of this 
Framework.  
Environmen tal impact assessment: A procedure to be followed for certain types of

Previously developed land: Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, 
including the curtilage of the developed l and (although it should not be assumed that the 
whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface 
infrastructure. This excludes: land that is or was last occupied by agricultural or forestry 
buildings; land that has been develope d for minerals extraction or waste disposal by 
landfill, where provision for restoration has been made through development

carbon technologies are those that can help reduce emissions (compared to 
conventional use of fossil fuels).  
Rural exception sites: Small sites used for affordable housing in perpetuity where sites 
would not normally be used for housing. Rural exception sites seek to address the 
needs of the local community by accommodating households who are either current 
residents or have an existing family or employmen t connection. A proportion of market 
homes may be allowed on the site at the local planning authority’s discretion, for 
example where essential to enable the delivery of affordable units without grant funding.

bound materials.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022  
311 Self-build and custom -build housing: Housing built by an individual, a group of 
individuals, or persons w orking with or for them, to be occupied by that individual. Such 
housing can be either market or affordable housing. A legal definition, for the purpose of 
applying the Self -build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 (as amended), is contained 
in section 1(A1 ) and (A2) of that Act.  
Setting of a heritage asset: The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. 
Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. 
Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribut ion to the significance of 
an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral.  
Significance (for heritage policy): The value of a heritage asset to this and future 
generations because of its heritage interest. The interest m ay be archaeological, 
architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s 
physical presence, but also from its setting. For World Heritage Sites, the cultural value 
described within each site’s Statement of Outstandin g Universal Value forms part of its 
significance.  
Special Areas of Conservation: Areas defined by regulation 3 of the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 which have been given special protection as 
important conservation sites.  
Special P rotection Areas: Areas classified under regulation 15 of the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 which have been identified as being of 
international importance for the breeding, feeding, wintering or the migration of rare and 
vulnerable species of birds.  
Site investigation information: Includes a risk assessment of land potentially affected by 
contamination, or ground stability and slope stability reports, as appropriate. All 
investigations of land potentially affected by contamination sh ould be carried out in 
accordance with established procedures (such as BS10175 Investigation of Potentially 
Contaminated Sites – Code of Practice).  
Site of Special Scientific Interest: Sites designated by Natural England under the  
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.  
Spatial development strategy: A plan containing strategic policies prepared by a Mayor 
or a combined authority. It includes the London Plan (prepared under provisions in the 
Greater London Authority Act 1999) and plans prepared by combined author ities that 
have been given equivalent plan -making functions by an order made under the Local 
Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 (as amended).  
Stepping stones: Pockets of habitat that, while not necessarily connected, facilitate the 
movement of species across otherwise inhospitable landscapes.  
Strategic environmental assessment: A procedure (set out in the Environmental 
Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004) which requires the formal 
environmental assessment of certain p lans and programmes which are likely to have 
significant effects on the environment.  East Devon  Local Plan – Consultation draft - November 2022

with the requirements of Section 19 (1B -E) of the Planning and Compulsory Purc hase 
Act 2004.  
Strategic policy -making authorities: Those authorities responsible for producing 
strategic policies (local planning authorities, and elected Mayors or combined 
authorities, where this power has been conferred). This definition applies whethe r the 
authority is in the process of producing strategic policies or not.  
Supplementary planning documents: Documents which add further detail to the policies 
in the development plan. They can be used to provide further guidance for development 
on specifi c sites, or on particular issues, such as design. Supplementary planning 
documents are capable of being a material consideration in planning decisions but are 
not part of the development plan.  
Sustainable transport modes: Any efficient, safe and accessible  means of transport with 
overall low impact on the environment, including walking and cycling, ultra-low and zero 
emission vehicles, car sharing and public transport.  
Town centre: Area defined on the local authority’s policies map, including the primary 
shopping area and areas predominantly occupied by main town centre uses within or 
adjacent to the primary shopping area. References to town centres or centres apply to 
city centres, town centres, district centres and local centres but exclude small parades 
of shops of purely neighbourhood significance. Unless they are identified as centres in 
the development plan, existing out -of-centre developments, comprising or including 
main town centre uses, do not constitute town centres.  
Transport assessment: A compreh ensive and systematic process that sets out transport 
issues relating to a proposed development. It identifies measures required to improve 
accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alternatives to the car 
such as walking, cycling and public transport, and measures that will be needed deal 
with the anticipated transport impacts of the development.  
Transport statement: A simplified version of a transport assessment where it is agreed 
the transport issues arising from development prop osals are limited and a full transport 
assessment is not required.  
Travel plan: A long -term management strategy for an organisation or site that seeks to 
deliver sustainable transport objectives and is regularly reviewed.  
Wildlife corridor: Areas of habita t connecting wildlife populations.  
Windfall sites: Sites not specifically identified in the development plan.
