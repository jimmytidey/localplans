  Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan 2022 – 2037: Foreword 
Foreword 
Spelthorne’s Local Plan has been many years in the making, with many bumps along 
the road. The journey has not just been difficult and challenging, it has gone way 
beyond that. It has been divisive, bruising and at times unpleasant. It has fractured 
communities and turned councillors against each other. The reason for the acrimony is 
easy to discern: the government’s brutal housing targets which eclipse everything else 
in the Plan -making process. 
Forget the semantics that it is a ‘housing need’ figure; it is for all practical purposes a 
rigid target. Every statement by an MP that it is not mandatory looks increasingly 
vacuous as authority after authority has seen their plan fail at the housing number 
hurdle. 
We are charged by the government to keep our Plan ‘up to date’, but to do this we are 
forced to use data that is now a decade old and we have been specifically banned from 
using more up -to-date figures. No Spelthorne councillor wants to build on our Green 
Belt, nor do we want to populate our town centres with sterile, high -rise blocks. But that 
is what Westminster is demanding. 
We all recognise the need for new homes, especially affordable housing, but 618 homes 
per year, compared to the target of 166 in our Core Strategy from 2009, repre sents an 
increase that will damage our environment and ruin the character of our small and highly 
constrained borough. We have repeatedly and consistently challenged the Government 
to review its methodology, but to no avail. The Government methodology is deeply 
flawed and is focused on a misleading algorithm for what is needed without any real 
consideration of what is possible. So as a Council we are faced with producing a Plan 
that pleases no one or having no Plan at all. The methodology we are required to use to 
calculate our housing need uses household growth projections from 2014 but using the 
subsequent figures would give us a need of 347 homes per year and therefore would 
have a significantly moderated impact on the Borough. 
Other authorities, in tr ying to find acceptable solutions, have made no progress over 
years of seemingly futile attempts to advance their Plans that do not meet the imposed 
housing need. This approach runs the very real risk of leaving planning decisions to be 
made in a local po licy vacuum. The outcome of recent Planning Appeal decisions has 
demonstrated how vulnerable Spelthorne is when we are unable to demonstrate our 
progress and ability to meet our housing targets. 
The decision of this Council to produce a Plan that does mee t the imposed housing 
target means that we will have policies in place that allow us to defend the Borough 
against damaging developments in our most precious areas. 
Although most of the attention is understandably focused on housing numbers, the Plan 
also includes important policies that reflect our local concerns and needs. 
• A robust Affordable Housing policy that will see us increase significantly the number 
of homes that meet the needs of our community. 
• Actions to address the effects of climate cha nge and protect and enhance local 
biodiversity.           
 
 
            
          
  
       
   
        
       
   
           
             
           
            
      
  
              
            
         
      
   
             
        
        
         
           
        
         
          
            
          
          
          
          
           
          
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
   
   
 
 
  
     
 
  
 
  
  
  
 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan 2022 – 2037: Foreword 
• A strategy to make sure that there is infrastructure in place to support existing and 
future residents, with a delivery plan that sets out how this will be achieved and 
funded. 
• Policies that will suppor t economic recovery and encourage more employment into 
the borough. 
• A new Staines Development Framework will help the Borough’s largest town to 
develop and grow in as sensitive a way as possible and that takes account of its 
existing assets and distinct ive character. 
In order to demonstrate the ability to meet the imposed housing targets, it has proved 
necessary to release some Green Belt land. Our Plan calls for the release of 0.7% of 
the existing Green Belt area. This is being done with the greatest r eluctance and on the 
basis that it will ensure protection of our largest and most valued open spaces. Before 
any Green Belt release was contemplated, every possible area of previously developed 
land was considered in detail. 
The focus of our efforts on th is Local Plan has been first and foremost to represent the 
interests of all our residents. Whilst we have had our hands tied by the Government on 
many aspects of the Plan, we have done our best to minimise the environmental impact 
and define constructive p olicies to arrive at a compromise that delivers a workable 
strategy for this Borough. 
It is councillors who are responsible for agreeing the final shape of the Plan, but the 
massive amount of complex and detailed work has been done by a small group of 
Council officers. This has taken several years and crossed three political 
administrations. Our officers have answered hundreds of questions, many of them 
more than once. The Plan documents have been produced by these officers with great 
professionalism, considerable hard work and exemplary patience. It is their advice and 
guidance which will be minutely tested by the Inspector and other interested parties. As 
councillors we recognise the enormous amount of hard work that the officers have done 
to get to the Regulation 19 stage, and we thank them for their efforts. 
There are no councillors who would willing endorse every aspect of this Plan and the net 
effect will be to increase housing densities and make Spelthorne a less attractive place 
to live. However, on balance we believe that by carefully considering all the available 
options and t he constraints imposed by central government, it is better for all residents 
that we put forward our proposals, framed by our understanding of local needs, rather 
than run the very real risk of planning decisions being taken out of our hands.

         Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan 2022 – 2037: Introduction 
1. Introduction 
What is a Local Plan? 
1.1 The Spelthorne Local Plan, which has been prepared by the Council in consultation 
with the community, sets out the policies and allocations that will guide how new 
development and infrastructure comes forward in the Borough for the next 15 years. 
The Local Plan supports the sustainable growth of Spelthorne in a planned way, 
which benefits our communities, environment and economy. 
1.2 The Local Plan is a statutory document that forms part of the Council’s strategy to 
deliver sustainable development, tackle clim ate change and deliver new homes , jobs 
and infrastructure for current and future Spelthorne residents. The Local Plan sits 
within a wider framework of planning documents, including national guidance set out 
by the government in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), regional and 
county planning policies and guidance, strategic plans, supporting strategies and 
background studies. The Local Plan will form the basis on which planning 
applications will be determined in Spelthorne. 
1.3 The Local Plan compris es various parts to be read as a whole. Our destination and 
objectives set out what the Spelthorne Local Plan is aiming to achieve and the 
policies and land designations to support their delivery. The policies are split into the 
high-level strategic polici es and allocations, which set out the overall strategy and 
overarching principles for the Local Plan . The plan also includes the detailed policies 
which set out the design and technical criteria against which proposed development 
will be assessed. 
1.4 To supp ort the Local Plan the Council can prepare additional guidance, which sets 
out how a policy is to be implemented in greater detail. These documents are called 
Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs). The Council will prepare and update 
SPDs, where required to support the successful delivery of the Local Plan. 
1.5 The Staines Development Framework (SDF) is a key SPD. It demonstrates how the 
town can grow in a sustainable and sensitive way, delivering for our residents, while 
offering the necessary protection to areas. Critically the SDF is rooted in a 
commercial reality, essential in demonstrating that Staines can successfully 
accommodate the growth required for the Local Plan to be successfully delivered, 
while providing much needed homes for our residents, imp roving the infrastructure 
and addressing climate change. 
Why is it important we have a Local Plan? 
1.6 All Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) are required by the Government, to provide a 
long-term plan setting out how we will meet our future needs. In Speltho rne, as in 
much of Surrey and the South East, successfully and sustainably accommodating this 
growth and new development presents a real challenge. This challenge is all the 
greater in Spelthorne as a result of our extensive Green Belt , much of which 
compr ises waterbodies and the amount of the Borough at risk of flooding, which limits 
our supply of land suitable and available for the level of development required to meet         
 
 
            
             
          
               
          
       
         
         
       
       
 
 
 
        
       
     
         
        
       
      
      
 
   
         
        
        
           
      
          
            
      
       
     
      
   
  
     
 
 
 
 
 
    
 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan 2022 – 2037: Introduction 
our housing need. An up to date, evidence based Local Plan allows us as a Borough 
to take a proactive approach to planning for and manging growth in a way that most 
benefits our present and future residents, while protecting what is most important. 
1.7 If we do not have a Local Plan development will still take place, however we will not 
be able to use our own policies to determine the type and location of development, 
which may result in increased risk to, for example, our strategically important Green 
Belt, attractive open spaces and heritage assets. We will also be less able to require 
the improvements to our infrastructure, such as highways and green and blue 
infrastructure, which are essential to support additional development and deliver a 
wide range of be nefits for our residents. 
How are Local Plans prepared? 
1.8 Local plans must be positively prepared, justified, effective and consistent with 
national policy, in accordance with section 20 of the Planning and Compulsory 
Purchase Act 2004 (as amended) and the NPPF. 
1.9 In preparing the Local Plan there are a several stages which must be undertaken. 
The process involves the gathering and analysis of the evidence necessary to 
support decision making, extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders 
includin g our residents, businesses, neighbouring authorities and other public sector 
partners, statutory bodies and the development industry. 
Issues and Options Consultation 2018 
1.10 The first consultation on the emerging Local Plan (Regulation 18 consultation) too k 
place in May and June 2018. The Council consulted on the Spelthorne Issues and 
Options Consultation Paper1, which set out the key issues affecting Spelthorne and 
the options considered for how we could meet our needs. The paper identified the 
challenges and constraints for development as well as the opportunities Spelthorne 
offers for growth and set out four strategic options for development, a brownfield 
focus ; a Green Belt focus ; a Staines focus ; or a combination of the above. 
1.11 The key issues raised du ring the consultation were as follows: 
• Concern over an increase in high rise development

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan 2022 – 2037: Introduction 
Preferred Options Consultation 2019 
1.12 The public consultation on the Spelthorne Local Plan Preferred Options2 document 
took place between Nov ember 2019 and January 2020. The Consultation took the 
form of Policies and Site Allocations documents, setting out the prefer red approaches 
to be considered. The selection of sites follows the preferred strategy, following the 
previous consultation, to maximise building on land in urban areas such as town 
centres, particularly Staines -upon -Thames, and to consider releasing some 'weakly 
performing' Green Belt for development. 
1.13 The key issues raised during the consultation were as follows: 
• Highways related issues (congestion / highway safety) 
• Green Belt 
• Infrastructure 
• Housing 
• Biodiversity and wildlife 
• Pollution – Air / Noise / Water 
• Flooding 
• Site specific issues regarding proposed allocations 
Pre-Submission Publication Version 2022 
1.14 The public consultation on the final draft of the Local Plan (Regulation 19 
consultation) will take place from June to September 2022. The Pre -Submission 
Publication Version is the version of the Plan that the Council intends to submit to the 
Planning Insp ectorate for examination by an independent Inspector. Any proposed 
changes to the final draft Local Plan are submitted alongside the Plan for the 
Planning Inspector to decide which are appropriate. The Staines Development 
Framework as an SPD does not requi re submission to the Planning Inspectorate but 
as both documents are so intrinsically linked it is the right approach for them to be 
considered together. 
1.15 The starting point for a Local Plan examination is the assumption that the Council has 
submitted what it considers to be a sound plan. The plan is positively prepared, 
based on a strategy which seeks to meet objectively assessed development and 
infrastructure requirements; is justified by robust evidence; can be delivered; and is 
consistent with national p olicy. The Pre -Submission Publication version of the 
Spelthorne Local Plan is considered to meet the test of soundness and is therefore a 
step closer to examination and eventual adoption. 
What are the next steps? 
1.16 The Examination3 will be a series of open public sessions which members of the 
public can attend and observe. At the Examination, officers and expert consultants 
appointed by the Council will be questioned by the inspector on how the Local Plan

meets the tests of soundne ss. It is usual for developers and landowners to attend, 
often legally represented by barristers, to speak in favour of or oppose elements of 
the plan. The Council will also be represented by a barrister. There are often complex 
legal and technical points to be made and defended. 
1.17 Members of the public and residents' associations who make representations during 
the Reg ulation 19 consultation will be asked if they wish to appear at the Examination 
in person and speak to the Planning Inspector directly on iss ues of importance to 
them. 
1.18 Following the Examination, the inspector will issue a report to set out whether the 
plan can be recommended for adoption and if not, what needs to be changed in order 
to be found sound. 
1.19 Once this has taken place, all Members of the Council will be asked to adopt the plan 
and the SDF at a formal meeting. If adopted, the policies in the Local Plan and the 
Staines Development Framework will carry full weight and supersede former policies 
in older documents.

  Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan 2022 – 2037: The Route to 2037 
2. The Route to 2037 
Spelthorne in 2022 
2.1 Located in Surrey, approximately 16 miles from central London, Spelthorne benefits 
from good transport links to both London and the southeast via both the road and rail 
network. In addition, the proximity of Heathrow Airport and easy access to Gatwick 
via the motorway network further serves to make the Borough accessible and 
attractive to both individuals and businesses. Covering an area of approximately 
19.75 sq miles, Spelthorne has a population of 99,900 and is home to over 7,500 
businesses including Pin ewood (Shepperton Studios), dnata and Woodgroup ltd. 
Kempton Park is a key visitor attraction. 
2.2 Located where the continuous built -up area of London gives way to a more dispersed 
pattern of urban areas and villages, the urban area of the Borough occupies ab out 
35% of the total area, while the land outside the urban area covers about 65% of the 
Borough and is designated as Green Belt. 
2.3 Spelthorne adjoins the River Thames and is crossed by two tributaries, the Ash and 
the Colne. The Borough is flat and low ly ing and consequently liable to flood. About 
20% of the urban area is liable to flood in a 1 in 100 year flood event or surrounded 
by flood water and over 49% of the urban area would be flooded in a 1 in 1000 year 
event.

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Strategy and Strategic Policies 
3. Strategy and Strategic Policies 
3.1 The Spelthorne Local Plan 2022 – 2037 sets out how we can achieve a sustainable 
future for Spelthorne that protects and enhances our Borough , delivers a wide range 
of benefits for ou r residents and meets our future housing needs 
3.2 The Plan seeks to deliver 9,270 homes over the Plan period, which equates to an 
average of 618 homes per year. This figure is Spelthorne’s objectively assessed 
need, based on the Government Standard methodolo gy, which is set out in the NPPF 
and the accompanying Planning Practice Guidance. 
3.3 In order to meet our housing need including need for Gypsy and Traveller sites , while 
managing the impact of new development on Staines, the Local Plan strategy agreed 
by the Council is to release a small amount (approximately 0.7% / 24.8 ha) of Green 
Belt. This approach will allow for more family homes with gardens to be built, as well 
as offering the opportunity for lower building heights in the more sensitive areas of 
Staines -upon -Thames. 
3.4 The Council considers that it is only possible to achieve this by meeting our housing 
need in full and by demonstrating Exception Circumstances to amend Green Belt 
boundaries through the production of this new Local Plan. 
ST1: Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development 
1) When determining development proposals the Council will take a positive approach 
that reflects the presumption in favour of sustainable development contained in the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) . The Council will work proactively with 
applicants with the aim of finding solutions that mean that proposals can be approved 
wherever possible, in order to secure development that improves the economic, social 
and environmental conditions in the Borough . 
2) Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Local Plan (and, where 
relevant, with policies in any neighbourhood plans adopted in the future) will be 
approved without delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. 
3) Where there are no policies relevant to the application or relevant policies are out of 
date at the time of making the decision, then the Council will grant permission unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise, taking into account whether: 
(a) the application of policies in the National Planning Policy Framework that 
protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for 
refusing the development proposed; or 
(b) any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and 
demonstrably outw eigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the 
National Planning Policy Framework taken as a whole.          
 
 
  
         
      
      
      
        
         
           
          
       
        
      
         
       
         
        
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
             
 
             
 
             
 
  
    
  Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Strategy and Strategic Policies 
Reasoned justification 
3.5 The NPPF emphasises that all Local Plans should be based upon and reflect the 
presumption in favour of sustainable development. The principle informs both the 
policies and site allocations contained within the ‘Local Plan: Strategy and Sites’ and 
will be used to guide decision makers. 
3.6 Local Planning Authorities are encouraged to include a policy within the ir Local Plan 
that embraces the presumption in favour of sustainable development. Policy ST1 
meets this requirement and adopts the model wording suggested. When 
implementing Policy ST1, local circumstances will be taken into account to respond to 
differe nt opportunities for achieving sustainable development. In accordance with 
policies in the NPPF that protect important natural and heritage assets, the 
presumption will not automatically apply to: habitats sites (including sites protected 
under the Birds and Habitats Directives) and/or designated as Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest (SSSIs), development requiring appropriate assessment because of 
its potential impact on a habitats site, land designated as Green Belt, or Local Green 
Space, designated her itage assets, and or locations identified as at risk of flooding.

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Strategy and Strategic Policies 
ST2: Planning for the Borough 
Spatial Development Strategy 
1) The housing requirement for Spelthorne is 6189 dwellings per annum over the plan 
period (2022 – 2037), a total of 9,270. During the plan period, provision has been 
made for at least 9, 270 new homes. Table 1 shows the contribution of all sources of 
housing supply. 
2) Economic growth in Spelthorne will be supported by maintaining and intensifying the 
use of the Borough ’s employment floorspace offer. This will be done by; 
• safeguarding employment land, 
• provision of new land in line with needs identified through the most up to date 
evidence and 
• encouraging its innovative re -use in ways that better meet the needs of the 
market. 
3) Provision for new permanent pitches for Gypsies and Travellers and new permanent 
plots for Travelling Showpeople (as defined by Planning Policy f or Traveller Sites) to 
meet the accommodation needs in the Borough which are identified in the most up -to-
date Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment (GTAA). 
4) The Council expects that all development proposals located within or adjacent to 
town/lo cal centres or a public transport interchange will seek to optimise the density of 
development, in order to make the most efficient use of the land in the most 
sustainable locations. 
5) The Council expects that all development will, at a scale proportionate to the proposal, 
make a positive contribution to achieving the relevant targets relating to climate 
change and Biodiversity Net Gain. 
Reasoned Justification 
3.7 National policy requires that we meet objectively assessed housing needs, including 
any unmet needs from neighbouring authorities, where it is practical to do so and 
consistent with achieving sustainable development. Spelthorne’s objectively 
assessed hous ing need has been based on the Government standard methodology 
set out in the NPPF 20 21 and accompanying Planning Practice Guidance . 
3.8 Spelthorne’s total housing supply over the plan period (2022 -2037) is indicated in the 
table below and will comprise homes from a variety of sources in addition to the Local 
Plan’s site allocations. 
9 As calculated using the standard method for assessing housing need. The Council will review the 
local housing need figure as and when appropriate, guided by the Government’s approach to 
assessing housing need.

3.9 Spelthorne has an annual requirement for 618 homes per annum, which has been 
determined using the Government’s standard methodology for calculating local 
housing need (LHN). The methodology uses the official 2014 household projections 
with an uplift to take account of local affordability . 
3.10 The Council has produced a Strategic Land Availability As sessment (SLAA) to 
identify which parcels of land in the urban area could help to meet development 
needs and has also undertaken a Green Belt Assessment to determine which areas 
are weakly performing and could be released from the Green Belt. These eviden ce 
base documents have informed the sites identified for potential allocation in the Local 
Plan. 
3.11 Not all sites identified in the SLAA have been allocated in the Local Plan due to their 
non-strategic nature and the lack of benefits identified from an alloc ation. As such 
they are expected to be delivered as windfall development and are identified as 
‘Brownfield Tier 2’ sites. In addition, an allowance for small sites and office to 
residential permitted development has been identified based on past trends. Sites 
under construction as of March 2022 are included within the supply, with a 1 5 year 
period from 202 2 to 2037. 
10 Housing need is an unconstrained assessment of the number of homes needed in an are a whereas 
housing supply is the number of homes anticipated to be delivered in the local aut hority area to meet 
these needs.

3.12 Spelthorne sits within a housing market area (HMA) with Runnymede Borough 
Council . Spelthorne shares its strongest economic links with Runnymede, Elmbridge 
and the London Borough s of Hillingdon & Hounslow and together these authorities sit 
within a Heathrow focussed Functional Economic Market Area (FEMA). Runnymede 
has recently had its Local Plan examined. The Runnymede Loca l Plan will make 
provision for a minimum of 7,480 net additional dwellings over their plan period, a 
20,000 sqm business park in New Haw and a 79,025sqm (7,350sqm net) 
office/business park at the Longcross Enterprise Zone. They are also seeking to 
deliver a minimum of 7,540sqm net retail floorspace and a minimum of 60,260 sqm

4. Place Shaping 
4.1 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021 attaches great importance to 
the design of the built environment and states that good design should contribute 
positively to making places better for people. Development should contribute to 
creating plac es that encourage mixed communities, promote walking and cycling, 
improve access to public transport, and ensure that new development connects with 
existing parks and open spaces for recreation. Our Plan will also protect the 
Borough ’s historic environmen t, including our listed buildings and Conservation 
Areas, which contribute to the Borough ’s character, sense of place and quality of life. 
4.2 The Council declared a climate emergency in October 2020 and recognises that 
climate change is the greatest challeng e currently facing us. Every decision we take 
must count towards reducing carbon emissions and both climate change mitigation 
and. Our Local Plan will help to support the transition to a low carbon future, helping 
to address the climate emergency, taking a ccount of flood risk. 
Responding to the climate emergency 
4.3 The Local Plan plays a key role in addressing the climate emergency by reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions and supporting the transition to a zero carbon future. As 
well as helping to deliver improvements to flood risk, air quality, recycling and waste 
manag ement. 
4.4 Our climate is changing as a result of human activity and this will have substantial 
implications for society and our environment if we do not act. The council is 
committed to responding to climate change and has declared a climate change 
emergency in October 2020 joining a growing number of domestic and international 
authorities that have adopted a carbon -neutral target. Across the Council's services, 
all strategic decisions, budgets and approaches to planning decisions will be aligned 
with the goa l of achieving a shift to carbon neutrality. The Council intends to 
accelerate its efforts by introducing greener buildings, transportation, greener 
investments and increasing renewable energy. 
4.5 Working with other Surrey districts and Borough s, and Surrey C ounty Council, 
Surrey’s Greener Futures Climate Change Strategy (2020 -2050) and Climate Change 
Delivery Plan (2021) have been produced. The Local Plan will play a central role in 
delivering a number of aims set out in both. A central thread of the Local Pl an is to 
plan for a low -carbon future in which carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases 
are reduced and we tackle and adapt to the new climatic norms. 
4.6 The council will take a proactive approach to mitigating the effects of, and adapting 
to, climate cha nge to ensure the future resilience of both communities and 
infrastructure. This includes locating new development in locations that reduces 
reliance on private motor vehicles as well as being designed and constructed in a 
way to achieve low or zero carbon buildings and facilitates more sustainable lifestyles 
including supporting the ability to work flexibly.

PS1: Responding to the climate emergency 
1) All development must respond to the climate emergency by: 
(a) Directing development towards locations that mi nimise the need to travel and 
maximise the ability to make trips by sustainable modes of transport including 
cycling, walking and public transport. 
(b) Delivering an efficient use of land especially on the most accessible sites. 
(c) Providing more walkable and c yclable neighbourhoods (Twenty Minute 
Neighbourhoods) that reduce demand for the use of private vehicles. 
2) Sustainable design and construction will be integral to new development in the 
Borough . All planning applications11 must include evidence that the below will be 
addressed, using as a minimum the Sustainable Construction Checklist : 
(a) Maximising energy efficiency and integrating the use of renewable and zero 
carbon energy (demonstrated though an energy statement); 
(b) Optimising the site orientation, building form, layout, landscaping and materials 
to maximise natural light and heat, whilst avoiding internal overheating by 
providing passive cooling and ventilation; 
(c) Incorporate sustainable construction and demolition techniques that provide for 
the efficient use of minerals including a proportion of recycled or secondary 
aggregates, and encou rage the re -use of construction and demolition waste at 
source or its separation and collection for recycling; 
3) In residential development (including replacements, conversions and subdivisions) 
(a) Achieve water efficiency of 110 litres per person per day12 and where feasible 
provide rainwater harvesting techniques; 
(b) Incorporate active electrical vehicle charging points in accordance with the 
latest guidance issued by Surrey County Council13; 
(c) Where CHP distribution networks already exist, new developments are 
required to connect to them or be connection -ready, unless it can be clearly 
demonstrated that utilising a different energy supply would be more 
sustainable or connection is not feasible. The impacts of the CHP plants 
emissions upon air quality must be ass essed in accordance with Policy E 4; 
(d) Incorporate measures for the secure storage of cycles and storage of waste 
including recyclable waste; 
4) Proposals for zero carbon development are strongly supported and the development 
14of renewable, low and zero carbon and decentralised energy , are strongly supported 
and encouraged. 
5) New homes should achieve a 31% reduction on the Dwelling Emission Rate (DER) 
against the Target Emission Rate (TER) based on the 2013 Edition of the 2010 
11 With the exception of applications for small householder extensions such as conservatories and 
porches and advertisement consent or prior notification 
12 through compliance with the Building Regulations which state that planning conditions can set the 
requirement to 110 litres rather than 125 litres.

Building Regulations (Part L). A fabric first approach shall be prioritised, ensuring that 
at a minimum the thermal performance of the whole envelope exceeds that of the 
notional specification by 5%15 . 
6) Applications for major development are expected to include information setting o ut: 
(a) how the energy hierarchy has been applied and how sustainable design and 
construction practice will be incorporated. 
(b) applications should be accompanied by Construction Management Plans, 
which seek to manage the impact of construction traffic on the local and 
strategic transport networks 
7) Smaller developments ( including refurbishment, conversion and extensions to existing 
buildings) should include information proportionate to the scale of the development 
proposed. 
Definitions 
4.7 Zero carbon development means development where emissions from all regulated 
energy use are eliminated or offset. This definition may be reviewed in the future. 
4.8 The definition of major development includes residential development of 10 dwellings 
or more (gross) and non -residential development of 1,000 sqm gross new floorspace 
or more. 
4.9 Sustainability and energy statements should set out a level of detail proportionate to 
the scale of development. 
Reasoned Justification 
4.10 In June 2019, the Government announ ced that the UK will ‘eradicate its net 
contribution to climate change by 2050’ by legislating for net zero emissions – the first 
G7 country to do so. In order to reach this target, all buildings will need to be net zero 
carbon by 2050. In April 2021 Spelthorne Borough Council declared a climate 
emergency and has committed to work with the local community and all other relevant 
partner agencies to support making the Borough carbon neutral as soon as practically 
possible. 
4.11 The Royal Town Planning Institute ( RTPI) considers climate change to be one of the 
most crucial issues facing our communities today, and the increasing occurrence of 
severe climate -change related weather events is just a reminder of the urgency of this 
issue. The RTPI have asked the Govern ment must reintroduce the requirement for 
all new -build homes to be zero -carbon16 and resources should be made available to 
help existing homes become carbon neutral. 
4.12 The Council considers that sustainable design is indivisible from good design and that 
requiring sustainable design features in development is justified. The NPPF (para 
148) sets out that the planning system should help to shape places in ways that 
15 The energy use intensity for new homes should be reported on a kWh/m2/year gross internal area 
(GIA) basis . 
16 A zero -carbon homes policy was axed in 2015 by then business secretary Sajid Javid, 
without consultation, a year before the policy was supposed to be introduced.

minimise vulnerability and improve resilience and support renewable and zero carbon 
energy and associated infrastructure. The NPPF also sets out that planning should 
provide net gains in biodiversity. 
4.13 The Planning Policy Guidance note titled Housing: Optional Technical Standards, 
sets out standards which can be adopted in Local Plan policies which go beyond the 
mandatory requirements of the Building Regulations for water efficiency and 
accessibility. 
4.14 The policy sets a thermal performance target (higher fabric energy efficiency 
standard) exceeding current national because it is important to en sure that buildings 
do not need to be retrofitted at expense at a later date when more demanding 
regulations are introduced. For example if the Government proceeds with the 
Climate Change Committee’s recent proposal that from 2028 no home should be able 
to be sold unless it reaches EPC B and C. This will also help safeguard against 
future heat decarbonisation pathways, by ensuring that new buildings can more easily 
transition to lower carbon heating sources in the near future. This is particularly 
pertine nt for decarbonisation trajectories involving heat pumps, as effective use of the 
technology will require highly insulated and draught -proofed buildings to operate 
efficiently. 
4.15 The South East of England is likely to face significant challenges from changin g 
climate and weather patterns. To avoid the costs associated with retrofitting and 
replacement new buildings should be future proofed, suited to, and easily adaptable 
for, the range of climate conditions and weather patterns we are likely to see over the 
next century, and adaptable to new technologies. The buildings we build today are 
likely to be with us into the next century, therefore it is beneficial to build adaptable 
and efficient developments. 
4.16 The purpose of the checklist is to highlight sustainable construction matters that 
developers can consider. It is not intended to duplicate the elements of sustainable 
construction that are incorporated into the building regulations. It will enable the 
Council to assess which sustainable construction principles have been considered in 
development proposals for new build and/or refurbishment of existing buildings, but 
does not seek to prescribe a set standard or requirement. The Council encourages a 
holistic approach where sustainable construction considerations are taken fully into 
account from initial project thinking through to development completion. This 
approach should achieve high quality sustainable development which is responsive to 
people’s need s and can help avoid unnecessary project delay. 
4.17 The future is likely to see a mix of zero carbon technologies used for heating. A 
government publication Clean Growth: Transforming Heating, an evidence review of 
the options for decarbonising heat, conclude d that it is unlikely that there will be a 
one-size-fits all solution, so multiple technologies will play a role. The Future Homes 
Standard expects heat pumps will become the primary heating technology for new 
homes. The consultation response document sta tes heat pumps are highly efficient, 
providing around three times the amount of heat compared to the electricity used. It 
goes on to say heat networks will also have an important role to play and are often an 
excellent solution for new buildings in towns and cities because of their ability to 
integrate the lowest -carbon heat sources. Heat networks are the only way to exploit 
larger scale renewable and recovered heat sources such as energy from waste, 
waste heat and heat from rivers and mines.

PS2: Designing places and spaces 
1) The Council will require a high standard in the design and layout of new development. 
Proposals for new deve lopment should demonstrate that they will: 
• create buildings and places that are attractive with their own distinct identity; 
• respect and make a positive contribution to the street scene and the character 
of the area in which they are situated; an d 
• pay du e regard to the scale, height, proportions, building lines, layout, 
materials and other characteristics of adjoining buildings and land. 
Impact on neighbours 
2) Proposals for new development should demonstrate that they will achieve a 
satisfactory relationship to adjoining properties avoiding adverse and un -neighbourly 
impacts in terms of loss of privacy, daylight or sunlight, or overbearing effect due to 
bulk and proximity or outlook. 
Accessibility 
3) All new development will be design ed to meet the needs of all users and be accessible 
to all. This includes the setting of the building in the wider environment, the location of 
the building on the plot, the gradient of the plot, transport infrastructure and public 
realm. 
Landscaping 
4) All new development should: 
(a) incorporate landscape to enhance the setting of the development; 
(b) avoid the loss of trees and other vegetation worthy of retention and 
supplemented with additional high -quality planting, or where retention is not 
feasible or desirable provide for high quality replacement planting; and 
(c) provide for suitable boundary trea tment to enhance the setting. 
Public Realm 
5) All development proposals should: 
(a) seek to positively impact on public realm through: 
• enhancing the quality of existing public realm where appropriate; 
• establishing relationships between development proposals and existing public 
realm; 
• maximising opportunities to create new public realm where appropriate. 
(b) ensure that public realm is well -designed, safe, inclusive, attractive, well -
connected, adaptable, related to the local and historical context and easy to 
understand, service and maintain. Landscape treatment, planting, street 
furniture and surface materials should be of good quality, fit -for-purpose, 
durable and sustainable; and

(c) seek to incorporate green infrastructure such as street trees and othe r 
vegetation into the public realm to support rainwater management through 
sustainable drainage, reduce exposure to air pollution, moderate surface and 
air temperature and increase biodiversity; and 
(d) ensure appropriate management, maintenance and governanc e arrangements 
are in place to secure the quality of public realm in perpetuity. 
Safe, connected and efficient streets 
6) All new development will be designed: 
(a) in a manner which is safe and welcoming, supporting natural surveillance 
through the use of active frontages and mixed used development. This will 
ensure maximum opportunities for natural security through layout and design, 
to reduce opportunities for crim e and antisocial behaviour; and 
(b) Secured by Design standards should be incorporated and consideration given 
to how an area functions at different times of day, on different days of the week 
and throughout the year. 
(c) to ensure it connects appropriately to existing street patterns and creates safe 
and accessible spaces. Proposals should offer safe, attractive, legible and 
permeable routes which are suitable for all users, linking people with places 
through active and sustainable travel choices delivered to b est practice 
standards and in accordance with the principals set out in the National Model 
Design Code17 and Manual for Streets18 . 
Major developments and allocated sites 
7) Given the size, function and proposed density of major developments, particularly 
those exceeding 50 dwellings, tall buildings and/or allocated sites on former Green 
Belt land, it may not always be desirable to reflect locally distinct patterns of 
developm ent. These sites should create their own identity to ensure cohesive and 
vibrant neighbourhoods. High rise development in appropriate locations will be 
expected to be supported by a visual impact assessment and demonstrate a positive 
contribution to the sk yline through its architectural merits. In Staines, the Development 
Framework will provide site specific guidance on the design of larger and tall buildings. 
On a case -by-case basis, it may be appropriate for larger developments to be shaped 
by a design pa nel review process at the applicant’s expense, and in conjunction with 
the Council.

Definitions 
4.18 The public realm includes all the includes all publicly accessible space between 
buildings, whether public or privately owned, including but not limited to streets and 
squares, public open spaces and river environs. 
Reasoned Justification 
4.19 High quality in the design and layout of new development is fundamental to achieving 
identified needs and creating places where people want to live and will thrive. Design 
is not just limited to the appearance of development, it includes many other elements 
such as layo ut and orientation which can contribute to creating safe and secure 
environments and will impact how much energy occupiers use over a buildings 
lifetime. The design of the built environment has a direct effect on how places are 
used. The relationship bet ween buildings, spaces and landscape is important as well 
as the more detailed design and materials used. Good design will influence how 
people move around our settlements, how they interact and how places make people 
feel. When considering applications, the Council place a high value on good design 
because of its importance and how it affects people’s daily lives. 
4.20 The NPPF states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental 
to what the planning and development process should ach ieve. Good design is a key 
aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work 
and helps make development acceptable to communities. Urban design and 
architecture can contribute to health outcomes through encouragement of mor e 
active lifestyles. Development should be encouraged to create places that result in 
mixed communities. It should cater for the needs of different types of people, 
including the young and old, encourage walking and cycling, improve access to public 
transport, and ensure that new development connects with existing parks and open 
spaces for recreation. Building exteriors and public realm should be designed in a 
way that contributes to pedestrian friendly environments. 
4.21 Planning applications must be support ed by design statements and the Council 
expects these to show how all the issues covered in the policy have been addressed. 
The level of detail required will be proportionate to the scale and nature of the 
development and for some small scale proposals, su ch as domestic extensions, 
some of the criteria may not be relevant. 
4.22 The Council’s current SPD on design19 elaborates on this policy and is intended to be 
a practical guide to help achieve high standards of design. It is aimed at a wide 
audience which in cludes home owners, architects, developers and those affected by 
planning proposals. 
4.23 Sport England have developed 10 principles to inspire and inform the layout of cities, 
towns, villages, neighbourhoods, buildings, streets and open spaces, to promote 
sport and active lifestyles. Below is a brief overview of these six of these principles 
which are supported by the Local Plan: 
• Activity for all neighbourhoods: Enabling those who want to be active, whilst 
encouraging those who are inactive to become active.

• Walkable communities: Creating the conditions for active travel between all locations. 
• Connected walking and cycling routes: Prioritising active travel through safe, 
integrated walking and cycling routes. 
• Co-location of community facilities: Creating multip le reasons to visit a destination, 
minimising the number and length of trips and increasing the awareness and 
convenience of opportunities to participate in sport and physical activity. 
• Network of multifunctional open space: Providing multifunctional space s opens up 
opportunities for sport and physical activity and has numerous wider benefits. 
• High quality streets and spaces: Well -designed streets and spaces support and 
sustain a broader variety of users and community activities.

PS3: Heritage, Conservation and Landscape 
1) The Council will seek to preserve, conserve and enhance as appropriate the 
architectural, historic and landscape character of the Borough . The Council will also 
expect all new development proposals to make a positive contribution to the 
environment taking account of any relevant design codes. 
Heritage 
2) Proposals for development which may affect any heritage asset (designated or 
undesignated & including listed buildings) will be required to demonstrate, through the 
submission of appropriate appraisals and investigations and in a Design and Access 
Statement, that the asset and its setting will be conserved and enhanced. 
3) The Council will support appropriat e development which seeks to maintain, sustain 
and enhance the significance and special architectural and historic interest of Listed 
Buildings in the Borough . 
4) Considerable weight will be given to the protection of a listed building and its setting. 
Devel opment of a listed building, or development within the curtilage or within the 
vicinity of a listed building or structure, should cons erve and/or enhance its setting and 
any features of special architectural or historical interest which it possesses 
5) Propo sals for extensions and or alterations to heritage assets must demonstrate that 
the development will respect the historic form, setting, fabric and any other aspects 
that contribute to the significance of the host building. Any features of architectural o r 
historic interest should be retained in situ and repaired rather than replaced wherever 
possible. 
6) The Council will keep under review all non -designated assets identified as being of 
local importance or distinctiveness and will, as necessary, identify ne w assets which 
contribute to the local character or distinctiveness of the area. 
7) Where any heritage asset appears to be at risk, either through neglect, decay or other 
threats, and where its loss would cause significant harm, the Council will work with 
owners to secure the enhancement of the asset and its setting for the benefit of the 
local character, in conjunction with other partners. 
Scheduled and Ancient Monuments & Archaeological Areas 
8) Proposals for development will be required to conserve, and wh ere appropriate, 
enhance the significance, historic features and importance of Scheduled and other 
nationally important ancient monuments (as shown on Policies \Map). Proposals 
which improve public access to, or the understanding of, a Scheduled Monument in a 
manner consistent with its conservation, will be supported . 
9) Proposals for development which adversely affect the physical survival, setting or 
overall heritage significance of a scheduled or other nationally important ancient 
monument will not be sup ported . 
10) Proposals for development on sites which affect, or have the potential to affect: 
• Scheduled Monuments;

• County Sites of Archaeological Importance (CSAI) or Areas of High 
Archaeological Potential (AHAP), as shown on the Policies Map 
• all other sites which exceed 0.4ha in size. should: 
(a) Submit an archaeological assessment, and where appropriate the results of a 
site evaluation (and, should remains have been identified, an accompanying 
archaeological mitigation strategy) with a planning applicatio n. 
(b) Where archaeological finds are identified the first consideration will be in situ 
preservation. Where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council 
that this is not feasible, the Council will require adequate excavation and an 
accurate reco rd to be made of any archaeological remains which will be 
destroyed and the results to be made publicly accessible via the publication 
and archiving of any material recovered . 
Conservation Areas 
11) The Council will continue to conserve and enhance the character and setting of the 
existing conservation areas, as shown on the Policies Map. The Council will require 
proposals for new development to demonstrate that they will make a positive 
contribution to the setting and local character of the conservatio n area 
Tree Preservation Orders 
12) The Council will seek to ensure the effective use of Tree Preservation Orders to 
protect significant trees and will encourage the proper care and maintenance of trees 
by requiring owners to submit applications to work on p rotected trees and ensure that 
protected trees are replaced, if they have to be felled, with a suitable replacement. 
Landscape 
13) The Council will seek that new development respects the existing landscape 
character, avoids harm, and provides for the positive enhancement of the landscape 
by the design, scale and setting of any new building. Reference should be made to 
the most up -to-date Landscape Character Assessment or equivalent. 
14) Development which would have a significant detrimental effect on the landscape 
setting of the Borough will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that the 
harm is outweighed by substantial public benefits or other benefits that outweigh the 
harm to or loss of the landscape setting. 
15) The Council will work with its partners in the public, private and voluntary sectors to 
develop and secure the implementation of projects designed to improve and maintain 
the landscape, particularly areas which have become degraded, derelict or 
contaminated and where remediation is necessary to provide opportunities for 
landscape enhancement and public enjoyment. 
Reasoned Justification 
4.24 The Borough contains an important legacy of historic buildings including nearly 200 
statutorily Listed Buildings and a further 160 buildings and st ructures of local 
architectural or historic interest. Many of these are located within the eight 
Conservation Areas.

4.25 The NPPF requires local authorities to identify opportunities for the conservation, 
enjoyment and enhancement of heritage assets and thei r setting whilst having regard 
to the need to reflect and enhance local character and distinctiveness. 
4.26 The NPPF also requires that new development is visually attractive and contributes to 
and enhances the natural and local environment and is sympathetic to local character 
and landscape. 
4.27 The NPPF recognises that heritage assets are irreplaceable resources and requires 
Local Authorities to maintain and strengthen their commitment to stewardship of the 
historic environment, and to adopt suitable policies to protect it. The Council will work 
with partners such as Historic England and others to ensure that buildings of heritage 
value are maintained.

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Spatial Policies 
5. Spatial Policies 
5.1 The spatial policies provide the basis around which the Council can secure 
improvements to the centres in the Borough . This allows for all development needs 
to be considered within suitable locations including housing, as well as employment 
and retail spa ce. This is reflected through an area -based approach which sets out a 
hierarchy for development types, which suit the size and character of the area. This 
will lead to improvements to the benefit of residents and users through enhanced 
public spaces and accessibility. 
5.2 As well as considering the urban environment, there is also an approach to the 
Borough ’s river network. This allows for opportunities to improve the local 
environment and biodiversity as well as ensuring that impacts on the network are 
avoided or mitigated. 
SP1: Staines -upon -Thames 
Strategy 
1) Recognising its size, location and significant opportunity for further regeneration, 
Staines -upon -Thames will be a key focus for housing, employment and retail 
development in the Borough . The guidance for how the town grows sustainably and 
coherently will be provided within a new Staines Development Framework (the 
Framework) to deliver development to meet need 
Infrastructure 
2) Growth of the town will be dependent on enhanced infrastructure, particularly to 
capitalise on the proximity to Heathrow Airport. The Council will support proposals 
that facilitate new and improved public and sustainable transport links, education 
facilities, healthcare services, and social and community uses in accessible locations, 
working with infrastructure providers to identify projects for funding. 
3) Flood risk management infrastructure should be incorporated into proposals where 
appropriate. Current and expected flood risk from all sources should be managed in a 
sustainable and cost -effective way. 
Retail and Leisure 
4) New development should support the position of Staines at the top of the retail and 
leisure hierarchy within the Borough . Proposals that contribute to culture, the arts and 
access to the River Thames will be considered favourably in accordance with the 
Framework. 
5) Mixed -use development that has the potential to introduce new community and 
healthcare uses to the centre will be encouraged which increase foot -fall and

Character 
6) The Staines Conservation Area (shown on the Policies Map) will be preserved and 
enhanced. New development in Staines is likely to be high density in suitable 
locations within the town centre to maximise efficient use of land but will be expected 
to achiev e high quality design in accordance with the Framework. Proposals will be 
supported that protect and enhance the local character of the area. 
7) The Staines Development Framework sets out more sensitive character areas where 
height and density limits will apply to new buildings. Development proposals in the 
relevant zones will be expected to comply with these limits unless, in exceptional 
cases, there is robust justification for a deviation that weighs heavily in favour of 
granting permission. This could in clude a higher proportion of affordable housing than 
required by policy, exemplary design or significant benefits to the community. 
Opportunities 
8) Southern Rail Access to Heathrow that includes a station at Staines, and Southern 
Light Rail as the Co uncil’s preferred solution, is considered essential for the town to 
maximise access to the airport, regardless of any expansion proposals. 
9) Any proposed tall buildings will be designed to reflect the redefined character of 
Staines and the design is to be of high standard, guided by principles in the 
Framework. There are opportunities to improve existing local leisure facilities and the 
evening economy. 
10) There are opportunities for attractive riverside development and public realm 
enhancement. Improved access will be encouraged in order to maximise the asset 
that is the River Thames -side location. 
11) Renewable and zero carbon energy solutions will be expected to be incorporated in all 
new development, including opportunities for Air Source Heat Pu mps (ASHP) and 
district heat networks or suitable alternative. 
Reasoned Justification 
5.3 Staines -upon -Thames is the main town centre within Spelthorne and therefore sits 
top of the centre hierarchy in the Borough . In this role, Staines is required to support 
a variety of uses, including shops, offices, leisure and entertainment facilities. I t is 
therefore necessary to consider how to ensure Staines continues to perform its 
function as part of the Framework. Through this, Staines has the opportunity to grow 
and develop into a thriving town that can take advantage of its close proximity to 
Heathrow Airport and proposed new public transport schemes are likely to enhance 
its connectivity further. Identified as a ‘Step up Town’ by the EM3 Local Enterprise 
Partnership, Staines is already on the map and its growth is sustainable and meets 
the needs for residents, businesses and visitors. For this reason, the Staines 
Development Framework will deliver an ambitious and viable vision for the 
transformation and regeneration of the whole town. The Framework will be adopted 
as a Supplementary Planning D ocument to guide decision -making, supporting the 
Local Plan and this policy. 
5.4 As well as accommodating growth, Staines also has significant character through the 
Staines Conservation Area and the proximity to and views of the river. There is

therefore an e xpectation that any new development which affects the setting of the 
Conservation Area or the river will respect the character and enhance this. 
5.5 The growth of Staines will allow opportunities to improve public realm and pedestrian 
linkages through the to wn centre. This will also provide opportunity to take 
advantage of the river and the footpath network through the Thames Path where 
possible. Utilising this asset is therefore a key strand of enhancing Staines and 
justifies its inclusion as part of the p olicy. 
5.6 Flood Risk is a notable constraint within Staines Town Centre. Flood Risk 
Management should therefore be a collaborative effort between the Environment 
Agency, the Lead Local Flood Authority, developers and infrastructure providers to 
ensure that th e impacts are minimised as much as possible for current and future 
generations. 
5.7 Mixed -use development within Staines town centre will reduce the need to travel and 
provide homes close to transport hubs. Mixed -use development presents 
opportunities to make good use of community combined heat and power, as the 
different types of use spread demand for heat and power over the day, evening and 
night. The buildings are likely to be in close proximity and reduce the cost of 
developing the heat network. 
to help the efficiency of the system. Taller buildings will require piling for deep 
foundations which may provide opportunities for ground source heat.

SP2: Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross 
Strategy 
1) Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross offer the potential for development 
opportunities to help meet identified needs. There are opportunities to maximise the 
efficient use of land by raising densities whilst ensuring high quality design, particularly 
around public transport interchanges, within the existing character . New developments 
will be expected to provide infrastructure improvements necessary to mitigate impacts. 
Infrastructure 
2) The Council will support proposals that seek to improve infrastructure to support the 
anticipated level of development in the centres. The Council will work wit h 
infrastructure providers to identify projects for funding. Improvements will be sought 
for: 
(a) Public transport and sustainable and active travel opportunities, including 
improvements to bus networks and access to rail stations . 
(b) Education facilities and healthcare services . 
(c) Social and community uses including open space provision in accessible 
locations . 
(d) Public realm to enhance connectivity for pedestrian access, encourage the use 
of cycling and to provide car parking opportunities. Pub lic realm improvements 
should positively contribute towards enhancing the existing local character . 
Retail and main town centre uses 
3) The Council will seek to preserve and enhance the role and diversity of uses in 
Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross to strengthen the vitality and viability of each 
centre. Development proposals are expected to be consistent with the scale and 
function of each centre and will be directed to the Primary Shopping Areas as shown 
on the Policies Map . 
Character 
4) The Conservation Areas around Shepperton (shown on the Policies Map) will be 
preserved and enhanced, along with heritage assets. Proposals will be supported that 
protect and enhance the local character of the area. 
Opportunities 
5) Sunbury Cross offers a n opportunity to encourage sustainable and active modes of 
travel through improvements to local bus networks and to the public realm to enhance 
safety and connectivity. These opportunities can be identified through Spelthorne’s 
most up -to-date Local Cycli ng and Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP). This will also 
contribute to improving air quality, particularly around Sunbury Cross roundabout. 
6) Ashford offers the opportunity to enhance the local level retail and leisure offer 
including health and fitnes s facilities and children’s play spaces. In addition, 
improvements to the public realm will enhance connectivity and present the

opportunity to provide more accessible car parking through rationalising of available 
land and public realm, where appropriate. 
7) Shepperton would benefit from improvements to bus and rail services to improve 
connectivity and support active and sustainable modes of travel. Opportunities to 
secure these improvements will be supported by the Council 
8) Renewable and zero carbon energy solutions will be expected to be incorporated in all 
new development, including opportunities for Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP) and 
district heat networks or suitable alternative. 
Definitions 
5.8 Primary Shopping Area is a defined area where retail development is concentrated. 
5.9 Public Transport interchanges are defined as rail stations and bus stations within the 
Borough and are shown on the Policies Map . For the district centres, Ashford rail 
station, Sunbury rail station and Shepperton rail s tation are relevant. Standalone bus 
stops are not included within the definition of public transport interchanges. 
Reasoned Justification 
5.10 Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross are identified in the centre hierarchy as 
district centres offering retail faci lities to their communities but without the range of 
retail offer provided in Staines . Ensuring vitality in the centres involves bringing 
unused retail units back into occupation and seeking to provide a diverse range of 
stores. Encouraging expansion wher e appropriate within the Primary Shopping Areas 
of each centre would allow for growth in this sector. 
5.11 Improvements in public realm, especially at Ashford and Sunbury Cross, will improve 
safety and connectivity for pedestrians. In the case of Sunbury Cro ss, public realm 
improvements will make pedestrians safer given the interaction with cars on the A308 
when accessing the retail area. Opportunities to improve access across the Sunbury 
Cross roundabout, to improve linkages to Sunbury rail station, should also be sought 
as part of this public realm improvements package. 
5.12 Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross each have their own mainline train station to 
provide connectivity into central London via Richmond and Kingston. This 
accessibility makes the three d istrict centres attractive places to live. Providing 
housing around transport interchanges such as rail stations accords with the NPPF in 
making effective use of land. Whilst this approach would lead to higher densities, it is 
also important to ensure th at the quality of design and standards are maintained and 
all necessary infrastructure is secured to mitigate the impacts of new development 
5.13 Each of the three centres have their opportunities where improvements could be 
sought and these have been identifie d within the policy. In addition to these, the 
three centres have more general infrastructure needs which will likely increase should 
growth occur and place greater pressures on existing services. This issue has been 
highlighted as a key component of del ivering growth in the centres. Infrastructure 
improvements will need to be in an accessible location to cater for all sections of the 
local community and ensure that this can be fully utilised.

SP3: Stanwell and Stanwell Moor 
Strategy 
1. The Council will support the communities of Stanwell and Stanwell Moor and will seek 
to secure improved economic, social and environmental benefits. 
Infrastructure 
2. The Council will work with infrastructure providers, developers and other key 
stakeholder s to identify long term sources of funding and secure proposals for new 
infrastructure which offer sustainable transport links including active travel and public 
transport to improve access into and out of Heathrow Airport and other employment 
areas. 
3. The Council will support the provision of new social facilities including education and 
healthcare services as well as new leisure facilities to meet identified local needs. 
4. The Council will support proposals which enhance the function and setting of th e local 
watercourses and river corridors and the rights of way network throughout the area. 
Retail 
5. The Council will protect the role that local facilities play in providing for the needs of 
the communities in Stanwell and Stanwell Moor. Development prop osals for Use Class 
E, particularly retail, will be supported, where the scale is considered to complement 
the needs of the communities and the local character. 
Character 
6. The Stanwell Conservation Area (shown on the Policies Map) will be conserved and 
enhanced, along with heritage assets. Proposals will be supported that protect and 
enhance the local character of the area. 
7. The Council will work with Surrey County Council to ensure that the areas of current 
and former mineral sites and are fully restored or enhanced as to the agreed 
restoration plans for the benefit of the local community. 
Opportunities 
8. The Council will support opportunities for new and enhanced open spaces within 
Stanwell and Stanwell Moor and will encourage improved linkages as part of the wider 
green infrastructure network to promote walking and cycling, including improvements 
in cycling routes to Heathrow. 
9. Opportunities to improve access to Staines Moor will also be pursued, where these do 
not impact upon the Moor. Additional ly, improvements to connectivity to the Colne 
Valley Regional Park will also be sought. 
10. The Council wil l support opportunities for new housing provision where it is sustainably 
located, makes an efficient use of land and complements the local character.

district heat networks or suitable alternative 
Reasoned Justification 
5.14 Stanwell and Stanwell Moor are communities to the north of the Borough which are 
less well connected to the rest of Spelthorne. Stanwell is more developed to the 
south and links with the northern -most part of Ashford, whilst Stanwell Moor has a 
more disti nct, rural character. Both Stanwell and Stanwell Moor are heavily impacted 
by Heathrow Airport. There is therefore a requirement for these communities to 
benefit from new and improved facilities and infrastructure where this can be secured. 
5.15 Clare Road in Stanwell is identified as an important shopping parade which supports 
its local community. There is therefore a need to ensure that the vitality and viability 
of this parade is maintained and enhanced where appropriate. Stanwell Moor has a 
small area o f retail provided on Horton Road, the offer for which is limited and further 
improvements could be sought. Stanwell and Stanwell Moor would benefit from 
improved local connectivity with other parts of the Borough and with Heathrow 
Airport. These improvem ents would focus around enhanced public transport and 
opportunities to encourage sustainable and active travel through cycle ways and 
improved pedestrian linkages. 
5.16 The proximity of Stanwell Moor to Staines Moor provides opportunities to enhance 
access to this important site. As part of this, opportunities to maintain and enhance 
linkages to the wider Colne Valley Regional Park, will be sought so as to encourage 
residents to use these key natural spaces to improve health and wellbeing.

Green Belt 
5.17 Full Green Belt policy can be found in the National Planning Policy Framework and 
this policy is not intended to repeat it, but to provide local detail on specific policy 
matters. 
SP4: Green Belt 
1) The Green Belt boundary is defined on the Policies Map . In order to uphold the 
fundamental aims of the Green Belt to prevent urban sprawl and to keep land within its 
designation permanently open, inappropriate development will not be approved unless 
very special circumstances can be demonstrated. Very special circumstances will not 
exist unless the potent ial harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and 
any other harm is clearly outweighed by other considerations. 
Replacement and extension of buildings in the Green Belt 
2) The Council will permit the replacement of a building in the Green Belt provided the 
new building: 
20(a) would be in the same use ; 
(b) is not materially larger than the one it replaces; 
(c) is sited on or close to the position of the existing building, unless an alternative 
position would benefit the openness of the Green Belt; and 
(d) does not have a materially greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt. 
3) The Council will permit the extension and alteration to a building in the Green Belt 
provided the addition: 
(a) is not disproportionate, over and above the size of the origina l building; and 
(b) does not have a materially greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt. 
Reasoned Justification 
5.18 The Metropolitan Green Belt plays a key role in Spelthorne to protect its character by 
preventing the immediate outward sprawl of London, to ensure settlements do not 
merge into each other, encouraging development of previously developed land and 
safeguard ing the countryside from encroachment. In developing this Local Plan, a 
two-stage review of the Green Belt was undertaken to assess the extent to which 
land in the Borough fulfils these purposes. As a result, some land was considered 
not to perform these functions to the extent that warranted retaining the Green Belt 
designation and the decision was made to amend the boundary to remove areas that 
20 Re-use of buildings in the Green Belt are not inappropriate under the NPPF provided they preserve

did not perform well and should be developed for other uses instead. The current 
area of Green Belt following removal of those sites is shown on the Policies Map . 
5.19 The original building will be determined based on its size as existing on 1 July 1948 
or first built if later than this date. This is to enable the effect of cumulative 
development to be taken into account when a building has been extended previously. 
The cumulative impact of a series of small extensions can be just as great as a single 
large addition. The size of the plot is not relevant when considering whether a 
replacement building is materially larger or an extension results in disproportionate 
additions. 
5.20 This Policy applies to dwellings within the former Plotland Areas that lie within the 
Green Belt. Other policies that protect the character of the riverside will be relevant 
to these dwellings even though the former Plotlands designation no longe r applies. 
The removal of the designation is a key change to this Local Plan. It was considered 
that the application of policies on Plotland Areas was inconsistent across the local 
authorities that have or had the designation, as some applied it in addit ion to Green 
Belt policy and some applied it instead of Green Belt policy. Spelthorne previously 
applied the policy in addition to Green Belt policy and set out design based criteria to 
protect the distinctive character of the river and is not strictly re levant to Green Belt, 
which can be covered instead by design policies for riverside development. 
Proposals within the Green Belt will also be expected to comply with all other Local 
Plan policies, particularly those that cover design, amenity, landscape, biodiversity 
and flooding.

SP5: Colne Valley Regional Park 
1) The extent of the Colne Valley Regional Park (CVRP) within the Borough is defined on 
the Policies Map . As a member of the CVRP, the Council will seek to maintain the 
character and landscape of the Park and promote its benefits. 
2) The Council will expect pro posals for development within the Colne Valley Park to 
make a positive and sustainable contribution towards implementing the objectives of 
the Park. The Council will support, in principle, development within the Park where it 
can be demonstrated that it w ill: 
(a) maintain and enhance the landscape and historic environment of the Park and 
its overall amenity value; 
(b) contribute to the objectives of the Park; 
(c) conserve and enhance biodiversity within the Park through the protection and 
management of its species, habitats and geological features; 
(d) provide opportunities for countryside recreation and ensure that facilities are 
accessible to all; 
(e) contribute to a vibrant and sustainable rural economy within the Park; 
(f) encourage community participation, including volunteering and environmental 
education, and promote the health and social well -being through high quality 
green space and its contribution to the wider green infrastructure network and; 
(g) carry out appropriate surveys , should deve lopment within the Park amount to 
changes to biodiversity areas or designations and recreational facilities. 
Reasoned Justification 
5.22 The Colne Valley Regional Park covers over 10,000 hectares to the west of London. 
It forms a narrow corridor of countryside, much of it within the Green Belt, stretching 
from Rickmansworth in the north to Staines and Wraysbury in the South where the 
River Colne joins the Thames. It is some 14 miles long and 3 miles wide at its widest 
point. It straddles a number o f local authority boundaries. The area within 
Spelthorne covers some 1,000 hectares and comprises three major reservoirs, the 
areas of Staines Moor, Hithermoor and the settlement of Stanwell Moor. 
5.23 The Colne Valley Regional Park was conceived in the 1960’s with the broad aim of 
providing for informal recreation in a countryside setting. The original objectives 
remain just as valid today, although they have been updated, modified and extended 
over the last 50 years: 
1. To maintain and enhance the landscape, hi storic environment and waterscape 
of the Park in terms of their scenic and conservation value and their overall 
amenity.

5.25 The CVRP produced the Colne and Crane Green Infrastructure Strategy in 2019 
These c hallenges include 
significant development pressure and the need to enhance green infrastructure 
assets. Improving the network of green infrastructure could benefit Spelthorne by

SP6: River Thames and its Tributaries 
River Thames 
1) The River Thames is a strategically important and iconic feature of Spelthorne. It is an 
important natural and cultural asset providing leisure, ecological, environmental, 
landscape and economic benefits. This role will be protected and promoted. The 
special character and setting of the River Thames as define d on the Policies Map will 
be conserved and enhanced, and appropriate development proposals associated with 
river related activities and employment will be supported. 
2) The Council supports opportunities to increase the use of the rivers for tourism and 
improving river -based and riverside recreation and leisure activities. All development 
proposals should protect and enhance the river and its setting as a valuable resource 
for biodiversity, wildlife and as an SNCI. Where possible and where there will be no 
adverse effect on the SNCI, development proposals should support infrastructure such 
as boatyards, moorings, jetties and safety equipment etc. 
3) Proposals for riverside development and improved facilities will need to demonstrate 
that there will be no un acceptable impact upon navigation, biodiversity, flood risk and 
landscape setting. 
4) Development proposals on the riverside should respect and make a positive 
contribution to enhance the waterside character, heritage value and setting, and 
provide physical and visual links with the surrounding areas (including views along the 
river). 
5) The Council is supportive of river -related business uses (for example boat yards) and 
supports their continued presence in a river -side location. 
6) The Council will support and promote new links across the River Thames and 
improvements to riverside access and towpaths which support active and sustainable 
travel and leisure uses of the river. 
New Visitor Mooring Facilities 
7) A visitor it does not harm the character, openness and views of the river, by virtue of 
its design and height; 
(a) allows use for a period of less than 24 hours; 
(b) there is no interference with the recreational use of the river, riverside and 
navigation; 
(c) the proposal is of wider benefit to the community; and 
(d) has undergone consultation with the Environment Agency and not received 
objection. 
River Thames Scheme 
8) The Council supports in principle the proposals for the wider River Thames Scheme 
and welcomes the proposed new footpath connection in Laleham as part of the

recreational benefits the scheme will bring. The proposed route is shown on the 
Policies Map . 
Tributaries 
9) The Rivers Ash, Colne and Wraysbury are tributaries of the River Thames and form an 
important part of the Borough ’s blue infrastructure network. Development proposals 
will be supported that: 
(a) Ensures there is no requirement for the culverting of watercourses . 
(b) Retain the natural banks . 
(c) Make appropriate provision to protect, enhance, improve and maintain 
accessible networks of Blue Infrastructure, including through deculverting21 and 
re-naturalisation of hard banks if appropriate . 
(d) Provide undeveloped buffer zones of 8m minimum for rivers and 5m minimum 
for other water courses. A scheme to provide a buffer zone will need to include 
a working method statement detailing how the buffer z one will be protected 
during construction and long -term ecological plan. 
(e) Include measures to allow for the natural movement of fish within the 
watercourse where barriers to fish movement are present to enhance habitat 
connectivity . 
Reasoned Justification 
5.26 The River Thames forms a large part of the southern boundary of the Borough 
between the neighbouring Borough s of Runnymede and Elmbridge. It is a significant 
local and regional amenity. The Thames is the longest river in England measuring 
215 miles; it begins in the Cotswold Hills (Gloucestershire), meandering eastwards 
through Spelthorne before passing through the city of London and ending in the North 
Sea. The River Thames is regarded as a key asset of the Borough , is one of the 
Borough ’s key tourist attractions , and the Council is keen to maximise its potential. 
The river brings great benefits from tourism, leisure, recreation and ecological 
perspectives, and is also beautiful. 
5.27 Policy SP6 aims to ensure that the setting of the river and i ts tributaries are protected 
and where possible enhanced. This involves protecting landscape features that 
contribute to the setting, and  protecting and enhancing views of the river. 
5.28 Particular care will be needed in assessing the visual impact of devel opment 
proposals in locations that form part of the setting of the river to ensure that the 
setting is not damaged and that new development makes a positive contribution to 
the riverside environment. 
5.29 There is public access to much of the Thames riverside in Spelthorne, although 
access to the River Ash, Colne and the River Thames downstream of Shepperton 
Lock is more limited. Existing riverside access will be maintained and opportunities

  Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Spatial Policies 
will be sought to improve access in conjunction with developments in riverside 
locations. 
River Thames Scheme 
5.30 A significant area of Spelthorne lies in the floodplains of the Thames, Colne (and 
related river system) and Ash. Flood defences are very limited and are on parts of the 
River Colne system and the River Ash. The River Thames between Egham and 
Teddington is one of the largest area of undefended, developed floodplain in 
England. Spelthorne Borough Council is working with the Environment Agency and 
other partners to bring forward the River Thames Scheme22 which seeks to address 
this with the aim of reducing flood risk in communities. The key elements are; 
• a new river channel built in two sections – at Runnymede and at Spelthorne – to 
increase storage capacity for w ater from a major flood; 
• improvements to existing river structures and; 
• new recreation areas for communities and habitat for wildlife. 
5.31 These measures will better protect around 11,000 homes (in total not just in 
Spelthorne) and 1,600 businesses, enhance th e natural environment around the river, 
and boost the local economy. 
5.32 The Spelthorne channel is 3.2km in length. It starts at Laleham and ends at 
Weybridge. The channel flows through four lakes and crosses five roads. This area 
includes increasing capacit y on stretch of the Desborough Cut. At Sunbury weir there 
will be three extra gates built on the lock island. 
5.33 The large scale of the project means it is treated as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) and requires a type of consent known as 'development 
consent order' (DCO). The DCO must be granted before full funding is approved and 
construction can begin. 
5.34 Development along the route of the River Thames Scheme should, where 
appropriate, seek to facilitate the Scheme. Flood Risk Assessmen ts should 
sufficiently consider how the River Thames Scheme may be impacted by the 
proposals and also identify opportunities to facilitate its implementation.

A possible expansion at Heathrow 
1) The Council will support a future expansion at Heathrow Airport if it is undertaken in a 
sustainable and integrated way by: 
(a) working strategically with local authorities around Heathrow Airport. 
(b) permitting development proposals outside the airport or Development Consent 
Order (DCO) Limits boundary23 in the Borough for Airport Supporting 
Development (ASD)24 particularly those that support economic development if 
they: 
• seek to protect and enhance designated areas of existing environmental 
character including Sites of Nature Conservati on Importance, areas of 
landscape value, the Borough ’s historic and cultural heritage (including 
historic buildings and Conservation Areas), habitats particularly within 
Biodiversity Opportunity Areas and open space of amenity and recreation 
value; 
• demons trate ecological offsetting and incorporate mitigation measures to 
achieve biodiversity net gain; 
• ensure safeguards are in place to mitigate air, noise, light and other 
pollution in the Borough ; and 
• offer high -quality design of buildings and structures. 
(c) resisting inappropriate development in the Green Belt unless the harm is 
outweighed by very special circumstances. 
(d) supporting the implementation of a range of surface access interventions to 
encourage modal shift towards more sustainable forms of transpo rt such as: 
• promoting sustainable transport choices which reduce the need to travel; 
• improving surface access to minimise airport related traffic (congestion) as 
the Borough as a whole; 
• promoting initiatives such as car sharing/clubs, the use of electri c vehicles, 
low emission cars and colleague shuttle buses from the surrounding areas 
and;

(e) supporting southern rail access including the promotion of the Southern Light 
Rail (SLR) where there is benefit to communities in the Borough and the wider 
strategic network. 
Hazardous Development 
2) The Council will refuse permission for any proposal likely to significantly increase the 
risks associated with any particular hazardous installation or impose conditions where 
necessary to avoid increased risk and; 
3) Development leading to an increase in people living, working or congregating in the 
Public Safety Zone will be refused. 
Noise from Heathrow 
4) The Council will seek the support of BAA , the Government and relevant statutory 
authorities for the following measures: 
(a) maintenance of the use of noise preferential routes; 
(b) controls on flying at night that will achieve a progressive improvement in the 
night noise climate, including a limit on the total number of flights at night and; 
(c) maintenance of existing controls on ground noise. 
Development close to Heathrow and Noise from Heathrow 
5) The Council will seek to minimise the adverse impact of development close to 
Heathrow by: 
(a) refusing new residential development where aircraft noise levels are at or

(b) requiring appropriate attenuation measures for development between 60 and

Reasoned Justification 
5.35 Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2020 that the proposed expansion can go 
ahead and would not be unlawful, the future of Heathrow Airport and a possible 
expansion is currently uncertain due to the impacts of COVID -19. Notwithstanding 
the current uncer tainty around the future of the project the Council remains involved 
with relevant work regarding Heathrow. 
5.36 The policy sets out the Council’s position on a possible expansion at Heathrow in the 
near future and reinforces the local importance the airport h as on the Borough ’s 
economy. The Council will support a future expansion (in principle) as it recognises 
the potential economic benefits and opportunities that an expanded airport could 
bring to Spelthorne, the wider Southeast and the UK as a whole. However, its 
support will be entirely dependent on Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) making sure

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Spatial Policies 
that the proposed scheme comprehensively and effectively mitigates the impacts it 
will have on our communities, businesses, services and environment. 
5.37 The main objective of this policy is for the Council to ensure that a future expansion at 
Heathrow Airport secures and provides the best possible outcomes for its residents 
and businesses, and in particular those most directly affected in the Stanwell Moor 
and Stanwell communities. 
5.38 Heathr ow Airport, the UK’s main and busiest airport lies immediately north of the 
Borough of Spelthorne where there is a concentration of airport supporting facilities 
(related developments and activities), including freight forwarding services. The 
Airport is a n important contributor to the local economy. Before the pandemic, 5,800 
of Spelthorne’s residents were in Heathrow related employment and around 45% of 
these residents lived in Stanwell and Ashford25 . Pre pandemic, Heathrow employed 
10.6% of Spelthorne’s workforce but as the Airport has been severely impacted by 
the pandemic, job losses in Spelthorne connected to Heathrow in 2021 is expected to 
be around 1,500. This suggests that there should be focus on recovery activities to 
support residents in the Boro ugh (ibid). 
5.39 Due to the Borough ’s close proximity to the airport, it experiences air and noise 
pollution and other environmental impacts. Pre pandemic over 92% of Heathrow 
employees who live in the Borough reach the airport by car rather than public 
transpo rt which highlights poor connectivity. Undoubtedly the Borough is also 
affected by activities related to the operation of the airport and its associated 
businesses, such as logistics and distribution, which impact on air quality, noise, the 
efficiency of the local and strategic road network. 
5.40 Given the economic benefits and opportunities Heathrow Airport brings to Spelthorne, 
the Council will work in partnership with HAL and other service providers to ensure 
the safe and efficient operation of the airport a nd seek to avoid and mitigate any 
potential adverse environmental impacts on the Borough and its surrounding areas. 
5.41 Development proposals that would support the operation of an expanded airport in 
the future would have to offer the highest quality design o f buildings and structures. 
The Council whilst seeking to secure economic and environmental benefits from 
specific Airport Supporting Development (ASD) proposals, will require such proposals 
to minimise or mitigate any adverse impacts on the wider economy. 
5.42 Development involving hazardous substances or development in the vicinity of 
hazardous installations seeks to ensure that public safety is maintained. In applying 
the policy account will be taken of advice from the Health and Safety Executive. It 
also ide ntifies the importance of tight controls on development within the Public 
Safety Zone (PSZ) (as defined by the Civil Aviation Authority) at the west end of the 
southern runway at Heathrow where development involving an increase in number of 
people living, working or otherwise congregating in the zone will be refused. The PSZ 
is shown on the Proposals Map.

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Housing 
6. Housing 
6.1 Different groups within our community, including families, older people, younger 
people, people with disabilities requiring more specialist accommodation and the 
Gypsy and Traveller community have differing accommodation needs. The policies 
within the Plan set out how a wide variety of high -quality homes, of all tenures, types 
and sizes, which meet the needs of our residents will be delivered. 
6.2 The Borough ’s accessible location, together with the diverse natural environment and 
prospering economy means the Borough offers a good quality of life. While this has 
many positive impacts, the desirability of Spelthorne as a place to live does have a 
negative impact on affordability. The policies within the Plan set out ambitious targets 
for meeting the needs of our residents who are not able to afford adequate housing 
on the open market. 
H1: Homes for All 
Housing Need 
1) The Council will make provision for at least an additional 61826 homes per annum in 
Spelthorne Borough over the plan period. 
Housing Mix and Stan dards 
2) New residential development is required to deliver a wide choice of homes to meet a 
range of accommodation needs. New development should provide a mix of housing 
tenures, types and sizes appropriate to the size, characteristics and location. 
3) Development proposals will be expected to contribute to meeting identified housing 
needs by having regard to the housing type and size mix as set out in the Strategic 
Housing Market Assessment27 or any similar evidence for market and affordable units. 
4) All new resi dential development across all tenures (under Use Class C3) will be 
expected to meet with the minimum space standards as set out by the Ministry of 
Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). Houses of Multiple 
Occupation (HMOs) will be expected to comply with HMO space standards defined by 
the Council. 
5) The Council will permit residential development provided that it does not result in a net 
loss of units (C2 or C328 use class accommodation or gypsies, travellers and travelling 
showpeople pitches or plots) unless the loss can be justified on other policy grounds. 
6) The Council supports development proposals which take opportunities to facilitate 
healthy lifestyles and include measures to boost the sustainability of the location. 
26 As cal culated using the standard method for assessing housing need, 2021.  The Council will 
review the local housing need figure as and when appropriate, guided by the Government’s approach 
to assessing housing need

7) The Council is supportive of Build to Rent housing, where a need for this type of 
accommodation can be demonstrated. Where Build to Rent housing is proposed, the 
proportion of Affordable Housing provision should be in line with the benchmark level 
set by the Council and follow any up to date evidence, plans or strategies. 
Accessible Homes 
8) All new homes must be designed and constructed in a way that enables them to be 
adaptable, so they can meet the changing needs of their occupants over their lifetime. 
Planning permission will be granted for new dwellings subject to the following: 
(a) All new build dwellings will, as a minimum, be constructed in accordance with 
the requirements of Building Regulations Part M4 (2) and any subsequent 
updates, unless it can be demonstr ated that it is unfeasible to do so. 
(b) The encouragement, where practicable and viable, of dwellings on schemes 
involving major development being provided as wheelchair adaptable dwellings 
in accordance with the Building Regulations M4(3) standard: Category 3. 
(c) Unless it can be demonstrated that it is unfeasible to do so, the Borough 
Council will require a minimum of 10% of new dwellings on major housing 
developments to accord with Category M4(3) (wheelchair adaptability). 
9) Exemptions will only be considered where the applicant can robustly demonstrate that 
compliance would significantly harm the financial viability of the scheme, or where it is 
not practical to do so given the flood risk. All residential proposals should be 
accompanied by a separate document setting out how proposals (including each 
dwelling type) accord with each of the standards as detailed in Building Regulations. 
Where exemptions are sought on practicality or viability grounds, the minimum number 
of units necessary will be exempted from t he requirements i.e. If only 1 out of 3 
wheelchair accessible dwellings can be provided, then the 1 still applies. 
Specialist Accommodation 
10) The provision of well -designed specialist forms of accommodation, including sheltered 
housing, care homes and othe r appropriate forms of accommodation for the elderly 
and those with particular needs, will be permitted provided that the development: 
(a) Meets demonstrable established local community need; and 
(b) Is in a sustainable location, with access to appropriate services and facilities 
where these are not provided on site. This includes public transport, shops, 
local services and community facilities. 
11) Where specialist accommodation falls within use class C3, an appropriate proportion 
of affordable housing in accordance with Policy H2 will be required, with the mix of 
tenures negotiated by the Council having regard to advice from appropriate specialist 
bodies. 
12) The Council encourages mixed development that include an element of specialist 
accommodation (including sheltered housing, supported housing, extra care housing 
and residential/nursing care homes) on larger schemes where the character and size 
of the site allows.

Self and Custom Build Housing 
13) The Council will support Self and Custom Build developments for residential 
accommodation in appropriate locations, in the interests of supporting high quality 
homes which meet the identified needs of the Borough . In considering major 
development applications , the Council will consider the currently applicable Self Build 
Register and whether provision should be included within the development. 
14) The delivery of housing on these plots will: 
(a) In terms of the mix of plots, be negotiated by the Council as informed by the 
Council’s self -build and custom housebuilding register; 
(b) Be required to be completed within 3 years of a custom builder purchasing the 
plot; 
(c) Where plots have been made available and marketed appropriately for at least 
12 months and have no t sold, the plot(s) will be expected to remain on the 
open market as self -build or custom build or be offered to the Council or a 
Housing Association before being built out by the developer. 
Definitions 
6.3 Specialist Housing: Housing that has been specifically designed to meet the needs of 
people with particular requirements (including sheltered housing, supported housing, 
extra care housing and residential/nursing care homes). It can refer to housing that 
has been purpose designed or designated for a particular client group to assist 
tenants to live independently. 
6.4 Self-Build and Custom Housebuilding: The building or completion by a) individuals, 
b) associations of individuals, or c) persons working with or for individuals, of houses 
to be occupied as homes by those individuals; but does not include the building of a 
house on a plot acquired from a person who builds the house wholly or mainly to 
plans or specifications decided or offered by that person. 
6.5 M4(2) Housing: Accessible and adaptable dwellings as set out in Building 
Regulations. Where a new dwelling makes reasonable provision for most people to 
access the dwelling and incorporates features that make it potentially suitable for a 
wide range of occ upants, including older people, those with reduced mobility and 
some wheelchair users. 
6.6 M4(3) Housing: Wheelchair user adaptable dwellings as set out in Building 
Regulations. Where a new dwelling makes reasonable provision, either at completion 
or at a po int following completion, for a wheelchair user to live in the dwelling and use 
any associated private outdoor space, parking and communal facilities that may be 
provided for the use of the occupants.

people requiring more specialist accommodation, the Gypsy and Traveller community 
and Travelling Showpeople community. The Plan will also seek to make provision for 
self-build/custom build projects and starter homes. 
Housing Need 
6.8 In September 2017 the Government published a consultation document ‘Planning for 
the right homes in the right places’. This put forward a standard approach to 
assessing local housing need, in the interests of simplicity, speed and transparency. 
It is based on a formula that uses affordability ratios and average household growth 
over a 10 year period, with the current year being the first year from household 
projections. Planning Practice Guidance confirms that local authorities should use 
the 2014 -based household projections to set the baseline. In the long term the 
Government proposes to review the formula with a view to establishing a new 
method. 
6.9 Using the standardised methodology, Spelthorne has a need of 618 new dwellings 
per annum. The Government makes clear that local planning authorities should be 
able to rely on the evidence used to justify their local housing need for a period of two 
years from the date they submit their Plan. 
Housing Mix and Size Requirements 
6.10 The need for different types, sizes and tenures of homes required has been assessed 
through the Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2015 and SHMA update 
2019. This includes accommodation needs of families, older people, people with 
disabilities, service families, people wishing to build their own homes and students. 
The Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment has assessed the need for 
traveller accommodation. The Council will have regard to the findings of the latest 
SHMA when determining the right balance of homes in new development and would 
encourage applicants to discuss housing mix with the Council’s Planning and 
Housing Officers. 
6.11 The SHMA 2015 and SHMA update 2019 indicate that: 
• There is a need for 35 -40% one bedroom, 25 -30% two bedroom, 25 -30% three 
bedroom and 5 -10% four bedroom affordable rented ownership housing . 
• There is a need for 15 -25% one bedroom, 40 -45% two bedroom, 25 -35% three 
bedroom and 5 -10% four bedroom affordable home ownership housing . 
• There is a need for 0 -5% one bedroom, 20 -25% two bedroo m, 50 -55% three 
bedroom and 20 -25% four bedroom market housing . 
• There is an ageing population in Spelthorne with the number of residents aged 
over 65 projected to increase by 41.4% up to 2035 . 
• With an ageing population the number of people with disabilitie s is expected to 
increase substantially in the future . 
• Need for 37 registered care bed spaces per annum . 
• Need for 93 specialist accommodation for older people per annum . 
• There are approximately 12,781 households with dependent children . 
• There are approxim ately 4,433 households with non -dependent children .

         Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Housing 
6.12 A flexible housing stock will help meet the wide range of accommodation needs so 
the Council will expect all new homes to be flexible, accessible, adaptable and age 
friendly. New homes should support the changing needs of individuals and families 
at different stages of life . Housing developments should help to meet the needs of all 
members of the community and in turn reduce inequalities. National Planning Policy 
requires local planning authorities to pl an for a mix of housing, taking account of local 
demographic trends, market trends and the needs of different groups of the 
community. Local planning authorities should identify the size, type, tenure and 
range of housing that is required in their area. 
6.13 The NPPF emphasises the importance of health and wellbeing and that LPAs should 
take account of current and future needs of the local population and identify the 
relevant barriers to improving health and well -being. Housing should be sustainably 
located wi th access to local services and transport links. Development proposals 
should facilitate healthy lifestyles and should help to achieve sustainable 
development and sustainable mixed communities. 
6.14 The minimum size for a bedroom is defined by the Housing Act 1 985. The Licensing 
and Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation and Other Houses 
(Miscellaneous Provisions) (England) Regulations 2006 require kitchens, bathrooms 
and WCs to be of adequate size. If there are no communal living areas, bedrooms 
need to be larger. 
6.15 Build to rent involves the construction of dwellings specifically for the rental market, 
rather than the more traditional route in which developers build dwellings which they 
then sell, either to householders or to landlords. Build to rent sche mes require long -
term professional management to deal with the maintenance of the building and day -
to-day issues. I t provides an opportunity to boost the rate of overall housing delivery, 
as it does not compete directly with traditional housing which are b uilt for sale. Build 
to rent housing can offer a range of benefits, making it a more attractive product than 
traditional private rented sector housing to developers, tenants, councils and 
stakeholders, as this sector has grown significantly over recent years while home 
ownership levels have declined. The Council supports the provision of Built to Rent 
homes where these are well -designed, where evidence is provided that high 
standards of management will be put in place, and where the benefits of such 
housing are balanced ag ainst the level of affordable housing provision. The need for 
Build to Rent housing should be demonstrated if this type of development is 
proposed. Any Build to Rent housing provision should be delivered in accordance 
with the Council’s latest guidance, policies and evidence. 
Accessible Homes 
6.16 The NPPF requires local planning authorities to have a clear understanding of 
housing needs in their area, including those for people with specific housing needs. 
Part M4(3) relates to wheelchair accessible dwellings ; Part M4(3)(2)(a) relates to 
dwellings which can be adapted for wheelchair users in the future and M4(3)(2)(b) 
relates to dwellings which are built to be accessible to wheelchair users. 
6.17 The intention of this approach will be to maximise the flexibility of new housing to 
accommodate a wider spectrum of housing needs. This will support the housing 
needs of older people but also those with specialist needs such as those who are 
disabled and wheelchair users, leading to positive impacts on health and well -being.

the Borough is at ris k to flooding, and that this could be a constraint to achieving this. 
Where developers demonstrate that the M4(2) or M4(3) requirements are not feasible 
to be delivered on viability grounds exemptions will be on a case by case basis on the 
clear evidence s ubmitted at planning application stage, e.g. the topography of the site 
makes provision as a whole not feasible and impacts development viability 
significantly. 
Specialist Accommodation 
Some of the community require accommodation that caters for their spec ific needs. 
This is often for more vulnerable members of our society, such as the frail, elderly or 
those needing specialist social support, who would benefit from on -site support. To 
create inclusive communities, this type of accommodation should be loc ated in 
accessible areas with links to public transport and local facilities. The Council will 
work with specialist providers and bodies, such as Surrey County Council, to identify 
and secure provision of suitable sites for specialist housing. 
The Council is aware of companies and organisations specialising in the provision of 
innovative, well designed residential units which would not be compliant with the 
space standards. Whilst such units are smaller than ideally would be required, it is 
acknowledged t hat such products are designed to offer high quality living spaces to 
meet specific needs and demands. 
To deliver sustainable communities means to support the needs of the current 
population and any future populations. Paragraph 60 of the NPPF states that the 
needs of groups with specific housing requirements should be addressed. Paragraph 
62 continues: within this context, the type of housing needed for different groups in Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Housing 
6.18 The National Building Regulations include specific nationally agreed construction 
standards (the M4(2) standard) which would deliver accessible and adaptable homes. 
However, as a national standard they are optional and depend partly on the viability 
of this aspect when considered with other requirements of the Local Plan. The 
Borough Council is therefore requiring that all dwellings must meet the M4(2) 
standard. Homes built to this standard are more flexible and readily adaptable as 
people’s needs change . They are suitable not just for the elderly but also for families 
with pushchair needs, or those with a temporary or permanent disability or health 
issue. 
6.19 Where the specific requirements of Building Regulations may not be achievable, an 
element of flexibi lity is recognised as being required in the delivery of these

the community should be assessed and reflected in planning policies including, but 
not limited to older people, and people with disabilities. Paragraph 92 of the NPPF 
state s that planning policies should ensure that developments create places that are 
safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well -being, with a high 
standard of amenity for existing and future users and do not undermine the quality of 
life o r community cohesion and resilience.

Self and Custom Build Housing 
6.23 Self-Build or Custom -Build is defined through the National Planning Policy 
Framework as housing built by an individual, a group of individuals, or persons 
working with or for them, to be occupied by that individual. Such housing can be 
either market or affordable housing. It is seen to support the individual self -builder, or 
community group for the delivery of low cost sustainable housing on small scale infill 
or windfall sites, or as part of large -scale planned development, and will help in the 
delivery of a wide choice of high quality homes. Under section 1 of the Self Build and 
Custom Housebuilding Act 2015, local authorities are required to keep a register of 
those seeking to acquire se rviced plots in the area for their own self -build and custom 
house building (which may or may not be meeting affordable housing need). They are 
also subject to duties under sections 2 and 2A of the Act to have regard to this and to 
give enough suitable dev elopment permissions to meet the identified demand.

H2: Affordable Housing 
1) The Council will require at least 30% affordable housing units on all schemes of 10 
units (net) or more. Greenfield sites will be expected to deliver at least 50% affordable 
housing. 
2) Planning permission will be granted provided that satisfactory arrangements have 
been made to secure affordable housing as determined by the following principles: 
(a) The sizes, types and tenure of homes provided will be determined on the basis 
of local needs as identified in having regard to the Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment29 . 
(b) Developments will be expected to be policy compliant in providing affordable 
housing. It is for applicants to demonstrate whether particular circumstances 
justify the need for viab ility assessment at the application stage. Where 
applicants demonstrate that the full amount of affordable housing cannot be 
delivered the Council will employ a sequential approach to provision: 
i) Where on -site provision is not viable, affordable housing will need to be 
provided off -site 30. This is expected to enable the same amount of 
additional affordable housing as would have been delivered on -site. 
ii) Where viability evidence demonstrates that the full amount of affordable 
housing cannot be delivered the Council will negotiate a level of on -site 
affordable housing that can be delivered taking into account the mix of unit 
size, type and tenure, in addition to a financial contribution. If this ca nnot 
be accommodated on -site then the Council will seek a suitable level of off -
site provision in addition to a payment in lieu. 
iii) The Council will only accept a financial contribution in lieu of affordable 
housing provision where it can be satisfactorily d emonstrated that on -site or 
off-site provision is neither feasible nor viable. 
(c) The Council will have regard to the whole development site in determining the 
appropriate level of affordable housing provision on -site. This includes where 
an applicant has s ub-divided, fragmented or phased a site or it is not being 
developed to its full potential so as to fall under the affordable housing 
threshold. The affordable housing requirement will need to reflect that which 
would be provided if the whole site were to come forward as a single scheme. 
(d) Proposals for housing need to meet the need as identified in the most up to 
date housing needs assessment with particular regard to size, type and tenure 
of dwellings. The tenure and number of bedrooms of the affordable homes 
provided on each qualifying site must contribute towards meeting the mix of 
affordable housing needs identified in the Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment31 . This currently includes a tenure split of 75% affordable/social 
29 or subsequent affordable housing needs evidence (as previous) commissions or produced by the 
council

rent, with 25% First Home s as per national guidance32 . A minimum of 10% of 
the homes provided on each site must be available for affordable home 
ownership, except where an exemption applies in the NPPF. 
(e) Where Build to Rent housing is proposed, the proportion of Affordable Housing 
provision should be in line with the benchmark level set by the Council and 
follow any up-to-date evidence, plans or strategies. 
(f) Where provided within a market housing scheme, a ffordable housing will be 
well integrated with and appropriately designed to complement the market 
housing. Equal access to facilities and amenities (such as open spaces and 
play facilities) will be required for all groups of the community living within t he 
development. 
(g) The requirement to provide affordable housing will apply to all residential 
development falling under Use Class C3 with the exception of Gypsy & 
Traveller Pitches or Travelling Showman Plots. 
(h) Viability Review mechanisms should be applied to all viability tested 
applications at early and late stages in the development process (and mid -term 
reviews in the case of longer phased schemes) to ensure that affordable 
housing delivery is maximised as a result of any future improvement in vi ability. 
Definitions 
6.24 Affordable housing is housing provided to those that are unable to meet their housing 
needs through the private sector. Government policy as set out in the NPPF defines 
affordable housing as affordable housing for rent, starter homes, discounted market 
sales housing, and other affordable routes to home ownership33 . To be affordable, 
the cost of housing must be low enough for eligible households to afford based on 
local incomes and house prices. 
6.25 The Affordable Housing d efinition was amended to include First Homes in May 2021. 
First Homes are a specific kind of discounted market sale housing and should be 
considered to meet the definition of ‘affordable housing’ for planning purposes. 
Specifically, First Homes are discoun ted market sale units which: a) must be 
discounted by a minimum of 30% against the market value; b) are sold to a person or 
persons meeting the First Homes eligibility criteria (see below); c) on their first sale, 
will have a restriction registered on the title at HM Land Registry to ensure this 
discount (as a percentage of current market value) and certain other restrictions are 
passed on at each subsequent title transfer; and, d) after the discount has been 
applied, the first sale must be at a price no hi gher than £250,000 (or £420,000 in 
Greater London). First Homes are the government’s preferred discounted market 
tenure and should account for at least 25% of all affordable housing units delivered 
by developers through planning obligations. PPG 24 May 202 1 Paragraph: 001

    Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Housing 
Reasoned Justification 
6.26 Spelthorne is a well -located Borough , situated immediately to the south of Heathrow 
Airport and adjacent to west London. The Borough offers a good quality of life with 
strong transport links to London. Whilst this has many positive impacts, the 
desirability of the location does mean that affordability is negatively affected. 
6.27 The NPPF states that local authorities should assess the size, type and tenure of 
housing needed for different gr oups in the community, including those who require 
affordable housing, and should reflect this in policy. The importance of housing 
delivery is a central objective of the Local Plan since housing costs in the Borough 
and neighbouring areas, for purchase a nd for rent, are generally very high. The 
provision of affordable housing is necessary to ensure that housing is available to 
local people in priority housing need who are unable to afford adequate housing on 
the open market. 
6.28 There is significant pressur e on the affordability of housing in the Borough with 
median house prices being 12.66 times median workplace -based annual earnings34 . 
6.29 The SHMA update 2019 indicates that there is a need for 459 affordable homes in the 
Borough per annum over the plan perio d. While the affordable housing need 
identified in the SHMA is a considerable percentage of the overall housing need, it is 
not a like for like comparison and does not directly correlate, therefore it is 
recommended the Council seek as much affordable hou sing need as is viably 
possible. Consideration will be given to the latest affordable housing evidence and 
the Council will have due regard for the priority needs of the Borough , as set out in 
the Housing Register maintained by the Council. 
6.30 The objective of this policy is therefore to provide a deliverable framework within 
which affordable housing can be secured from new development in the Borough in 
accordance with national planning policy and responding to local identified needs. It 
will help the Borou gh to bridge the gap between the supply of affordable housing and 
the identified housing need. 
6.31 This arrangement will also contribute towards the creation of sustainable, inclusive 
and mixed communities and a wide choice of housing on new development sites . 
Developments that include an element of affordable housing will need to ensure that 
all groups of the community are given equal access to new or improved facilities and 
amenities. This includes, but is not limited to, playgrounds, open space or communi ty 
infrastructure. 
6.32 Given the level of local housing need, the Council will seek 30% of housing on 
qualifying sites to be affordable either by means of on -site provision, off -site provision 
or by a financial contribution and to be delivered as part of a mix of housing types and 
tenures as set out in Policy H1. This will ensure that the required housing mix is 
reflected across the whole development scheme as far as possible. Greenfield sites 
(including those formerly designated as Green Belt and released through the Local 
Plan) will be expected to deliver at least 50% affordable housing. This requirement is 
based on the Spelthorne Viability Assessment evidence which confirms the feasibility 
of providing a higher level of affordable housing on greenfield sites.

  Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Housing 
6.33 National policy and guidance set out that the role for viability assessment is primarily 
at the plan making stage. Policies should be realistic and for affordable housing, 
required levels should be set as to take account of affordable housing and 
infrastructure needs and allows for the planned types of sites and development to be 
deliverable, without the need for further viability assessment at the decision -making 
stage. Given the viability assessment work undertaken at the plan making stage, all 
development will be expected to be policy compliant. It is up to the applicant to 
demonst rate whether particular circumstances justify the need for a viability 
assessment at the application stage. 
6.34 If the Council determines that the full on -site affordable housing delivery cannot be 
made at the time of the decision, the Council will require a review mechanism by way 
of a planning obligation, to assess if circumstances have improved to increase the 
provision to the full policy compliant amount. This is more likely to be appropriate on 
larger or phased developments. 
6.35 In instances where developmen t viability is an issue, developers will need to submit 
sufficiently detailed viability evidence which will be reviewed by the Council and a 
third party35 . To allow this analysis to take place in an open and transparent manner a 
viability report, completed using a recognised toolkit36 , should be provided as part of 
pre-application discussions or the application submission with the data and 
information available in an open book format. The assessment should clearly outline 
the maximum number of affordable dw ellings which can be achieved on site. Costs 
associated with the assessment and third -party review should be met by the 
developer. 
6.36 The Council aims to secure the delivery of affordable housing on -site or where it can 
be demonstrated that it is not viable or feasible to provide any affordable housing on -
site, the Council will consider accepting off -site provision and/or financial 
contributions in lieu of on -site provision. 
6.37 Given the viability work in preparation of the Local Plan, it is considered that the 30% 
affordable housing contribution and tenure splits in Policy H2 are viable and realistic 
in most development locations in the Borough . It is, however, recognised that there 
may be sites where on -site provision would not be viable or would be impractic al (due 
to its size or location), therefore financial contributions in lieu may be accepted. Any 
relaxation in the provision of affordable housing must be the minimum to make the 
scheme viable. The applicant will be expected to provide a viable amount of 
affordable housing on -site with the rest provided via financial contribution. This 
payment is expected to be of broadly equivalent value relative to on -site provision. 
6.38 The National Planning Policy Framework states that affordable housing on build to 
rent schemes should be provided by default in the form of affordable private rent, a 
class of affordable housing specifically designed for build to rent. Affordable private 
rent and private market rent units within a development should be managed 
collectiv ely by a single build to rent landlord. The benchmark for the level of 
affordable private rent homes to be provided should be in line with national policy and 
guidance until such a time that the Council sets its own benchmark level based on 
local evidence, strategies and guidance.

contribution must be justified with clear and robust evidence which stands up to 
scrutiny and independent review (which must be carried out at the expen se of the 
applicant). 
6.40 Evidence in the SHMA update 2019 indicates that single key workers are likely to 
require social rental accommodation or support from Local Housing Allowance in

H3: Meeting the needs of Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling 
Showpeople 
1) National planning policy for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople is set out in 
the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and Planning Policy for Traveller 
Sites. The Equality Act 2010 requires Councils to take steps to meet the needs of 
people who have relevant protected characteristics, such as Romany Gypsies and 
Irish and Scottish Travellers. 
2) The Council will make provision for additional Gypsy and Traveller p itches and 
additional plots for Travelling Showpeople to meet the accommodation needs in the 
Borough which are identified in the most up -to-date Gypsy and Traveller 
Accommodation Assessment (GTAA). 
3) The Council will safeguard existing authorised pitches a nd plots for Gypsies, 
Travellers and Travelling Showpeople and the loss of these to other uses will be 
resisted unless it can be demonstrated that there is a surplus supply of traveller 
pitches and plots for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople in the Borough . 
4) In addition to site allocations in this Plan, planning permission for Gypsy and Traveller 
and Travelling Showpeople accommodation will be granted provided that all of the 
following criteria are met and subject to other policies in the Plan : 
(a) There is an identified need for the pitch or plot provision . 
(b) There is good access to local services, including education, health and welfare 
services, and shop . 
(c) There is safe access to the highway, public transport services and other 
sustainable transport options . 
(d) Adequate onsite facilities are provided for parking, storage and waste collection . 
(e) The location of the site provides a safe living environment, free from the risk of 
flooding and risks to health through contamination, noise , vibration, odour and 
pollution. 
(f) The potential for successful integration between travelling and settled 
communities can be demonstrated . 
Definitions 
6.42 For the purposes of this planning policy, ‘Travellers’ means ‘Gypsies and Travellers’ 
and ‘Travelling Showpeople’ as defined below. 
• Gypsy and Travellers: Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, 
including such persons who on grounds only of their own or their family’s or 
dependents’ educational or health needs or old age have ceased to travel 
temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of Travelling Showpeople 
or circus people travelling together as such.

• Travelling Showpeople: Members of a group organised for the purposes of holding 
fairs, circuses or shows (whether or not travelling together as such). This includes 
such persons who on the grounds of their own or their family’s or dependents’ more 
localised pattern of trading, educational or health needs or old age have ceased to 
travel temporarily, but excl udes Gypsies and Travellers as defined above. 
6.43 For the purposes of this planning policy, ‘pitch’ means a pitch on a ‘Gyps y and 
Traveller’ site and ‘plot’ means a pitch on a ‘Travelling Showpeople’ site (often called 
a ‘yard’). This terminology differentiat es between residential pitches for ‘Gypsies and 
Travellers’ and mixed -use plots for ‘Travelling Showpeople’, which may/will need to 
incorporate space or to be split to allow for the storage of equipment. 
6.44 A pitch is an area normally occupied by one househol d, which typically contains 
enough space for one or two caravans but can vary in size. A site is a collection of 
pitches which form a development exclusively for Gypsies and Travellers. For 
Travelling Showpeople, the most common descriptions used are a p lot for the space 
occupied by one household and a yard for a collection of plots which are typically 
exclusively occupied by Travelling Showpeople . 
Reasoned Justification 
6.45 National planning policy for Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople is set out in 
the National Planning Policy Framework and Planning Policy for Traveller Sites and 
the Council will expect all new sites to meet the requirements of national policy. New 
pitches and plots should have adequate utility services and amenity space, safe 
turning space and parking and be in areas with reasonable access to schools, health 
services and local services. Travelling Showpeople sites may also need space for 
related business storage. 
6.46 The Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) requires local plan ning authorities to 
identify and update annually a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide 
five years’ worth of sites against their own, locally -set targets. The Council published 
a Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Accommodati on Assessment (GTAA) 
in 2018 which has identified the need for Traveller pitches and Travelling Showpeople 
plots in the Borough over the Plan period. T he Housing Act 2004 requires local 
authorities to take account of the needs of travelling people and to c reate strategies 
to meet those needs. National policy requires local planning authorities to identify 
and if necessary, allocate sufficient sites to meet the needs of these groups within 
their local plans. 
6.47 Households who do not travel fall outside the pla nning definition of a Traveller. 
However Romany Gypsies, Irish and Scottish Travellers may be able to claim a right 
to culturally appropriate accommodation under the Equality Act (2010). In addition, 
provisions set out in the Housing and Planning Act (201 6) now include a duty (under 
Section 8 of the 1985 Housing Act that covers the requirement for a periodical review 
of housing needs) for local authorities to consider the needs of people residing in or 
resorting to their district with respect to the provis ion of sites on which caravans can 
be stationed. 
6.48 The Council recognises the value of closer working relations with the local Traveller 
community. Often a socially excluded group, the community has a significantly lower 
life expectancy, lower educational attainment, and strikingly, a Gypsy and Traveller

child is three times more likely to be taken into care than a child from the settled 
community37. The Council recognises the contribution that decent permanent 
culturally suitable accommodation can have to the overall wellbeing of Traveller 
families. 
6.49 Gypsy and Traveller sites can either be publicly or privately owned residential sites. 
Pitches on public sites can be obtained through signing up to a waiting list, and the 
costs of running the sites are met from the rent paid by the licensees (similar to social 
housing). The alternative to public residential sites are private residential sites and 
yards for Gypsies, Travellers and Travelling Showpeople. These result from 
individuals or families buying area s of land and then obtaining planning permission to 
live on them. Households can also rent pitches on existing private sites. Therefore, 
these two forms of accommodation are the equivalent to private ownership and 
renting for those who live in bricks and mortar housing. Generally, the majority of 
Travelling Showpeople yards are privately owned and managed.

7. Environment 
7.1 Two of the most pressing challenges to be addressed at all scales in the 21st century 
are climate change and the loss of biodiversity. Addressing these challenges, as well 
as supporting development which delivers health and wellbeing benefits for our 
commu nity lies at the heart of achieving sustainable development. The natural 
environment plays a key role in meeting these objectives and as such the protection 
and enhancement of the Borough ’s natural environment is fundamental to the 
success of the Plan and securing a sustainable future for Spelthorne. 
7.2 Spelthorne benefits from a diverse natural environment, highly valued by our 
communities and offering a wide range of benefits; our natural environment plays a 
key role in making the Borough an attractive place to live and work. Recognising the 
importance of both protecting the existing natural environment and delivering high 
quality development which provides further enhancements, the policies within the 
Plan set out how this will be achieved over the next 15 y ears. 
Green and Blue Infrastructure 
7.3 Encompassing more than simply conventional open space, a successfully planned 
and implemented green and blue infrastructure network provides multiple, 
multifunctional benefits at all scales and makes a significant contribution to 
sustainable development. 
7.4 Green and blue infrastructure is a strategically planned network of features, including 
parks, open spaces, playing fields, woodlands, as well as street trees, allotments, 
private gardens, green roofs an d walls and sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), as 
well as watercourses and other waterbodies 
7.5 The benefits of good quality green and blue infrastructure include improving health 
and wellbeing, air quality, nature recovery and resilience to and mitigation of climate 
change, along with addressing issues of social inequality and environmental decline.

E1: Green and Blue Infrastructure 
1. Development must contribute towards the provision, protection and enhancement 
of the wider green infrastructure network at a scale commensurate with the 
proposal. 
2. All proposals for major development will be required to provide a high standard of 
design f or green infrastructure in accordance with established, recognisable 
standards, including the National Design Guide38, the Natural England Green 
Infrastructure Framework39 and Building with Nature Standards40. 
3. Where development is located on or adjacent t o a watercourse or reservoir 
proposals must contribute towards the delivery of a high quality multi -functional 
blue infrastructure network through ensuring the protection and enhancement of 
the ecological, landscape and recreational value of that water bod y. 
4. Development proposals impacting upon rivers and watercourses must 
demonstrate how they will, maintain and enhance the quality of blue infrastructure, 
in accordance with the Water Framework Directive . 
5. Green and blue infrastructure should be planned, designed and managed in an 
integrated way to achieve multiple benefits and should ensure appropriate long -
term stewardship arrangements are in place to secure the quality of green and 
blue infrastructure in perpetuity41. 
6. Development should have regard to and contribute towards any Green and Blue 
Infrastructure Strategy/SPD that is produced. 
Definitions 
7.6 Green Infrastructure is defined in the NPPF as ‘a network of multi -functional green 
and blue spaces and other natural features, urban and rural, which is capable of 
delivering a wide range of environmental, economic, health and wellbeing benefits for 
nature, climate, local and wider communities and prosperity’42 
7.7 Blue Infrastructure is the network of watercourses and other bodies of water including 
reservoirs, which provide ecological, landscape and recreational value to the 
Borough . This also includes the banks and corridors immediately along the 
watercourse whic h can provide significant biodiversity benefits and play a vital role in 
ensuring habitat connectivity

Reasoned justification 
7.8 All development should contribute towards the provision, improvement, and 
maintenance of the green infrastructure network across the Borough where 
appropriate to do so. Whilst the Council will only expect ‘major’ development 
proposals to be designed in accordance with established, recognised green 
infrastructure standards, all developments can make a positive impact on the green 
infrastructure network and proposals will, be expected to make such provision at a 
scale that is commensurate with the development. Supplementary guidance will set 
out how development proposals on a large and small scale might assist in enhancing 
the green in frastructure network 
7.9 The Water Framework Directive43 requires rivers and waterbodies in the UK to 
achieve good ecological status by 2027. This includes resisting the establishment 
and spread of non -native invasive species which can have a significant detrimental 
impact on native species. UK domestic law ha s retained the WFD and requires that 
River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) are produced to improve the status of 
waterbodies . Many of the waterbodies in the Borough support recreational uses 
which are required to be carried out within tight environmental r estrictions and are 
regulated. Recreational uses are supported provided that they respect the ecological 
and landscape values of the waterbodies and the associated corridor. 
Long Term Stewardship 
7.10 Development proposed within this Local Plan will enhance the existing green 
infrastructure network as well as delivering a diverse range of green and blue 
infrastructure features. How this provision is delivered and maintained in perpetuity 
has a direct impact on the quality of a place in the long term. 
7.11 Expandi ng and enhancing the green and blue infrastructure network will provide 
multiple benefits to the Borough as a whole, however, preserving its quality and 
condition for the long term requires effective stewardship. Planning for long term 
stewardship of commu nity assets, including its financing and governance structure 
must be considered from the outset if a successful and sustainable outcome is to be 
achieved. 
7.12 In the past it was common for the Council, together with its partners to adopt and 
manage new commu nity assets (including the green and blue infrastructure and other 
community facilities) which were delivered through development. However, in light of 
ever-increasing public sector financial constraints and the ongoing pressures on the 
Council’s resources this model of long -term stewardship is no longer the preferred 
option of the Council in the majority of circumstances. 
7.13 With a broad range of stewardship models and funding opportunities available, it is 
not possible to adopt a ‘one size fits all’ approach . The most appropriate stewardship 
option for a development will vary depending on the scale, location and community 
assets provided and must be agreed on a case -by-case basis. Community 
stewardship models are encouraged and will be supported. 
7.14 Nevertheles s, the Council recognises that a community stewardship model requires 
sufficient level of development to create a natural community focus or where there is

adequate scale of on -site community assets to manage. In circumstances where the 
scale of developmen t is not sufficient to support a community management 
stewardship model, a private management company solution may be considered 
acceptable. Where this is the case, proposals will need to demonstrate that the 
private management company proposed will: 
• be ru n in a way that ensures residents have and retain a key governance role, 
• maintain openness and transparency, 
• be focused on the local development and the maintenance of the environment in 
the longer term with surpluses reinvested for such purpose, 
• provide a quality service at a reasonable cost over the longer term, 
• allow for residents to take control in the longer term should this be their ambition.

E2: Biodiversity 
1) The Council will support development proposals which restore, maintain and enhance 
habitat connectivity and will seek opportunities for habitat creation particularly within 
Biodiversity Opportunity Areas. Development proposals will be expected to contribute 
to biodiversity through clearly demonstrating impro vements when submitting a 
planning application as part of securing biodiversity net -gain. 
2) Development on or adjacent to the following designated sites in the Borough will need 
to have reference to this Policy: 
• Ramsar sites (International). 
• Special Prote ction Areas (European). 
• Sites of Special Scientific Interest and National Nature Reserves (National). 
• Ancient Woodland, ancient or veteran trees; and/or trees and hedgerows 
protected by a Tree Preservation Order. 
• Sites of Nature Conservation Importance, Local Nature Reserves (Local) 
• Other priority habitats and priority species not identified above (Local); 
designated Local Green Space where richness of wildlife has been identified 
as a contributing factor in its designation; and any area in Spelthorne th at may 
be identified in a Local Nature Recovery Strategy; trees considered to make a 
significant contribution to their surroundings, individually or as a group. 
3) The Council will maintain Sites of Nature Conservation Importance as shown on the 
Policies Map and will only permit development proposals within these sites, where 
there will be no adverse effect, either directly or indirectly on their ecological interest 
and this has been clearly demonstrated through use of appropriate assessment. 
4) For development proposals that affect national, regional or locally protected sites not 
forming part of a Ramsar or SPA, (such as SSSIs, SNCIs, LNRs) permission will only 
be granted where it can be demonstrated that the benefits of the development 
proposed cl early outweigh the decrease in the nature conservation value of the site 
and that: 
(a) any such decrease has been kept to a minimum, 
(b) mitigation or compensation to provide for species protection and/or 
habitat creation or enhancement has been made within the area, and 
(c) appropriate measures to monitor the effectiveness of the mitigation 
have been established. 
Biodiversity Net Gain 
5) The Council will seek net gains in biodiversity, through creation or expansion, 
restoration, enhancement and management of habitats and features to improve the 
status of priority habitats and species. All development44 will be expected to provide at 
least 10% net gain. Major development should calculate this through the most up -to 
date version of the Biodiversity Metric (or its equivalent). For development of nine

    Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Environment 
dwellings or less, the latest small sites metric (or its equivalent) should be used to 
calculate net gain . 
6) The Council will expect developers to demonstrate full consideration of a variety of 
means in improving biodiversity within developments including, but not limited to, the 
use of innovative approaches where appropriate such as: 
• the installation of bee b ricks, 
• use of bird nest boxes, 
• incorporation of green roofs and living walls 
7) Development proposals should demonstrate clearly how net gain will be achieved and 
this should be in accordance with any Supplementary Planning Document and/or 
additional guida nce as produced by the Council. 
8) Biodiversity net gain should be delivered using the following hierarchy: 
i) On site as part of the development; 
ii) Where on -site delivery is not feasible then this should be provided on land 
adjacent to, or as close to the development site, as possible; 
iii) As a last resort, net gain should be secured on land within the Borough 
boundary 
Waterbodies in the Borough 
9) Where development is proposed on or adjacent to any waterbodies in the Borough , 
reference should be made to the fol lowing:

7.15 Biodiversity Opportunity Areas (BOAs) are identified as the most important areas for 
biodiversity in the Borough . BOAs represent the basis for an ecological network 
where improved habitat management as well as efforts to restore an d create habitats 
will be most effective in enhancing connectivity to benefit species recovery. 
7.16 Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) is an approach to development, and/or land 
management, that aims to leave the natural environment in a measurably better state 
than it was beforehand.

     managed. It is therefore important to conserve and enhance natural habitats, which 
are key to protecting individual species and, in turn, to achieving sustainable 
development as well as ensuring that when development does come forward it 
minimises its impacts as f ully as possible and provides opportunities to achieve net 
gains in biodiversity. 
There are a number of protective designations within the Borough that are of 
international, national and local significance. These designations include four SSSI 
with a furt her SSSI, which include the Wraysbury reservoir network to the north, 
Staines Moor and Shortwood Common. Additionally, these reservoirs are also 
identified as Special Protection Ares and Ramsar sites as part of the South West 
London Waterbodies (SWLWB) net work which also includes sites outside the 
Borough . These networks are crucial for migrating and over -wintering birds. As part 
of this, Spelthorne has a number of non -SPA relevant sites, primarily waterbodies, 
which support the SWLWB network and provide r efuge for many species. There are 
also 26 local SNCI spread across Spelthorne, along with two Local Nature Reserves 
and an area of ancient woodland. 
Paragraph 179 of the Framework sets out that local plan policies should identify, map 
and safeguard components of local wildlife -rich habitats and wider ecological 
networks. Spelthorne has a number of international, national and locally designated 
biodive rsity sites which justify protection. 
Biodiversity net -gain is an approach which aims to leave the natural environment in a 
measurably better state than beforehand. This approach has been included as part 
of the Environment Act 2021 which stipulates tha t net gain should be mandatory by 
November 2023. Biodiversity net gain will be sought on sites where existing green 
assets can be improved or enhanced or where these are lost, such as on greenfield 
sites, proposed development will provide significant repl acements. Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Environment 
Reasoned justification 
7.17 Biodiversity is a means of quantifying the natural environment, which surrounds us 
everywhere, and is connected to many aspects of everyday life. Biodiversity can be 
described as the richness and variety of living things which exist in a given area. 
Biodiversity and geodiversity (the diversity of geological sites) is not just confined to 
identified and protected sites. 
7.18 Over the past half a century, there have been significant declines in several species, 
which has resulted in many cases of local extinction, linked largely to loss of habitat. 
The causative factors behind this loss of natural habitat and species include climate 
change, the expansion of the built environment and the way important habitats are 
7.19 
7.20 
7.21 
7.22 Development proposals should refer to any relevant Supplementary Planning 
Documents or Action Plans that are produced by the Council which guide on 
biodiversity net gain for planning applications. 
7.23 BOAs are key areas where priority habitat can b e created, improved or restored and 
there are two significant areas identified in Spelthorne where opportunities for 
restoration and creation of habitats exist:

E3: Managing Flood Risk 
1) Flood zones in Spelthorne Borough are determined by definitions contained within 
national planning practice guidance and the Council’s Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (Level 1). 
2) To reduce the overall and local flood risk and manage water resources development 
must be located, designed an d laid out to ensure that it I safe, the risk from flooding is 
minimised (whilst not increasing flooding risk elsewhere) and that residual risks ae 
safely managed. 
3) New development will be guided to areas of lowest flood risk from all sources of 
flooding through the application of the sequential test46. Where individual sites contain 
different flood zones, the layout of the site will be expected to minimise flood risk. The 
exception test will continue to be applied where national planning policy advises that 
this is necessary. 
4) All development propos als47 are required to demonstrate that land drainage will be 
adequate and that they will not result in an increase in surface water run -off. The 
Council will expect incorporating SuDs (Sustainable Drainage Systems) to manage 
surface water drainage, unless it can be demonstrated that they are not appropriate. 
5) Development in Flood Zones 2 and 3a48 and on a dry island49 will be permitted 
provided that: 
(a) the vulnerability of the proposed use is appropriate for the level of flood risk on 
the site (see table below); 
(b) the proposal passes the sequential and exception test (where required) as 
outlined in the NPPF and guidance; 
(c) a site -specific flood risk assessment demonstrates that the development, 
including will be safe for its lifetime (taking into account climate change) 
without increasing flooding elsewhere, and will, where possible, reduce flood 
risk overall; 
(d) safe access and egress50 is demonstrated for residential development of one 
or more net additional units;51 
(e) the scheme incorporates flood protection, flood resilience and resistance 
measures appropriate to the character of the area and;

(f) applications include appropriate flood warning and evacuation52 and site 
drainage systems take account of storm events and flood risk of up to 1 in 100 
year event with an appropriate allowance for climate change. 
6) applications must be supported by Flood Risk Assessments where appropriate that 
demonstrate the development will be safe, not increase flood risk elsewhere, and 
maximise opportunities to reduce floo d risk. 
1 in 20 year – Flood Zone 3b 
7) Within the 1 in 20 year53 (5% AEP) extent; 
(a) the provision of essential infrastructure will be supported but in principle the 
land should remain undeveloped to maintain flood storage capacity and not 
impede the flow of flood water. 
(b) development vulnerability should be reduced and change of use to a higher 
vulnerability classification will not be permitted; 
(c) extensions or re -development of buildings may be considered, subject to the 
following: 
i) the footprint of the building should be reduced where possible and should 
not be increased, 
ii) finished floor levels should be raised where possible; 
iii) surface water runoff rates and volumes from the site should be reduced; 
iv) floodplain storage capacity shoul d be increased and space created for 
flooding to occur by restoring functional floodplain; 
v) impedance to floodwater flow should be reduced; 
vi) flood resistance and resilience measures be incorporated and; 
vii) inclusion of measures to ensure development remain s safe for users in 
time of flood54 . 
8) Schemes which deliver a betterment will be supported, subject to consultation with the 
Environment Agency where required and meeting other policy requirements of the 
Plan. 
9) Within the 1 in 20 year (5% AEP) extent basements, basement extensions, 
conversion s of basements to a higher vulnerability classification are not permitted. 
Basement car parks (or similar development) which are designed to allow the inflow 
and egress of flood water may be permitted

River Thames Scheme 
10) The Council supports proposals fo r strategic flood relief measures, including the 
proposed flood channel through the Borough as part of the River Thames Scheme. 
The proposed route of the channel and the land adjacent to it, as shown on the 
Policies Map will be safeguarded for this purpos e55. 
Definitions 
7.25 
7.26 
Flood Zones Flood Zones in Spelthorne are based on definitions contained within National 
Planning Practice Guidance and the Council’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
(Level 1). 
• Flood resistance: Flood -resistant construction can prevent entry of water or 
minimise the amount that may enter a building where there is short duration 
flooding outside with water depths of 0.6 metres or less. This form of construction 
should be used with caution and accompanied by resilience measures, as 
effective flood exclusion may depend on occupiers ensuring some elements, such 
as barriers to doorways are put in place and maintained in a good state. 
• Flood resilience: Flood -resilient buildings are designed and constructed to reduce 
the impact of flood water entering th e building so that no permanent damage is 
caused, structural integrity is maintained, and drying and cleaning is easier and 
the building can be re -occupied more quickly. 
Planning Practice Guidance states that flood resistance and resilience measures 
should not be used to justify development in inappropriate locations. 
Flood Zone Definition 
Zone 1 Low Probability Land having a less than 1 in 1,000 annual probability of 
river or sea flooding. 
(Shown as ‘clear’ on the Flood Map – all land outside 
Zones 2 and 3) 
Zone 2 Medium 
Probability Land having between a 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 annual 
probability of river flood ing; or land having between a 1 
in 200 and 1 in 1,000 annual probability of sea 
flooding. 
Zone 3a High Probability Land having a 1 in 100 or greater annual probability of 
river flooding; or land having a 1 in 200 or greater 
annual probability of sea floo ding. 
Zone 3b The Functional 
Floodplain This zone comprises land where water has to flow or 
be stored in times of flood. Local planning authorities 
should identify in their Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessments areas of functional floodplain and its 
boundaries accordingly, in agreement with the 
Environment Agency.

7.27 Note: The Flood Zones shown on the Environment Agency’s Flood Map for Planning 
(Rivers and Sea) available on the Environment Agency’s website, do not take 
account of the possible impacts of climate change and consequent changes in the 
future probability of flooding. Reference should therefore also be made to the 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment when considering location and potential future flood 
risks to developments and land uses. 
Flood Zone 3b Functional Floodplain 
7.28 The definition of Flood Zone 3b Functional Floodplain for Spelthorne Borough Council 
includes all buildings which have not been designed to exclude floodwater and do not 
resist water ingress, such as garages and warehouses, as well as roads, other linear 
features and other areas for car parking or recreational use which may provide 
important flow routes and flood storage functionality. 
Flood Risk Vulnerability and Flood Zone ‘Compatibility’ (Source: PPG) 
Reasoned Justification 
7.29 In Spelthorne there are areas within the 1 in 20 (5%) or greater flood extent that are 
already developed and are prevented from flooding by the presence of existing 
infrastructure or solid buildings. Whilst these areas may be subject to frequent 
flooding, it may not be practical to refuse all future development. As such, and in 
accordance with the PPG, in some instances the Council will consider existing 
building footprints, where they can be demonstrated to exclude floodwater, not to be 
defined as Flood Zone 3b Functional Flood plain. 
The approach the Council will take to development within the 1 in 20 year (5%) flood 
outline recognises the importance of pragmatic planning solutions that will not 
unnecessarily ‘blight’ areas of existing development, the importance of the 
undevelo ped land surrounding them and the potential opportunities to reinstate areas 
which can operate as functional floodplain through redevelopment to provide space 
for floodwater and reduce risk to new and existing development. 
7.31 The consideration of whether a b uilding resists water ingress will be considered on a 
case -by-case basis as part of the planning application process, having regard to the 
presence of existing buildings on the site and the existing routing of floodwater 
through the site during times of fl ooding.

E4: Environmental Protection 
Air Quality 
1) The Council will seek to protect and improve the Borough ’s air quality and work 
towards meeting the World Health Organisation Air Quality Guidelines by ensuring all 
development proposals prevent further deterioratio n of existing poor air quality and are 
“air quality neutral” as far as reasonably practicable. 
2) An applicant will be required to submit an air quality assessment for development 
proposals where development: 
(a) is in an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA), or is predicted to impact 
pollutant levels within an AQMA and 
(b) generates significant levels of pollution, or 
(c) increases traffic volumes or congestion, or 
(d) is for non -residential uses of 1000 sqm or greater, or 
(e) is for 10 or more dwellings, or 
(f) involves development sensitive to poor air quality or 
(g) introduces a potentially significant point source of air pollutant emissions or 
alters the emissions of an existing point source. Applicants are strongly 
encouraged to avoid the introduction of a point sou rce by utilising technology 
such as Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP). Where a development proposal 
introduces a point source, for example a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
unit, the Air Quality Assessment should demonstrate the necessity of the 
proposed equipmen t. 
3) For development proposals that could potentially cause, exacerbate or introduce new 
exposure to poor air quality, mitigation and compensation measures should be 
incorporated. Mitigation is required to ensure that all major developments are 
sustainable from an air quality perspective and for the protection of public health. 
Where on site measures alone are not possible or are insufficient to reduce the impact 
on air quality, applicants should consider the scope for mitigating the impact by 
contributing to fu nding of other initiatives that improve air quality. 
4) Planning permission will not be granted for proposals where adverse effects on air 
quality for existing receptors and/or future occupiers are of a significant scale, either 
individually or in combinat ion with other proposals and/or the effects cannot be 
appropriately and effectively mitigated. 
Water Quality 
5) The Council will ensure all development located near ground and surface water have 
the appropriate measures in place to mitigate any adverse impact on water quality and 
water features. Planning permission will not be granted for developments which do 
not demonstrate the incorporation of water efficiency measures such as water 
recycling and collection features. Wherever practical, Sustainable Drainage System

(SuDS) should be incorporated to minimise the discharge of surface water to the 
sewer system. 
Nois e 
6) The Council will seek to protect and improve local noise conditions as far as 
reasonably practicable. The Council will ensure that development proposals that may 
generate unacceptable noise or be unreasonably impacted by noise sources 
incorporate appropri ate attenuation measures to minimise the effects on new and 
existing residents. The adverse impacts of noise are to be reduced to acceptable 
levels through good design, layout and orientation of sites and buildings, and 
adequate noise insulation. In reside ntial areas close to the airport, only one -for-one 
replacement of existing housing will be allowed within the 66Leq and above noise 
contour. The Council will require an acoustic report to accompany an application for 
development proposals that may be sens itive to noise sources, or might cause 
unacceptable noise for residents, businesses or the environment. Planning permission 
will be refused where the impact of noise cannot be mitigated to an acceptable level. 
Light 
7) This policy seeks to minimise the a dverse impact from light pollution on the 
environment. It promotes the use of measures to minimise the adverse impact of 
lighting on surrounding areas. Applicants developing proposals for lighting will be 
required to assess the impact of the lighting sch eme and demonstrate there are no 
unacceptable adverse impacts. The Council will require developments that may result 
in light pollution to incorporate appropriate design and energy saving measures in 
order to minimise the potential for light pollution. Pla nning permission will not be 
granted for light generating development proposals that may have an adverse impact 
on residential developments, amenity, wildlife, biodiversity and highway safety. The 
Council will require a lighting impact assessment to accomp any an application for 
development proposals that may cause unacceptable light pollution for residents, 
businesses or the environment. 
Development of Land Affected by Contamination 
8) The Council will ensure that where development is proposed on land that m ay be 
affected by contamination, the applicant must undertake appropriate risk assessment 
and if necessary, remediation to ensure the development is safe or will be made safe 
for its intended use. Through the incorporation of mitigation measures, treatment to 
reduce contamination or remove pollutant pathways and soil/ground gas/groundwater 
remediation initiatives, receptors exposure to land contamination will be minimised. 
9) The Council will: 
i) Require development proposals to be accompanied by an assessment of risk 
from contamination where the development is on or adjacent to previous 
industrial uses or other land known to be affected by contamination, or in all 
cases where the proposal is for ne w housing or other forms of development 
which are particularly sensitive to contamination. 
ii) Impose conditions on planning permissions requiring appropriate investigation 
and remediation of contamination before development can proceed.

Definitions 
7.32 Air Quality Management Area (AQMA ): The area within the Borough where the 
national air quality objectives56 are not likely to be achieved, as declared to 
Defra. Spelthorne currently has a Borough wide AQMA for nitrogen dioxide. 
7.33 Point sources of air pollutant emissions: Point sources of air pollutant emissions are 
stationary locations from which pollutants are discharged such as a chimney or flue. 
Examples include centralised boilers and Combined Heat and Power units . 
7.34 Land affected by contamination: The terminology within policy E3 refers to land 
affected by contamination which is reflected in Government guidance57 . “Land 
affected by contamination” or “land contamination”, are used to describe the much 
broader categories of land where contaminants are present but usually not at a 
sufficient level of risk to be contaminated land58 . As such, the Council/planning 
regime will require development of land affected contamination to follow a higher 
standard of remediation which is in line with best practice guidance from government. 
Government guidance states that organisations must use other regimes above Part 
2A where contaminants are present to resolve land contamination. After carrying out 
the development and commencement of its use, t he land should at a minimum not be 
capable of being determined as contaminated land under Part 2A of the EPA 1990 
(NPPF 2021, paragraph 183b), and must be deemed suitable for use in line with best 
practice guidance. 
7.35 The other term “contaminated land” has a specific legal definition under Part 2A 
Section 78A (2) of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA)1990. The thresholds for 
contamination are less stringent under Part 2A standards than under best practice 
guidance that is applied through planning regime.

Reasoned Justification 
7.36 National policy states that planning policies and decisions should contribute to and 
enhance the natural and local environment by preventing new and existing 
development from contributing to, being put at unacceptable risk from, or being 
adversely affected by, unacceptable levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land 
instability. Development should, wherever possible, help to improve local 
environmental conditions such as air and water quality, tak ing into account relevant 
information such as river basin management plans; and remediating and mitigating 
despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable land, where appropriate 
(NPPF 2021, paragraph 174). 
7.37 Whilst some polluting activities are con trolled through legislation, the planning system 
has a complementary role in directing the location of development that may give rise 
to pollution where a separate pollution control regime does not apply, both pollution 
directly generated from the developm ent or indirectly, for example through the traffic 
a development generates. The NPPF 2021 is clear that the impact of pollution is a 
material planning consideration. 
7.38 National policy requires planning policies and decisions to take into account the likely 
cumulative effects of pollution on health, living conditions and the natural 
environment, as well as the potential sensitivity of the site or the wider area to 
impacts that could arise from the development (NPPF 2021, paragraph 185 and 186). 
Air Quality 
7.39 Air Quality is an important environmental issue for Spelthorne. The Council’s Air 
Quality Action Plan designates the whole Borough as an Air Quality Management 
Area (AQMA). This reflects that the whole Borough has a particular need to improve 
air quality t herefore the Council will ensure that any new development in the Borough 
is consistent with the local Air Quality Action Plan and the requirements of national 
policy for planning decisions to sustain and contribute towards compliance with 
relevant limit va lues or national objectives for pollutants, taking into account the 
AQMA and cumulative impacts (NPPF 2021, paragraph 186) . 
7.40 Road traffic has been identified as the biggest single contributor to poor air quality in 
Spelthorne and results in other adverse en vironmental and health effects. Transport 
modelling and highways data suggest that the main road corridors are the worst 
affected areas. Some areas in the Borough with poor air quality where nitrogen 
dioxide (NO 2) concentrations are in excess of national standards remain notably 
alongside the A308 at Sunbury Cross and the A30 at the Crooked Billet roundabout. 
The level of particulates (known as PM 10 and PM 2.5) is also a concern adjoining the 
M25 and Heathrow Airport. 
7.41 Like every other authority, the Council has a statutory duty to work towards the 
Government’s air quality standards. What is worthy of note is that, though the 
Council has little or no influence over traffic, there is scope to reduce reliance on cars 
and trips that have origins or destinations within Spelthorne to ensure that air quality 
impacts are kept to a minimum. The Council with other stakeholders, will develop 
and implement a strategy to decrease the reliance on cars, promote sustainable 
modes of t ransport and reduce congestion and environmental impacts. The Council 
will ensure that there are mechanisms such as additional Air Quality monitoring

stations in the Borough to capture current levels and to assist in managing air quality 
improvements. Al so, the Council will require an ‘air quality assessment’ to be 
undertaken where the development proposed meets the criteria given in Policy E3. 
National policy requires that the Council to take into account the impacts of 
particulate levels with regard to public health, developments meeting the criteria for 
an air quality assessment should ensure that the impacts of particulate emissions 
(both PM 10 and PM 2.5) are considered within the assessment alongside the impacts of 
NO 2. Where an air quality assessment is required the impacts of the construction, 
demolition and earthworks process and the impacts of construction traffic upon local 
air quality should also be assessed in line with best practice guidance to ensure that 
any significant effects are appropriat ely mitigated against, for the prevention of 
pollution. 
7.42 Individual developments are often shown to have a very small air quality impact. The 
cumulative impact of many individual schemes, deemed insignificant in themselves, 
can contribute to a ‘creeping baseline’. Therefore, good practice to reduce emissions 
and exposure should be incorporated into all developments* at the outset, at a scale 
commensurate with the emissions. Consideration of air quality neutrality should focus 
on both NO x, and PM 10 emissions, the energy sources used within buildings and 
emissions from the vehicles associated with use of the development. Mitigation 
measures to reduce emissions may be applied on -site or off -site however the 
exposure of residents to poor air quality my still resu lt in refusal without sufficient 
mitigation in order to protect public health. 
7.43 In many cases, the impact of the development being assessed will have a cumulative 
effect with other planned developments, which may or may not have planning 
permission. Where these developments have been granted planning permission and 
are therefore ‘committed’ developments, their impacts should be assessed 
cumulatively with those of the application site and incorporating traffic growth 
predictions on the highway network . The c ontribution of these committed 
developments should be accounted for in the ‘future baseline’, provided that their 
contributions can be quantified. It is difficult to include other planning applications yet 
to be determined, as the outcome is not certain – the number and type of traffic 
movements may not be quantifiable, and the site layout and end users may be 
unknown. Circumstances with scenario assessment for proposed development 
without planning permission will be rare. 
7.44 In some circumstances, there will be an existing permission for development on the 
site that has not yet been exercised. In the planning system, the estimated emissions 
from the existing permission could be considered as part of the future baseline and 
thus a revised application for the s ite would give rise to an incremental change 
emission from that associated with the extant permission. The Council’s approach, in 
line with best practice guidance, is that impacts be assessed for the new permission 
sought against the current baseline for t he site, disregarding the extant permission; 
this will reflect the ‘real world’ increase experienced by receptors. 
Water quality 
7.45 The Borough ’s surface and ground water resources are extremely important for a 
range of uses and consumers including domestic, commercial, industrial and 
agricultural. The water industry is a major user of land in the Borough with four large 
97

reservoirs: the Queen Mary, Wraysbury, King George VI, Staines North and Staines, 
and treatment works at Ashford. 
7.46 Due to the Borough ’s prox imity to the River Thames, a significant area is at risk from 
flooding, with Staines and Shepperton being the worst affected areas. Also, the 
Borough ’s ground water is particularly susceptible to pollution from contaminated run -
off, storm sewerage and mis connections of sewerage to surface water drains. As 
such, there is the need for practical measures to be taken to protect, restore and 
enhance the quality of the Borough water resources and its water features without 
compromising sustainable development. 
7.47 Therefore, the Council in conjuncti on with the Environment Agency will seek to resist 
any development proposal that threatens water quality but will support initiatives t hat 
result in improving water quality and the capacity of surface water to support wildlife. 
As stipulated in the European Water Framework Directive , the Council will also 
ensure that the Borough ’s waterbodies achieve good ecological status and protection 
for drinking water sources and protected sites such as Sites of Specific S cientific 
Interest. 
7.48 The possibility of adverse impacts on water quality and the impact of any possible 
discharge of effluent or leachates which may pose a threat to surface or underground 
water resources directly or indirectly through surrounding soils de pends on the nature 
and scale of the development proposed as well as the local topography, the size and 
sensitivity of the water body. Therefore, risks to water quality will need to be 
considered on a case -by-case basis and in consultation with the Environ ment Agency 
where a development could impact upon groundwater sources and water quality. 
Noise 
7.49 Some parts of the Borough suffer from high levels of noise, particularly due to 
Heathrow Airport and road traffic. There are also high noise levels close to t he 
motorways, trunk roads and other major roads such as the A308. Where noise 
sensitive development, including housing and schools, are proposed in these areas 
sound attenuation measures will be required to ensure an acceptable environment is 
created for residents of the development. Applicants should seek advice from the 
Council’s Environmental Health team to ensure that the need for assessments and 
the appropriate level of detail is established at an early stage. The extent of aircraft 
noise from Heathr ow is indicated by noise contours which are shown on the Policies 
Map. 
7.50 Noise sensitive uses proposed in areas that are exposed to noise from existing or 
planned industrial or commercial sources, will only be permitted where future users 
will not be expos ed to an unacceptable noise impact that would result in creation of a 
statutory nuisance. Noise generating development will be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that any nearby noise sensitive uses (as existing or with planning 
permission), will not b e exposed to noise impact that will adversely affect the amenity 
of users of surrounding noise sensitive premises. In urban areas the density of 
industrial plant and air handling units (including kitchen extracts, air -conditioning units 
and refrigeration p lant) has a cumulative effect of increasing the overall background 
noise level. To prevent this level continually increasing to the detriment of the local 
residential amenity in those locations there will be an expectation that all new noise

sources would operate at a Rating Level (BS4142) of 10dB below the background 
noise level measured as a LA90 . 
7.51 Noise pollution from Heathrow Airport is of particular concern to the Council as the 
airport is close to major built up areas which means a large number of peop le in the 
Borough suffer noise disturbance from aircraft using the airport. Approximately, 
300,000 people are affected by aircraft noise from Heathrow as defined by the 57Leq 
noise contour. In Spelthorne the worst affected areas are in the north of the Borough 
in Stanwell and Stanwell Moor. 
7.52 The phasing out of noisier aircraft has led to some reduction in noise disturbance but 
the potential gains have not been fully realised because of a continuing upward trend 
in the total number of aircraft movements. N ight flights are also a potential source of 
great disturbance to communities. The Council will continue to support controls on 
night flying that achieve a progressive improvement in the night noise climate, 
including a limit on the total number of night f lights. The Council also supports the 
retention of noise preferential routes, aimed at ensuring flights are concentrated over 
more sparsely populated areas, and the maintenance of controls that limit ground 
noise at the airport. 
Light Pollution 
7.53 National policy requires planning policies and decisions should limit the impact of light 
pollution from ar tificial light on local amenity, intrinsically dark landscapes and nature 
conservation (NPPF, paragraph 185, c) . 
Development of Land Affected by Cont amination 
7.54 This policy seeks to ensure land which is likely to be affected by contamination is 
safely developed and is suitable for the proposed use. 
7.55 Less stringent pollution control and less careful site management in the past has led 
to a substantial leg acy of sites that may be subject to contamination by former land 
uses. In particular, large areas of the Borough have been worked for minerals and 
the land subsequently filled. Although much of this activity has been on land within 
the Green Belt, many o ld sites are now occupied by, or are close to housing and 
commercial developments. These pits were filled long before any controls existed on 
waste disposal and, together with former industrial sites, now present a range of 
unknown contamination issues wh ich need to be addressed. Contaminants may also 
be present on land where there are no specific records of contaminating uses, such 
as in made ground where unsuitable fill has been used. The Council’s principal 
mechanism for dealing with land affected by c ontamination is to ensure that land is fit 
for purpose when being redeveloped through the planning system. This is the most 
cost effective and sustainable way forward. 
7.56 A fundamental principle of sustainable development is that the condition of land, its 
use and its development should be protected from potential hazards. Failing to deal 
adequately with contamination could cause harm to human health, property and the 
wider environment. Where development is proposed, the developer is responsible for 
ensuring that development is safe and suitable for use for the purpose for which it is 
intended. A potential developer will need to satisfy the Council that unacceptable risk 
from contamination will be successfully addressed through remediation without undue

responsible for ensuring submission of adequate site investigation information and

Person (SQP) (who m holds a recognised and relevant qualification) with

E5: Open Space and Recreation 
Existing Open Space 
1) The Council will seek to protect, maintain and enhance existing open spaces and 
areas for recreation and encourage quality and accessibility improvements. Priority will 
be given to areas where specific deficiencies in access or quality have been identified. 
2) The Council will not permit the loss or dis placement of existing open space to other 
uses unless it can be demonstrated, through up -to-date and robust evidence, that: 
(a) There is a proven surplus of provision and the site is no longer needed, or is 
unlikely to be required in the future; or 
(b) The benef it of the development to the community outweighs the harm caused 
by the loss of the facility; or 
(c) An alternative facility of an equal quantity and quality or higher standard will be 
provided in at least an equally convenient and accessible location to serve the 
same local community. 
Provision of new open space and financial contributions 
3) Proposals for new residential development will be expected to make on -site provision 
for open space, having regard to the standards as set out in the most up -to-date Open 
Space Assessment. The Council will negotiate on site -by-site basis the typology of 
any open space provision. 
(a) Proposals delivering on -site provision will ensure appropriate long-term 
stewardship arrangements are in place to secure the quality of the open space 
in perpetuity59. 
(b) The Council will consider an off -site financial contribution to improve the quality 
of existing Council owned open spaces within a reasonable proximity to that 
development site where: 
i) it is demonstrated that it is not feasible or viable to incorporate on -site 
provision of open space; or 
ii) where the evidence indicates a demonstrable need for improvements to the 
quality of existing provision, as highlighted by the most up to date Open 
Space Assessment and/or other relevant documents. 
4) Proposals for new open space delivered separately from development should be firstly 
directed to areas where there are deficiencies of such space as identified within the 
most up -to-date Open Space Assessment and Playing Pitch Strategy and/or other 
relevant documents. 
Local Green Space 
5) The Council will give protection to sp aces designated as Local Green Space and 
development will only be permitted where very special circumstances can be 
demonstrated which outweigh the harm.

     Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Environment 
Definitions 
7.59 Open Space is defined as all types of spaces, including areas of water such as rivers, 
lakes and reservoirs, which provide areas for sport and recreation and can act as 
amenity value. This includes, but is not limited to, playing pitches and fields, 
recreation grounds, parks and gardens, allotments and natural spaces such as 
common land. 
7.60 The Open Space Assessment provides a qualitative and quantitative audit of publicly 
accessible open space in the Borough . This assessment (or any successor 
document) should be used as the starting point when considering open space 
requirements for n ew developments. The Playing Pitch Strategy will provide a robust 
and up -to-date assessment of the need for playing pitches in Spelthorne as well as 
identifying opportunities for new provision. 
Reasoned Justification 
7.61 Open Space is important due to the po sitive contribution it makes to the character of 
settlements and health and social well -being. 
7.62 Open Space forms the basis of the Borough ’s green infrastructure network supporting 
residents and other users. Therefore, it is considered that cumulatively, these spaces 
form valued assets of strategic importance which should be protected as a priority. 
Open spaces within urban areas provide relief from the urban environment for 
residents. Urban open spaces also provide breaks in the built environment. Poli cy 
E5 identifies all open space within urban areas as open space for the purposes of this 
policy and the protection afforded to these. 
7.63 The NPPF in paragraph 98 states that access to a network of high -quality open 
spaces and opportunities for sport and phys ical activity is important for the health and 
well-being of communities and can deliver wider benefits for nature and support 
efforts to address climate change. Planning policies should be based on robust and 
up-to-date assessments of the need for open spa ce, sport and recreation facilities 
and opportunities for new provision. 
7.64 Given the importance of these spaces, there is justifiable reason for the inclusion of a 
policy which seeks to protect existing provision as a minimum and ensure provision of 
spaces i n which there are identified deficiencies over the plan period. 
7.65 The NPPF allows for the designation of land as Local Green Space (LGS) through 
the preparation of the Local Plan. The designation is suitable for spaces of particular 
local significance or have community value. The Council has undertaken a n 
assessment to identify potential Local Green Space (LGS) in consultation with the 
local community. 
7.66 By designating as LGS spaces will be protected from development in a manner which 
is consistent with Gre en Belt policy. Open spaces which do not meet the 
requirements of the LGS designation will be protected through Policy E5. Those 
spaces designated as LGS are shown on the Policies Map and are listed within the 
Local Green Space – review of sites.

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Economy 
8. Economy 
8.1 Economic performance is an important indicator of the ‘health’ of the Borough . 
Ensuring the vitality and viability of Spelthorne’s centres and shaping these to be 
appealing places for local residents and visitors to access for shopping, leisure and 
enterta inment purposes remains a key strand of the Local Plan. The Borough ’s 
location provides a strong basis for attracting visitors and new businesses. Providing 
a diverse mix of business and facilities enhances the attractiveness of these centres 
and provides for the needs of local people within their communities and employment 
opportunities for a wider population. 
8.2 The Borough provides a home to major companies such as Shepperton Studios and 
BP, which are valuable contributors to providing local employment o pportunities and 
supporting the local economy. Retaining these and identifying suitable locations for 
other high -profile companies to locate in Spelthorne, are important parts of the 
Borough ’s economic and employment performance. 
Meeting Employment Needs 
8.3 The Employment Land Needs Assessment60 is based on economic forecasts which 
estimate the growth in jobs in different sectors and translates this into an estimate for 
change in employment floorspace over the plan period. Changes in office, industrial 
and storage/warehousing floorspace are considered .

8.4 The study was published prior to the COVID -19 pandemic which has resulted in a 
change in the working patterns of many people and t he extent to which these 
changes might become permanent is not yet clear. Some employers are likely to 
make more flexible or h ybrid working practices permanent with smaller office spaces 
needed . Some o ccupiers are likely to be reviewing their space needs particularly in 
light of the financial difficulties and uncertainties businesses face around COVID -19 
and BREXIT. Whilst it is too soon to quantify the impact on future need, this highlights 
the need for flexibility to enable businesses to adapt to meeting changing market 
conditions and achieve innovations. For this reason, it has been decided flexibility 
and frequent review is re quired with the floorspace needs.         
 
 
  
 
         
          
 
   
           
  
          
 
        
     
 
          
        
      
       
  
     
          
      
       
        
  
      
 
      
      
      
   
 
  
 
           
            
     
         
            
       
    
    
  
   
   
 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Economy 
EC1: Meeting Employment Needs 
1. Economic growth in Spelthorne will be supported by maintaining and intensifying the 
use of the Borough ’s employment floorspace offer. This will be done by; 
• safeguarding employment land, 
• provision of new land in line with needs identified through the most up to date 
evidence and 
• encouraging its innovative re -use in ways that better meet the needs of the 
market 
This will accommodate the predicted future growth in jobs in the Borough requir ed to 
help to secure sustained growth of the local economy. 
2. To support the retention, creation and development of local businesses, promote 
business competitiveness and allow for flexibility to cater for the changing needs of the 
economy, the Council will support: 
(a) proposals to redevelop outmoded employment floorsp ace to cater for modern 
business needs; 
(b) proposals which will deliver high quality, well -designed, flexible and adaptable 
spaces of different unit sizes and types for a range of uses and occupants 
(c) proposals which will deliver smaller and incubator units, flexible workspaces for 
co-working, managed workspace and serviced office accommodation and 
(d) the provision of essential ancillary employment facilities close to places of 
employment. 
in the most sustainable locations, in particular in town and local centr es. 
3. Proposals should seek to incorporate sustainability measures, including but not limited 
to sustainable design, construction and carbon/energy demand reduction measures to 
ensure that economic development is of a high standard. 
Strategic Employment Ar eas

4. The five designated employment areas (as shown on the Policies Map that together 
make up the Borough ’s current core supply of employment land will be protected as 
Strategic Employment Areas and changes of use of land and/or buildings from 
employment to non -employment use will be resisted. The refurbishment and 
redevelopment of sites in these areas for e mployment use, and proposals for the 
intensification of sites for employment use will be permitted.

5. Redevelopment or change of use to a non -employment use will only be acceptable if 
evidence is provided of active and comprehensive marketing of the site for its current 
use for a continuous period of at least 24 months for a Strategic Employment Site prior 
to submission of a planning application. 
Office and Research & Development 
Office and Research & Developmen t 
6. Proposals for new office and research & development (E (g) (i and ii)) floorspace will 
be directed sequentially to Staines -upon -Thames town centre and the Strategic 
Employment Are as. Only if sites cannot be found in these locations should the edge 
of centre sites and locations within 500m of a public transport interchange be 
considered. 
Industrial, warehousing and storage 
7. Proposals for new industrial, warehousing and storage (B2 and B8) floorspace will be 
directed to the industrial Strategic Employment Areas, to any of the existing industrial 
estates and to any sites where floor space of this use class is included in the site 
allocation in the Local Plan. 
Outside of the designa ted employment sites 
8. Outside of the designated employment sites, employment floorspace will be protected 
in line with the latest Employment Land Needs Assessment and the loss will be 
resisted unless the site is having significant negative impact on reside ntial amenity. 
9. Redevelopment or change of use to a non -employment use will only be acceptable if 
evidence is provided of active and comprehensive marketing of the site for its current 
use for a continuous period of at least 24 months prior to submission of a planning 
application. If the site is allocated for an alternative use within the Local Plan, the 
marketing period will not be required. 
Heathrow 
10. The Council provides in -principle support for a future expansion of Heathrow Airport, 
(as set out in Policy SP7) if it is undertaken in a sustainable and integrated way. 
Definitions 
8.5 Active and comprehensive marketing requires demonstration of a marketing 
campaign for a continuous period of at least 24 months. Marketing must be 
undertaken through a recognised commercial agent at a price that genuinely reflects 
the market value of the current or most recent use of the site. It must be 
demonstrated to the Council’s satisfaction that marketing has been unsuccessful for 
all relevant floor space proposed to be lost through re -development or change of use. 
8.6 Transport interchanges are defined as rail stations and bus stations within the 
Borough and are shown on the Policies Map. The 500m catchment around each 
interchange are shown on maps. The transport interchanges are: 
• Ashford rail station

Reasoned justification 
8.8 The NPPF is clear that there are three dimensions to sustainable development, one 
of which is economic. One of the roles of the planning system is to contribute to 
building a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that sufficient 
land of the right type is available in the righ t places and at the right time to support 
growth, innovation and improved productivity. 
8.9 Our Corporate Plan (2021 -2023) has five priorities including the support and 
guidance to residents and businesses to help them to recover from the economic 
impact of th e COVID -19 pandemic. The Council will support economic recovery by: 
• Minimising unemployment 
• Developing skills and getting people back in work 
• Assisting future business growth and adaptation 
• Placemaking, regeneration and developing infrastructure 
• Attrac ting visitors to the Borough 
8.10 The Employment Land Needs Assessment (ELNA), identified a need for a fairly small 
additional amount of floorspace over the plan period in order to meet the anticipated 
level of jobs which will be created. Meeting this will mee t the identified local 
Spelthorne need. We are keen to gain from the economic benefits that our close 
proximity to Heathrow brings. 
8.11 Spelthorne has significant strengths with a large business base and a wide range of 
business sectors represented, including a significant presence of businesses of 
national and international renown. This is further strengthened by its proximity to 
Heathrow Airport and its good communication links to London and the rest of the UK. 
It has a significant retail sector which is f ocussed largely on meeting the needs of 
local residents. The Enterprise M3 Town Analysis (Dec 2019) highlighted Staines as: 
• A relatively high concentration of employment in Information & Communications, 
with a Location Quotient of more than 2.0 in this se ctor i.e. more than double the 
national average concentration of employment in this sector. 
• Strategic Economic Plan (SEP) identifying Staines as step -up town

 8.12 In March 2021, the Government launched a Build Back Better Plan, it’s plan for 
growth focused on three pillars of investment to act as the foundation which to build 
economic recovery -high quality infrastructure, skills and innovation. The Spelthorne 
Economic Strategy was refreshed in February 2020. It builds upon the first 3 years of 
the 2017 -2022 Economic Strategy and continues to focus on prioritising the key 
needs for businesses to settle, grow and thrive. Through the strategy the Borough

EC2: Retail 
1) The Council will seek to meet identified retail needs within the Borough through 
maintaining and enhancing the vitality and viability of Staines -upon -Thames, as the 
main town centre and Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross as the Borough ’s 
district cen tres. Staines -upon -Thames will be the primary location for main town 
centre uses. 
Locations for Development 
2) The Council will ensure that Staines -upon Thames will be the preferred location for the 
development of main town centre uses61 , including retail. 
3) Retail proposals in Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross will be supported where 
the scale and design of the proposal is considered appropriate to the existing 
character and supports their role as district centres. 
4) The Council will support development which improves the viability and vitality of 
shopping parades within the Borough which support their local communities and 
where the scale and design complements the existing character 
5) Proposals for main town centre u ses that are located outside Staines -upon -Thames 
and Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross will be subject to the sequential test as 
set out in the NPPF. In this instance, the applicant will have to demonstrate that: 
(a) The proposal satisfies the sequential test and flexibility has been demonstrated 
on issues such as format and scale. 
(b) For retail proposals which exceed 500 sqm, a retail impact assessment is 
required to be undertaken to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on 
existing retail uses in the Borough ’s centres as set out in the NPPF. 
(c) Edge -of-centre62 and out -of-centre sites, which satisfy the sequential test, should 
be accessible including by public transport, bicycle and foot and well -connected 
to the centre. 
Primary Shopping Areas  
6) Proposals for development within the Primary Shopping Areas will be permitted where 
they improve the quality and mix of within Use Class E to enhance the role of the 
centres and their vitality and viability and to a scale which c omplements the local 
character. 
61 Main town centre uses are defined in the NPPF as retail development (including warehouse clubs 
and factory outlet centres); leisure, entertainment and more intensive sport an d recreation uses 
(including cinemas, restaurants, drive -through restaurants, bars, pubs, nightclubs, casinos, health and 
fitness centres, indoor bowling centres and bingo halls); offices; and arts, cultural and tourism 
development (including theatres, mus eums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference 
facilities).  
62 Edge -of-centre locations are defined for retail purposes, as a location that is well connected and 
within 300 metres of the PSA. For all other main town centres uses, it is a locatio n within 300 metres 
of a town centre boundary, however for office development this includes locations outside of the town

and is acceptable against all other policy. 
Opportunities 
8) Improve connectivity for pedestrians by enhancing the public realm within the district 
centres. This can also support new cycling infrastructure and to enhance the local 
area. Improved connectivity and utilising sustainable and active travel modes can al so 
assist in establishing 20 -minute neighbourhoods, particularly within the district centres. 
9) Improve accessibility of existing parking for users of shopping areas to encourage 
footfall, where appropriate, and identify suitable locations for the implementation of EV 
charging points for electric vehicles 
Definitions 
8.14 Primary Shopping Areas: Defined area where retail is concentrated shown on the 
Policies Map . 
8.15 20-minute neighbourhoods: Compact and connected neighbourhood, where people 
can meet their everyday needs within a short walk or cycle which presents multiple 
benefits including boosting the local economy, improving people’s health and 
wellbeing, increasin g social connections and tackling climate change. 
Reasoned Justification 
8.16 Spelthorne Borough Council have defined a hierarchy of centres as required by the 
NPPF and will seek to promote their long -term vitality and viability. Staines -upon -
Thames is the Borough ’s main town centre, where main town centre uses should be 
directed principally. Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross are district centres 
which act as key providers for their respective catchments. As such, the Council will 
ensure that identified retail needs, as well as those of other main town centre uses, 
will be met using the centre hierarchy. 
8.17 Paragraph 86 of the NPPF (2021) states that LPAs should set out policies that allow 
centres to grow and diversify in a way that can respond to rapid ch anges in retail and 
leisure industries. LPAs should define the extent of the centres and primary shopping 
areas. Paragraph 86 also states that policies should retain and enhance existing 
markets and where appropriate, re -introduce or create new ones. 
8.18 Changes to the Use Classes Order means that approaches previously proposed in 
regard to ensuring sufficient numbers of shops under Use Class A1 are no longer 
practical. Shops, offices, restaurants and cafes are all now under Use Class E, along 
with many ot her different uses. This means that to move between these uses, 
planning permission is not required. This means that the market now effectively 
takes precedence over the planning system for the management of shopping areas 
and high streets. 
8.19 From 1 Augus t 2021, the Government have introduced changes to the General 
Permitted Development Order (GDPO) through the use of extended permitted 
development rights (PDR). These changes make it possible for uses with Class E, to

be converted into residential use (Cl ass MA) without planning permission. To do so, 
a prior approval is required from the Local Authority however these are limited in their 
scope for dealing with possible consequences of losing retail units and other 
commercial premises to residential use on the high street. 
8.20 As a result of increased competition from online retailers and increasing flexibility in 
respect of changes of use introduced through amendments to the General Permitted 
Development Order (GPDO), there is an increased risk of the reductio n in numbers of 
retail units within all centres of different scales in the Borough . The Council will 
ensure the retention of as many retail units within the centres as possible, within the 
scope of the current GDPO. Retaining retail units will secure the centres as shopping 
destinations and to ensure, in the case of the local centres, that they continue to 
provide for the day -to-day needs of their populations and achieve high footfalls.

EC3: Local Centres, Shopping Parades and Isolated Retail 
Units 
Strategy 
1) Spelthorne has several local centres and a series of shopping parades located across 
the Borough. These centres and parades vary in size and are generally located in 
more isolated parts of the Borough and serve some of the day to day needs of their 
respec tive communities. Given the isolated nature of these retail units, ensuring their 
continued viability is important to support their communities. 
2) Local Centres 
• Charlton 
• Laleham 
• Lower Sunbury 
• Upper Halliford 
3) Shopping Parades; 
• Clare Road, Stanwell 
• Convent Road and Feltham Hill Road junction, Ashford 
• Edinburgh Drive, Staines 
• Feltham Road, Ashford 
• Green Lane, Shepperton 
• Green Street, Sunbury 
• Groveley Road, Sunbury 
• Laleham Road, Shepperton 
• Stainash Parade and The Broadway, Kingston Road, Stain es 
• The Avenue, Lower Sunbury 
• Staines Road West, Ashford 
• Vicarage Road, Sunbury Common 
• Victoria Parade, Kingston Road, Staines 
• Woodlands Parade, Ashford Common 
4) The Council will seek to protect the role that the local centres and shopping parades 
play in providing for local retail and other service needs of the community. 
Development proposals for retail (use class E) will be supported, where the scale is 
conside red to complement the needs of the communities. 
5) Development proposals (new and change of use) for other town centre uses will also 
be supported, provided they maintain; 
(a) an active frontage 
(b) the overall role of the centre in meeting day -to-day retail need s 
(c) customer choice 
(d) the vitality and viability of the centre or parade and; 
(e) the scale and function of the centre

6) The Council will resist the loss of isolated retail units given the role they play in 
supporting communities. This will act as a ‘last shop in the village’ to maintain the 
provision of such units in these communities. The loss of a retail unit (use class E) that 
provides for everyday needs, will only be acceptable if evidence is provided of active 
and comprehensive marketing of the site for its current use for a minimum of 24 
months, prior to the submission of a planning application. 
7) Proposals for residential development on the upper floors, which will enhance the local 
vitality, will be considered positively, provided the proposals maintain or enhance the 
local character and comply with all other policy objectives. 
Opportunities 
8) On shopping parades, the Council will support opportunities to improve the 
relationship between the shopping area and the attractiveness of the shopping ar ea 
and its connection to the wider local environment including public realm and 
landscaping . 
9) The Council will support proposals to improve connectivity, particularly in encouraging 
the use of active and sustainable modes of travel and the infrastructure t o support 
these such as improved pedestrian walkways and cycle lanes, as well as improved 
bus services. This provides the opportunity to promote the 20 -minute neighbourhood 
principles. 
Definitions 
8.21 Local centres are smaller areas of housing with some retail use to help meet the day -
to-day needs of the area. These centres are generally located in more remote 
locations and are less well connected to either the main town centre or the three 
district centres. 
8.22 Shopping parades are rows of shops providing a variety of facilities for their local 
neighbourhood. These parades can be of varying sizes but generally help to 
contribute to meeting some or all of their local communities’ everyday needs. The list 
provided in the policy is not exhaustive and all para des will be shown on the 
forthcoming policies map. 
8.23 Active and comprehensive marketing requires demonstration of a marketing 
campaign for a continuous period of at least 24 months as a minimum. Marketing 
must be undertaken through a recognised commercial a gent at a price that genuinely 
reflects the market value of the current or most recent use of the site. It must be 
demonstrated to the Council’s satisfaction that marketing has been unsuccessful for 
all relevant floor space proposed to be lost through re -development or change of use. 
8.24 Town centres uses are defined in the NPPF as retail development (including 
warehouse clubs and factory outlet centres); leisure, entertainment and more 
intensive sport and recreation uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive -through 
restaurants, bars and pubs, nightclubs, casinos, health and fitness centres, indoor 
bowling centres and bingo halls); offices; and arts, culture and tourism development 
(including theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conferen ce 
facilities).

8.25 20 minute neighbourhoods are compact and connected neighbourhood, where 
people can meet their everyday needs within a short walk or cycle which presents 
multiple benefits including boosting the local economy, improving people’s health and 
wellbeing, increasing social connections and tackling climate change 
Reasoned Justification 
8.26 The Borough has a number of local centres which support a smaller population when 
compared to the town and district centres. The local centres play an important role in 
supporting their communities. These centres have a few shops which help to provide 
for local peo ple’s basic day -to-day needs but lack the diversity of more established 
8.27 
8.28 retailers or uses such as banking facilities, supermarkets etc. However, the role 
these centres play within their communities is important and maintaining the vitality of 
these is a k ey challenge. Therefore, the Council is justified in protecting these 
centres and encouraging the development of uses within Class E, particularly retail 
where appropriate. 
In addition, the Borough also has a vast number of shopping parades dispersed 
across residential areas. These parades also play a key role in helping to support 
their communities where there is an absence of a district or local centre. Many of 
these parades provide homes for local businesses and are of importance to the 
communities which they serve. The Council will seek to maintain these parades to 
help them to continue to fulfil their functions and encourage the re -use of vacant units 
to ensure vitality within the parades. 
Spelthorne also has a small number of isolated shops whi ch are often on their own 
and provide an important service such as post office or local convenience store. As 
such, these units often provide for everyday needs. These units could be vulnerable 
to development pressures and therefore, due to the key role they play within their 
communities, seeking significant justification for proposals affecting these is 
considered necessary.

EC4: Leisure and Culture 
1) The Council will support proposals that deliver a high quality and diverse range of 
leisure and visitor experiences. It is anticipated that such proposals will increase the 
contribution that tourism, arts and cultural heritage make to quality of life, soci al and 
cultural well -being, economic growth and the natural environment. 
2) The Council will safeguard the viability of Staines -upon -Thames and the centres of 
Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross by ensuring that proposals for new leisure 
space located outside these centres provide an impact assessment in accordance with 
the NPPF. Proposals should accord with the following criteria: 
(a) Proposals for leisure attractions, including arts and cultural facilities, 
accommodation and conference facilities will be determined in accordance with 
the sequential approach outlined in the NPPF, except where they apply to 
applications for small scale rural development. Where proposals exceed 
2,500sq.m and are located outside the centres, as designated on the Polici es 
Map, an impact assessment must be submitted. 
(b) All new, enhanced or replaced leisure and cultural attractions, accommodation 
and conference facilities will be required to preserve and enhance the 
character of the local area and be of a scale and nature a ppropriate to the 
location. 
3) The loss of existing leisure attractions, including arts, cultural and entertainment 
facilities and hotels will be strongly resisted unless replacement facilities are proposed 
in a location equally accessible to the facility’s c urrent catchment area. Alternatively, 
robust evidence must be provided to demonstrate that: 
(a) The facility causes significant detriment to the amenity of the locality; or that 
(b) The existing use is unviable and its retention has been fully explored (including 
active and comprehensive marketing of the facility for its existing or an 
alternative leisure or cultural use for a continuous period of at least 24 months 
prior to the submission of a planning application) 
Definitions 
8.29 Leisure uses include cinemas, restaurants, retail, bars and pubs, nightclubs, casinos, 
health and fitness centres, gyms and studios, indoor bowling centres, indoor sports 
provision and bingo halls. Cultural uses include theatres, museums, libraries, 
galleries and concert hall s, hotels and conference facilities. 
8.30 Active and comprehensive marketing requires demonstration of a marketing 
campaign for a continuous period of at least 24 months. Marketing must be 
undertaken through a recognised commercial agent at a price that genuin ely reflects 
the market value of the current or most recent use of the site. It must be 
demonstrated to the Council’s satisfaction that marketing has been unsuccessful for 
all relevant floor space proposed to be lost through re -development or change of us e.

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Economy 
Reasoned justification 
8.31 Leisure uses play a key role in maintaining the vitality and viability of the town and 
local centres within the Borough . Staines, as the main town centre, provides the 
primary leisure uses which include a mix of shops, restauran ts and a cinema. There 
are also a range of sports facilities located across the Borough including the two 
Council -owned leisure centres in Staines and Sunbury, private gymnasiums and 
sports grounds to help to promote active lifestyles. The Borough also b enefits from 
Kempton Park racecourse which offers regular race meetings as well as hosting 
many other activities such as antique markets and music events, therefore playing a 
key role in providing for leisure activities and encouraging visitors to the Boro ugh. The 
River Thames and Shepperton Studios also play roles in attracting social and 
economic benefits and the Council should continue to benefit from these. 
8.32 The Council considers that the leisure and cultural experience in the Borough has the 
potential t o contribute to Spelthorne’s future growth. As such, the Council will 
continue to protect existing leisure and tourism facilities. Where appropriate, new 
facilities will also be supported to enhance the Borough ’s attractiveness to its 
residents and visit ors. The provision of arts and cultural facilities in particular can 
broaden the Borough ’s offer and increase its appeal to visitors. 
8.33 The sequential testing of proposed leisure developments will help to ensure that the 
vitality and viability of the main t own centre and the three district centres within the 
Borough are protected. Only where there are no town centre or edge of centre sites 
available will out -of-centre locations be accepted. Applicants proposing new leisure 
uses outside Staines -upon -Thames and Ashford, Shepperton or Sunbury Cross will 
be required to submit an impact assessment. The assessment should clearly identify 
and explain the proposed development’s likely impact on the vitality and viability of 
the centre. 
8.34 Spelthorne’s proximity to Heathrow Airport, London and several large -scale tourist 
attractions means that there is potential for visitors to use facilities within the 
Borough , particularly in respect of hotels. This also presents the opportunity to 
enhance this provision to improve tourism opportunities within the Borough .

            Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Infrastructure and Delivery 
9. Infrastructure and Delivery 
9.1 In order to support a sustainable future for the Borough , infrastructure provision is a 
key element in the delivery of a Local Plan. Infrastructure includes; transport and 
physical infrastructure (including roads and cycle lanes), social and community 
facilities (i ncluding schools and youth facilities) and green infrastructure (including 
open and green space). The Council is required to identify the infrastructure needed 
to support the development proposed over the next 15 years. This is done through 
the Infrastruct ure Delivery Plan (IDP). 
9.2 To compile an IDP the Council undertakes ongoing engagement with providers, 
developers and other key stakeholders to establish the impacts of new development 
on essential infrastructure within the Borough . The IDP outlines any potential gaps in 
provision a nd identifies what new infrastructure is required to mitigate some of the 
potential effects of the levels of development being proposed. This, together with the 
polices in the Plan, sets out how the needs of the Borough will be met over the plan 
period. 
ID1: Infrastructure and Delivery 
1) The Council will work with infrastructure providers, developers and other key 
stakeholders to support the delivery of the infrastructure necessary to enable the 
development set out in the Local Plan. To achieve this, the d elivery of development 
may need to be phased to reflect the delivery of infrastructure. 
2) The projects required to support the Local Plan strategy are identified within the 
Borough ’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan will be 
updated to ensure infrastructure information remains up to date and is monitored 
effectively. 
3) Developers will be expected to engage early with the Council and infrastructure 
service providers to discuss their requirements. 
4) Developers must demonstrate the y have explored existing infrastructure capacity, and 
how this could be future -proofed, with appropriate providers and demonstrate that they 
have made sufficient provision. Where appropriate, and where there is an identified 
shortfall across the Borough , opportunities should be taken to maximise infrastructure 
provision on suitable sites. 
5) Development proposals, including those allocated in this plan which give rise to a 
need for infrastructure improvements, will be expected to mitigate their impact, 
whet her individually or cumulatively, and at a rate and scale to meet the needs that 
arise from that development or a phase of that development. The standards of 
infrastructure delivery will be expected to comply with other policies set out within this 
Plan. 
6) Planning permission will be granted subject to the provision of (or appropriate funding 
towards) the required level of infrastructure to support the development. This will be

other identified sources of funding as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 
8) Development proposals which rely on the delivery of crit ical infrastructure projects to 
support the development, will only be permitted prior to completion of that project or 
where appropriate, a phase of that project which has been identified as necessary, 
where the council is content that the infrastructure o r phase of that infrastructure will 
be in place within a reasonable timetable from the date of permission. 
Social and community facilities 
9) The Council will resist the loss or change of use of existing facilities unless it can be 
demonstrated that: 
(a) the fa cility is no longer needed for its existing purpose or viable for any other 
social or community use; 
(b) the services can be re -provided in a facility of better quality on the same site or 
in an alternative location that is equally accessible to the community served; 
and 
(c) there is no requirement from any other public or voluntary service provider for 
an alternative community or social facility that could be met through a change 
of use or redevelopment. 
Definitions 
9.3 Infrastructure is a broad term and includes but is not limited to: 
• Transport and physical infrastructure: local and strategic road network, cycling and 
pedestrian infrastructure, rail network and stations, bus services, utilities, 
telecommunications, flood risk minimisation, wastewater trea tment. 
• Social and community facilities: schools and other education facilities, health and 
social care facilities, libraries, museums, cultural facilities, emergency services, 
advice centres, clubs, public houses, societies, places of worship, sport and le isure 
activities, youth facilities and community centres. 
• Infrastructure Delivery Plan : identifies the Borough 's infrastructure requirements 
including social, physical and green infrastructure. The IDP sets out what is needed, 
where it is needed and when it is needed 
63 i.e., prohibiting development authorised by the planning permission or other aspects linked to the 
planning permission (e.g. occupation of premises) until a specified action has been taken (such as the 
provision of supporting infrastructure). Such conditions should not be used where there are no 
prospects at all of the action in question being performed within the time -limit imposed by the 
permission.

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Infrastructure and Delivery 
Reasoned Justification 
9.4 The NPPF sets out that to deliver the social, recreational and cultural facilities and 
services the community needs, planning policies should plan positively for the 
provision and use of shared space, community faci lities and local services to enhance 
sustainability and guard against the unnecessary loss of valued facilities. 
9.5 The provision of suitable, adequate infrastructure is vital to the well -being of the 
Borough ’s population and economy. The Spelthorne Infrastr ucture Delivery Plan 
outlines the capacity and quality of existing infrastructure, including planned 
improvements. Growth within the Borough has often out -paced the provision of 
necessary infrastructure and there are parts of Spelthorne where existing 
infrastructure is at or near capacity or of poor quality and in need of improvements. 
9.6 There may also be occasions where development proposals will require infrastructure 
capacity improvements before they can come forward or are reliant on critical 
infrastruc ture projects for delivery 
9.7 In order to redress this, the infrastructure will be provided in a timely manner to 
support the new occupants and/or mitigate the impacts of the development. Where it 
is demonstrated that individually or cumulatively there is an ticipated to be a significant 
impact on the existing community, development will be phased to ensure provision 
meets demand and needs. 
9.8 Maintenance of infrastructure and expansion to meet requirements is generally the 
responsibility of the relevant infrastructure provider. Most providers operate to 
statutory requirements and have set timescales for plans. 
9.9 The planning system allows the Council to ensure that there is adequate 
infrastructure in place to support new development. Developers, where required, will 
have to demonstrate that their proposed developments incorporate adequate 
wastewater capacity and surface water drainage both on and off site. Where there is 
an infrastructure capacity constraint, the Council will require the developer to clearly 
set out the appropriate improvements required to facilitate the development and how 
this will be delivered. The planning system has mec hanisms to secure timely 
provision such as through the imposition of Grampian -style conditions which relate to 
restricting development to phases. 
9.10 To ensure the scale of development set out in the Local Plan can be delivered, the 
impacts of the Plan policie s and other requirements must be viability tested. As part 
of this, the Council require that these impacts and related costs are accounted for the 
in the price for the land (or any agreement in place to acquire the land). In line with 
paragraph 58 of the NPPF, applicants will be required to justify the need for a viability 
assessment at the application stage and these should be made publicly available. 
9.11 The Council have adopted the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to contribute 
towards funding the pro vision, improvement, replacement, operation or maintenance 
of infrastructure to support the development of its area. The Council is required to 
produce an Infrastructure Funding Statement to outline the Council’s spending 
priorities.

ID2: Sustainable Transport for New Developments 
Development Proposals 
1) The Council will require development proposals to incorporate opportunities to 
facilitate sustainable and active modes of travel. This will be achieved by: 
(a) provision of, or contributions towards, the improvement of public and 
community transport; 
(b) provision of vehicle parking standards, as set out in the Council’s latest Parking 
SPD, and the provision of electric vehicle charging points which are set out in 
the latest Surrey County Council guidance; 
(c) provision of secure, accessible and convenient on -site cycle parking as set out 
in the Council’s latest Parking SPD; 
(d) providing improvements to or contributions towards improving the capacity and 
security of cycle parking at the Borough ’s public transport interchanges; 
(e) providing funding to deliver the tra nsport projects and highways improvements 
required to support the spatial strategy as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan (forthcoming); 
(f) providing a transport assessment and travel plan for all major development 
proposals, to promote the delivery a nd use of sustainable transport. The 
Travel Plan should set out how it will facilitate the use of sustainable and active 
transport modes, including but not limited to; low emission car clubs, low 
emission employee shuttle bus schemes supporting public bus schemes or 
offering discounted season tickets between public transport interchanges and 
employment areas. 
(g) Requiring major transport schemes to assess the impacts on health and 
wellbeing in order to facilitate healthy lifestyles. Where appropriate a Health 
Impact Assessment will be required. 
Borough -wide sustainable transport 
2) The Council will work with stakeholders, including Surrey County Council (as the 
highways authority), to promote and enable schemes and development proposals 
which facilitate sustainable and active travel. This will include: 
(a) provision of new and accessible, safe and attractive sustainable transport 
networks and routes; 
(b) provision and improvement of public and community transport; 
(c) securing improvements to cycle parkin g at the Borough ’s transport 
interchanges; 
(d) securing funding to deliver the transport projects and highways improvements 
required to support the spatial strategy as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan. 
3) The Council will use the Spelthorne Local Cycli ng and Walking Infrastructure Plan 
(LCWIP) and any successor documents, as a basis for identifying schemes to secure 
improvements for sustainable and active travel and future opportunities.

Staines -upon -Thames 
4) Development within Staines will be subject to bespoke parking standards, as set out in 
the most up -to-date Parking SPD, to take account of the anticipated level of 
development and provision of sustainable and active travel modes. 
Definitions 
9.12 Sustainable and active travel is defined as any efficient, safe and accessible means 
of transport with overall low impact on the environment, including walking and cycling, 
low and ultra -low emission vehicles, car sharing and public transport. 
9.13 Public Transport Interchanges are defined as rail stations and bus stations within the 
Borough and are shown on the Policies Map. 
Reasoned Justification 
9.14 The planning process for new developments provides the opportunity to maximise the 
use of sustainable and active travel modes such as walking, cycling and the 
increased use of public and community transport. This also provides an opportunity 
to ensure tha t people with disabilities can access all modes of transport. This is 
consistent with the NPPF. Due to the relatively small nature of the Borough , cycling 
has the potential to replace short car journeys. By providing safe and accessible 
routes this will encourage the increased use of cycles to facilitate this modal shift. 
9.15 The Council will work with stakeholders and Surrey County Council as part of the 
forthcoming Infrastructure Delivery Plan, which will set out the key infrastructure 
required to suppor t the delivery of the Local Plan, including sustainable transport and 
highway schemes. Growth over the Plan period will give rise to increased traffic 
volumes and it is therefore required that this be mitigated as far as possible. The 
policy sets out the measures by which the Council will seek to militate against the 
impacts and will require new developments to adopt the relevant standards to 
achieve this. 
9.16 With respect to parking, the policy takes account of the NPPF in paragraph 108. The 
Council’s sta ndards are set out in the latest Parking Supplementary Planning 
Document (SPD). This allows for the setting of maximum parking standards where 
there is a clear and compelling justification that they are necessary for optimising the 
density of development in town centres that are well served by public transport. The 
policy does not preclude developers from bringing forward proposals for new 
development that is car -free. 
9.17 All major developments require the submission of a Transport Assessment and 
Travel Pl an. These documents set out the potential transport impacts of the 
proposals, how these will be addressed and how sustainable travel will be delivered 
in the long term. There may be occasions where smaller developments have lower 
impacts and therefore a Transport Statement may be necessary unless it can be 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council that the changes are minor. Such 
assessments will be subject to liaison between the Council and the highway authority 
or authorities.

Appendix A : Spatial Portrait 
Maps 2: Borough of Spelthorne 
13.1 Spelthorne is located where the continuous built -up area of London gives way to a 
more dispersed pattern of urban areas and villages. The urban area of the Borough 
occupies about 35% of the total area. The larger part of the urban area of the 
Spelthorne lies across the middle of the Borough from east to west. Stanwell, 
Ashford and Sunbury comprise a continuous urban area with no separation by open 
land and there is only a small gap between Staines and Ashford. The settlements of 
Stanwell Moor, Laleham, Shepperton, Upper Halliford and Charlton Village are 
separate urban areas albeit by only small distances. There is a clear belt of open 
land separating the urban areas of Spelthorne from outer London. 
13.2 Land outside the urban area covers about 65% of the Borough and is designated as 
Green Belt. It is part of the Metropolitan Green Belt surrounding London and has an 
important strategic role in containing the outward spread of the capital and providing 
a belt of open land for air and exercise. Locally the Green Belt serves not only to 
contribute to the wider strategic function but also separates existing settlements

flood risk in Spelthorne and adjoining Borough s.

which together they act as a constraint on development.

within the Green Belt and maintaining their distinct physical identity and character. 
Within the Green Belt in Spelthorne are five major wate r supply reservoirs and a 
water treatment works at Ashford Common. Some areas of the Green Belt need 
some environmental improvement. 
13.3 Spelthorne adjoins the River Thames and is crossed by two tributaries, the Ash and 
the Colne. The Borough is flat and low lying and consequently liable to flood. About 
20% of the urban area is liable to flood in a 1 in 100 year flood event or surrounded 
by flood water and over 49% of the urban area would be flooded in a 1 in 1000 year 
event. Flood risk is a very serious th reat with some 5,600 homes within the 1 in 100 
flood risk area. The flood risk area affects the south and west edges of the Borough , 
including large parts of Staines and Shepperton and limits the scope for further

 Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Appendix A -Spatial Portrait 
13.5 The whole of the Borough is designated as an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) 
because of poor air quality. Traffic is the predominant source of air pollution in 
Spelthorne althoug h traffic levels were reduced in 2020 due to the Covid -19 
pandemic. The primary pollutants are nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and particulates (PM 10) 
which result from traffic. There are elevated concentrations of NO 2 pollution in parts 
of Staines, around the Sun bury Cross junction of the A316/M3 at Sunbury and along 
the strategic roads including the A308. Close to the airport in the north of the Borough 
there are elevated concentrations of NO 2 due to freight traffic including HGVs. 
13.6 Due to the Borough ’s close prox imity to the airport, it experiences air pollution and 
other environmental impacts. Pre pandemic, over 92% of Heathrow employees who 
live in the Borough reached the airport by car rather than public transport which 
highlights poor connectivity. Undoubtedl y the Borough is also affected by activities 
related to the operation of the airport and its associated businesses, such as logistics 
and distribution, which impact on air quality, the environment and the efficiency of the 
local and strategic road network. The 2021 Air Quality Annual Status Report was 
published in October 2021 and reviews monitoring data for 2020 and over a 5 year 
period. It is available on the Council’s website64 . 
13.7 Heathrow Airport, the UK’s main and busiest airport lies immediately north of the 
Borough of Spelthorne. Currently, the proposed expansion plans which entailed major 
changes to the layout of the airport and the infrastructure surrounding it, faces 
uncertainty despite the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2020 that the proposed expansion 
can go ahead and would not be unlawful. A possible expansion at Heathrow has 
been delayed given the impacts of COVID -19, however, it is anticipated that 
permission through a DCO or smaller scale expansion plans based on a two -runway 
scenario will be pursued by Heathrow at such a point that post -pandemic aviation 
recovery makes proposals viable. 
13.8 Heathrow Airport is an important contributor to the local economy as 7% of 
Spelthorne’s population works at the airport which is around 3525 people.65 There is 
also a concentration of airport supporting facilities (related developments and 
activities), including freight forwarding services to the north of the Borough . 
Therefore, a future expansion at Heathrow in whatever form it takes, is likely to have 
several potential impacts, both direct and indirect, on Spelthorne. This could include 
pollution and impacts on road capacity and traffic flows especially in the north of the 
Borough . Although the Council has generally scaled back its collaborative work o n 
the Heathrow expansion, it’s involvement in other pieces of work, such as changes to 
flight paths, is still ongoing. 
13.9 In the north of the Borough there are areas suffering high levels of noise from 
Heathrow Airport, in particular at Stanwell Moor and the northern part of Stanwell. 
Housing development in the most affected areas is restricted to one for one 
replacement only. The northern part of Stanwell Moor also has part of the public 
safety zone for the west end of the southern runway affecting it. 
13.10 Spelthorne has about 43,100 dwellings66 and a relatively high level of owner 
occupation with only a 12.4% social housing stock. It has a higher proportion of

semi -detached and terraced properties and flats than the rest of Surrey. The mix of 
dwellings resul ts in a higher prevailing density of housing than found in the rest of 
Surrey and more akin to that found in adjoining London Borough s. 
13.11 House prices in Spelthorne are relatively high. There are in excess of 2,80267 people 
on the Spelthorne Housing Regi ster 2021 and an on -going need for affordable 
housing. 
13.12 Spelthorne’s population is slightly older and its average household size slightly 
smaller than the national average. It has a relatively small ethnic minority population 
(12.7%), of which the largest group is Indian 4.2%)68. Almost 30% of households in 
Spelthorne are single person households yet around 40%69 of the housing stock is 
three bedrooms or larger. Future extra care demand for Spelthorne has been 
calculated as 320 units by 2035 (2019 data)70. 
13.13 A relatively high proportion of the population is “economically active” (either in work or 
seeking work). The total unemployment rates from February 2020, just before 
COVID -19 affected the country to January 2021 have jumped significantly as 
illustrated i n table 1.

A further considerable number of the Spelthorne population have businesses or are 
employed by the supply chain that serves Heathrow. As per Appendix 3: Update 
Report to Audit Committee on the Impact of Covid -19 on the Spelthorne Economy, 
the number of unemployed in Spelthorne has increased by 328%, see table 271 for

13.15 The Spelthorne Retail Study 201872 shows there is scope for further significant 
growth in shopping provision in the period to 2035 in Staines, particularly in non -food 
retailing. Staines is seen as the best location in both market demand and in 
accessibility terms. There is physical scope for further major expansion adjoining the 
Elmsleigh Centre. Without growth Staines is likely to lose an increasing proportion of 
retail expenditure to centres outside the Borough . 
13.16 The Retail Studies73 showed Ashford, Shepperton and Sunbury Cross were well -used 
by their local communities and the need to maintain their role. There is no scope for 
significant expansion but opportunities for improvement need to seek to maintain their 
role. Local parades provide convenient shopping facilities for local communities and 
are important. 
13.17 There are some relatively small areas of deprivation based in parts of Stanwell, 
Staines, Ashford and Sunbury Common. This information comes from the Index of 
Multiple Depriva tion (IMD) 2016/201974 which uses a bundle of issues to create a 
score. For these small pockets of deprivation the main issues are low income, lack of 
or poor employment, poor education and skills and crime and disorder. Income, 
education and employment are inextricably linked. 
13.18 Spelthorne contains areas of national and international significance for nature 
conservation. Most of its major reservoirs form part of the South West London 
Waterbodies Special Protection Area, in recognition of their internati onal significance 
as a habitat for two particular birds. Additionally the Staines Commons form a 
substantial Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which means they are of national 
importance for nature conservation as well as an important historic l andscape. There 
are also smaller SSSIs and other areas of local nature conservation importance in the 
Borough . 
13.19 Spelthorne sits on river gravels, which are an important mineral resource. The open 
areas of the Borough contain a mixture of past workings mos t of which have been 
restored to varying standards including some schemes that have created new 
habitats and landscapes. Most mineral extraction sites are filled with inert material. 
Minerals and Waste disposal planning is the responsibility of the Coun ty Council and

13.20 Recreation is a significant land use in the Borough , including formal sporting sites 
such as Kempton Park racecourse, sailing on reservoirs and lakes, three golf courses 
and various parks and sports grounds as well as informal recreation including 
common land. The River Thames and its towpath define about 50% of the Borough 
boundary and attract people from a wider area as well as being an important 
environmental amenity. 
13.21 Spelthorne Boro ugh Council has declared a Climate Emergency for the Borough . We 
have committed to work with the local community and all other relevant partner 
agencies to support making the Borough carbon neutral as soon as practically 
possible. The Council will also ne ed to work with the Local Government Association 
and leading environmental Non -Government Organisations to ensure we can learn 
from 'best practises' in mitigating the effects of climate change and to seek funding 
opportunities from various sources includin g central Government. 
13.22 Earlier in the year Spelthorne Borough Council launched a dedicated member task 
group with the sole aim of tackling climate change as quickly as possible by 
developing a strategy and action plan. This Council intends to accelerate i ts efforts 
by introducing greener buildings, transportation, greener investments and increasing 
renewable energy. You can find more information at 
www.spelthorne.gov.uk/goinggreen . 
The following sect ions describe different parts of the Borough . 
13.23 Staines -upon -Thames is Spelthorne’s major shopping centre with a catchment area 
covering the whole Borough and adjoining areas to the west and south. It is also the 
main commercial centre in the Borough . It benefits from Two Rivers shopping centre 
and the Elmsleigh Centre in addition to the High Street . The main residential area of 
Staines are to the east and south of the town centre. 
A distinctive feature of the area north and east of Staines is the extensiv e areas of 
Common Land, notably Staines Moor and Shortwood Common. These are of historic 
as well as amenity and nature conservation value. 
13.24 Ashford lies in the centre of the Borough and forms its largest residential area. Its 
town centre is linear in char acter and is surrounded by adjoining residential areas. It 
primarily serves local needs. Ashford has a number of commercial areas some in 
close proximity to housing and accessed through residential areas; the largest is at 
Littleton Road/Ashford Road. A shford Hospital provides a hospital services and is 
also a major employer. Ashford has a shortage of open space in some locations. 
13.25 Stanwell runs north from Ashford to the boundary with Heathrow. While it has an 
historic village centre in the north of the Stanwell area it was mostly developed down 
to the A30 in the immediate post war years. In comparison with the rest of 
Spelthorne, parts of Stanwell suffer from relatively high levels of social deprivation. 
Heathrow has a substantial impact on the northern part of Stanwell due to noise 
disturbance and the impact of airport related development, although stretches of open 
land between parts of Stanwell and the airport help to maintain a separate identity for 
the community. 
13.26 Stanwell Moor is a separate village to the west of Stanwell. It is surrounded by open 
land and maintains a distinct identity. It lies partly under the flight path from the 
airport’s southern runway and is severely affected by aircraft noise.

13.27 Sunbury lies at the eastern end of the Borough . It is split in two by the M3. Junction 
1 of the motorway is at Sunbury Cross, which was developed in the 1970s to include 
several high r ise commercial and residential buildings and a shopping centre adjacent 
to which a large Tesco superstore was added in the early 1990s. The Sunbury 
Common area north of the M3 includes the Borough ’s largest industrial estate at 
Windmill Road and another s ignificant commercial area at Hanworth Road, both of 
which contain a mixture of traditional and modern premises. It also contains a major 
BP office and research facility. Lower Sunbury is a large residential area to the south 
of the M3. Parts of Sunbury have relatively higher levels of deprivation compared to 
the rest of the Borough . There is a particular concentration of poorer air quality 
around the Sunbury Cross Junction at Sunbury 
13.28 Shepperton is a distinct settlement in the southern part of the Boroug h. It is primarily 
residential with a significant local shopping centre and a business park. Its major 
commercial site is Shepperton Studios, which lies in the north western part of the built 
up area. 
13.29 Other smaller communities include Charlton Village, L aleham and Upper and Lower 
Halliford.

Summary of issues 
13.31 Many of the issues faced by the Borough are also common to authorities in the wider 
area such as high house prices, strong economy, traffic congestion, a strong desire to 
protect and enhance the en vironment and maintaining the role of town and local 
centres. There are also issues facing all authorities including matters relating to 
climate change. 
13.32 There are however in addition particular issues facing Spelthorne. These are: 
• Meeting future developm ent requirements within a limited urban area 
which is constrained by significant flood risks 
• Reducing the extent of flood risk 
• Improving air quality 
• Meeting the particular need for affordable housing 
• Noise from Heathrow 
13.33 In addition to these major local issues there are other matters of local significance 
and include housing for a growing elderly population, growth in need for smaller 
dwellings, supporting initiatives to increase the skills of the work force, risks within the 
public safety zone, the environmental and visitor issues relating to the River Thames 
and balancing the demands for housing with other uses of land. 
13.34 Some issues apply to the Borough as a whole such as affordable housing and others 
to particular areas e.g. flooding, air quality, focussing development on urban areas 
and the role of existing centres.

 (c) it includes provisions to remain at an afford able price for future eligible households, or for 
the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision. For Build to Rent 
schemes affordable housing for rent is expected to be the normal form of affordable housing 
provision (and, in this context, is known as Affordable Private Rent). 
b) Starter homes: is as specified in Sections 2 and 3 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 
and any secondary legislation made under these sections. The definition of a starter home 
should reflect the meaning set out in statute and any such secondary legislation at the time 
of plan -preparation or decision -making. Where secondary legislation has the effect of limiting 
a household’s eligibility to purchase a starter home to those with a particular maximum level 
of household income, those restrictions should be used. 
c) Discounted market sales housing: is that sold at a discount of at least 20% below local 
market value. Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and localhouse prices. 
Provisions should be in place to ensure housing remains at a discount for future eligible 
households. 
d) Other affordable routes to home ownership: is housing provided for sale that provides a 
route to ownership for those who could not achieve home ownership through the ma rket. It 
includes shared ownership, relevant equity loans, other low cost homes for sale (at a price 
equivalent to at least 20% below local market value) and rent to buy (which includes a period 
of intermediate rent). Where public grant funding is provided , there should be provisions for 
the homes to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households, or for any receipts 
to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision, or refunded to Government or the 
relevant authority specified in th e funding agreement. 
Air quality management areas: Areas designated by local authorities because they are not 
likely to achieve national air quality objectives by the relevant deadlines. Pre-submission Spelthorne Local Plan, 2022 – 2037: Appendix B – Glossary 
Appendix B: Glossary 
Affordable housing: Housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the 
market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is for 
essential local workers); and which complies with one or more of the following definitions: 
a) Affordable housing for rent: Meets all of the following conditions: (a) the rent is set in 
accordance with the Government’s rent policy for Social Rent or Affordable Rent, or is at 
least 20% below local market rents (including ser vice charges where applicable); 
(b) the landlord is a registered provider, except where it is included as part of a Build to Rent 
scheme (in which case the landlord need not be a registered provider); and 
Ancient or veteran tree: A tree which, because of its age, size and condition, is of 
exceptional biodiversity, cultural or heritage value. All ancient trees are veteran trees. Not all 
veteran trees are old enough to be ancient, but are old relative to other trees of the same 
species. Very few trees of any species reach the ancient life -stage. 
Ancient woodland: An area that has been wooded continuously since at least 1600 AD. It 
includes ancient semi -natural woodland and plantations on ancient woodland sites (PAWS). 
Archaeological interest: There will be archaeological int erest in a heritage asset if it holds, 
or potentially holds, evidence of past human activity worthy of expert investigation at some 
point.

Article 4 direction : A direction made under Article 4 of the Town and Country Planning 
(General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 which withdraws permitted 
development rights granted by that Order. 
Brownfield land : See Previously developed land. 
Brownfield land registers : Registers of previously developed land that local planning 
authorities consider to be appropriate for residential development, having regard to criteria in 
the Town and Country Planning (Brownfiel d Land Registers) Regulations 2017. Local 
planning authorities will be able to trigger a grant of permission in principle for residential 
development on suitable sites in their registers where they follow the required procedures. 
Build to Rent: Purpose built housing that is typically 100% rented out. It can form part of a 
wider multi -tenure development comprising either flats or houses, but should be on the same 
site and/or contiguous with the main development. Schemes will usually offer longer tenancy 
agreements of three years or more, and will typically be professionally managed stock in 
single ownership and management control. 
Climate change adaptation: Adjustments made to natural or human systems in response 
to the actual or anticipated impacts of climate change, to mitigate harm or exploit 
beneficial opportunities. 
Climate change mitigation: Action to reduce the impact of human activity on the climate 
system, primarily through reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Competent person (to prepare site investigation information): A person with a 
recognised relevant qualification, sufficient experience in dealing with the type(s) of 
pollution or land instabil ity, and membership of a relevant professional organisation. 
Conservation (for heritage policy): The process of maintaining and managing change to a 
heritage asset in a way that sustains and, where appropriate, enhances its significance. 
Decentralised ener gy: Local renewable and local low carbon energy sources. 
Deliverable: To be considered deliverable, sites for housing should be available now, offer a 
suitable location for development now, and be achievable with a realistic prospect that 
housing will be d elivered on the site within five years. In particular: 
a) sites which do not involve major development and have planning permission, and all 
sites with detailed planning permission, should be considered deliverable until permission 
expires, unless there is clear evidence that homes will not be delivered within five years (for 
example because they are no longer viable, there is no longer a demand for the type of units 
or sites have long term phasing plans). 
b) where a site has outline planning permission for major development, has been 
allocated in a development plan, has a grant of permission in principle, or is identified on a 
brownfield register, it should only be considered deliverable where there is clear evidence 
that housing completions will begin on s ite within five years. 
Design code: A set of illustrated design requirements that provide specific, detailed 
parameters for the physical development of a site or area. The graphic and written 
components of the code should build upon a design vision, such as a masterplan or other 
design and development framework for a site or area.

of the development plan, unless the local planning authority decides that the neighbourhood 
plan should not be made. 
Edge of centre: For retail purposes, a location that is well connected to, and up to 300 
metres from, the primary shopping area. For all other main town centre uses, a location 
within 300 metres of a town centre boundary. For office development, this includes locations 
outside the town centre but within 500 metres of a public transport interchange. In 
determining whether a site falls w ithin the definition of edge of centre, account should be 
taken of local circumstances.

generating electricity. Renewable energy covers those energy flows that occur naturally and 
repeatedly in the environment -from th e wind, the fall of water, the movement of the oceans, 
from the sun and also from biomass and deep geothermal heat. Low carbon technologies 
are those that can help reduce emissions (compared to conventional use of fossil fuels). 
Self-build and custom -build housing: Housing built by an individual, a group of 
individuals, or persons working with or for them, to be occupied by that individual. Such

section 1(A1) and (A2) of that Act. 
Significance (for heritage policy): The value of a heritage asset to this and future 
generations because of its heritage interest. The interest may be ar chaeological, 
architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical 
presence, but also from its setting. For World Heritage Sites, the cultural value described 
within each site’s Statement of Outstanding Univer sal Value forms part of its significance. 
Special Areas of Conservation: Areas defined by regulation 3 of the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 which have been given special protection as 
important conservation sites. 
Special Protection Areas: Areas classified under regulation 15 of the Conservation of

Strategic environmental assessment: A procedure (set out in the Environmental 
Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004) which requires the formal 
environmental assessment of certain plans and programmes which are likely to have 
significant effects on the environment. 
Strategic policies: Policies and site allocations which address strat egic priorities in line with 
the requirements of Section 19 (1B -E) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. 
Supplementary planning documents: Documents which add further detail to the policies in 
the development plan. They can be used to provide f urther guidance for development on 
specific sites, or on particular issues, such as design. Supplementary planning documents 
are capable of being a material consideration in planning decisions but are not part of the 
development plan. 
Sustainable transport modes: Any efficient, safe and accessible means of transport with 
overall low impact on the environment, including walking and cycling, ultra low and zero 
emission vehicles, car sharing and public transport. 
Town centre: Area defined on the local authorit y’s policies map, including the primary 
shopping area and areas predominantly occupied by main town centre uses within or 
adjacent to the primary shopping area. References to town centres or centres apply to city 
centres, town centres, district centres and local centres but exclude small parades of shops 
of purely neighbourhood significance. Unless they are identified as centres in the 
development plan, existing out -of-centre developments, comprising or including main town 
centre uses, do not constitute tow n centres. 
Transport assessment: A comprehensive and systematic process that sets out transport 
issues relating to a proposed development. It identifies measures required to improve 
accessibility and safety for all modes of travel, particularly for alterna tives to the car such as 
walking, cycling and public transport, and measures that will be needed deal with the 
anticipated transport impacts of the development. 
Transport statement: A simplified version of a transport assessment where it is agreed the 
transport issues arising from development proposals are limited and a full transport 
assessment is not required. 
Travel plan: A long -term management strategy for an organisation or site that seeks to 
deliver sustainable transport objectives and is regularly re viewed. 
Wildlife corridor: Areas of habitat connecting wildlife populations. 
Windfall sites: Sites not specifically identified in the development plan.
