Local Plan 2016-2036 
Part One: Planning Strategy
    New Forest District outside

New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  Foreword
The adoption of the Local Plan 2016 2036 Part One: Planning Strategy as the statutory 
basis for planning decisions brings the development plan up to date with the National 
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).
At the heart of the new Local Plan is a step change in housing delivery to meet both local 
needs and national policy objectives. The change from the previous policy emphasis on 
development restraint has presented significant challenges to the communities that live 
in the area, and to the Council in terms of the limited availability of land appropriate for 
development.
All new residential development within the Plan Area will have an impact on International 
Nature Conservation sites, whose conservation and protection is of international 
importance. Residential development (and other forms of development) within the 
Plan Area can only be made compliant with the Conservation of Habitats and Species 
Regulations 2017 if it is accompanied by an extensive package of habitat mitigation 
measures. 
The Government has fully endorsed the Council’s balanced vision and strategy for the 
future of this area. The planning strategy ensures the long-term protection of internationally 
significant environmental sites, the Green Belt, and the landscape and townscape character 
of the area whilst providing the right amount and mix of new homes, affordable homes, jobs 
and facilities that our communities and businesses need.

About the Local Plan
1.1  The Local Plan sets out a strategy and policies for the use, development or 
protection of land and buildings in the Plan Area for the period 2016 to 2036. The 
Plan Area is those parts of New Forest District outside the New Forest National 
Park (as shown in Figure 2.1).
1.2  The Local Plan forms part of the statutory development plan for the Plan Area 
(together with any Neighbourhood Plans and the Hampshire Minerals and Waste 
Plan). The policies of the statutory development plan are the basis for deciding 
planning applications for development.
Two stage Local Plan Review
1.3  This Local Plan 2016-2036 Part One: Planning Strategy sets out strategic policies, 
including Strategic Site Allocations capable of accommodating 100 or more 
homes. It replaces and updates parts of the adopted Core Strategy (2009), and 
a small number of the more strategic policies in the Local Plan Part 2: Sites and 
Development Management adopted in 2014.
1.4  The remaining policies of the adopted Core Strategy (2009) and Local Plan Part 
2 (2014) are either saved for continued use pending review as part of the Local 
Plan Review 2016-2036 Part Two, or are deleted, as set out in Appendix A. Deleted 
policies will no longer be applied.
1.5  The Local Plan Review 2016-2036 Part Two will focus mainly on development 
management and other matters of policy detail, on allocations for smaller sites, and 
the review of the remaining saved planning policies including saved site allocations.
1.6  Saved Policies remain in force until they are updated or deleted (unless they 
become out of date for other reasons, for example a change in national guidance or 
local circumstances).
Relationship to Neighbourhood Plans
1.7  The Local Plan Part One provides the strategic context for Neighbourhood 
Planning. Neighbourhood Plans must be in general conformity with the 
Development Plan.
1.8  Where Neighbourhood Plans are being prepared the Local Plan Part Two will be 
tailored so as not to duplicate work communities have committed to undertake, 
whilst ensuring that all necessary matters are addressed in a consistent and timely 
manner.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  2Supporting documents and evidence base
1.9  The following companion documents support the Local Plan 2016-2036 Part One 
and/or have informed the preparation of the Local Plan policies, including the 
selection of sites allocated for development.
•  The Sustainability Appraisal1 (SA) documents how policies and sites were 
tested to ensure that they achieve environmental, economic and social 
objectives, and to ensure that the Local Plan as a whole contributes to 
improvements in environmental, social and economic conditions of the Plan 
Area. The SA is also a means of identifying and mitigating any potential 
adverse effects that the Local Plan might otherwise have.
•  A Habitats Regulations Appropriate Assessment2 (LUC) has assessed 
whether the Local Plan is likely to have significant effects on International 
Nature Conservation sites. It shows that Local Plan policies including 
development proposals are unlikely to have a significant adverse effect on 
International Nature Conservation sites, provided that the necessary habitat 
mitigation measures are implemented in an effective and timely manner .
•  The Infrastructure Delivery Plan3 sets out the infrastructure, services and 
facilities including open space required to enable new development to take 
place, how it will be delivered and by whom. It was produced in consultation 
with infrastructure providers.
•  The Mitigation for Recreational Impacts Supplementary Planning 
Document4 sets out how the effects of higher levels of planned housing on 
internationally designated nature conservation sites will be managed and 
mitigated e.g. from recreational disturbance. This work was prepared and will 
be periodically updated in close consultation with the New Forest National Park 
Authority, Natural England and other key wildlife and ecology interest groups.
•  The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)5 sets a charge per square metre 
on development to help pay for infrastructure and mitigation on a defined list 
of projects or categories of infrastructure. The defined list of projects will be 
reviewed periodically to ensure CIL is used effectively.  Further guidance will be 
prepared on other developer contributions.

context
Introduction
2.1  The Plan Area is characterised by a dispersed pattern of small to medium-
sized towns and villages within attractive countryside and coastal landscapes. It 
comprises three separate sub-areas around the edges of the New Forest National 
Park on the south coast between the city of Southampton and Bournemouth (see 
Figure 2.1). The Plan Area contains 32% of the New Forest District Council area, 
and 81% of the District population. The rest of the District lies within the New Forest 
National Park Authority Local Plan Area.

2.2  The Key Diagram on the following page shows the Plan Area in strategic context.
Relationship to the New Forest National Park
2.3  Historically much of the District was part of the New Forest Heritage Area which 
pre-dated the formation of the National Park, where successive county and regional 
plans recognised a need for development constraint.
2.4  In planning for the District area outside the National Park there is a statutory duty to 
have regard to the purposes of National Parks7 : 
•  To conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of 
the National Park.
•  To promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special 
qualities of the National Park by the public.
2.5  The New Forest National Park is in close proximity to most of the main settlements 
in the Plan Area, and this Local Plan has been prepared in close cooperation with 
the New Forest National Park Authority, including joint production of key parts of the 
evidence base. Sites allocated for development in the Local Plan are predominantly 
on the settlement edge of towns and villages in areas with strong rural character, in 
some cases located on the National Park boundary.
Housing markets and economic areas
2.6  The Plan Area is partly within three housing market and travel-to-work areas, 
which overlap to some extent: Southampton, Bournemouth and to a lesser extent 
Salisbury.
2.7  The District is a member of the Partnership for South Hampshire (PfSH) and forms 
part of the Solent Local Economic Partnership (LEP) area (see fig 2.3). PfSH has a 
significant history of cooperative working on strategic planning matters.

The environment
2.8  The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) sets out a presumption in favour 
of sustainable development, including that Local Plans should meet identified needs 
unless specific policies in the NPPF indicate development should be restricted.
2.9  The policy examples referenced8 in the NPPF include those policies relating to sites 
protected under the Birds and Habitats Directives (collectively called ‘International 
Nature Conservation sites’ in this Local Plan), and/or designated as Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest, land designated as Green Belt, Local Green Space, Areas 
of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage Coast or land within a National Park, 
designated heritage assets, and locations at risk of flooding or coastal erosion.

Figure 2.3 PfSH and Solent LEP area
2.10  Within the Plan Area the Habitats Regulations Assessment has shown that all 
residential development will have an impact on International Nature Conservation 
sites, and this significantly affects how or whether a presumption in favour of 
sustainable development9 can be applied to planning decisions.
2.11  The Plan Area is relatively small, and a small proportion of the Plan Area is free 
from the type of constraints that, based on the NPPF, may justify restricting 
development (as illustrated in Figures 2.4 and 2.5). The extent of restrictive 
designations  and significant policy constraints effectively means that much of the 
Plan Area is either an inappropriate location for built development, and/or should 
only be considered for development in exceptional circumstances. For example:

for its nature conservation significance
• 28% is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)
• 21% is Green Belt 
•  17% is already built-up, with relatively limited opportunities for brownfield  
redevelopment11 other than at the former Fawley Power Station site
• Around 15% is at risk of flooding or erosion (Flood Zones 2 or 3)
2.12  Taking into account land within the Inner Consultation Zone identified by the Health 
and Safety Executive for certain potentially hazardous military or industrial activities 
or materials12, just 19% of the undeveloped land in the Plan Area is not directly 
affected by a significantly constraining national policy, safety or environmental 
constraint. Of this approximately 4,500 hectares of greenfield land, around 950 
hectares have locally identified habitat or wildlife value13, around 210 hectares are 
within the strategic land reserve for the Port of Southampton at Dibden Bay , and 
around 470 hectares are allocated for development in this Local Plan. The majority 
of the remaining area without significant constraints is in relatively remote rural 
locations in the Avon Valley and Downlands sub-area.

objectives
Key issues
3.1  The Local Plan must be a response to the specific issues facing the Plan Area. 
This chapter sets out 14 Key Issues that the Local Plan must address if it is to 
be successful - not in any order of importance and inevitably with some overlap 
between issues.
3.2  This list of Key Issues is a local expression of the requirements and objectives 
for plan-making set out in national guidance, drawing on the Local Plan review 
evidence base and accumulated experience of planning for New Forest District.
3.3  The Key Issues are organised thematically reflecting the vision and priorities set out 
in our Corporate Plan, including:
•  Protecting and enhancing the special and unique character and environment of 
the New Forest area 
• Providing more homes for local people
• Supporting local businesses to prosper for the benefit of the community
•  Promoting the safety and wellbeing of people who live and work within the 
District
Protecting and enhancing the special and unique character and 
environment of the New Forest area
Key Issue 1: Accommodating development whilst protecting the environment
3.4  What is the right balance between meeting development needs and aspirations 
within the Plan Area and protecting the quality of the local environment, including 
avoiding harm to International Nature Conservation sites and to nationally 
recognised areas of high nature conservation or landscape value such as the 
New Forest National Park and the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural

of the Plan Area’s towns, villages and rural areas to ensure that new development 
makes a positive contribution to local distinctiveness and quality of life?
Providing more homes for local people
Key Issue 5: Housing needs and affordability
3.8  How can the Local Plan best address housing needs? There is a high demand 
for housing from outside the area and there is a limited supply of suitable land 
for development. House prices are unaffordable to most local residents trying to 
access the housing market for the first time.
Key Issue 6: Ageing population
3.9  How do we best address the accommodation, care and related needs of our ageing 
resident population when the proportion of residents aged 65 and over is projected 
to increase by 40% (13,200)14 between 2016 and 2036?

community
Key Issue 7: Local economy
3.10  How can the Local Plan best help local businesses to prosper and provide 
good quality local employment? What is the right balance between protecting, 
releasing and allocating new employment land, recognising that the economically 
active population of the Plan Area is forecast to increase slightly but primarily 
in age cohorts approaching retirement age15, and where opportunities for new 
development are limited?
Key Issue 8: South Hampshire and the Port of Southampton
3.11  How should the Local Plan respond or contribute to supporting the trading and 
port needs of the national economy as Britain leaves the European Union, and to 
the economic regeneration of the South Hampshire sub-region, whilst protecting 
the local environment and ensuring that local communities benefit when major 
development takes place?

3.14  How can the Local Plan respond to the risks posed by climate change including 
rising sea levels and increased likelihood of flooding, and help to minimise the 
harmful impacts of development activity and promote renewable resource use 
within the Plan Area?
Key Issue 12: Infrastructure and local services
3.15  How can the Local Plan help ensure adequate provision of infrastructure and locally 
accessible services and facilities, when new development can only address its 
own consequences and cannot be expected to redress historic deficiencies, in a 
wider context where service–providers are facing budget restraint and pressures to 
centralise services?
Key Issue 13: Transport and accessibility
3.16  How can the Local Plan maintain, promote and where possible improve access to 
services, employment, social and leisure opportunities by public transport, cycling 
and walking, whilst also maintaining safe and convenient access by car for which 
there is often no practicable alternative (especially in rural areas)?
Key Issue 14: Leisure, culture and recreation
3.17  What provision is needed in the Local Plan to ensure suitable provision for leisure, 
cultural activities, open space, sports and recreation by all age groups to encourage 
and enable active and healthy lifestyles?New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  16Local Plan Vision
By 2036 New Forest District (outside the National Park) will be characterised by thriving and 
prosperous communities that provide for the housing, business and community needs of residents.
The natural beauty and cultural heritage of the adjoining New Forest National Park and Cranborne 
Chase AONB, and the International Nature Conservation sites and nationally protected habitats in 
the New Forest area will have been safeguarded and enhanced.
The character, heritage and local distinctiveness of the towns and villages will have been 
protected and enhanced by contextually appropriate and well-designed development providing 
a wide spectrum of new homes addressing and prioritising the diverse needs of district residents 
at all stages of life. New residential development will provide improved facilities for the whole 
community, including significant areas of natural recreational green space retaining and enhancing 
key landscape features and biodiversity in areas of new development. This will provide improved 
access to the countryside promoting healthy and active lifestyles, whilst also buffering sensitive 
ecological areas and natural landscapes, and safeguarding the special qualities of the adjoining 
New Forest National Park. The communities living around it will continue to strongly identity with 
the New Forest National Park.
Totton and the Waterside will continue to play an important and growing role in the regional and 
national economy, whilst also protecting and enhancing the International Nature Conservation 
sites in the New Forest and Solent and functioning as a good neighbour and positive gateway to 
the New Forest National Park.
The regeneration of the former Fawley Power Station site and new communities north of Totton 
and Marchwood will provide new opportunities, facilities, and open spaces for residents in the 
Waterside sub-area.
Within the South Coastal Towns the selective Local Plan release for development of land in 
sustainable locations that no longer strongly serve the purposes of Green Belt provides significant 
opportunities for growth for the first time in a generation. Strongly performing Green Belt land will 
continue to be protected and the recreational, landscape and environmental value of the Green 
Belt adjoining development locations will be enhanced. The release of land for development will 
provide more affordable opportunities for younger households to help sustain the vitality and 
diversity of south coast towns and villages, whilst also better meeting the diverse accommodation 
needs of older households in the community.
Within the Avon Valley and Downlands  area the natural beauty and tranquillity of the Cranborne 
Chase AONB will continue to be protected. Continued protection of the lower Avon Valley as 
Green Belt will play an important complementary role in helping to sustain the open views and 
long vistas which are an essential part of the landscape character of this mainly rural area, and 
form an important part of the setting of the adjoining New Forest National Park. Planned growth 
will help to sustain and enhance the vitality of Fordingbridge and Ringwood as market towns, and 
will enable improvements to flooding and drainage issues in Fordingbridge and Bransgore.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy17Local Plan strategic objectives
3.18  We have identified ten strategic objectives for the Local Plan review to support and 
achieve sustainable development. These objectives reflect and express in our local 
context the main plan-making requirements set out in national planning policy. They 
draw on the Sustainability Appraisal process but focus on our highest priorities, 
and also our biggest challenges that require a judgement to be made between 
potentially conflicting strategic priorities.

development 
The spatial strategy
4.1 The strategic policies in this chapter:
•  Identify the development needs that the Local Plan seeks to meet and where 
they will be provided; and
•  Set out the key implementation principles that will ensure development 
is delivered in the right place and in a manner that achieves sustainable 
development that is appropriate to the sensitive environment and character of 
the Plan Area.
4.2  Taken together the policies of this chapter are the Spatial Strategy for New Forest 
District outside the New Forest National Park.
Achieving sustainable development
4.3  The National Planning Policy Framework16 sets out three overarching objectives to 
achieve sustainable development:
•  An economic objective – to help build a strong, responsive and competitive 
economy;
•  A social objective – to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities; and
•  An environmental objective – to contribute to protecting and enhancing our 
natural, built and historic environment.
4.4  The Local Plan taken as a whole achieves net gains across all three sustainable 
development objectives, as demonstrated by the Sustainability Appraisal. 
Identifying sufficient, suitable land to meet development needs poses particular 
challenges in the Plan Area, which contains extensive areas with high value in 
habitat or landscape terms, as well as extensive areas subject to flooding or other 
safety risks. In some cases compromises have been necessary between the three 
sustainability objectives at the level of individual policies or site allocations, to 
achieve an acceptable balance for the Local Plan overall.
16 NPPF 2012 paragraph 7, NPPF 2019 paragraph 8New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  24 
Policy STR1: Achieving sustainable development
All new development will be expected to make a positive social, economic and 
environmental contribution to community and business life in the Plan Area by:
Meeting most development needs within settlement boundaries, in a manner 
that is appropriate for and proportionate to the nature and size of the 
settlement, and where there is or will be sufficient supporting infrastructure 
and services;
i.  Ensuring that the housing needs of local communities are addressed 
by locating new residential development in sustainable and accessible 
locations, and ensuring that new development provides a mix of types of 
home by size, tenure and cost to help to address the full spectrum of local 
housing needs at all stages of life;
ii.  Taking a context and landscape-led approach to the siting and design 
of development to deliver high quality design that maintains local 
distinctiveness, creates high quality new landscapes and townscapes, 
safeguards the Green Belt and AONB, sustains and enhances the heritage, 
scenic and amenity value of the Plan Area, and has appropriate regard to 
and the purposes of the adjoining New Forest National Park;
iii.  Achieving an environmental net gain17 and avoiding wherever possible or 
mitigating where necessary the direct and indirect impacts of development 
on the integrity of the New Forest, Solent, River Avon and other 
International Nature Conservation sites, and on other areas, species or 
habitats of nature conservation value;
iv.  Ensuring development contributes to a diverse and thriving local economy 
providing an overall balance of uses, services and opportunities that are 
accessible by sustainable transport modes as well as by car, in order that 
reliance on the private car is minimised;
v.  Ensuring communities and workers are safe and feel safe, and the risks 
to people, places and to the environment from potential hazards including 
pollution, flooding and climate change effects are minimised;
vi.  Ensuring that new development is adaptable to the future needs of 
occupiers and future-proofed for climate change and innovations in 
transport and communications technology.
17 As defined in the glossary and where applicable encompassing the national requirement for 
development to achieve a biodiversity net gain.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy25Protection of the countryside
4.5  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) and National Parks are statutorily 
protected landscapes, recognised by Government to be of the very highest quality. 
The purposes of these designations are subtly different, but they share a common 
aim of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the English landscape, not 
just for the present, but also for future generations.
4.6  There is a duty to have regard to the purposes of both AONBs, under the 
Countryside and Rights of Way Act, 2000 (Section 85), and National Parks, under 
the Environment Act, 1995 (Section 62).
Policy STR2: Protection of the countryside, Cranborne Chase Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty and the adjoining New Forest National 
Park
Development should not have an unacceptable impact on the special 
qualities and purposes of the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty, or on the adjoining New Forest National Park and their settings. In 
the determination and implementation of development proposals including 
planned growth, great weight will be given to ensuring that the character, 
quality and scenic beauty of the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty and adjoining New Forest National Park are protected and enhanced.
Supporting text
4.7  Proposals for development within or affecting the Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty (AONB) or the New Forest National Park will need to demonstrate that they 
have taken account of the objectives, policies and actions set out in the relevant 
Management Plans for these areas. Proposals for development outside the AONB 
and the National Park that is sufficiently prominent (in terms of its siting or scale) to 
have an impact on the area’s special qualities must also demonstrate that it would 
not adversely affect their setting.
The strategy for locating new development
4.8  The strategy maintains the established approach in the Plan Area to identifying 
appropriate locations for development in relation to the existing settlement pattern. 
The Local Plan evidence base identified sufficient opportunities to meet future 
needs around the edge of settlements, and within built-up areas or on previously 
developed land.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  26 
Policy STR3: The strategy for locating new development
The strategy is to locate and direct new development to accessible locations 
that help to sustain the vitality and viability of the towns and villages of the 
Plan Area as the focal points of commercial activity and community life, and as 
safe, attractive and accessible locations to use and visit.
Investment and development in town centres and villages that is in accordance 
with the settlement hierarchy will be supported on environmentally appropriate 
sites provided that the development achieves a high standard of design that 
maintains and enhances local character and amenity.
Beyond locations where site-specific policies apply and the built-up area 
boundary of settlements (as defined on the Policies Map), the primary 
objectives are to conserve and enhance the countryside and natural 
environment. Development will generally be restricted unless the development 
proposed is appropriate in a rural setting in accordance with Saved Policy 
CS21: Rural economy .
Supporting text
4.9  Settlement boundaries include the Strategic Site Allocations set out in Policies 
SS1 - SS18, and will be further updated through the Local Plan Review Part Two, 
if required to include any non-Strategic Site Allocations outside the defined built-up 
areas.
The settlement hierarchy
4.10  The settlement hierarchy provides a guideline to where new development proposals 
of different types and scales can best be accommodated in a sustainable way , 
taking into account existing facilities and future potential. The towns and villages 
in the Plan Area have been classified into a settlement hierarchy based on the 
availability within the settlement, or ease of access to, the following services, 
potentially reducing the need to travel: 
• Shops and ‘high street’ facilities
• Schools, health and community facilities 
• Proximity to employment locations and main settlements
• Public transport  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy27 
Policy STR4: The settlement hierarchy
The settlement hierarchy identifies three tiers of settlements and sets out 
the nature and scale of development that would be appropriate for each type 
of settlement. Development which is not in accordance with the settlement 
hierarchy will normally be resisted.
i.  Towns: Fordingbridge, Hythe Village, Lymington, Marchwood, New 
Milton, Ringwood and Totton. These centres offer access to a wider range 
of employment, facilities and services. They are the most sustainable 
locations for large-scale residential, retail, leisure, cultural and business 
development to improve their self-containment and to support and 
consolidate their local service offer.
ii.  Main villages: Ashford, Blackfield, Bransgore, Everton, Fawley, Hardley, 
Holbury, Hordle, Langley, Milford-on-Sea and Sandleheath. These villages 
provide a limited to moderate range of local services and in addition to 
Strategic Sites where allocated, they are appropriate locations for small 
to medium-scale development that sustains their current village role in a 
manner that is cumulatively proportionate. This includes local service and 
employment uses. Strategic Site 4: the former Fawley Power Station  will 
be treated as equivalent to a main village.
iii.  Small rural villages: Breamore, Damerham, Ellingham, Harbridge, Ibsley, 
Martin, Rockbourne, Sopley and Whitsbury. No built-up area is defined for 
these small, rural villages and there is a gradual transition from settlement 
to countryside. These villages have limited access to facilities and 
workplaces. They are suitable locations for small-scale uses appropriate in 
a countryside setting and that help to maintain community life, including 
proportionate and small-scale housing development where it is specifically 
to meet local housing needs identified by the local community.

4.11 As a general guideline: 
•  Large-scale development is defined as for 50 or more homes or 2,500 square 
metres or more floorspace of non-residential development (gross internal area)
•  Medium-scale is defined as 10-49 homes or 500-2,500 square metres 
floorspace
•  Small-scale is defined as under 10 homes or less than 500 square metres 
floorspaceNew Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  28Meeting our housing needs
4.12  The identification of land to meet identified future housing needs is one of the 
primary purposes of this Local Plan. This policy identifies broadly when and where 
the objectively assessed need for housing in the Plan Area will be met. The sites 
and sources of supply have been assessed to ensure that they are suitable, 
available and likely to be deliverable for housing within the Plan period.
Policy STR5: Meeting our housing needs
The target is to provide at least 10,420 additional homes in the Plan Area for the 
Plan period 2016-2036, phased as follows:
•  Approximately 1,500 homes (averaging 300 homes per annum) 2016-17 to 
2020-2118 
•  Approximately 2,000 homes (averaging 400 homes per annum) 2021-22 to 
2025-26
•  Approximately 7,000 homes (averaging 700 homes per annum) 2026-27 to 
2035-36
Provision will comprise:
i.    At least 6,000 homes on Strategic Site Allocations set out in Figure 4.1, in 
accordance with Strategic Site Allocation Policies SS1 – SS18 .
ii.   At least 800 homes on sites of 10 or more homes to be identified within or 
adjoining the defined towns and large villages and allocated in the Local 
Plan Part Two or in Neighbourhood Plans, which may include sites of 100 
or more homes provided that they are within the settlement boundary, to 
include: 
a.  Around 200 homes on sites to be identified in Lymington and 
Pennington;
b.  Around 200 homes on sites to be identified in New Milton 
Neighbourhood; and
c.  Around 400 homes on sites to be identified in other towns and large 
villages.
iii.   Existing commitments of approximately 2,755 homes, including saved site 
allocation policies19 from the previous Local Plan Part 2; and
iv.   An estimated 924 homes on small developments of 1-9 homes reflecting 
past trends, and developments on affordable housing exception sites in 
suitable locations in the smaller villages to meet local need for affordable 
and low cost housing for local people in accordance with Policy HOU5: 
Rural housing exceptions sites and community-led housing schemes .

deliver
19 See Appendix A for Saved Policies  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy29Supporting text
4.13  The Strategic Site Allocations of 100 or more homes, identified in Figure 4.1, 
address the majority of future housing needs not already being met by permitted 
development proposals or previously allocated sites. The identified capacity 
of strategic sites is in most cases a minimum target. It reflects what has been 
demonstrated to be deliverable through preliminary masterplanning work (carried 
out by the Council in consultation with site promoters), whilst meeting the 
requirements of other Local Plan policies including public open space requirements 
and housing mix guidelines, and in relation to mitigating impacts of development 
on International Nature Conservation sites. Subject to high-quality design and the 
specific housing mix proposed, it may be possible at detailed design stage that the 
site capacity exceeds that identified in this Local Plan.
4.14  Development phasing reflects the practical reality of lead-in times required to deliver 
a near three-fold increase in housing completions compared to the preceding Core 
Strategy housing target: a step change in delivery can only be achieved in steps. 
The overall phasing takes into account the views of the promoters of Strategic Site 
Allocations, and factors relevant to the timing and commencement of development 
including the potential extraction of minerals.
4.15  Additional non-strategic sites (of less than 100 homes) will be allocated in 
Neighbourhood Plans and the Local Plan Part Two, providing scope to respond 
if necessary to overall housing delivery progress before a full review of this Local 
Plan is due.
4.16  The balance of the required housing supply is expected to come forward on 
small unidentified (‘windfall’) sites of under ten homes, plus rural exception sites, 
reflecting established trends and informed by a review of potential small site supply .New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  30Strategic Site Site Policy Estimated minimum

authority in Hampshire (7,700), a diverse mix of businesses with different and 
changing needs. The leading business sectors in the district are distribution, 
transport, accommodation and food including tourism, public administration, 
education and health, construction and manufacturing. Sectors such as information 
and communication, finance, professional, scientific and technical are under-
represented when compared with rates for the wider south east and the UK.
4.18  At one end of the spectrum local businesses include nationally significant industrial 
uses such as the Fawley oil refinery complex, operating in well-established 
industrial areas and complexes, including some land reserves for future needs. 
Their primary requirements are a stable, supportive and consistent land use 
planning environment and good infrastructure links.
4.19  At the other end of the spectrum, micro-businesses typically employing fewer than 
10 employees make up 89% of the total. Their business and employment needs are 
primarily for small and flexible workspaces to start-up in, and to grow on.
4.20  The Local Plan strategy therefore aims to promote sustainable economic growth 
that is appropriate to the environmental and locational characteristics of the Plan 
Area. This will be achieved by retaining and supporting existing business sectors, 
safeguarding opportunities for future employment and business development, 
supporting the marine industries sector, by encouraging a greater presence of 
appropriate higher value and knowledge-based businesses, and promoting the 
development of flexible workspace and accommodation suitable to meet the diverse 
needs of and support the significant number of small businesses in our area.
4.21  The strategy for sustainable economic growth takes into account that 
unemployment rates in the Plan Area are currently low, and that with an ageing 
population the working age population will not increase significantly in the Plan 
period.

Policy STR6: Sustainable economic growth
The Council strategy for sustainable economic growth is to maintain and 
enable a vibrant and prosperous local economy offering a diverse range of 
local employment opportunities, where existing businesses continue to thrive 
and new businesses have sufficient and suitable opportunities to form and 
grow in appropriate locations. This will be achieved by:
i.    The provision of sufficient land to meet the identified need for 126,000sqm 
of employment floorspace. This will comprise of: 
a.  18 hectares of employment land (for around 70,000sqm floorspace) 
allocated within residential-led mixed-use Strategic Site Allocations at 
Totton (SS1), Fawley (SS4) and Ringwood (SS14);
b.  10 hectares of employment land (for around 40,000sqm floorspace) 
allocated by Saved Policies from the Local Plan Part 2 (2014);
c.  Around 10,000sqm of employment floorspace completions 2016-2018, 
and around 30,000sqm on sites with extant planning permission.
ii.   Safeguarding opportunities for future businesses by retaining employment 
sites and site allocations that are suitable and viable for continued 
employment use;
iii.  Encouraging a greater presence of higher value, knowledge-based 
businesses;
iv.  Supporting the Solent marine industries sector and ensuring that direct 
access to the coast for commercial marine uses and vessels is maintained 
if sites that currently provide access are redeveloped;
v.  Working with key businesses, transport authorities and other partners in 
the Waterside area to ensure that its transport infrastructure and capacity 
is resilient to planned and other potentially significant growth;
vi.  Supporting a sustainable rural economy including low environmental 
impact businesses and tourism;
vii.  Promoting development or programmes that provide skills or vocational 
training, business incubation and mentoring, flexible workspace and 
conference and meeting facilities, or that support flexible working.

4.22  The Business Needs and Commercial Property Market Assessment (2017)20  
indicates that there is realistic potential demand for around 6,300sqm of business 
floorspace per annum in the Plan Area. Over the Local Plan period 2016-2036 this 
equates to 126,000 sqm of business floorspace or a requirement for approximately 
32 hectares of employment development land. 
20 Commercial Property Market and Business Needs Assessment (2017)  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy334.23  The Partnership for Urban South Hampshire (PUSH) Spatial Position Statement  
(2016)21 provides targets for employment provision within the PUSH area of 
New Forest District (Totton and the Waterside). Need for 32,000sqm of business 
floorspace is identified for the period 2011 to 2034 (equating to around eight 
hectares of land). Taking into account allocations in the previous Local Plan in the 
period 2011- 2016, there is a residual need of around five hectares of employment 
land within Totton and the Waterside. This figure is within and not additional to 
the total Plan Area requirement set out in the Commercial Property Market and 
Business Needs Assessment.
4.24  Taking into account the current availability of around 20 hectares of suitable 
employment land, including the remaining employment land allocations from the 
Local Plan Part 2 (2014), the strategy addresses identified local employment 
needs by the provision of around 18 hectares of new employment land as part of 
the following residential-led mixed use strategic allocations in accordance with 
the requirements set out within the Strategic Site Allocation Policies . These are 
intended to provide for a range and choice of sites in sustainable locations for a 
variety of business sectors, to provide jobs close to people’s homes, and to enable 
the replacement of business premises that transition to alternative non-employment 
uses under permitted development rights.
•  Around five hectares of employment land with Strategic Site SS1 Totton, 
addressing the residual PUSH target
•  Around 10 hectares of business and industrial land, including land for marine 
industries, and subject to demand up to 16,000sqm of B1 office space, within 
Strategic Site SS4 the former Fawley Power Station
•  Around three hectares of employment land at Strategic Site SS14 in Ringwood 
adjacent to the A31.
4.25  The South Marine Plan22 and the Marine Policy Statement23 are relevant 
to planning decisions for the sea, coast, estuaries and tidal waters, and for 
developments that impact these areas. The Solent LEP has published a register24 
of key waterfront employment sites, including the following in the Plan Area: Eling 
Wharf, Marchwood Industrial Park, Marchwood Port, Hythe Marina Village, Hythe 
Marine Park, Fawley oil refinery and the former Fawley Power Station. 
4.26  The Local Plan strategy also provides a supportive approach to development 
proposals that would provide skills or vocational training, or business mentoring.

needed to access the jobs and opportunities available and local employers have 
access to a suitably skilled local labour force.
Strategic transport priorities
4.27  The Local Plan strategy for transport and access aims to promote a more integrated 
and sustainable local transport network, and to facilitate ease of access to local 
services and facilities supporting planned development and mitigating its cumulative 
impact on the highways network and other transport services.
4.28  Transport links with neighbouring areas and local accessibility are important to, and 
have a significant impact on, the lives of communities in the Plan Area. The unusual 
shape of the Plan Area and dispersed settlement pattern mean that many transport 
issues within the area need to be considered as part of a bigger picture for a much 
wider area.
4.29  The Strategic Transport Network Assessment (2016)25 demonstrated that the 
cumulative impacts of the planned housing growth set out within Policy STR5: 
Meeting our housing needs  are not severe and the transport impacts of planned 
development can be accommodated satisfactorily. Planned growth will place 
increased pressure on the road network at certain locations, but these impacts 
can be adequately addressed by specific local measures that are capable of being 
funded by development contributions or provided as part of site developments. The 
Strategic Site Allocation Policies and Infrastructure Delivery Plan provide further 
information.
4.30  However it remains important to ensure that future development takes account 
of land that may be required to deliver existing transport projects, or to address 
future needs should there be an expansion of port-related transport activity in the 
Waterside area.
Policy STR7: Strategic transport priorities
The Council will support and facilitate major projects that improve 
accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists, improve public transport, reduce 
traffic congestion and improve road safety, provided that they can be 
achieved without an unacceptable impact on the local environment and local 
communities.
25 https://www.newforest.gov.uk/localplanexamination#evidencebase  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy35Supporting text
4.31  Strategic Transport Proposals are projects identified in a strategy or report 
published by Highways England or by the Highways Authority (Hampshire County 
Council), including priorities identified in the Local Transport Plan. High priorities for 
improvement are:
i.  A31 Ringwood area (increase the width of the A31 from two lanes to three 
lanes on the westbound carriages between the Ringwood and Verwood 
junctions);
ii.  A35 east of A326 (repairs to the Redbridge Causeway, capacity improvements 
and bus priorities Rushington – Millbrook);
iii.  A326 capacity and junction improvements including bus priorities.
4.32  Committed strategic transport projects include improvements to the A31 at 
Ringwood and on the A35 the Redbridge Causeway. Other strategic priorities 
identified in the New Forest Transport Statement (2012) accompanying the 
Hampshire County Council Local Transport Plan LTP3 2011-2031, and in the 
Hampshire Waterside Interim Transport Policy26 include the A326 corridor, where 
it may also be necessary to undertake further transport works if there is a future 
consent for significant port development (see Policies ECON3 and ECON4). Until 
such time as it is clear whether and what scale of port development might take 
place, new development within the A326 corridor should be carefully designed and 
sited so that future A326 capacity enhancement is not unduly prejudiced.
Community services, infrastructure and facilities
4.33  The primary focus of this policy is to set out the strategy to secure or enable 
provision by the relevant third parties of the infrastructure and community service 
facilities that are needed, to meet the current and future needs of residents 
and businesses, and to ensure that planned development can be sustainably 
accommodated. This involves:
•  Working constructively with infrastructure and service providers to help them 
to identify and (as planning authority) implement appropriate projects to deliver 
the facilities or installations required; and
•  Ensuring that the development industry addresses the particular infrastructure 
and service requirement arising from, or necessary to support or mitigate their 
development proposals.
26 https://democracy.hants.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=514New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  364.34  For Local Plan purposes, infrastructure encompasses the provision and 
maintenance of the facilities, services, and installations needed to make 
development acceptable and sustainable, and to support our communities and to 
enable the local economy to thrive, such as (but not limited to):
•  transportation: roads, car parking, bus routes, rail networks, footpaths, cycling 
routes and cycle parking, electric vehicle charging infrastructure;
•  education facilities: schools, adult learning centres, nurseries and child care;
•  utilities: water, gas and electricity supply; waste treatment works, drains and 
sewers;
• surface water drainage
•  telecommunications including superfast fibre broadband and 5G mobile 
networks;
•  community facilities: sports and leisure facilities, community centres, libraries, 
places of worship, crematoria and burial space;
• health care: hospitals, local medical and dental practices;
• emergency services: fire, police and ambulance facilities;
• waste: facilities for collection, recovery, recycling and disposal;
•  green spaces: playing fields, sport pitches (New Forest District Council 
Standards for Formal Open Space August 2017), play facilities, parks and 
natural recreation areas.
4.35  The preparation of the Local Plan was informed by consultation with infrastructure 
and service providers, and the Local Plan evidence base27 includes technical 
assessments of transport capacity and some other infrastructure and service 
needs.
4.36  It is important to distinguish between infrastructure and services that are provided 
to address or mitigate the wider than site-specific impacts of development and 
growth, the focus of this policy, and infrastructure that is provided to open up sites 
for development and to meet the on-site needs of future occupiers. The latter is 
part of the normal cost of undertaking development met by the developer. This 
typically includes but is not limited to site roads and points of access, parking areas, 
footpaths, drainage, landscaping and amenity play and open space areas within the 
site, and the utilities and telecommunications connections to and within the site.

Policy STR8: Community services, infrastructure and facilities
In order to ensure the provision of adequate infrastructure and services to 
meet the current and future needs of residents and businesses in the Plan 
Area:
i. The Council will work with:
a.  Community service and infrastructure providers and business 
interests, to support or enable their delivery of transport, utilities, 
communications and community service infrastructure projects 
and facilities that help to address the current and future needs of 
communities and businesses in the Plan Area; and
b.  Developers through the planning application process, to ensure that 
proposed developments make sufficient provision for the needs of 
future occupiers, and mitigate their impacts on existing services and 
facilities in accordance with Policy IMPL1: Developer contributions  
and the requirements set out in the Strategic Site Allocation Policies  
and the Infrastructure Delivery Plan.
ii. The Council will support proposals for:
c.  Utilities, communications and transport infrastructure developments 
that are designed to avoid wherever possible, otherwise to minimise 
and adequately mitigate, any adverse environmental, health, safety 
and landscape impacts.
d.  The provision of education, health, social and other community 
services that are located to be accessible to all sectors of the 
community.
e.  Development to enable innovative delivery of public services including 
through the use of mobile services and information technology.
iii.   There will be a presumption against any development that involves the 
loss of education, health, social and other community services, unless the 
use of the site or building is redundant, or the service will be provided in 
another way following a service review.

4.37  Based on consultations with infrastructure and service providers, the Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan (IDP) identifies the types of infrastructure required (including capacity 
and constraints of existing infrastructure) and the potential sources of funding 
identified to support the delivery of the Local Plan. The IDP is a live document, and 
its requirements are reflected in the Strategic Site Allocation Policies which set 
out site-specific requirements for the provision of the infrastructure and services 
necessary to sustainably accommodate planned growth, including public open 
space in accordance with Saved Policy CS7: Open Space, Sport and Recreation.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  38Infrastructure providers 
4.38  Infrastructure provision to meet identified needs will be supported provided that it is 
appropriately designed and located in accordance with the wider policy objectives 
of this Plan, to avoid or minimise, or if necessary mitigate, potential harmful impacts 
on the environment, the landscape, or on communities, as part of achieving an 
overall net environmental gain.
4.39  Where practical, the possibility of sharing infrastructure facilities should be fully 
explored. For example sharing telecommunications masts or using school premises 
and facilities for community purposes outside school hours.
Developers
4.40  New development increases the use of, or demand for, existing services and 
facilities. Where new homes or businesses are developed and there is insufficient 
capacity to meet additional demand, the essential infrastructure and facilities 
needed must be provided in a timely manner to provide the capacity to meet the 
demand created. Policy IMPL1: Developer contributions  explains the role of the 
development industry in meeting the infrastructure and service needs generated by 
development, or to mitigate its impact on existing facilities.
Mineral resources
Policy STR9: Development on land within a Minerals Safeguarding 
Area or Minerals Consultation Area
i.  Viable mineral resources should not needlessly be sterilised by 
development. Development proposals on land within a Minerals 
Safeguarding Area or Minerals Consultation Area as defined in the 
Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan should be phased around the 
appropriate prior extraction of minerals.
ii. Appropriate extraction will depend on: 
a. The scale and quality of mineral resource; 
b.  Ground water levels if they would adversely impact on future re-use of 
the land; 
c. Amenity, environmental and other relevant considerations; and
d.  The need to ensure the timely provision of new homes and other 
development.
iii.  Where there is a viable resource, minerals re-use on site for construction 
is encouraged.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy39Supporting text
4.41  Where land proposed for development is within a Minerals Safeguarding Area 
or Minerals Consultation Area, site promoters should undertake a minerals 
assessment to assess the viability and practicability of prior extraction of the 
minerals resource in consultation with the Minerals Planning Authority, having 
regard to the Hampshire Minerals and Waste Local Plan and any relevant 
supplementary planning guidance.
4.42  Where prior or incidental minerals extraction takes place before housing 
development, particular care should be taken to protect features of landscape and 
biodiversity interest within the site to ensure that development including minerals 
extraction can achieve a net environmental gain compared to the original state of 
the land.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  40Page intentionally blank  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy415. Protecting our special environment
Nature conservation, biodiversity and geodiversity 
5.1  As set out in Strategic Objective SO2 and Saved Policy DM2 (Local Plan Part 
2, 2014) the overall objective is that developments should protect and enhance 
biodiversity.
Mitigating the impacts of development on International Nature 
Conservation sites
5.2  The significant extent and ecological sensitivity of International Nature Conservation 
sites in and adjoining the Plan Area makes accommodation of the development 
a major challenge. All development in the Plan Area must meet the requirements 
of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 and this 
may significantly affect how or whether a presumption in favour of sustainable 
development can be applied to planning decisions28.
5.3  The Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) of the Local Plan identifies that 
without appropriate mitigation, planned development (either alone or in combination 
with development elsewhere) would be likely to have a range of significant effects 
on a number of International Nature Conservation sites, or that significant effects 
could not be ruled out. These include potential effects on plants and species due 
to traffic emissions on roads through the New Forest, water quality impacts from 
increased discharge of phosphorus or nitrogen to the River Avon or to the Solent 
and Southampton Water respectively, and recreational disturbance in the Solent 
and New Forest arising from an increased population.
5.4  Where harmful impacts are identified to be likely, development can only take place 
where that harm is avoided, or fully mitigated if it cannot be avoided. Avoidance 
of harm is best achieved by not locating high impact activities in sensitive 
locations, but within the Plan Area this cannot be wholly avoided. Where harmful 
effects cannot be ruled out, the requirements of the Conservation of Habitats 
and Species Regulations 2017 can best be met by applying the Precautionary 
Principle to avoid or mitigate possible harm.
5.5  Mitigation measures will be applied until such time as it can be demonstrated 
(based on monitoring and review of the impact of mitigation measures through the 
Local Plan review process) that it can reasonably be concluded that development is 
unlikely to have a harmful effect on International Nature Conservation sites.
28 NPPF 2012 paragraph 119 (NPPF 2019 paragraph 177) states that: “The presumption in favour 
of sustainable development (paragraph 14) does not apply where development requiring appropriate 
assessment under the Birds or Habitats Directives is being considered, planned or determined.”New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  42 
Policy ENV1: Mitigating the impacts of development on International 
Nature Conservation sites
 1.  Except as provided for in the first paragraph of Saved Policy DM2: Nature 
Conservation, Biodiversity and Geodiversity , development will only be 
permitted where the Council is satisfied that any necessary mitigation, 
management or monitoring measures are secured in perpetuity as part 
of the proposal and will be implemented in a timely manner, such that, in 
combination with other plans and development proposals, there will not be 
adverse effects on the integrity of any of the following International Nature 
Conservation sites:
•  The New Forest Special Area of Conservation (SAC), the New Forest 
Special Protection Area (SPA) and the New Forest Ramsar site;
•  The Solent Maritime SAC, Solent and Isle of Wight Lagoons SAC, the 
Solent and Southampton Water SPA, and the Solent and Southampton 
Water Ramsar site;
• The River Avon SAC, Avon Valley SPA and Ramsar site; and
• The River Itchen SAC.
2.   For residential development and the provision of overnight visitor 
accommodation adverse effects can be adequately mitigated by 
implementing approved measures relevant to the site location, including 
as set out in the Mitigation for Recreational Impacts SPD  and in the Solent 
Recreation Mitigation Strategy29, and in supplementary guidance on 
nutrient management. 
3.  For non-residential developments, the requirement for mitigation will be 
considered on case-by-case basis with regard to the nature, scale and 
location of the proposed use.
4.    The approved mitigation measures for residential developments currently 
include:
i.  For developments providing 49 or fewer net additional units of residential 
accommodation, financial contributions towards the provision of 
recreational mitigation measures as set out below and in the Mitigation for 
Recreational Impacts SPD:
(a)  Projects for the provision of alternative natural recreational green 
spaces and recreational routes: new or improved open space and 
recreational routes of a quality and type suitable to attract residents of 
new development within the Plan Area who might otherwise visit the 
International Nature Conservation sites for recreation; and
(b)   Access and Visitor Management: measures to manage the number of 
recreational visits to the New Forest and Solent Coast International 
Nature Conservation sites; and to modify visitor behaviour within 
those sites so as to reduce the potential for harmful recreational 
impacts; and
29 https://solent.birdaware.org/strategy  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy43(c)  Monitoring of the impacts of new development on the International 
Nature Conservation sites and establishing a better evidence base: 
to reduce uncertainty and inform future refinement of mitigation 
measures.
ii. For developments of 50 or more net additional residential dwellings:
(a)  Direct provision by the developer of at least eight hectares of 
natural recreational greenspace per 1,000 population located on the 
development site or directly adjoining and well connected to it; and
(b)  A financial contribution towards Access and Visitor Management and 
Monitoring as set out above at i(b) and i(c).
iii.  Additionally for all residential developments within 5.6km of the Solent and 
Southampton Water SPA, as shown on Figure 5.1, a financial contribution 
is required towards a Solent-wide programme of visitor management, 
monitoring and development mitigation projects.
iv.  Additionally for residential developments and the provision of overnight 
visitor accommodation draining or discharging wastewater to the River 
Avon in relation to phosphate neutrality or to the Solent and Southampton 
Water in relation to nitrogen neutrality, a financial contribution or other 
appropriate mechanisms to achieve nutrient-neutral development.
v.  Additionally for all residential developments, a financial contribution 
towards monitoring and, if necessary (based on future monitoring 
outcomes) managing or mitigating air quality effects within the New Forest 
SPA, SAC and Ramsar site.

Policy scope
5.6  The primary focus of this policy is the mitigation of impacts of residential 
development on internationally designated nature conservation sites, as most of the 
development proposed in the Local Plan is for housing.
5.7  The mitigation requirements for residential development apply to all forms of new 
residential development resulting in the net gain of a self-contained dwelling. This 
includes new build homes, redevelopment, mixed-use schemes, changes of use 
including under Permitted Development rights, conversions, affordable housing, 
sheltered housing, extra care housing, second homes, visitor accommodation, and 
gypsy and traveller pitches.
5.8  Residential and institutional care homes (Use Class C2) are not considered likely 
to generate recreational impacts on International Nature Conservation sites, but 
may generate water quality impacts especially if located in the River Avon or Solent 
catchments.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  445.9  Non-residential development may also generate impacts that require mitigation. 
The diversity of possible activities means it is not possible or practical to identify 
appropriate mitigation measures for every eventuality. Planning applications will 
need to include an assessment of the potential effects of the development proposed 
on International Nature Conservation sites, and include appropriate mitigation 
measures where adverse impacts cannot be screened out.
5.10  In general terms, for non-residential uses air quality and water quality impacts 
are more likely to be relevant issues for mitigation. The main exception is visitor 
or recreational activities, where recreational impacts of visitors are likely to 
require mitigation. Mitigation contributions will be required for hotel and visitor 
accommodation, and a unit of visitor accommodation will be treated as equivalent to 
a home for the purposes of calculating mitigation contributions, whether or not it is 
self-contained.
5.11  The general (rather than site-specific) recreational impacts of employees can be 
screened out, as there is a net commuting outflow from the district30.
Mitigation of recreational impacts from residential development
5.12.  The Plan Area has easy access to the New Forest National Park and to the Solent 
coast. International Nature Conservation sites in these areas require the highest 
levels of protection. A growing local population and the large numbers of summer 
visitors increase the pressures on sensitive habitat areas.
5.13  The New Forest SPA is home to a number of very rare birds which nest on or near 
the ground during the spring and early summer, and the habitats of the New Forest 
SPA provide suitable feeding for the birds. The New Forest SAC is particularly 
important for the diversity of its habitats and the range of rare and scarce species 
which it supports. It is designated for a range of rare habitats, including European 
dry heaths, northern Atlantic wet heaths, oligotrophic waterbodies, and Molinia 
meadows. On the Solent, recreational walking and dog-walking can adversely affect 
breeding, ground-nesting or over-wintering birds.
5.14  Management measures include a ranger service and the provision of advice and 
information to visitors to enable them to enjoy the New Forest and the Solent coast 
in ways that have less impact on habitat sites and protected species, especially 
in sensitive periods such as the nesting season, and ongoing habitat monitoring. 
Mitigation measures focus on the provision of natural green spaces which are 
conveniently accessible to the future residents of a development, that provide a 
suitable recreational alternative to divert some visits which may otherwise have 
been made to the New Forest and Solent Coast International Nature Conservation 
sites.
30 Census 2011  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy45The GreenWay Project
5.15  The Mitigation for Recreational Impacts SPD31 sets out a programme of 
measures and projects collectively branded the GreenWay Project, to relieve 
recreational pressures on sensitive habitats by:
• Enhancing existing green spaces 
•  Enhancing the extensive network of walking routes that exist outside of the 
sensitive areas
•  Providing Rangers to help manage sensitive areas, and to inform and influence 
visitor behaviour
• Providing natural green spaces as part of new residential development. 
5.16  Contributions are required for all new dwellings located anywhere in the Plan 
Area to fund a package of mitigation measures. For developments of 50 or more 
homes, the natural recreational greenspace element will be provided in kind by the 
developer on land either on or directly adjoining the site. The 50-home threshold 
reflects Natural England advice and the practical limitations of achieving a suitable 
layout to meet recreational mitigation requirements on sites below this threshold. A 
financial contribution to the monitoring and recreational management elements of 
the GreenWay Project will also be required, and for the in-perpetuity management 
and maintenance of the mitigation land.
5.17  On all sites likely to contain 50 or more homes when fully implemented, alternative 
natural recreational greenspace (ANRG) must be available for use at the point of 
dwelling occupation, in proportion to the number of residents likely to occupy the 
homes completed.
5.18  Off-site contributions are not an acceptable alternative to the provision of on-site 
alternative natural recreational greenspace (ANRG) for development phases on 
sites likely to contain 50 or more homes, even if that phase is for less than 50 
dwellings. Provided that there is an appropriate design solution and enforceable 
landowner agreements are in place relating to the quantum, location and timing of 
provision, ANRG provision need not be on the planning application development 
parcel itself and may be located elsewhere within the wider development.
5.19  If pro-rata areas of ANRG are proposed on smaller individual sites within a larger 
development, these will only be acceptable provided that they are in general 
accordance with either the Strategic Site concept master plan, or are part of a 
suitable pre-agreed alternative masterplanning approach, and where delivery of 
the ANRG is concurrent with housing delivery. This is to ensure that appropriate 
mitigation measures for the full proposal are properly considered at the outset in 
both quantitative and design terms. 
31 https://www.newforest.gov.uk/article/1168/Planning-Policy-GuidanceNew Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  465.20  The design, management and maintenance of recreational mitigation areas 
is important to ensure that they are, and remain, safe and attractive areas for 
recreational walking and dog exercising. Working with Natural England the Council 
has established design guidelines and parameters for recreational mitigation 
land, to ensure it provides effective mitigation by creating attractive recreational 
walking and dog-walking routes and spaces. The design guidelines are set out 
in the Mitigation for Recreational Impacts SPD , and suitable arrangements 
are illustrated in the Strategic Site Allocation Policy  concept master plans, 
forming part of an integrated approach that will also meet Local Plan objectives to 
provide net gains for biodiversity and for landscape protection and enhancement 
(Policy STR1: Achieving sustainable development ; Policy ENV4: Landscape 
character and quality).
5.21  To be effective and used, recreational mitigation land must also be safe and 
appear safe to use. Woodland areas may be acceptable if under a high level of 
management, but densely wooded areas may not be attractive to users concerned 
about their personal safety.
5.22  It will not generally be appropriate to use for recreational mitigation purposes land 
that has existing species or habitat value, unless it can be demonstrated that its 
existing habitat value would not be compromised by increased public and dog 
access.
5.23  In some instances it will not be possible to provide recreational mitigation land on 
or adjoining sites of 50 or more homes, for example on redevelopment sites in 
existing built-up areas. In these circumstances the developer should put forward the 
required eight hectares per 1,000 population of land for recreational mitigation in an 
alternative location that will provide equivalent benefits to the settlement where the 
site is located, preferably in close proximity to the site. 
5.24  In all circumstances developers may put forward their own, alternative mitigation 
measures, provided that they fulfil the requirements of the Habitat Regulations, 
and are demonstrated to be sufficient by supporting evidence and justification 
including a project level Appropriate Assessment. Alternative proposals and 
supporting evidence must be submitted as part of the planning application to inform 
its determination, setting out enforceable delivery and in-perpetuity maintenance 
arrangements. Prior consultation with the Council and Natural England is 
recommended.
Bird Aware Solent
5.25  Bird Aware Solent is the ‘brand’ name of the Solent Recreation Mitigation 
Partnership, which comprises fifteen Solent local authorities including New Forest 
District, the New Forest National Park Authority, Natural England, the Royal Society 
for the Protection of Birds, the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, and the   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy47Chichester Harbour Conservancy. The strategy aims to manage disturbance of 
birds over-wintering in the Solent from increasing coastal recreational activities. It 
seeks to do this through a series of projects and management measures including 
a ranger service which actively encourage all coastal visitors to enjoy their visits 
in a responsible manner. To fund this work, contributions are required from new 
dwellings within 5.6km of the Solent SPA as shown in Figure 5.1. Details are set out 
in the Solent Recreation Mitigation Strategy  (2017)32.

Solent Mitigation AreaNew Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  485.27  There is potential for new development on land adjacent to or in close proximity 
to Solent waders and Brent Goose sites to impact on the ecological function of 
the Solent and Southampton Water SPA network. Proposals for development on 
terrestrial waders and Brent Goose sites located on land identified in the Solent 
Waders and Brent Goose Strategy33 should have due regard to the mitigation 
measures set out in that strategy.
Water quality and the mitigation of nutrient enrichment
The River Avon
5.28  Phosphorus concentrations in the River Avon have reached a level where adverse 
effects upon the integrity of the River Avon SAC cannot be ruled out. Natural 
England and the Environment Agency advice is that new development should 
therefore be phosphorus neutral to the River Avon, until a long-term solution 
is identified, for example through the OFWAT 2024 price review for water and 
wastewater service providers.
5.29  The Planning Authorities in the River Avon catchment working with Wessex Water, 
Natural England and the Environment Agency will identify suitable mitigation or off-
setting measures to enable development proposals to achieve phosphate neutrality, 
including an update of measures set out in the River Avon Nutrient Management 
Plan34.
The River Itchen and the Solent
5.30  Evidence35 suggests uncertainty as to whether or not housing development in 
southern Hampshire in the later part of the Plan period would be likely to have 
a significant adverse effect on the River Itchen and the Solent due to nutrient 
enrichment. Applying the precautionary principle, subsequent Natural England 
advice is that harmful effects cannot be ruled out from the development of additional 
dwellings, visitor or institutional overnight accommodation. In the longer term the 
situation may be resolved by future arrangements for water supply and wastewater 
treatment in south Hampshire, which have their own regulatory processes. Until 
any such arrangements are operational, new development in the Solent must 
achieve nitrate neutrality for both foul drainage and surface water run-off by other 
appropriate means, on- or off-site.
5.31  The Council will support the Environment Agency, Natural England, water 
companies and surrounding authorities in the development and implementation 
of solutions to achieve nitrate neutral development and projects which reduce

Hampshire (including NFDC)  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy49nutrient inputs to the Solent designated sites from wastewater discharges. 
Where necessary based on evidence of harmful impacts or by application of 
the precautionary principle, additional mitigation measures may be applied to 
developments that directly or indirectly discharge wastewater into the Solent.
Air Quality in the New Forest
5.32  Modelling of traffic emissions from cumulative traffic growth over the Plan period 
has identified potential for significant adverse effects of parts of the New Forest 
SPA and SAC from nitrogen deposition and ammonia, particularly near main road 
corridors through the New Forest in areas lacking screening woodlands.
5.33  There are uncertainties in the data, but the precautionary principle applies 
requiring a modest financial contribution from development to ongoing monitoring 
of the effects of traffic emissions on sensitive locations, to trigger management 
or mitigation measures and developer contributions to implement them if harmful 
effects are confirmed in the future.
5.34  If future air quality monitoring identifies that significant adverse effects are occurring 
or likely, legal agreements or other appropriate mechanisms will be put in place to 
ensure that homes subsequently permitted would be required to make reasonable 
and proportionate developer contributions for air quality management or mitigation.
The South West Hampshire Green Belt
5.35  The extent of the Green Belt in the Plan Area is shown on the Policies Map. It 
covers areas outside defined settlement boundaries in all of the South Coastal 
Towns sub-area, and all of the Avon Valley and Downlands sub-area to the south 
of Ringwood. It adjoins more extensive Green Belt areas in Dorset that preserve 
the openness of countryside around the Christchurch, Bournemouth and Poole 
conurbation.
5.36 National policy36 identifies that the Green Belt serves five purposes:
• to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas
• to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another
•  to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment
• to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns
•  to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and 
other urban land.
36 NPPF 2012 paragraph 80, NPPF 2019 paragraph 134New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  505.37  With new development focused on the edge of existing towns and villages, 
the spatial strategy also seeks to maintain the distinct identity of settlements. 
Continuing to maintain the Green Belt and gaps between settlements therefore 
forms part of the spatial strategy.  
5.38  The designation of Green Belt in the New Forest area first received ministerial 
support in 1960, although the South West Hampshire Green Belt was first formally 
designated by the Hampshire Structure Plan in 1983. The Hampshire Structure 
Plan Review (2000) removed from Green Belt areas that would become part of the 
then pending New Forest National Park, retaining the remaining Green Belt and re-
stating its purposes as follows in the context of the establishment of the New Forest 
National Park:
   “A Green Belt will be maintained in South West Hampshire south of Ringwood 
between the county boundary; coast and New Forest Heritage Area. Proposals for 
development within it will be subject to policies to check the unrestricted sprawl of 
large built-up areas; prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another and 
assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment.”37 
5.39  This Local Plan Review included the first full review38 in 2016 of the South West 
Hampshire Green Belt since the formation of the New Forest National Park, in 
recognition that there was unlikely to be sufficient, suitable development land to 
meet development needs unless the release of Green Belt land for development 
was considered. The 2016 review concluded that most of the Green Belt continues 
to serve the purposes of the Green Belt very well, but also identified some areas 
that made a weaker contribution to Green Belt purposes. Those areas making a 
weaker contribution that were also in appropriate locations for strategic housing 
development have been removed from the Green Belt.
 
Policy ENV2: The South West Hampshire Green Belt
The openness and permanence of the South West Hampshire Green Belt will 
be preserved with particular regard to its stated purposes and those of national 
policy for the Green Belt.
Development proposals in the Green Belt will be determined in accordance 
with national planning policy.

5.40  National policy is that the fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban 
sprawl by keeping land permanently open. The construction of new buildings is 
generally regarded as inappropriate development in Green Belt, with a limited range 
of exceptions39. Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green 
Belt and can only be considered in very special circumstances where the potential 
harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is 
clearly outweighed by other considerations. 
5.41  In line with exceptions set out in national policy for development in the Green Belt, 
the provision of green space for natural recreational mitigation and public open 
space is regarded as appropriate development in the Green Belt, provided that it is 
implemented in accordance with the requirements of Policy ENV1: Mitigating the 
impacts of development on International Nature Conservation sites  and any 
applicable Strategic Site Allocation Policy .
5.42  In terms of very special circumstances that may justify development in the Green 
Belt, the provision of affordable housing to meet the needs of local people that 
could not otherwise be provided for, may meet this test. This is provided that the 
housing developments are non-strategic in scale (less than 100 homes), and are 
bought forward in the Green Belt through a Neighbourhood Development Plan, 
a Community Right to Build Order or as a Community-led Housing Scheme in 
accordance with Policy HOU5: Rural housing exception sites and community-
led housing schemes . In such circumstances the land will remain in the Green 
Belt until the development is completed, but may be removed at the next Local Plan 
review.
Design quality and local distinctiveness
5.43  The Plan Area is characterised by generally high environmental quality with towns 
and villages set within attractive countryside with significant visual, recreational, 
heritage and ecological value. The qualities of the area and the sensitivities of its 
landscapes and habitats demand commensurate care and attention to quality in 
new development.
5.44  The objective of this policy is to create high-quality places that enhance local 
character and distinctiveness, that connect well to existing development, that offer 
a high-quality living environment for current and future residents, and also offer 
attractive green spaces and opportunities for wildlife. By achieving these objectives 
new development can contribute to achieving an environmental net gain, which in 
the context of the Plan Area is essential to achieving sustainable development.
39 See NPPF 2012 paragraphs 89-90, NPPF 2019 paragraphs 145-146New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  525.45  Most of the Local Plan Strategic Site Allocations are on the countryside edge 
of towns and villages. A significant proportion of the site allocations will bring 
developed areas closer to the edge of the New Forest National Park, and closer 
to areas of identified ecological significance. These are locations where over-
intensive or urbanised development forms are unlikely to be suitable or contextually 
appropriate, and where poorly designed development would have the potential 
to cause significant harm. National policy is that ‘planning permission should be 
refused for development of poor design that fails to take the opportunities available 
for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions’40. 
5.46  Whilst the primary focus of the Local Plan is on delivering housing, the principles of 
this policy are equally applicable to other forms of development.
 
Policy ENV3: Design quality and local distinctiveness
All development should achieve high quality design that contributes positively 
to local distinctiveness, quality of life and enhances the character and identity 
of the locality by creating buildings, streets, places and spaces that are:
•  Functional: well connected to surrounding uses, and logically laid out 
so that different elements work well together in a manner that is safe to 
access, easy to navigate, convenient to use and that makes effective use 
of both developed land and open spaces;
•  Appropriate: sympathetic to its environment and context, respecting and 
enhancing local distinctiveness, character and identity; and
• Attractive: visually appealing and enjoyable to be in.
New development will be required to:
i.  Create buildings, streets and spaces which are sympathetic to the 
environment and their context in terms of layout, landscape, scale, height, 
appearance and density and in relationship to adjoining buildings, spaces 
and landscape features;
ii.  Avoid unacceptable effects by reason of visual intrusion or overbearing 
impact, overlooking, shading, noise and light pollution or other adverse 
impacts on local character or residential amenity;
iii.  Create buildings, streets and spaces which are accessible to those with 
disabilities or of reduced mobility, that are safe and easy to navigate, and 
that minimise opportunities for anti-social and criminal behaviour or other 
public threats;
iv.  Integrate sufficient car and cycle parking spaces so that realistic needs 
are met in a manner that is not prejudicial to the character and quality of 
the street, highway safety, emergency or service access or to pedestrian 
convenience and comfort;
40 NPPF 2012 paragraph 64, NPPF 2019 paragraph 130  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy53v.  Incorporate design measures that improve resource efficiency and climate 
change resilience and reduce environmental impacts wherever they are 
appropriate and capable of being effective, such as greywater recycling 
and natural heating and cooling, and the use of Sustainable Drainage 
Systems (SuDS);
vi.  Provide appropriately designed green spaces including sufficient planting, 
and where applicable: provision for play, sports and natural green spaces 
for recreational mitigation; and
vii.  Enhance the sense of place by ensuring that buildings, streets and spaces 
are attractive to look at through good architecture, landscape and street 
design.

5.47  The Council has published a number of Design Statements, Local Distinctiveness 
Guides and Conservation Area Appraisals41 which will assist in identifying the 
features and characteristics of the Plan Area that are valued by local communities.
5.48  For residential developments, further guidance is provided in the Strategic Site 
Allocation Policies .
5.49  The use of Design and Access Statements  as a means of securing good quality 
design is strongly encouraged.
Landscape character and quality
5.50  Where development takes place the character of the landscape or townscape 
will inevitably change, especially if the land is currently countryside. The key to 
the achievement of a net environmental gain in landscape terms is to ensure that 
the change arising from development is as positive as it can be. By retaining and 
augmenting key landscape and townscape features, as part of creating a strong 
landscape framework for new development, the place created can have its own 
distinctive landscape character and quality whilst also relating well to its landscape 
context.

Policy ENV4: Landscape character and quality
Where development is proposed there is a requirement to retain and/or 
enhance the following landscape features and characteristics through sensitive 
design, mitigation and enhancement measures, to successfully integrate new 
development into the local landscape context:
i.  Features that contribute to a green infrastructure and distinctive character 
within settlements including the locally distinctive pattern and species 
composition of natural and historic features such as trees, hedgerows, 
woodlands, meadows, field boundaries, coastal margins, water courses 
and water bodies;
ii.  Features that screen existing development that would otherwise have an 
unacceptable visual impact;
iii.  Existing or potential wildlife corridors, footpath connections and other 
green links that do, or could, connect the site to form part of an integrated 
green infrastructure network;
iv.  The landscape setting of the settlement and the transition between the 
settlement fringe and open countryside or coast; 
v.  Important or locally distinctive views, topographical features and skylines; 
and
vi. Areas of tranquillity and areas of intrinsically dark skies.

5.51  The creation of a robust Green Infrastructure framework of spaces, trees, planted 
features, links, watercourses and corridors will be of fundamental importance to 
the character, quality and sustainability of new developments that take place in 
the Plan Area. The first step towards achieving this is to analyse and document 
the landscape qualities of the site within its wider setting using a recognised 
methodology, to underpin the design and masterplanning process.

application of Policy ENV4 that were identified by Saved Policy DW-E12 of the 
New Forest District Local Plan First Alteration (2005).

Policies set out how and where the objectively assessed housing need for 10,420 
homes will be provided in the Plan period. The policies of this chapter provide 
guidance on the types of homes to be provided to meet identified community needs, 
including for parts of the community with particular needs.
6.2  For policies on householder development and other non-strategic housing policy 
matters see also the Saved Policies (listed at Appendix A) and the relevant 
Supplementary Planning Documents and other published guidance.43  
Housing type, size, tenure and choice
6.3  To sustain a mixed and balanced community requires the provision of a variety 
of housing to rent and to buy, to meet the different needs of the community. In 
addition to responding to market demand, this will include providing homes that 
are affordable for households on moderate and lower incomes, homes for families 
with children, couples, single person households and homes designed to meet the 
needs of older people and people with disabilities.
Policy HOU1: Housing type, size, tenure and choice
The strategy is to ensure that all residential development helps to address the 
diversity of housing needs of local people at all stages of life by providing a 
mix and choice of homes by type, size, tenure and cost.
The policy objectives are to improve the diversity of housing choice, and to 
achieve an overall balance of housing provision in general accordance with 
housing needs evidence. Each development should contribute appropriately 
to improving housing diversity wherever possible, taking into account the 
location, size and characteristics of the site, the form of development proposed 
and the viability of the scheme.

6.4  Policy HOU1 seeks the provision of a greater range and quantity of the following 
types and tenures in appropriate locations: 
•  Entry level and other lower cost forms of market housing, including flats and 
smaller houses, to buy or for private rent

standards
•  Homes which provide specialised care on-site including sheltered and extra 
care housing
•  Homes attractive to active older households and down-sizers, including 
bungalows and smaller homes with higher accessibility and space standards
• Plots for self- and custom-build housing, including for travellers
• Affordable housing in accordance with Policy HOU2
6.5  Evidence of housing need in the Plan Area will be updated over time and 
development proposals will be assessed in light of the most robust and up-to-date 
information. Current evidence44 summarised in Figure 6.1 suggests a need for 
a greater proportion of new stock to be smaller-to-medium-sized homes. Larger 
homes continue to form part of future new home supply, but the existing housing 
stock of the Plan Area is predominantly 3 and 4-bedroom homes, and turnover 
within the existing stock will continue to be the main source of supply for meeting 
future demand for larger homes.  
1-2 bed 3 bed 4+ bed
Affordable rental homes 60-70% 25-30% 5-10%
Affordable home ownership 55-65% 30-35% 5-10%
Market homes 30-40% 40-45% 20-25%
Figure 6.1: Indicative need for different sizes and tenures of home45
6.6  Provision of more, smaller homes will help to meet the needs of newly forming 
households, including those not eligible for affordable housing. Smaller homes 
should be designed to be affordable and to meet the needs of newly forming 
households, or to be attractive to ‘down-sizers’ when they no longer need their 
family home (see Policy HOU3: Residential accommodation for older people ). 
Provision of smaller homes could also include homes designed for private rent in 
appropriate locations, as private rented homes play an important role in meeting 
needs for lower cost market housing for lower income residents who are unlikely to 
qualify for affordable housing and are unable to purchase a home46.

Forest Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2014 (Table 2)
46 Housing Affordability (JGC 2017 Fig 3.5 - Fig 3.7)  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy596.7  Based on demographic evidence there is an element of need for one-bedroom 
homes. One-bedroom homes are considered more likely to meet both need 
and occupier preferences where they are provided either as private rental 
accommodation, or as low-cost or affordable extra-care accommodation47. For 
home buyers and providers of affordable housing, two-bedroom homes offer much 
more flexibility for changing needs.
6.8  Strategic housing site allocations are large enough to accommodate areas of 
different character and density within them, and are expected to include a broad mix 
of new homes more closely corresponding to Figure 6.1. Large new developments 
of predominantly 3-4 bedroom homes would not meet the requirements of this 
policy. 
6.9  The viability of housing sites of 100 or more homes has been tested on the basis 
that the requirement for housing diversification would be met alongside and in 
addition to the provision of affordable housing48. Viability testing included that 
around 5% of the market housing would be provided in the form of a modest 
2-bedroom entry level or starter homes offered at a 20-25% discount to open 
market value.
6.10  Viability testing also included the provision of smaller bungalows. On the rural edge 
of settlements where lower densities may be necessary for reasons of contextual 
appropriateness or landscape sensitivity, bungalows and self-build plots are a form 
of development that may be especially suitable.
6.11  There is an element of demand49 for self and custom-build housing opportunities 
in the Plan Area. This is a form of housing provision national policy seeks to 
encourage to help diversify housing supply. However, the challenges in meeting the 
general housing needs of the local population are such that the Local Plan cannot 
respond to all self-build aspirations and the development industry already offers 
home buyers some scope for home customisation or custom build. The particular 
aim of this part of the policy is therefore to address the lack of supply of moderately 
priced, serviced land parcels sufficient for local people wishing to build an average 
family home, either by self-build or by contracting their own independent builder.
6.12  Where serviced self-build plots are provided, legal agreements or other appropriate 
mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that for a reasonable period, the first 
opportunity to purchase is offered to persons already on the New Forest District

Affordable housing
6.13.  Market housing is less affordable in the Plan Area than in surrounding districts and 
a high proportion of the total identified need for housing is for affordable housing: 
361 homes per annum representing 69% of the total annual housing requirement51.
6.14  To address the housing needs of those unable to afford market housing, including 
workers providing essential community services, a significant proportion of the 
housing built will need to be affordable housing. Under current 52Government 
funding arrangements, most of the affordable housing that will be provided in the 
future will be built by developers as part of a market housing development without 
external funding support. The Council has therefore considered the economic 
viability of development53 in setting the affordable housing target. The analysis 
takes into account the policy requirements of this Local Plan including habitat 
mitigation, and the developer contributions that are necessary to provide sufficient 
community facilities and infrastructure, whilst also providing a reasonable financial 
return to both land owners and developers. The need to ensure that housing 
development is viable means that not all affordable or specialised housing needs 
can be met. 
6.15  The provision of social rented affordable housing is a high Council priority , and the 
Council will continue to be a significant provider of social rented housing. Around 
30% of households cannot afford to pay more than ‘social rents’, a social housing 
tenure which plays an important role for households, including families on single 
low incomes that are unable to afford the higher ‘affordable rents’54.
6.16  As at 2018 National Planning Policy states that developments below certain size 
thresholds are not required to provide affordable housing.

Policy HOU2: Affordable housing
There is a requirement for all new developments of 11 or more dwellings, or of 
more than 1,000 sqm gross internal area of residential floorspace, to provide 
affordable housing as follows:
i.  In Totton and the Waterside area, the target is for 35% of new homes to be 
affordable housing.
ii.  In the rest of the Plan Area, the target is for 50% of new homes to be 
affordable housing.
iii.  The tenure mix target is to provide 70% of affordable homes for rent, 
split equally between social and affordable rent, and 30% intermediate or 
affordable home ownership tenures including shared ownership.
iv.  Affordable housing provided should be indistinguishable in appearance 
from the market housing on site, and distributed evenly across the site.
The viability of development will be taken into account in applying this policy 
as set out in Policy IMPL1: Developer contributions .
Supporting text
6.17  Where there is a particular local need social rented housing will be sought in the 
form of family housing, with commensurate adjustments to the size, tenures and 
mix of other forms of affordable housing to be provided, to achieve equivalent 
development viability.
6.18  It is anticipated that most intermediate/affordable home ownership products will 
be in the form of shared ownership housing, especially in higher value areas. 
Discounted or low-cost home ownership products will be accepted as affordable 
housing if a lower quartile income household could afford to purchase the home 
at the offered price with a 10% deposit and a mortgage of four times household 
income. ‘Starter homes’ at a discount to market value are unlikely to qualify as 
affordable housing55, but can assist in meeting demand for entry level market 
housing.
6.19  Affordable housing tenure mix flexibility will also be applied where a development 
is primarily providing a specialised form of housing such as build-for-rent or certain 
forms of older persons housing, where the provision of some forms or tenures 
of affordable housing would be incompatible with the nature or purpose of the 
development.
55 Housing Affordability, JGC 2017, paragraph 42: for a 2-bedroom home a market price discount 
of 44% is estimated as being necessary to make the home as affordable as the private rental housing 
equivalentNew Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  626.20  Whilst the affordable housing target will be viable in most circumstances, especially 
on previously undeveloped land, variations to the affordable housing tenure mix 
or affordable housing target will be supported where it is demonstrated to be 
necessary.
6.21  Variations are more likely to be demonstrably justifiable on previously developed 
land, and in some circumstances on smaller greenfield sites in lower value areas. 
It is also recognised that the estimated costs of necessary infrastructure or facilities 
may change or, exceptionally, unforeseen circumstances may arise which make 
delivery of the full affordable housing requirement unviable. Where there are no 
other mechanisms available to improve the viability of a housing development to a 
fair profit level, the Council will consider varying the affordable housing tenure mix, 
and if necessary the timing of delivery, before considering whether a reduced level 
of affordable housing provision would be acceptable. In exceptional circumstances, 
consideration may be given to alternative mechanisms to secure the equivalent 
delivery of affordable housing off-site. 
6.22  In such circumstances it will be for the developer to clearly demonstrate why any 
exception from the policy is necessary, and to provide this information as part of 
the planning application to inform its determination. This will be tested using an 
economic viability assessment toolkit which will examine specific site viability , 
based on ‘open book’ information relating to the costs and values of that particular 
development that explains and justifies any departures from standard development

6.23  The resident population of the Plan Area is ageing and living longer, and the 
number of people aged 75 and over is projected to increase by 65% (12,800) in 
the Plan period, and by 2036 almost half the Plan Area population is projected 
to be aged 55 and over56. The majority of older residents will continue to live in 
mainstream housing. Many will prefer to remain in their existing homes and to live 
independently for as long as they are able to. New technologies and in-home care 
may help them to do so. 
6.24  Whilst turnover in and renewal of the existing stock of specialist older persons 
accommodation will help to meet some future needs, there remains a significant 
need to provide new specialist accommodation during the Local Plan period, 
especially for the very elderly. Based on national prevalence rates of health and 
other factors affecting the ability of local residents to live independently57, homes 
56 NFDC Demographic Projections, JGC 2017, Appendix 2 (projection 2)
57 Housing LIN  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy63designed to be suitable for the changing needs of older people, including sheltered 
and extra care housing may need to comprise around a fifth of the new homes 
provided in the Plan period. Whilst this figure is best treated as indicative, such 
provision can help local people to continue to live independently in more suitable 
accommodation if they wish to, freeing up existing family houses for others. Some 
homes designed to meet the needs of older people are also likely to be suitable for 
households with impaired mobility or some other specialist care needs.
6.25  There are around 1,600 care home bed spaces in the Plan Area, sufficient 
in quantitative terms to meet the needs of the current population, and to 
accommodate needs in the first five years of the Plan period (based on national 
prevalence rates). However, the current models of care home service provision and 
funding appear likely to change in the near future. Accordingly, in the first five years 
of the Plan period the highest priorities in providing specialist accommodation for 
older people are:
•  to increase the level of self-contained extra care housing units that provide a 
higher level of support to enable continued independent living; and
•  to encourage the renewal or replacement of general residential care home 
stock to better serve more specialised and intensive support needs, such as 
providing dementia care or end-of-life hospices.
6.26  In the medium to longer term the growth in population aged 75+, and in particular 
aged 85+, will generate need for additional care home bed spaces including 
specialised nursing homes58 that address specific local needs not met by existing 
facilities.

Policy HOU3: Residential accommodation for older people
The strategy is to enable older people to continue to live independently by:
•  Taking a positive and flexible approach to the adaption of homes where 
it would enable the occupier to continue to live independently, or for the 
occupier to accommodate a friend or family member requiring care;
•  Ensuring that new homes are built to standards that are capable of 
adaption to meet the future needs of older people and others with care 
needs; and
•  Ensuring that new housing provision includes housing types designed to 
be suitable for older people.
Care homes (Use Class C2) for older people and others will be supported on 
sites in existing care home use, and in other locations suitable for residential 
use provided that there is an identifiable local need for registered care 
provision that cannot reasonably be met by existing care home facilities in the 
Local Plan sub-area.
Supporting text
6.27  Where specialist self-contained accommodation for older people is provided, 
it will be important to ensure that residents benefit from a high level of amenity 
and shared community spaces to encourage companionship and social activities 
whilst enabling residents to live independently as far as possible. For example, 
by ensuring the development is located close to local facilities and services and 
includes information technology such as high speed broadband to enable remote 
access to support and services. Specialist older persons’ accommodation should 
also include features such as level access without steps, increased storage 
including for mobility vehicles, a ground floor bath/shower room, a guest bedroom 
for visiting family, stairwells that can accommodate a stair lift and low maintenance 
garden areas with outdoor seating. See Policy IMPL2: Development standards 
for accessibility requirements.
6.28  On-site provision of affordable housing will be sought on sheltered and extra care 
housing schemes, also in the form of sheltered and extra care housing, having 
regard to the viability implications of any communal or care facilities and services 
provided.
Care homes (Use Class C2)
6.29  Given the limited supply of land suitable for residential use in the Plan Area, it is 
not appropriate to accommodate wider market demand for commercial care home 
development if it does not specifically address a local need not met by existing 
facilities in the Plan Area. Where care home development is proposed based on   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy65meeting specific local needs, an operator commitment to provide residential care 
to clients referred by the District Council or Hampshire County Council will be given 
positive weight.
6.30  Exceptions will be made where primarily self-contained retirement housing 
developments, include an element of residential care accommodation to provide 
full care to residents who may need it on a short-term basis before returning to 
independent living, or to ease the transition to more specialised forms of care when 
appropriate.
6.31  Affordable housing contributions will not be sought for residential care homes that 
fall within Use Class C2.
Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople
6.32  There are historic links between gypsies and the New Forest area. Gypsies and 
travellers make up a small but higher-than-average proportion of the Plan Area 
population. National policy59 is to ensure fair and equal treatment for travellers, in 
a way that facilitates the traditional and nomadic way of life while respecting the 
interests of the settled community.
6.33  The Hampshire Consortium Gypsy, Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
Accommodation Assessment  (GTAA, May 2017) indicates a confirmed need in 
the Plan Area as follows:
•  One additional permanent pitch for gypsies and travellers, arising after 2031;
• Current need for four plots for travelling showpeople; and that
•  Some additional needs may arise from traveller households that did not 
participate in the assessment survey.

Policy HOU4: Gypsies, travellers and travelling showpeople
Needs for gypsy and traveller pitches and for plots for travelling showpeople, 
who continue to live a travelling lifestyle, will be met by existing planning 
permissions, site allocations and a combination of the following:
i.  Regularising and/or permitting extensions to existing sites in appropriate 
locations;
ii.  Permitting applications for new traveller pitches or showpeople plots in 
appropriate locations for residential development;
iii.  Addressing any remaining unmet needs through the Local Plan Review 
Part Two, in consultation with travelling communities.

6.34  Saved Policy TOT10 of the Local Plan Part 2 (2014) allocates land at Little 
Testwood Farm for traveller pitches. It has capacity for around eight new pitches.
6.35  The needs of travellers who no longer live a travelling lifestyle will be 
accommodated within existing housing allocations. Development proposals 
for those who no longer travel but wish to live in a culturally specific form of 
accommodation will also be assessed using the criteria set out in part (ii) of the 
policy. General restrictions on residential development in the open countryside, 
including in the Green Belt, apply equally to travellers, but where in accordance 
with Policy HOU5: Rural housing exception sites and community-led housing 
schemes  proposals may be considered in appropriate locations as a form of self-
build housing or as a rural housing exception site.
6.36  The requirements of Policy ENV1: Mitigating the impact of development on 
International Nature Conservation sites apply to traveller sites.
Rural housing exception sites and community-led housing 
schemes
6.37  In accordance with Policy STR3: The strategy for locating new development , 
residential development is not normally permitted in the countryside i.e. outside 
settlement boundaries. However problems of access to affordable housing are often 
greatest in the rural parts of the Plan Area, and as a consequence local people, 
particularly the young, may have no alternative but to leave their community to find 
housing.
6.38  To address these issues the Council will make an exception to controls on 
development outside settlement boundaries to permit new, small-scale housing   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy67development, subject to strict criteria to ensure that it meets an identified local 
affordable housing need which would not otherwise be met.
6.39  As a potential delivery mechanism the Council is supportive of a community-led 
approach, where communities identify and address the housing needs of their own 
community locally. Community-led housing is housing designed and managed by 
local people and built by or for them to meet the needs of their community on a 
not for private profit basis. The community-led housing group may acquire land by 
purchase (by the community), or by gift. The homes can be rented or sold to local 
people at rates that remain affordable, or sold to create income for the benefit of the 
community.
Policy HOU5: Rural housing exception sites and community-led 
housing schemes
New residential development will only be permitted on suitable sites outside 
the defined settlement boundaries where it is to meet an identified need of 
local people for affordable housing to meet local needs which cannot be 
provided in any other way.
The Council will support and encourage housing, and other ancillary or related 
development proposed alongside housing, by a qualifying Community-led 
Housing group on land it owns or controls, where the development has the 
support of the local community and is proposed to meet the identified local 
needs of the community it relates to.
Suitable sites will be located within or adjoining a settlement which either 
provides a range of local services and facilities, or is (or can be made) safely 
accessible to a larger settlement nearby which provides a wider range of 
services and facilities. The District Council will work with local communities 
to identify suitable sites, which may also be identified through Neighbourhood 
Plans.
Legal undertakings or other appropriate mechanisms will be required to ensure 
that the benefits of the scheme to the local area and/or specified community 
group are clearly defined and legally protected in perpetuity.
Supporting text
6.40  Rural housing exception sites should be supported in principle by the relevant town 
or parish council and the local community based on a housing needs assessment 
including the following information:
i.  The present housing circumstances and income levels of those considered to 
be in need; related to local house prices and rent levels;
ii.  The connection of the likely occupants with the village or nearby village; andNew Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  68iii.  The type and size of dwellings that would meet their requirements (which may 
include including self-build housing).
6.41  Occupancy will be restricted to local people in a manner that should be clearly 
defined, and will usually mean someone who lives or works in, or who has strong 
family connections with, the settlement or parish in which the scheme is proposed.
6.42  Exception sites to meet the needs of more isolated rural communities will tend to 
be more reliant upon access by car, but should include measures to improve safe 
access by foot and cycle wherever practicable.
6.43  Community-led housing is based on the following core principles60. Groups that can 
demonstrate that they meet these principles will comply with the policy:
i.  Meaningful community engagement throughout the process, including 
community participation in making the key decisions about what should be built 
and for whom;
ii.  Once developed, the local community group or organisation owns, manages or 
stewards the homes and in a manner of their choosing;
iii.  A requirement that the benefits of the scheme to the local area and/or specified 
community group are clearly defined and legally protected in perpetuity .
6.44  Community Land Trusts (CLT) are a form of community-led housing. The Localism 
Act 2011 enables CLTs to bring forward development through a Community Right 
to Build Order backed by community support in a referendum, as well as by the 
standard planning application process.
6.45.  Binding arrangements must be made to ensure that the housing provided will 
be managed and made available specifically to meet the identified local housing 
needs, and will remain affordable for both current and future occupiers. The precise 
nature of these arrangements may vary but will most often be achieved through a 
legal agreement.

Employment land and development
7.1  As set out in Policy STR6: Sustainable economic growth , the use and re-
use of existing employment sites, in combination with additional employment 
land provision within Strategic Site Allocations, is sufficient to meet identified 
employment needs over the Plan period.
7.2  Local Plan employment objectives will therefore be met in part by making effective 
use and re-use of existing employment sites, to help maintain a sufficient supply of 
employment land and premises to meet future needs in suitable locations.
7.3  To accommodate any additional or operator-specific employment needs that may 
arise, this policy also provides criteria facilitating and supporting suitable new 
employment development in other environmentally appropriate locations, subject to 
appropriate controls.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  70 
Policy ECON1: Employment land and development
i.  Proposals for the development, redevelopment or intensification of 
employment uses will be supported on existing employment sites, and on 
other suitable sites within defined town centre boundaries, provided that:
a.  Safe and suitable access can be provided for pedestrians, cyclists and 
for the types of vehicles likely to visit the site; and
b.  The proposal would not unacceptably impact on the environment, the 
landscape, or on the amenity of nearby residents; and
c.  The proposal would not have a significant detrimental impact on the 
operation of other businesses in the locality; and
d.  the use proposed is proportionate in scale for the location with regard 
to the settlement hierarchy
ii.  In other parts of the built-up areas of settlements not in current 
employment use, employment uses will be supported provided that, in 
addition to meeting criteria (a) – (d):
e.  The use proposed is small-scale and would not generate levels of 
noise, visitor numbers or traffic movements materially higher than 
those of residential use, especially outside of normal working hours.
iii.  Outside of built-up area boundaries and areas covered by site-specific 
policies, new employment development will be considered where, in 
addition to meeting criteria (a), (b) and (c):
f.  The proposal is in accordance with Saved Policy CS21 Rural 
Economy; or
g.  To enable the establishment or growth of a high value-added or 
knowledge-based business proposal that can demonstrate a specific 
need for the location and that it would have a low environmental 
impact.

7.4  Employment sites comprise land in or last in employment use, or with a Local 
Plan allocation or planning permission for employment use (including where the 
planning permission is lapsed or subject to a legal agreement which has not been 
completed).
7.5  Employment uses comprise: industrial, office, business, storage and distribution 
uses falling within classes B1, B2 and B8 of the Town and Country Planning (Use 
Classes) Order 1987 as amended, and ‘sui generis’ uses of a similar character.
7.6  High value-added or knowledge-based business employment activities are defined 
in the glossary at Appendix B, and to be of low impact are likely to be predominantly 
office-based activities of a professional, financial, digital and information technology ,   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy71management, consultancy, design, creative or similar nature. They may also 
involve light industrial activities that are not reliant on either or both of, daily 
HGV movements or production processes that could generate levels of noise or 
emissions likely to cause amenity disturbance beyond the site curtilage, or to cause 
environmental harm.
7.7  In applying the policy criterion (g) proposals should first consider any alternative 
employment sites and premises in whichever of the three sub-areas of the Plan 
Area the operator is seeking to locate in. Proposals of 2,500 sqm gross internal 
area or more should additionally consider alternative sites and premises in the full 
Plan Area. Evidence that specific operational needs can only be met by the location 
proposed will be taken into account.
7.8  Planning conditions or other appropriate measures will be applied to employment 
developments in a manner proportionate to the sensitivity of the location, if and 
where they are necessary to ensure that an employment use does not have an 
unacceptably adverse impact on the environment, highways and pedestrian safety, 
residential amenity or the operations of existing businesses. These measures may 
include but are not limited to: hours of operation, timing and routeing of heavy 
goods vehicles, and the control of discharges and emissions including noise and 
light (if not already controlled or licensed by other bodies).
Retention of employment sites
7.9  In addition to supporting appropriate new employment development, Local Plan 
employment objectives will in part be met by ensuring that existing suitable and 
viable employment sites in the Plan Area are retained wherever possible. The 
Government has introduced a range of permitted development rights61 that allow for 
greater flexibility of change of use. These include rights that will impact on existing 
employment uses, by allowing some commercial, office, light industrial, storage/
distribution and agricultural premises to be converted to housing without the need 
for a formal planning permission to establish the change of use.
7.10  The Business Needs and Commercial Property Market Assessment62 states 
that the commercial market in the Plan Area for business, industrial and distribution 
uses is characterised by rising take-up, reducing availability and low levels of 
vacancy. The majority of employment sites and premises provide valuable local 
employment opportunities and accommodation for local businesses in the Plan 
Area, which should be retained wherever possible.
61 At the time of adoption these were set out in the Town and Country Planning (General 
Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted 
Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2016
62 Business Needs and Commercial Property Market Assessment (2017)New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  727.11  Employment sites or premises that are no longer attractive to potential employment 
occupiers in their current state, or are not capable of being made so through 
redevelopment, are better considered for alternative uses to ensure the efficient use 
of previously developed land. Suitable opportunities for redevelopment or change of 
use will be identified in the Brownfield Land Register63, updated annually.
Policy ECON2: Retention of employment sites and consideration of 
alternative uses
Employment sites that remain suitable for employment use will be retained 
for continued employment use wherever possible. Other uses that require 
planning permission will be supported provided that:
i.  The primary purpose of the use is to provide a supporting service to 
businesses or to the workforce in the local area; or
ii.  For other non-employment uses, it is demonstrated that the employment 
site is no longer suitable or viable for continued employment use, by 
submission of proportionate evidence showing that:
a.  The condition of the site or building renders it unsuitable for its 
present or any other realistic and appropriate employment use, and it 
would not be viable to refurbish or redevelop the site for an alternative 
employment use; and/or
b.  The site has been actively but unsuccessfully marketed for 
employment use on unrestricted terms fair to potential occupiers and 
at a realistic price, for a minimum period of twelve consecutive months 
prior to the date at which the planning application for an alternative 
use was submitted.
And in addition to either (i) or (ii)
iii.  The alternative use would not have a significant detrimental impact on the 
operation of other businesses in the local area.
Supporting text
7.12  Policy ECON2 seeks to retain existing employment sites and premises in 
employment use wherever it is it is reasonable and possible to do so. Given the 
extent of permitted development rights, a marketing period of twelve months for 
sites that do not benefit from permitted development rights will help to ensure 
that employment re-use and re-development options are properly tested and 
not unduly affected by short-term market fluctuations. Marketing should include 
notices visible to passing traffic at the site location, and advertisements in relevant 
commercial property press (including online press). The property should be offered 
63 https://www.newforest.gov.uk/article/1167/Brownfield-Land-Register  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy73at a price commensurate with its condition, location and permitted use, and without 
restrictions that would unreasonably limit its attractiveness to potential occupiers. 
Marketing evidence should document all these details and provide a log of 
enquiries and offers made by potential occupiers.
7.13  The policy identifies that certain types of alternative use are acceptable on 
employment sites without meeting the requirements of criterion (ii). Such uses can 
help to make business sites more attractive to incoming firms and can improve the 
quality of the working environment for employees. Supporting services may include 
crèche facilities, training, meetings space and conference facilities, restaurants/
cafes, recreation and sports facilities, and medical facilities. The policy test that will 
be applied is whether their primary purpose is to provide a supporting service to 
businesses or to the workforce in the locality, rather than servicing general demand 
or passing trade.
7.14  Proposals for other non-employment uses that require planning permission on 
existing employment sites will only be considered where the site marketing criteria 
in this policy have been met, unless there are other significant and specific material 
considerations in the public or local community interest for the alternative use in the 
location proposed, and these considerations outweigh the employment objectives 
of this policy.
Port development
The Port of Southampton and Dibden Bay
7.15  The international deep-sea gateway Port of Southampton is of national and 
international economic importance and plays a central role in the economy of 
southern Hampshire. The main landside operational area is located within the 
City of Southampton, but the port operator Associated British Ports (ABP) owns a 
significant land holding within New Forest District at Dibden Bay .
7.16  Dibden Bay adjoins the New Forest National Park. The reclaimed land area is 
designated the Dibden Bay Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The Dibden 
Bay foreshore is part of the Hythe to Calshot SSSI, forming part of the Solent and 
Southampton Water Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar site.
7.17  In their Draft Port of Southampton Master Plan64 (2016) ABP conclude from 
trade and shipping volume forecasts that the Port of Southampton will need to grow 
within the lifetime of this Local Plan. The master plan indicated65 ABP’s intention to 
64 www.southamptonvts.co.uk/port_information/commercial/southampton_master_plan/
65 www.southamptonvts.co.uk/port_information/commercial/southampton_master_plan/New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  74seek consent for port expansion onto Dibden Bay and that they are likely to make 
an application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for port use at Dibden 
Bay during the lifespan of this Local Plan. It is common ground between ABP and 
the District Council that ABP land at Dibden Bay is the only area of land physically 
capable of accommodating a significant expansion of the Port of Southampton.
7.18  A future application for port use at Dibden Bay would be likely to be of a scale66 
that would qualify as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project  (NSIP) 
under the 2008 Planning Act and thereby require an application to be submitted 
for a Development Consent Order. It would fall to the Planning Inspectorate rather 
than the District Council to consider a NSIP for port development and to make a 
recommendation to the Secretary of State whether a Development Consent Order 
should be made.
7.19  In considering a NSIP application for port development, the decision maker would 
first consider whether the proposal is in accordance with relevant national policy , 
including that for ports. If in accordance with government policy objectives, the 
decision maker would then weigh the suggested benefits, including the economic 
benefits and the contribution that the scheme may make to the national, regional 
or more local need for the proposed infrastructure, against anticipated adverse 
impacts, including cumulative impacts.
7.20  In cases where nationally significant infrastructure development would affect a 
protected habitat, and in the absence of alternative solutions, the decision-maker 
may need to consider whether there are any imperative reasons of overriding public 
interest (IROPI) in allowing the development to proceed.
7.21  The Secretary of State would make the final decision whether or not to issue 
consent. In the event that a Development Consent Order is made by the 
Secretary of State, it would most likely fall to the District Council to discharge any 
requirements imposed in the Order (broadly equivalent to planning conditions).
Marchwood Port
7.22  Marchwood Port has been used as a sea mounting centre for the movement of 
troops and equipment since 1943, and is also extensively used as a berth by the 
Royal Fleet Auxiliary in support of the Royal Navy. The port was identified and 
safeguarded for port and port-related use in the previous Local Plan.
7.23  In 2017 the Ministry of Defence awarded Solent Gateway a 35-year concession to 
manage the military movements through the port whilst also opening the site for 
commercial port use. The landside area benefits from an active railhead and lies to 
66 NSIP thresholds for port use are set out in Part 3 Section 24(3) of the Planning Act 2008  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy75the north of Dibden Bay. The site and its foreshore have no international or national 
ecological designations, but it is adjacent to the designated SSSI, SPA and Ramsar 
sites covering Dibden Bay and its foreshore. Any proposal would therefore need 
to demonstrate in a Habitats Regulations Assessment of the proposal that it would 
not have an adverse effect on the integrity of any International Nature Conservation 
sites, including on the adjacent Solent and Southampton Water SPA and Ramsar 
site. The site also abuts smaller locally designated Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC).
The role of the Local Plan in relation to port development
7.24  Marchwood Port is an established facility and the Local Plan needs to consider its 
additional potential now that it is also available for commercial as well as military 
use (see Policy ECON3: Marchwood Port ).
7.25  The position in relation to Dibden Bay as a site for potential future port expansion 
is very different to the position in relation to Marchwood Port. Given that the scale 
of port development envisaged by the landowner at Dibden Bay is likely to be 
nationally significant, it is not appropriate for the Local Plan itself to take a position 
on the merits or otherwise of proposed port development. These are matters for the 
NSIP process.
7.26  In relation to potential nationally significant infrastructure projects, it is the 
appropriate role of the local planning authority to seek the best outcome for 
the District and in particular for directly affected communities, if significant port 
development is consented. As part of the examination of a NSIP the Council would 
submit a Local Impact Report to the examiner, giving details of the likely positive 
and negative impacts of the proposed development on the local area and its 
communities (see Policy ECON4: Port Development at Dibden Bay).
7.27  Matters a local impact report would need to address are set out in Figure 7.2 below 
Policies ECON3 and ECON4.
Other Local Plan considerations
7.28  Both the Marchwood Port site and ABP land holdings at Dibden Bay include 
significant land areas, respectively about 90 and 400 hectares that could 
accommodate a wide range of supporting uses and infrastructure (subject to 
obtaining the necessary consents). ABP also own large parts of the Marchwood 
Industrial Estate to the north of Marchwood Port. At this early stage there is 
no clearly identifiable need to make further land allocations for supporting 
development, infrastructure or consequential economic or other growth.
7.29  Hythe and Dibden Parish is a designated area for Neighbourhood Plan-making 
purposes.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  767.30  In the event that a consent for port use at Dibden Bay is given, the Council will 
initiate a review of the Local Plan in whole or in part to address the implications of 
major port expansion, including wider engagement with the Partnership for South 
Hampshire, Hampshire County Council and other relevant parties through the Duty 
to Cooperate (or equivalent future bodies and mechanisms) to address strategic 
and cross boundary implications.
Policy ECON3: Marchwood Port
Land at Marchwood Port (as defined on the Policies Map and illustrated in 
Figure 7.1) is safeguarded for port and port-related uses. The Council will 
work co-operatively with the operators to enable the effective and efficient use 
of the site and port facility for commercial, economic and local employment 
generating purposes whilst:
i.  Ensuring the effective functioning of the transport network including new 
highway provision or improvements if required;
ii.  Avoiding where possible and mitigating where necessary any harmful 
impacts on the environment;
iii.  Avoiding unacceptable impacts on the local communities and the health, 
safety and amenity of local residents, including from air pollution, noise, 
light or other disturbance from operational activity, road and freight 
movements; and
iv.  Minimising where possible and mitigating where necessary adverse 
impacts on the wider countryside and landscape, including the New Forest 
National Park.
Any non-port-related proposals must be compatible with the port and port-
related activity and not prejudice the effective utilisation of the port and rail 
facilities of the site.
Should proposals reach the scale to trigger the NSIP process, the Council will 
prepare a Local Impact Report to address the matters (i) – (iv) above as part of 
addressing the Local Impact Report considerations set out in Figure 7.2.
   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy77 
Policy ECON4: Port development at Dibden Bay
If a Development Consent Order is sought for port operations in the Dibden 
Bay area (as identified on the Policies Map and illustrated in Figure 7.1) the 
Council will work to seek the best outcome for the District and directly affected 
communities. This will be achieved by preparing a Local Impact Report 
addressing the matters identified in Figure 7.2 to set out the likely impact of 
the proposed development on the District and its communities, and for any 
negative impacts to identify how and to what extent they may be resolved, 
mitigated or compensated for.
In the event a Development Consent Order for port use at Dibden Bay is 
made by the Secretary of State, the Council will give particular weight to the 
following considerations in determining subsequent planning applications or 
in discharging any conditional requirements imposed in the Order, insofar as 
the issues or impacts arising are additional to those already considered in the 
Development Consent Order process:
i. improving local business and employment opportunities;
ii.  ensuring the effective functioning of the transport network including new 
highway provision or improvements if required;
iii.  avoiding where possible and mitigating where necessary any harmful 
impacts on the environment;

7.31  Proposals which make effective use of the port rail connection for freight movement, 
with appropriate regard to residential amenity, will be encouraged. This includes 
the potential for a future rail freight connection to Dibden Bay , which should not 
be precluded or sterilised by development at Marchwood Port unless shown to be 
unnecessary or unachievable on technical or viability grounds.
7.32  If a Development Consent Order is sought for port operations at Dibden Bay or 
Marchwood Port the Council would seek and expect to work through the Local 
Impact Report issues with the port development promoter prior to submission of the 
application for development consent, and would seek to agree potential solutions 
or establish common ground where possible. As part of this process the Council New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  78would also seek to work collaboratively with all relevant port, transport and local 
authorities to ensure that freight movements and the logistics/operations of port 
access are directly managed to minimise the impact on the highway network, local 
communities and the environment.
7.33  The Hampshire County Council Waterside Interim Transport Policy67 is that any 
port-related freight vehicles should be accommodated through the most direct route 
avoiding traffic generation on routes through residential areas, gaining access to 
the M27 at junction 2 via the A326.
7.34  Development proposals will require a development-specific Habitats Regulations 
Assessment.

nationally significant scale of port development in the Solent watersideNew Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  80Retail development and other main town centre uses
7.35  The main towns within the Plan Area of Totton, Hythe Village, Lymington, New 
Milton, Ringwood and Fordingbridge provide a good range of services and facilities 
and local employment opportunities for the communities living within and around 
them. Whilst vibrant and healthy, they tend to focus on local markets and the day-
to-day needs of residents and visitors.
7.36  The preceding decade has been one of significant change for retailing and town 
centres, including significant sub-regional retail consolidation to larger centres and 
the ongoing growth of online retailing and related branch restructuring by retail 
chains. The Plan Area is also served for higher order retail, cultural and commercial 
leisure activities by the nearby sub-regional centres of Southampton, Bournemouth 
and Salisbury. Theoretical need for additional retail provision identified in the 
Core Strategy (2009) has not materialised. Market interest leading to or seeking 
opportunities for major development in the Plan Review period and preceding 
decade has been limited to a few small supermarkets.
7.37  In this context the Local Plan takes a flexible approach, setting a framework to 
respond positively to future interest or demand if it arises. The aim of the policy is 
to ensure that the town centres within the District remain the focal points for new 
investment in retail and commercial facilities to maintain and enhance their roles 
and the services they provide to their communities and to visitors. There is current 
interest led by locally based investors in the renewal of parts of New Milton town 
centre, which is being addressed by the New Milton Neighbourhood Plan.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy81 
Policy ECON5: Retail development and other main town centre uses
The strategy is to support the renewal of and investment in town centres 
and large villages by applying a ‘town centres first’ approach in determining 
development proposals for retailing and the other Main Town Centre Uses, as 
defined in the supporting text.
i.  Development proposals for the Main Town Centre Uses will be favourably 
considered on environmentally appropriate sites in the settlements 
identified in Policy STR4: The settlement hierarchy provided that:
a.  The proposal is consistent with the scale and function of settlement in 
accordance with Policy STR4: The settlement hierarchy; and
b.  The site is within a defined shopping frontage, other appropriate 
commercial location within the Town Centre boundaries defined on 
the Policies Map, or will form part of a community hub provided as 
part of a Strategic Site Allocation; and where necessary the proposed 
scale and location of development is justified by the application of the 
sequential test.
ii.  Other than as set out in Saved Policy CS21: Rural economy or in the Site 
Allocation Policies, development proposals for Main Town Centre Uses will 
only be supported in more peripheral locations within or outside defined 
built-up area boundaries where supported by robust evidence submitted at 
planning application stage to demonstrate that:
a.  There is a local need and no suitable town centre or edge-of-town 
centre sites that are available to address that need; and
b.  The location is, or will be made, accessible by a choice of transport 
modes including safe and convenient pedestrian and cycle access; 
and
c.  That there would be no significant adverse impact on the vitality and 
viability of town centres and large villages.
Supporting text
7.38  The main town centre uses are as defined in Annex 2 of the National Planning 
Policy Framework: retail development (including warehouse clubs and factory 
outlet centres), leisure, entertainment facilities, more intensive sport and recreation 
uses (including cinemas, restaurants, drive-through restaurants, bars and 
pubs, night-clubs, casinos, health and fitness centres, indoor bowling centres 
and bingo halls), offices; and arts, culture and tourism development (including 
theatres, museums, galleries and concert halls, hotels and conference facilities). 
Development includes redevelopment and change of use. 
7.39  As set out in this policy, proposals for new retail and other main town centre 
uses should satisfy the requirements of the sequential test where necessary. The New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  82sequential test applies to planning applications for main town centre uses that are 
not in an existing centre and are not in accordance with an up-to-date Local Plan69. 
Applications for main town centre uses (other than smaller scale facilities meeting 
rural or localised needs) should be located in town centres, then in edge of centre 
locations and only if suitable sites are not available should out of centre sites be 
considered.
7.40  Outside of town centre boundaries, retail development proposals of over 1,000sqm 
Gross Internal Area (GIA) will be subject to an impact assessment. In the villages 
and in locations outside of the defined built-up areas, retail development proposals 
over 500sqm GIA will be subject to an impact assessment.
Primary, secondary and local shopping frontages
7.41  In response to changing high streets and retail markets the Government has 
expanded the scope of permitted development rights70, enabling more flexibility 
and changes of use in shopping areas and town centres without the need for 
planning permission. This policy sets out how changes of use that are not permitted 
development will be managed.
7.42  The Policies Map defines71 the ‘Primary Shopping Area’ for the town centres of 
Totton, Hythe, Lymington, New Milton, Ringwood and Fordingbridge. Primary and 
Secondary Frontages are defined in towns, and Local Shopping Frontages are also 
defined elsewhere in most towns and large villages.

be amended if required as part of the Local Plan Review 2016-2036 Part Two  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy83 
Policy ECON6: Primary, secondary and local shopping frontages
i.  Within the designated Primary Shopping Frontages, proposals for 
the change of use of ground floor shops (Class A1) and financial and 
professional services premises (Class A2) to other uses that require 
planning permission or are subject to Prior Approval, will only be 
supported where it will not create a concentration of non-shopping 
uses and result in an unacceptable change in the retail character of the 
shopping frontage as a whole.
ii.  Within the designated Secondary Shopping Frontages, proposals for 
changes of use of ground floor shops (Class A1) and financial and 
professional services premises (Class A2) to other uses which require 
planning permission or are subject to Prior Approval will be supported 
provided that they would not have an adverse impact on the vitality and 
viability of the shopping frontage as a whole.
iii. Within the designated Local Shopping Frontages 
a.   Uses which provide for the day-to-day shopping and service needs of 
the area will be permitted.
b.  The loss of an occupied shop or service use (within Use Class A1) 
that provides for everyday community needs will only be acceptable if 
evidence is provided of active and comprehensive marketing of the site 
for its current use for a minimum of 12 months prior to the submission 
of a planning application, which demonstrates the existing use is not 
commercially sustainable.
Supporting text
7.43  The aim of the policy is to strike an appropriate balance between responding to 
market demand and changing circumstances on the one hand, and the need to 
ensure that wherever possible settlement centres and shopping parades remain 
active, viable, and provide a healthy level of shopping facilities and services 
conveniently accessible to surrounding residential areas. Local shopping areas 
provide a focal point for community life and their convenience and accessibility 
are especially important for less mobile residents including the elderly and those 
without access to private transport.

change
8.1  The Local Plan aims to create places that are safe and healthy to live in now and 
that will remain so in the future. This chapter addresses the community safety 
aspects of natural processes including those arising from climate change, as well 
as the implications of industrial and other developments and installations. Policy 
ENV3: Design quality and local distinctiveness  addresses safety and security 
within developments though the masterplanning and design process.
Safe and healthy communities
8.2  This policy seeks to ensure that new development is appropriately managed or 
controlled where it poses or exacerbates environmental or other safety risks to 
communities, and that existing health and safety risk factors are avoided wherever 
possible in affected or sensitive locations, or minimised where development is 
necessary. A range of health and safety risk factors have been considered in 
identifying the Strategic Sites allocated in this Local Plan.
8.3  Parts of the Plan Area are affected by or at risk of fluvial, ground or surface water 
flooding, sea level rise and coastal erosion with links to climate change. Flood risk 
is addressed in the section following this policy.
8.4  The Plan Area, and in particular the Totton and the Waterside sub-area, also 
contains a range of infrastructure, installations and industries that could give rise to 
various forms of pollution (including noise), or which involve the use of hazardous 
substances or explosives covered by specific regulatory regimes. These include the 
Fawley oil refinery complex, major gas and oil pipelines, and military installations. 
Within the consultation areas around these installations, the development potential 
of land may be constrained especially for uses with vulnerable occupants such as 
children or care home residents.
8.5  Modelling72 shows that traffic emissions may reach or exceed recommended 
thresholds for human health in the Plan period in a small number of locations near 
the M27 north of Totton and near the A31 at Ringwood. Development in the Plan 
Area may also have implications in relation to an existing Air Quality Management 
Area in Lyndhurst in the New Forest National Park, and to the Clean Air Zone that is 
being established in Southampton to tackle traffic-related exceedance of air quality 
limits for human health in the city centre and around the port and its main access 
routes.
72 New Forest District Council – Local Plan, Air Quality Impacts, AQC 2018New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  868.6  All of the Plan Area lies in either or both of the aerodrome safeguarding consultation 
zones for Bournemouth and Southampton airports. Whilst not a constraint on most 
forms or types of development, the airport operator must be consulted in relation to 
relevant proposals within the identified safeguarding zones.
Policy CCC1: Safe and healthy communities
i.  Development should not result in pollution or hazards which prejudice 
the health and safety of communities and their environments, including 
air quality and the water environment. Where necessary to enable 
development to take place, appropriate measures will be required to 
prevent, control, mitigate or offset the impacts or risks of development on 
community health and safety.
ii.  When the opportunity arises, particularly through development or 
redevelopment, remedial measures will be taken to address existing 
pollution or hazards which prejudice the health and safety of communities 
and their environments.
iii.  Development within the safeguarding area of a military explosives storage 
area or within the consultation zones of a hazardous industrial site or 
pipelines will be restricted or managed either in accordance with Health 
and Safety Executive guidelines, or in consultation with the Secretary of 
State for Defence, as applicable.
iv.  In the interests of public safety, vulnerable developments will not be 
permitted
a.  Within the defined Coastal Change Management Area at Barton-on-
Sea to Milford-on-Sea unless in accordance with Saved Policy DM6: 
Coastal Change Management Areas ;
b.  In areas at risk of flooding unless in accordance with the sequential 
and exceptions tests;
c.  On contaminated, polluted or unstable land unless it is first adequately 
remediated or otherwise made safe for the proposed use and for the 
local community prior to occupation.
Supporting text
8.7  The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is a statutory consultee for planning 
applications around major hazard sites and pipelines and on applications for 
hazardous substances consent. The HSE has identified inner, middle and outer 
consultation zones around major potential hazard sites or installations, and 
provides guidance73 on appropriate development within the three consultation 
zones, taking into account the nature of the risk posed, and the scale of potential 
73 www.hse.gov.uk/landuseplanning/  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy87exposure to that risk (based on the scale of development and the relative 
vulnerability of potential occupiers). In very general terms most forms of major 
residential development in the inner and middle HSE consultations zones would 
not be in accordance with HSE advice, and development with more vulnerable 
occupiers e.g. care homes would not be in accordance with HSE advice in any of 
the consultation zones. Similar arrangements apply around locations where the 
military may store explosives.
8.8 An Air Quality Assessment is likely to be needed for development that would:
•  Significantly affect traffic congestion, speed or volume (especially HGV volume) 
during construction or operation;
•  Introduce new point sources of air pollution (including dust during construction);
• Expose future occupiers to existing sources of air pollutants;
•  Affect International Nature Conservation sites or biodiversity especially by 
deposition or concentration of pollutants. 
8.9  Site promoters are recommended to contact the Council’s Environmental Health 
team to confirm whether an Air Quality Assessment is likely to be needed in support 
of a future planning application.
Flood risk
8.10  Significant parts of the Plan Area face some level of flood risk. Areas at risk include 
low-lying land near the coast and around water courses (including rivers, streams 
and the feeder streams, drains and ditches that flow into them), and areas affected 
by rainwater surface run-off. Maps of areas at risk of marine, fluvial and surface 
water flooding are maintained on a Government website74 and periodically updated 
by the Environment Agency. These maps take into account flood modelling work 
undertaken in the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA)75 prepared to inform the 
Local Plan Review.
8.11  Climate change will increase the extent and degree of flood risk over the Plan 
period and in the longer term, as a consequence of rising sea levels and more 
extreme weather events. These effects are modelled in the SFRA. In addition the 
geology of the Plan Area includes underlying chalk and gravel. Groundwater may 
exacerbate fluvial flooding or present additional risks of surface water flooding, 
especially when the water table is elevated in prolonged wet periods.
74 https://flood-map-for-planning.service.gov.uk/
75 See evidence base: https://www.newforest.gov.uk/localplanexamination#evidencebaseNew Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  888.12  To address flooding risks the Council will apply national policy76 to ensure that flood 
risk is taken into account at all stages in the planning process. The Sequential Test 
will be applied to direct new development to areas with the lowest probability of 
current and future flooding, and to control and avoid inappropriate development in 
areas at current or future risk from flooding.
8.13  The Exception Test will be applied to consider proposals that it is not possible to 
locate in areas of lower flood risk, taking into account any wider benefits of the 
development proposal, and safety consideration on- and off-site. Appropriate 
flood warning and evacuation plans are a SFRA requirement for any sites at risk 
of flooding where development is allocated or permitted in accordance with the 
flooding Exception Test.
8.14  In considering potential or proposed locations for development it is therefore 
important that, as far as reasonably possible, development is located where the 
risk of flooding (from all sources) is and will remain lowest, taking account of 
climate change and the vulnerability of future uses to flood risk. The Flood Risk 
Vulnerability Classification in National Planning Policy Guidance77 identifies ‘Highly 
vulnerable’ and ‘more vulnerable’ uses that are least appropriate to locate in 
flood risk areas. These include emergency service stations, mobile home parks, 
caravans, hospitals, residential institutions and housing. Where appropriate the 
Strategic Site Allocation Policies provide site-specific guidelines for managing, 
minimising or mitigating flood risk, informed by the SFRA.
8.15  It is equally important that where development can safely take place in areas prone 
to flooding, that it does not worsen flood risk elsewhere, and that opportunities 
presented by development to reduce existing flood risks are taken. Where proposed 
development would resolve or significantly reduce existing risks of flooding or 
drainage network overload this will be accorded significant positive weight in 
determining the planning application. In accordance with Policy ENV3: Design 
quality and local distinctiveness  the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems 
(SuDS) will be sought wherever they would be effective in reducing the risks of 
flooding including by drainage network overload.
Safe and sustainable travel
8.16  Safe site access and the impact of new development on the capacity and safety 
of the transport network are important planning considerations, as is the need to 
encourage and enable more sustainable means of travel including walking and

by ensuring all development has safe and convenient links to existing and proposed 
pedestrian and cycle routes including those on adjacent developments.
8.17  This policy addresses how new development is accessed including parking and 
servicing arrangements, and how the development is connected to the road 
network, public transport services, footpaths and cycle ways. New development 
may also provide opportunities to deliver improvements to the transport network, 
to improve access and the ease or convenience of movement, and to install or 
improve communications systems that may reduce the need to travel.
Policy CCC2: Safe and sustainable travel 
New development will be required to:
i.  Prioritise the provision of safe and convenient pedestrian access within 
developments, by linking to and enabling the provision of more extensive 
walking networks wherever possible, and where needed by providing new 
pedestrian connections to local facilities;
ii.  Provide or contribute to the provision of dedicated cycle routes and 
cycle lanes, linking to and enabling the provision of more extensive cycle 
networks and providing safe cycle routes to local schools wherever 
possible;
iii.  Consider and wherever possible minimise the impact of development on 
bridleways and horse riders;
iv.  Provide sufficient car and cycle parking, including secure cycle parking in 
schools and colleges, work places, bus and rail stations, and in shopping 
areas in accordance with the adopted Parking Standards Supplementary 
Planning Document78;
v. Incorporate infrastructure to support the use of electric vehicles; and
vi.  Provide, or contribute proportionately to the provision of, any highways 
or public transport measures necessary to enable the development 
to be accommodated in a safe and sustainable manner, including the 
requirements identified in any applicable Strategic Site Allocation Policies .

Access and connectivity
8.18  New development must accord with Government and Highway Authority design 
guidance related to road safety, and safe and convenient access for pedestrians 
and cyclists are paramount.

pdf?m=637298154628700000New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  908.19  Preparation of a Transport Assessment will be required where a proposed 
development will or is likely to generate significant vehicle movements, or to affect 
pedestrian, cyclist or road safety. The Transport Assessment must demonstrate that 
the impact of the development on the transport network is acceptable, or how any 
unacceptable impacts or risks will be satisfactorily controlled or mitigated.
8.20  The Strategic Site Allocation Policies  set out site-specific requirements for 
sustainable transport measures identified to be necessary to support the proposed 
development. Wherever footpath, pedestrian and cycle routes run alongside or 
through the site, there is a presumption that these routes will be retained and 
improved by the development.
8.21  Site-specific Transport Assessments may identify that additional measures are 
necessary. Developer contributions will be sought where they are necessary and 
reasonably required to improve pedestrian and cycle routes, or to support or 
provide public transport services.
8.22  Where a development Transport Assessment identifies a need for mitigation 
measures to manage or reduce vehicle movements, a Travel Plan will be required 
setting out practicable measures to promote and encourage sustainable travel 
including walking and cycling.
Parking
8.23  Proposed parking in new developments will be assessed in relation to the Council’s 
adopted Parking Standards Supplementary Planning Document , which 
alongside Policy IMPL2: Development standards includes a requirement for the 
provision of electric car charging points.
8.24  It is important to ensure that a realistic and sufficient level of vehicle and cycle 
parking is provided where new development takes place. The availability of 
sufficient car parking has a role in improving accessibility to necessary local 
services and facilities, particularly in rural areas and for the less mobile including 
people with disabilities. Equally it is important to approach parking requirements 
and standards with some flexibility to ensure land is used efficiently , having 
regard to existing parking provision, the realistic needs arising from the proposed 
development, and the accessibility of the location by other travel modes.
8.25  Where developments are large enough to include on-site parking, parking provision 
must be addressed as an integral part of the design and site masterplanning 
process. Where on-street parking is relied upon in whole or part, streets should 
either be designed to accommodate likely demand (if the site is large enough), or 
it should first be demonstrated that existing on-street parking capacity is sufficient 
to meet likely current and future needs. In such schemes, on-street electric car 
charging points should be provided.   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy918.26  Traffic Regulation Orders will be applied where necessary or desirable to regulate 
the speed, weight, movement and parking of vehicles, or to regulate pedestrian 
access.
8.27  Where necessary, measures will be put in place to ensure that communal or public 
parking areas are managed efficiently and effectively for the primary benefit of the 
car park’s intended users. This may include considering how on-street parking will 
be managed and maintained if the Highways Authority does not wish to adopt the 
street.

Developer contributions
9.1  New development often creates a need for new or improved infrastructure and 
community facilities without which the development could have a detrimental impact 
upon amenity, safety or the environment. Development can also help to achieve 
the objectives of the plan, for example by providing affordable housing, a coherent 
footpath and cycleway network and improvements to the environment.
9.2  Policy STR8: Community services, infrastructure and facilities sets out the 
strategy to secure or enable provision of the infrastructure and community services 
and facilities that are needed in the Plan Area. This policy sets out the mechanisms 
for securing appropriate contributions from developers to meet the needs arising 
from their developments, or to mitigate its impact on existing infrastructure, facilities 
and services.
9.3  It is important to understand the limitations of the planning system in relation 
to infrastructure provision. National policy is that planning obligations, such as 
to require developer contributions for infrastructure, should only be placed on 
developers where they are necessary to make the development acceptable in 
planning terms, and they must also be directly related to the development, and fair 
and reasonable in scale and kind. For a development impact to be ‘acceptable in 
planning terms’ does not mean that the current situation must be improved upon or 
made no worse, and it is not the role of developer contributions to make up historic 
deficiencies - these are the responsibility of the infrastructure provider and beyond 
the scope of the planning system.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  94 
Policy IMPL1: Developer contributions
All developments must provide, or contribute proportionately to the provision 
of, any on-site and off-site infrastructure, facilities, affordable housing, public 
open space and habitat mitigation measures that are necessary and reasonably 
required to support the development and mitigate its impacts to achieve a 
sustainable development.
Where the development is part of a larger site, the developer will be expected 
to demonstrate how the provision of infrastructure and services for the 
application area forms a coherent part of a comprehensive solution for the 
site as a whole, and how the proposal can be delivered without prejudicing the 
development of the site as a whole.
In exceptional circumstances where it is demonstrated in a robust and 
independently tested viability study that there are previously unidentified cost 
considerations that render development unviable, the Council will work with 
the applicant to explore options to restore viability in the following order of 
preference. The starting position is that there will be a proportionate reduction 
in returns to the developer and land owner for any reduction in developer 
contributions agreed, within acceptable margins of profitability79 relative to 
development risk.
i.  Varying the development proposal if development costs could be reduced 
without unacceptably compromising design quality or sustainability.
ii.  Where it is possible, phase or defer the required contributions in whole or 
part, including by the use of Grampian planning conditions.
iii.    Vary, reduce or remove contributions that would have the least impact on 
the achievement of sustainable development.
As last resort development that would be unsustainable without the inclusion 
of necessary but unfunded infrastructure, facilities, affordable housing, public 
open space or recreational mitigation, will be refused planning permission.

9.4  The mechanism to secure developer contributions will depend on the type of 
infrastructure and the site circumstances, as set out within the Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan for requirements currently identified to be needed.
9.5  The methods for collecting contributions from developers include the Community 
Infrastructure Levy (CIL) (or future equivalent), Section 106 and Section 278 legal 
agreements. The Council will prepare an Infrastructure Funding Statement annually 
to set out how infrastructure projects will be funded in accordance with the CIL 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) or future equivalent. 
79 See PPGV paragraph 018 Reference ID 10-0178-20190509  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy959.6  Where Section 106 Legal agreements are used, they will be drafted by the 
Council (Section 278 agreements are drafted by Hampshire County Council as 
Highway Authority). The developer will be responsible for the costs resulting from 
administering the agreement. For developments that appear likely to take place 
over an extended period or to evolve over time, planning agreements will include 
formulae or other appropriate mechanisms to ensure flexibility for changing 
circumstances, so that the appropriate contribution will be made when the details of 
the development are finalised without the need to re-negotiate the agreement.
9.7  A CIL or Section 106 contribution may be made ‘in kind’, by the direct provision 
of the necessary facilities or project by the developer. Where the contributions 
required are published as standard charges, reasonable allowance will be made for 
any on- or off-site provision in kind that will be made by the developer , and for any 
existing infrastructure capacity.
9.8  In some circumstances larger sites may be owned or developed by more than 
one developer, or brought forward in more than one planning application. Where 
this is the case for a Strategic Site Allocation, the various developers will be 
expected to collaborate on the provision of the infrastructure and facilities which are 
needed to serve them all, preferably through equalisation agreements where their 
proportionate impacts and costs are fairly reconciled in advance of making planning 
applications. 
9.9  Equalisation agreements may also be needed where several land parcels in a 
larger site all rely on infrastructure that will be provided off-site, or will be provided 
on one of the land parcels towards which the other land parcels will need to 
contribute.
9.10  The Council will have regard to the viability of development. It is expected that 
policy requirements and related costs arising from the Local Plan and its supporting 
documents will already have been taken into account in land transactions, which 
should not therefore be based on unreasonable or over-optimistic assumptions 
regarding the type and density of development or the extent of planning 
obligations. The relevant supporting documents include (but are not limited to) 
the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, Supplementary Planning Documents including 
the Mitigation for Recreational Impacts SPD  the Community Infrastructure 
Levy or future equivalent, and forthcoming guidance on developer contributions. 
Viability testing has demonstrated that housing development is likely to be viable 
in the Plan Area taking into account the known or likely costs of meeting the policy 
requirements of this Local Plan and its supporting documents. This work has 
included discussions with infrastructure and service providers to establish the likely 
development costs that would be borne by the Strategic Site Allocations, as set out 
in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan .New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  96Development standards
9.11  National Building Regulations now address many aspects of the efficiency , 
sustainability and quality of development previously addressed by the planning 
system. There remain particular areas where higher standards can and should be 
applied where they are justified.
9.12  As set out in Policy HOU3: Residential accommodation for older people , the 
population aged 75+ is projected to grow 65% (12,800) in the Plan period, and by 
2036 almost half the Plan Area population is projected to be aged 55 and over80. 
The number of residents with a long-term disability or mobility limiting medical 
condition will increase commensurately. Suitably designed accommodation of the 
appropriate accessibility standards will be required to meet their needs.
9.13  The Plan Area is within a wider area designated by the Environment Agency as 
being under serious water stress, where demand for water must be effectively 
managed. Parts of the Plan Area are also in a Clean Air Zone and traffic emissions 
affect both human health and International Nature Conservation sites.
Policy IMPL2: Development standards
New development will meet or exceed the following standards and 
requirements81 to help minimise their environmental impact and/or to be 
adaptable to the future needs of occupiers over their lifetime.
i.  Visitable Dwellings standards of Part M4(1) of the Building Regulations 
except for Sheltered and Extra Care homes which should be built to the 
Wheelchair Adaptable Dwelling standard of Part M4(3)2a of the Building 
Regulations.
ii.  The higher water use efficiency standard in accordance with Part 36(2)
(b) of the Building Regulations, currently a maximum use of 110 litres per 
person per day.
iii.  New commercial developments of 250 - 999 sqm gross internal area (GIA) 
are required to achieve Building Research Establishment Environmental 
Assessment Method (BREEAM) excellent standard in the water 
consumption criterion. Commercial development of 1,000 sqm or more GIA 
is also required to achieve BREEAM excellent standard overall.
v.  Provision of a high speed fibre broadband connection to the property 
threshold.
vi.  Provision to enable the convenient installation of charging points for 
electric vehicles in residential properties and in residential, employee and 
visitor parking areas.

Visitable dwellings
9.14  New development must comply with the latest mandatory national standards for 
access. As at spring 2020, these are the Visitable Dwelling standard as set out 
in the Building Regulations Approved Document M: Volume 1- Dwellings  part 
M4(1).82  
9.15  For sheltered and extra care housing, the requirements of M4(3)2a of the Building 
Regulations should be provided in all circumstances.
Water efficiency standards
9.16  The higher water use efficiency Building Regulations standard is applied to all 
residential development in the Plan Area. Further efficiencies are encouraged, 
and Southern Water seeks83 to achieve a higher efficiency standard of 100 
litres per person per day by 2040 to manage demand in Hampshire (affecting 
the Totton and the Waterside sub-area). For commercial buildings the national 
BREEAM standard84 provides an equivalent mechanism for water efficiency, and 
a wider benchmark including other measures of environmental performance and 
sustainable construction.
9.17  The Council is also adopting the most efficient water use standard partly due to the 
potential risk of adverse impacts from water abstraction for the River Itchen SAC, 
and to reduce wastewater discharge that may adversely affect the River Avon SAC 
by increasing phosphorus levels or concentrations.
Telecommunications
9.18  Development should provide digital communications infrastructure, including 
superfast broadband, as an integral requirement for new homes and business 
premises. The Government recognises that reliable broadband internet access is 
essential for homes throughout the country to benefit from online services, including 
future opportunities to provide remote social, health and care services that may 
help to support independent living, as well as potentially reducing the need to 
travel for employment purposes (with air quality benefits). Appropriate, universal 
and future-proofed infrastructure should be installed and utilised. The Building 
Regulations already address telecommunications provision within new buildings, 
but there is a need to ensure that sites are provided with a high quality connection 
to an exchange with superfast broadband capacity wherever practicable.

9.19  Electric and hybrid vehicles are important emerging technologies essential to 
achieve the national commitment to phase out new combustion engines by 2040. 
The provision of electric vehicle (EV) charging points within all new developments 
will also support the early take up of electric vehicles in the Plan Area, helping to 
reduce the level of traffic emissions and their adverse effects on human health and 
sensitive habitats.
9.20  The success of electric and hybrid vehicles as technologies is partly dependent 
on there being a readily available supply of vehicle charging points. In accordance 
with national planning policy, new developments should be designed to enable the 
provision of plug-in charging points for electric and hybrid vehicles.
9.21  Within all dedicated off-street parking spaces that are within the curtilage of a 
dwelling, the minimum requirement is the installation within the parking space of 
a dedicated fast charging85 unit. In new developments where communal parking 
areas are provided, or where private parking is separate from the premises or 
dwelling, an electrical supply should be installed with sufficient power capacity to 
enable the convenient installation of fast charging points to all parking spaces in 
the future, without the need for significant re-wiring, structural or subsurface works. 
Some charging points should be provided unless it is demonstrably unfeasible to do 
so.
9.22  With continuing development in technology, new developments should install 
the latest method of charging that is accepted as an industry standard and cost 
effective for general use.
Monitoring the Local Plan
9.23  This policy sets out how the Local Plan 2016-2036 Part One: Planning Strategy 
will be monitored. Monitoring is important to ensure that the strategic objectives are 
being achieved, including that planned growth is being delivered in a timely manner.
9.24  The Council will update progress in an Annual Monitoring Report . If monitoring 
demonstrates that Local Plan targets are not being met appropriate action will be 
taken.

adopted nationally  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy99 
Policy IMPL3: Monitoring
The Council will monitor the implementation of the Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 
One using the Strategic Objective monitoring framework set out in Figure 9.1. 
If the strategic objectives of the Local Plan are not being achieved, including 
where planned development is not being delivered in a timely manner, the 
Council will investigate the reasons why and take appropriate action.
Depending on the scale and nature of the objective or delivery target not being 
met, actions may include:
i.  Engagement with the relevant parties including developers, landowners, 
service and infrastructure providers and other relevant parties to identify 
barriers or obstacles to the achievement of a Local Plan objective, or 
to the timely delivery of a planned development, and how they can be 
resolved;
ii.  The preparation of a position statement, development brief or action plan 
where it would assist delivery;
iii.  If possible, the identification of alternative sustainable and deliverable 
sites that are in general accordance with the Spatial Strategy through the 
Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 2 , Neighbourhood Plans or other appropriate 
mechanism;
And if necessary:
iv.  Undertaking a partial or full early review of the Local Plan for New Forest 
District (outside of the National Park), including if required discussions 
with neighbouring local planning authorities about the capacity of their 
Plan Areas to meet any unmet needs arising from this Plan Area. New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  100Targets Monitoring Indicators

Figure 9.1: Local Plan Strategic Objective Monitoring Framework (continued)New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  104Strategic Site Allocations
9.25  The Strategic Site Allocations address the majority of future housing needs not 
already being met by sites with planning permission or already allocated for housing 
development.
9.26  The Local Plan should be read as a whole. Development proposals for the 
Strategic Site Allocations will be assessed against the applicable Strategic Site 
Allocation policy and all other relevant policies in this Local Plan, including relevant 
Saved Policies. Planning applications for the Strategic Site Allocations should 
also have regard to, and contribute towards, the policies and objectives of any 
adopted Neighbourhood Plans, Supplementary Planning Documents and Local 
Distinctiveness guides that are relevant to the site location.
9.27  The larger site allocation boundaries may include some existing dwellings that have 
not been promoted for redevelopment. There is no presumption or requirement 
that they would form part of a future development, but this would be acceptable 
in principle subject to meeting the requirements of this policy, and any policies 
relevant to the property itself e.g. if it has heritage asset status.
Infrastructure Delivery Plan
9.28  The Site Allocation Policies set out the main site-specific requirements for the 
provision of the infrastructure and services necessary to sustainably accommodate 
the planned growth. More detail is provided in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan 
(IDP). The IDP is a live document that identifies the types of infrastructure required 
to support the delivery of the Local Plan, based on consultations with infrastructure 
and service providers. It includes information about the capacity and constraints of 
existing infrastructure and potential sources of funding, where known.
Masterplanning and design
9.29  Site Concept Master Plans have been prepared for each Strategic Site Allocation to 
demonstrate how the identified minimum number of homes can be accommodated 
in a manner compliant with the Local Plan policy requirements and standards, 
including the provision of natural recreational greenspace for habitat mitigation 
and the provision of public open space, and the development setbacks required:- 
around pipelines and overhead power lines, and to protect specific habitats, water 
courses, mature trees and woodlands.
9.30  The Site Concept Master Plans are illustrative rather than prescriptive 
requirements. Informed by a landscape assessment and consideration of 
biodiversity potential, they illustrate how development can fit its landscape (or 
townscape) context and deliver a net environmental gain (subject to appropriate 
detailing and implementation). The achievement of a net environmental gain is a   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy105national policy objective86 in its own right, and forms an important part of addressing 
Habitat Regulations requirements, and fulfilling the Council’s legal Duty of Regard 
to the purposes and objectives of the New Forest National Park. The layouts 
and details of development proposals will be subject to further consideration 
and discussion as sites come forward through the planning application process, 
including in pre-application discussions.
Site capacity
9.31  The stated capacity of the Strategic Site Allocations is based on masterplanning 
work carried out by the Council in consultation with site promoters and in full 
accordance with Local Plan policy requirements, including the provision of natural 
recreational greenspace for habitat mitigation, open space provision and housing 
mix.
9.32  The Strategic Site Allocation Policies express the site housing capacity as a 
minimum requirement. Achievement of the stated site capacity may be dependent 
on the form, size and mix of housing provided, especially on smaller and more 
constrained sites. This will be tested in detail at planning application stage.
9.33  At the detailed site design stage site promoters may be able to demonstrate that 
more homes can be delivered whilst still meeting the requirements of the Local Plan 
and the Habitats Regulations. Where added capacity can be delivered in a manner 
that is well-designed and contextually appropriate, provides an acceptable housing 
mix, fully mitigates its habitat impacts and achieves a net environmental gain, 
additional capacity will be supported.
Recommended material to support planning applications
9.34  An Environmental Impact Assessment and a Habitats Regulations 
Assessment  are likely to be required in support of development proposals on 
all of the Strategic Sites. As part of this process, the Environmental Statement 
must identify, describe and assess the following factors including the interactions 
between them:
• Population and human health
• Biodiversity
• Land, soil water and climate
• Material assets, cultural heritage and the landscape
86 A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment (HM Government 2018)New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  1069.35  Planning applications will need to include the mandatory supporting documentation 
specified in the national and local mandatory lists, where they are relevant to the 
proposed development. These are likely to include some or all of the following:
• Design and access statement
• Air quality assessment
• Biodiversity survey and report
• Flood Risk Assessment
• Heritage statement
• Land contamination assessment
• Lighting assessment
• Transport assessment
• Travel plan
• Tree assessment
•  Any other information or evidence identified by the Strategic Site Allocation 
Policies
Coordinated development
9.36  To ensure that the development of Strategic Site Allocations delivers high 
quality new communities making the most effective use of the land available it is 
important that development is delivered in a manner that connects and integrates 
development phases. A framework master plan should be prepared for the site as a 
whole to guide and coordinate detailed consideration of development phases, and 
to demonstrate how early phases will form part of a coordinated whole.
9.37  Development proposals that do not follow the approach illustrated in the Site 
Concept Master Plans set out in the Strategic Site Allocation Policies will need 
to include their own master plan that demonstrates from first principles how the 
requirements of the Strategic Site Allocation Policy can be met in full and would 
deliver net environmental gain and a high quality design that is appropriate to its 
context and landscape setting.
9.38  Applications for the piecemeal development of smaller parts of larger strategic sites 
are unlikely to meet the requirements of a Strategic Site Allocation policy unless 
they clearly demonstrate:
i.  How they form part of a coherent overall scheme in design terms, based on 
either the Strategic Site Allocation Policy Site Concept Master Plan, or on an   New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy107alternative master plan for the site as a whole. Jointly prepared master plan 
frameworks or Design and Access Statements, and equalisation arrangements 
for the provision of infrastructure and services and land for habitat mitigation 
that are agreed with the other site interests will help to demonstrate a 
coordinated approach.
ii.  That access arrangements for the application site are coherent for the strategic 
site as a whole, and will be permeable in relation to access and movement for 
the site as a whole, including for road traffic, without the imposition of ransom 
strips; and
iii.  How the site would make a proportionate contribution to the facilities, services, 
infrastructure, open space and recreational habitat mitigation requirements of 
the allocation site as a whole. This may necessitate the provision of land for, 
and must not prejudice the delivery and implementation of, the infrastructure, 
facilities, open space and habitat mitigation that is necessary for the Strategic 
Site Allocation as a whole as well as for the development site itself.
Implementation
9.39  The Council will work closely with developers and the community to deliver on 
site the high quality schemes required. Pre-application advice and Planning 
Performance Agreements will be a central part of how new development is 
delivered, as will monitoring implementation to ensure that quality outcomes are 
delivered.
9.40  Regulations87 require that pre-commencement planning conditions can only be 
used where agreed by the applicant. Consequently more detail will need to be 
provided about development proposals at the point of application in general, and 
in particular about landscaping and open space provision, to enable planning 
decisions to be made. The Council’s 1APP Planning Application Requirements will 
set out all the relevant supporting documents and information required, as identified 
in the Local Plan and its supporting SPD, to ensure they are provided when an 
application is submitted.
9.41  After planning permissions are issued the Council will closely monitor development 
on site to ensure that approved details are implemented and any other 
requirements are adhered to. Where issues of compliance are identified these 
will be discussed with the developer to agree how compliance will be achieved. If 
necessary appropriate action will be taken to enforce compliance.

Strategic Site 1: Land to the north of Totton
i.  Land to the north of Totton, as shown on the Policies Map is allocated for 
residential-led mixed use development and open space and will comprise 
the following:
•  At least 1,000 homes, dependent on the form, size and mix of housing 
provided.
•  A commercial core west of Pauletts Lane including around five 
hectares of land for business and employment uses.
•  A community focal point in a prominent location including ground 
floor premises suitable for community use.
•  Contributions to educational provision to include two hectares of land 
to be reserved for a primary school.
• On-site provision of formal public open space.
ii.  The masterplanning objectives for the site as illustrated in the Concept 
Master Plan are to create a well-designed and integrated extension 
to Totton whilst maintaining the rural character of Hill Street and 
Pauletts Lane and a countryside edge to the New Forest National Park. 
Development will be required to:
a.  Create an integrated network of natural green spaces to frame 
development, using and enhancing important tree belts, hedgerows 
and woodland blocks (including Bog Plantation, Hatton’s Plantation 
and Kilnyard Copse), and by making a positive feature of water 
courses, to connect new greenspace to existing footpaths and rights 
of way to Loperwood, Sharveshill Plantation, Wade Hill Drove and 
Testwood Lakes.
b  Set development behind the ridgeline on the northern and north-
western edges to maintain an open landscape and an appropriate 
westbound transition from urban Southampton to the countryside 
edge of the New Forest National Park.
c  Provide traffic calming and crossing points for the A36 (Salisbury 
Road) and creating a choice of vehicular routes including an 
alternative route west of Pauletts Lane between the A36 and 
Loperwood suitable for two-way traffic including buses, and an east-
west pedestrian and cycle route across Pauletts Lane.
iii. Site-specific Considerations to be addressed include:
a.  The need for an agreed comprehensive development framework for 
the whole allocation to ensure the effective coordination between 
multiple land interests to deliver an integrated, whole-site approach to 
the provision of access, community facilities, open space and natural 
recreational greenspace for habitat mitigation.
b.  Design and other appropriate measures to mitigate potential noise and 
air quality impacts from the M27/A31, A36 and the A326.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy109c.  To assess the need for, and to provide where necessary, 
enhancements to the A326 and A36 junctions to provide safe vehicular 
access for the development.
d.  The Grade II listed building Broadmoor Cottage, Pauletts Lane should 
be retained within an appropriate setting so that its significance can 
be appreciated.
e.  The preparation of a detailed site-specific Flood Risk Assessment 
(FRA) will be required which would demonstrate that there will be no 
inappropriate development within Flood Zone 3b.
Supporting text 
9.42  Site capacity and housing mix will be tested in detail at the planning application 
stage. 
9.43  The site is divided by Salisbury Road. Based on indicative masterplanning of the 
main land parcels on a stand-alone basis, land to the north can accommodate 
at least 260 homes. The land to the south is divided by Pauletts Lane, which will 
deliver at least 330 homes to the west and at least 230 homes to the east. Land 
south of Loperwood has outline planning permission for up to 80 homes. Through 
a coordinated approach the site is expected to achieve ‘at least’  1,000 home total 
capacity.
9.44  The site allocation boundary includes some existing residential properties that have 
not been promoted for redevelopment. There is no presumption or requirement 
that they would form part of a future development, but this would be acceptable 
in principle subject to meeting the requirements of this policy, and any policies 
relevant to the property itself e.g. if it has heritage asset status.
9.45  The Infrastructure Delivery Plan should be read in conjunction with this policy as it 
lists the requirements that will be needed to mitigate the development’s impacts on 
the local infrastructure. The main infrastructure requirements for the site include:
•  Developer contributions to access, or to provide, school capacity where 
necessary to meet the educational needs of the development in a manner and 
location to be agreed with Hampshire County Council at the point of planning 
application. Unless confirmed in writing to be unnecessary by Hampshire 
County Council, two hectares of land will be reserved on-site for a new primary 
school in a location that is conveniently walkable from both the development 
and the adjacent settlement
•  Provision and in-perpetuity maintenance of public open space and natural 
recreational greenspace for habitat mitigation
•  A capacity appraisal of the sewage network and enhancements to sewer 
capacity if required, which will need to match the rate of development.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  110Schools
9.46  Based on a capacity of 1,000 homes, Hampshire County Council preference is 
for extensions to existing primary schools rather than provision of a new school, 
subject to technical confirmation that expansion is feasible and deliverable. If a 
new school is required, then the land and the necessary contributions to help to 
deliver the school will be sought. If a new school is not required, then developer 
contributions will be sought to extend or add temporary classrooms at Calmore 
Infant and Junior schools and another local schools, and the school reserve site 
can be released for additional residential development.
Formal open space (sports pitches)
9.47  Provision of formal public open space at north Totton should include two multi-use 
games areas, and there is a need for a cricket pitch in the area88.
Minerals
9.48  The site contains pockets of land within a Hampshire Minerals Consultation Area. 
Minerals extraction may be appropriate where environmentally suitable subject to 
confirmation of the scale and quality of the resource.
Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
9.49  The Flood Risk Assessment should be informed by the outputs of the SFRA Level 2 
and the latest Climate Change requirements to ensure development is safe and that 
there is no increase in flood risk elsewhere over the lifetime of the development.
Nutrient management
9.50  Preparation of a development-specific nutrient budget and nutrient management 
strategy will be required to demonstrate how the development will achieve nitrogen 
neutrality in relation to wastewater discharge and drainage run-off, to avoid the 
potential for adverse impacts on the Solent and Southampton Water international 
conservation sites.

i.  Land north-west of Marchwood as shown on the Policies Map is allocated 
for residential development and public open space and will comprise the 
following:
•  At least 700 homes in the Plan period, dependent on the form, size 
and mix of housing provided, and around 300 additional homes in the 
future on land currently occupied by a solar array.
•  A community focal point in a prominent location in the southern part 
of the site including ground floor premises suitable for community 
use.
•  Contributions to educational provision to include two hectares of land 
to be reserved for a primary school.
• On-site provision of formal public open space.
ii.  The masterplanning objectives for the site as illustrated in the Concept 
Master Plan. Development will be required to deliver a well-designed and 
well-connected extension to Marchwood including a new countryside edge 
that reinforces the settlement gap between Totton and Eling, by:
a.  Creating green corridors running from the woodlands towards the 
coast and to buffer the railway line incorporating amenity and play 
areas, natural recreational greenspace, streets, footpaths, existing 
water courses and features to manage surface water flood risk.
b.  Providing a primary access route through the site using the existing 
mineral working road connecting to a new spur off the lower Bury 
Road roundabout, with secondary access points off Tavell’s Lane.
c.  Creating a transition in character from a suburban core nearer to 
Marchwood, to a lower density built form appropriate to the settlement 
and countryside edge that incorporates more public open space, 
natural greenspace and planting.
iii. Site-specific Considerations to be addressed include:
a.  Phasing and masterplanning of development to deliver a 
comprehensive and integrated development over time.
b.  Assessment of the need for, and where necessary, provision of 
enhancements to Bury Road, Marchwood Road and their connection 
to the A326 to ensure safe and suitable vehicular, cycle and pedestrian 
access for the development.
c.  Design or other appropriate measures if required, to mitigate potential 
odour impacts from Slowhill Copse Wastewater Treatment Works, in 
consultation with Southern Water.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy113d.  The preparation of a detailed site-specific Flood Risk Assessment 
(FRA) demonstrating that there will be no development within areas of 
Flood Zone 3b and how the proposed development will be made safe 
over its lifetime.
e.  Design or other appropriate measures in any new development to 
minimise and mitigate the effects of potential noise and light impacts 
generated by the Port of Southampton on residential amenities.

9.55  Based on a capacity of 700 homes during the Plan period up to 2036, Hampshire 
County Council preference is for extensions to existing primary schools rather 
than provision of a new school, subject to technical confirmation that expansion 
is feasible and deliverable. If a new school is required, then the land and the 
necessary contributions to help to deliver the school will be sought. If a new 
school is not required, then developer contributions will be sought to extend or add 
temporary classrooms to local schools.
9.56  Land for a primary school is reserved until such time as Hampshire County Council 
confirms in writing that there is either sufficient existing school capacity to meet the 
future needs of the development, or that existing schools are capable of expansion 
to provide the additional capacity needed. If a new school is not required, the 
school reserve site can be released for additional residential development.
Open space
9.57  Provision of formal public open space at west Marchwood should include provision 
of two adult football pitches and cricket pitch with supporting accommodation on 
site89.
Allotments
9.58  Marchwood Parish Council has identified a local need for allotments. Allotments are 
in principle an acceptable use in the countryside outside settlement boundaries. 
Provision of allotments could be enabled by the development of Sites SS2 and/or

Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
9.59  The Flood Risk Assessment will be required to show how improved flood and 
drainage management in the locality will ensure that there is no increased flood risk 
on or off the site. 
Port of Southampton
9.60  Development should take into account that the Port of Southampton is an 
established use that operates 24 hours a day, and is likely to expand its operations 
in the future.

9.66  Mitigation measures such as ground-raising and other flood defence works 
to address future flood risks must be undertaken in a manner that does not 
exacerbate risks to other developments or interests in the vicinity, and seeks to 
address the future vulnerability of adjoining developed areas from flooding that 
might otherwise arise or flow through site SS3 under the higher climate change

Strategic Site 4: The former Fawley Power Station
i.  The site of the former Fawley Power Station will be comprehensively 
redeveloped for residential-led mixed use scheme and public open space 
and will comprise the following:
•  Around 1,380 new homes dependent on the form, size and mix of 
housing provided, but predominantly apartments, within the central 
and southern parts of the site.
•  Up to around 10,000 square metres of ancillary community, retail, 
leisure and service uses appropriate to serve a village-scale 
community, site-based activities and employees.
•  Office uses and a marina may be included within primarily residential 
areas in the central and southern parts of the site, subject to demand 
and viability.
•  Around 10 hectares of land in the northern part of the site for business 
and industrial uses (Use Classes B1 an B2) with a low environmental 
impact. Locations where sea access would be provided by the 
redevelopment to be prioritised for marine industries that require sea 
access, unless there is a demonstrable lack of demand.
ii.  The masterplanning objectives for the site as illustrated in the Concept 
Master Plan are to create a mixed-use waterside community embodying 
the highest standards of design and sustainability that also benefits the 
wider Calshot community by:
a.  Creating a landmark and contextually appropriate design that befits 
the prominent and sensitive location, concentrating areas of greater 
height and mass around the footprint of the current power station 
building, scaling down in height and density towards the water front 
and the southern site.
b.  Providing public access to the waterfront and dockside areas 
including public spaces.
c.  Providing a mix of commercial and community uses to enable a 
significant level of self-containment in facilities and employment 
opportunities.
d.  Integrating planting and design features that maximise the wildlife 
and habitat potential of buildings and the development area, and 
to avoid, or where necessary manage and minimise, the impacts of 
development on the Solent foreshore and other areas of habitat value.
iii.   Site-specific Considerations to be addressed include:
a.  The outputs of the SFRA Level 2 will be considered in the preparation 
of a detailed site-specific Flood Risk Assessment demonstrating how 
the proposed development will be made safe over its lifetime. 
b.  To assess the need for, and to provide where necessary, 
enhancements to the B3053 and A326 where necessary to provide 
safe vehicular, public transport, cycle and pedestrian access for the 
development.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  122c.  Uses proposed especially in the northern quarter must be compatible 
with the extent of safety hazard from the Fawley oil refinery complex.
d.  The need to incorporate and facilitate appropriate measures to ensure 
the conservation and enhancement of the landscape and scenic 
beauty of the neighbouring New Forest National Park. 
e.  To ensure redevelopment is brought forward in a coordinated manner 
and fully mitigates its impacts, the promoter will prepare a master 
plan and supporting technical assessments for the entire Fawley 
Power Station site, for submission as part of the planning application. 
Development will be phased as set out in an approved master plan 
agreed with the local planning authorities.
Supporting text
9.71  Site capacity and housing mix will be tested in detail at the planning application

9.72  The site of the former Fawley Power Station will be developed as part of a 
comprehensive scheme which includes adjoining land allocated in Policy SP26 
of the New Forest National Park Local Plan 2016-2036 (2019). Policy SP26 
supports the effective use of the previously developed power station site. Proposals 
include additional homes, land for a primary school if required and other measures 
that support a comprehensive redevelopment approach including the provision of 
extensive areas of natural recreational greenspace for habitat mitigation, restoration 
or enhancement, and the provision of other public open space.
9.73  The allocation site is also suitable for stand-alone redevelopment with a 
proportionate reduction in development capacity to accommodate sufficient public 
open space and natural recreational greenspace on-site.
9.74  This policy should be read in conjunction with the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, 
which lists the requirements that will be needed to mitigate the development’s 
impacts on the local infrastructure. The main infrastructure requirements for the site 
are as follows:
•  Developer contributions to access, or to provide, school capacity where 
necessary to meet the educational needs of the development in a manner and 
location to be agreed with Hampshire County Council at the point of planning 
application
•  Site-specific bird surveys will be required to confirm their contribution to in-

Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
9.75  The mitigation measures such as ground raising and other flood defence 
works to address future flood risks must be undertaken in a manner that does 
not exacerbate risks to other developments in the vicinity. It will need to be 
demonstrated that any mitigation measures proposed to make the development 
safe for its lifetime can be funded through the development scheme. The site is 
within Flood Zone 3 but redevelopment is acceptable in principle on the basis that 
the site is a major regeneration opportunity on previously developed land.
Housing choice
9.76  The nature of the development offers an opportunity to provide purpose-built homes 
for rent.
Viability of development
9.77  An initial viability assessment has shown that the site can achieve the 35% 
affordable housing requirement applicable for residential development in the Totton 
and Waterside area, and to make appropriate provision for community needs.
9.78  It is not a requirement of this policy to build an extension to the existing dock 
or to provide a marina. Marina development is acceptable in principle provided 
that it forms part of a comprehensive, residential-led redevelopment, and does 
not compromise the viability of development to the extent that the site is unable 
to provide for a mixed community that meaningfully contributes to meeting local 
housing needs. 
Minerals 
9.79  Redevelopment of the site offers an opportunity for aggregates recycling to reduce 
the need to import building materials or land fill.
Nutrient management
9.80  Preparation of a development-specific nutrient budget and nutrient management 
strategy will be required to demonstrate how the development will achieve nitrogen 
neutrality in relation to wastewater discharge and drainage run-off, to avoid the

•  A dedicated off-site connecting sewer or pumped connection to Ringwood 
Sewage Treatment Works
•  Developer contributions to access, or to provide, school capacity where 
necessary to meet the educational needs of the development, in a manner and 
location to be agreed with Hampshire County Council at the point of planning 
application. Unless confirmed in writing to be unnecessary by Hampshire 
County Council, two hectares of land will be reserved on-site for a new primary 
school in a location that is conveniently walkable from both the development 
and the adjacent settlement  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy153•  Provision and in-perpetuity maintenance of public open space and natural

• Improvements to the Christchurch Road and Moortown Lane junction
• Measures or contributions to achieve phosphorus neutral development
•  Site-specific bird surveys will be required to confirm their contribution to in-
combination loss of supporting habitat to internationally designated species 
and to be mitigated as required
Schools
9.132  Based on a capacity of 480 homes, Hampshire County Council preference is 
for extensions to existing primary schools rather than provision of a new school, 
subject to technical confirmation that expansion is feasible and deliverable. If a 
new school is required, then the land and the necessary contributions to help to 
deliver the school will be sought. If a new school is not required, then developer 
contributions will be sought to extend or add temporary classrooms at Ringwood 
Infant and Junior Schools or Poulner Infant and Junior Schools.
9.133  If a new school is not required, the school reserve site will remain public open 
space within the Green Belt.
Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
9.134  The Flood Risk Assessment should be informed by the outputs of the SFRA Level 
2 and Climate Change requirements (February 2016) to ensure development is 
safe and that there is no increase in flood risk elsewhere over the lifetime of the 
development. Where, exceptionally, a reduction in flood storage or conveyance in 
areas outside of Flood Zone 3b is proposed, it would need to be fully compensated 
for on a level-for-level / appropriate basis and supported with detailed hydraulic 
modelling for a development of this scale.
Nutrient management
9.135  Preparation of a development-specific nutrient budget and nutrient management 
strategy will be required to demonstrate how the development will achieve 
phosphate neutrality in relation to wastewater discharge and drainage run-off, 
to avoid the potential for adverse impacts on the River Avon Special Area of 
Conservation. SuDs should include measures to reduce the run-off of silt and 
diffuse pollutants into the River Avon.
Minerals 
9.136  The site is within a Minerals Consultation Area. Subject to confirmation of the scale 
and quality of the resource and safeguarding the amenity of nearby residents, 
minerals extraction may be appropriate as part of the development.

i.  Land to the north of Hightown Road, Ringwood, as shown on the Policies 
Map is allocated for residential-led mixed use development and will 
comprise the following:
•  Residential development of at least 270 new homes and public open 
space dependent on the form, size and mix of housing provided
• Around three hectares of employment land
ii.  The masterplanning objectives for the site as illustrated in the Concept 
Master Plan are to create a new area of Ringwood with a countryside edge 
that has regard to and respects the landscape sensitivities of the adjoining 
New Forest National Park by:
a.  Creating a transition of character from suburban town to rural edge 
reducing the intensity of development towards the rising land in the 
east, incorporating a significant area of recreational greenspace along 
the New Forest National Park boundary; and through the orientation of 
wedges of greenspace and broad streets in an east-west alignment.
b.  Creating a north-south greenspace along the site’s western boundary, 
providing flood attenuation and drainage features as part of a high 
quality landscape.
c.  Creating a new site access spur from the A31 slipway (Southampton 
Road) roundabout to a main north-south street serving as both the 
focal point for development and an alternative route for local traffic 
to the A338 Christchurch Road in conjunction with Strategic Site 13: 
Land at Moortown Lane .
d.  Providing a community focal point in a prominent location including 
ground floor premises suitable for community use.
e.  Incorporating employment and small business uses on the northern 
edge of the site with embankments and tree planting to buffer traffic 
impacts from the A31.
iii.   Site-specific Considerations to be addressed include: 
a.  Wherever possible, development should be directed to Flood Zone 
1 and will only be considered within Flood Zones 2 or 3 where it is 
possible to mitigate flood risk. Preparation of a detailed site-specific 
Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) demonstrating how the proposed 
development will be made safe over its lifetime will be required. 
b.  Provision of a new connection to the Ringwood Sewage Treatment 
Works bypassing the town centre sewer network, to be delivered in 
conjunction with Strategic Site 13: Land at Moortown Lane .
c.  Ensuring that new development preserves the setting of the listed 
building, the Elm Tree public house.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  156Supporting text

Assessment of land at north of Hightown Road, parts of which are in Flood Risk 
Zones 2 and 3 and which is at higher risk of groundwater emergence. The SFRA 
confirmed in general terms that safe development could be achieved. The Flood 
Risk Assessment will be required to show how improved flood and drainage 
management in the locality will ensure that there is no increased flood risk on or off 
the site. It will need to be demonstrated that any mitigation measures proposed to 
make the development safe for its lifetime can be funded through the development 
scheme.

This area is near to local schools and to a potential ‘village’ focal point, but is also 
an area of transition between land interests requiring an integrated and cooperative 
design approach to create a successful village core area that is framed by 
surrounding development.
Surface and groundwater flood risks and run-off nutrient management
9.172  In periods of heavy rainfall and when groundwater levels are high the site is prone 
to surface water flooding including from groundwater sources nearby that are 
usually dry. The site will need to be made safe from likely future flood risks in a 
manner that stores and slows the passage of flood water to help protect areas 
downstream towards central Fordingbridge, utilising sustainable urban drainage 
techniques integrated into public open space and natural recreational greenspace 
areas.
9.173  Preparation of a development-specific nutrient budget and nutrient management 
strategy will be required to demonstrate how the development will achieve 
phosphate neutrality in relation to wastewater discharge and drainage run-off, 
to avoid the potential for adverse impacts on the River Avon Special Area of 
Conservation. SuDs should include measures to reduce the run-off of silt and 
diffuse pollutants into the River Avon.
Sewer and wastewater treatment
9.174  The developers of Strategic Site 16: Land to the north of Station Road , 
Strategic Site 17: Land at Whitsbury Road , and Strategic Site 18: Land 
at Burgate will need to work cooperatively with each other and with the water 
company to proportionately fund and cooperatively deliver a suitable foul sewer 
connection to the Fordingbridge treatment works, and the phased delivery of 
additional wastewater treatment capacity. Sewer provision through Sites SS16 
and SS17 must be of sufficient capacity to accommodate, and provide a suitable 
point of connection for, wastewater arising from all parts of Site SS18 without the 
imposition of a ‘ransom strip’ approach to future connections.
Open space 
9.175  All development sites in the Fordingbridge area will contribute land and/or funding 
contributions to proportionately address their combined formal open space needs. 
The site provides a suitable location for play and formal or informal sport pitch 
provision as part of the public open space requirement for the site. The site could New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  174include formal open space provision to address needs from other developments in 
the area that are less suitable for on-site provision of formal public open space.
Settlement boundary
9.176  The precise location of the northern settlement boundary will be agreed through 
the planning application process, in a position that retains a clear open space and 
landscape gap between the development, Burgate Cross and Fryern Court Road.
Minerals
9.177  The site is within a Minerals Consultation Area. Subject to confirmation of the scale 
and quality of the resource, potential impact on groundwater and safeguarding the 
amenity of nearby residents, minerals extraction may be appropriate as part of the 
development.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy175Strategic Site 18: Land at Burgate, Fordingbridge

from the New Forest District Local Plan 
First Alteration (2005), Core Strategy 
(2009) and Local Plan Part Two (2014)
 
A.1  In determining planning applications the Council will apply the reviewed policies of 
the Local Plan 2016-2036 Part One, together with any policies saved from previous 
Local Plans and the policies of any adopted Neighbourhood Plans, and where 
applicable the Hampshire Minerals and Waste Plan.
A.2 This appendix sets out:
•  policies that are saved from the New Forest District Local Plan First 
Alteration (2005), Core Strategy (2009)  or the Local Plan Part Two (2014), 
that will continue to be applied (in whole or part, and if in part, which part)
•  policies that have not been saved, and either stating which current policies 
supersede them, or that they have been deleted without replacement.
A.3  Where a Saved Policy includes a cross-reference to a previous policy that has not 
been saved, refer instead to its replacement policy in this Local Plan Part One. If 
there is no replacement policy, that section of the Saved Policy will not be applied.
A.4  Other Local Plan and national policy and guidance will continue to be taken into 
account where they are relevant.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  178Policy Core Strategy Policy title Status Local

Adopted Policies Map:  A map of the Local Planning Authority’s area which must be 
reproduced from, or based on, an Ordnance Survey map; include an explanation of any 
symbol or notation which it uses; and illustrate geographically the application of the policies 
in the adopted development plan. Where the adopted Policies Map consists of text and 
maps, the text prevails if the map and text conflict.
Adoption:  Formal approval by the Council of a Development Plan Document or 
Supplementary Planning Document whereupon it achieves its full weight in making 
planning decisions
Affordable Housing:  As defined in the National Planning Policy Framework glossary, 
currently (2020): ‘Housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the 
market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is 
for essential local workers)’.  The NPPF defines a number of affordable housing formats/
tenures. 
Air Quality Management Areas (AQMA):  Areas designated by local authorities because 
they are not likely to achieve national air quality objectives by the relevant deadlines.
Annual Monitoring Report (AMR):  Assesses and reports on the progress of the Adopted 
Local Plan and other planning policy documents. In doing so, it monitors how successfully 
the policies of the plan are being implemented.
Back-up grazing/back-up land:  Enclosed pasture land which forms an integral part of 
the commoning economy. Generally it is located close to a commoner’s holding. Its uses 
include overwintering of stock, raising store cattle, making hay or silage, tending sick 
animals and young stock, finishing ponies for riding, and preparing stock for market.
Brownfield land:  See Previously developed land
Business Incubator: Is a workspace created to offer start-ups and new ventures access 
to the resources they need, all under one roof. In addition to a desk or office, incubators 
often provide resident companies with access to expert advisors, mentors, administrative 
support, office equipment, training, and/or potential investors.
Clean Air Zone: A Clean Air Zone defines an area where targeted action is taken to 
improve air quality and resources are prioritised and coordinated in order to shape the 
urban environment in a way that delivers improved health benefits and supports economic 
growth. They aim to address all sources of pollution, including nitrogen dioxide and 
particulate matter, and reduce public exposure to them using a range of measures tailored 
to the particular location.New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy  190Coastal Change Management Area (CCMA):  An area identified in Local Plans as likely to 
be affected by coastal change (physical change to the shoreline through erosion, coastal 
landslip, permanent inundation or coastal accretion).
Commoners of the New Forest: Those people eligible to use rights of common. In the

whether a site falls within the definition of edge of centre, account should be taken of local 
circumstances.
Environmental Net Gain:  This encompasses net gains to the wider natural environment 
including biodiversity, together with landscape quality, design quality and local 
distinctiveness.  It is an approach to development that leaves the natural environment in a 
measurably better state than it was beforehand.
Subsequently published national requirements for achieving biodiversity net gain will, 
where relevant, need to be addressed as a part of the Local Plan approach to achieving 
environmental net gains.
European site: This includes candidate Special Areas of Conservation, Sites of 
Community Importance, Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, and 
is defined in regulation 8 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.

Local Planning Authorities to identify and update annually a supply of specific deliverable 
sites sufficient to provide five years’ worth of housing against their housing requirements 
with an additional buffer of 5% or 20% (moved forward from later in the Plan period) to 
ensure choice and competition in the market for land.

Planning obligation:  A legally enforceable obligation entered into under section 106 of the 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to mitigate the impacts of a development proposal.
Precautionary principle: There is no universally accepted definition of the precautionary 
principle. The key point of the Principle is to create an impetus to take a decision 
notwithstanding scientific uncertainty about the nature and extent of the risk, i.e. to avoid 
‘paralysis by analysis’ by removing excuses for inaction on the grounds of scientific 
uncertainty. Although the precautionary principle was originally framed in the context of 
preventing environmental harm, it is now widely accepted as applying broadly where there 
is threat of harm to human, animal or plant health, as well as in situations where there is a 
threat of environmental damage.  New Forest District Local Plan 2016-2036 Part 1: Planning Strategy193Previously developed land (PDL):  Land which is or was occupied by a permanent

buildings; land that has been developed for minerals extraction or waste disposal by landfill 
purposes where provision for restoration has been made through development control 
procedures; land in built-up areas such as private residential gardens, parks, recreation 
grounds and allotments; and land that was previously-developed but where the remains of 
the permanent structure or fixed surface structure have blended into the landscape in the 
process of time. Also known as ‘brownfield land’.
Primary shopping area: Defined area where retail development is concentrated (generally 
comprising the primary and those secondary frontages which are adjoining and closely 
related to the primary shopping frontage).
Primary and secondary frontages: Primary frontages are likely to include a high 
proportion of retail uses which may include food, drinks, clothing and household goods. 
Secondary frontages provide greater opportunities for a diversity of uses such as 
restaurants, cinemas and businesses.

Convention.
Section 106 agreements (S106):  This refers to the benefits or safeguards, often for 
community benefit, secured by way of a legally binding agreement between the local 
planning authority and a developer as part of a planning approval. These are usually 
provided at the developer’s expense; for example, affordable housing, community facilities 
or mitigation measures.
Section 278 agreements (S278):  A section 278 agreement is a section of the Highways 
Act 1980 that allows developers to enter into a legal agreement with the council to make

shopping area and areas predominantly occupied by main town centre uses within or 
adjacent to the primary shopping area. References to town centres or centres apply to city 
centres, town centres, district centres and local centres but exclude small parades of shops 
of purely neighbourhood significance. Unless they are identified as centres in Local Plans, 
existing out-of-centre developments, comprising or including main town centre uses, do not 
constitute town centres.
Transport assessment (TA): A comprehensive and systematic process that sets out 
transport issues relating to a proposed development. It identifies what measures will
