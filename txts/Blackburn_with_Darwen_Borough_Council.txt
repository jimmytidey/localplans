 Foreword  
I am pleased to introduce this  new Local Plan for Blackburn with Darwen. This document sets 
out an ambitious and exciting vision for the future of the Borough.  It provides an up to date 
planning policy framework to support growth  and to help target future investment in the Borough  
of the right type , to the right places. It includes new site allocations for the provision of new 
homes and jobs . Importantly it contains  a range of  policies to  help secure sustainable growth, 
protect ing the Borough  and its env ironment for future generati ons and helping to address  the 
climate emergency.  
This final draft version of the Local Plan has been prepared following extensive engagement  to 
date with residents, businesses, statutory consultees and other interested parties. An extensive 
library of su pporting documents sits alongside the plan itself . This is the last chance to have 
your say into the content of the plan as , once adopted by the Council, it will be the primary 
decision making tool in determining planning applications in the Borough for th e next 15 years.  
The c entral concept underpinning and guiding the structure of  this new Local Plan is one of a  
‘balanced growth’ st rategy . This will ensur e that all proposals  for new development give due 
consider ation to  their impact o n ‘people ’, ‘place’ and the ‘economy ’. The expectation  is for 
planning applications to d emonstrate  net gains against the  social, environmental and economic 
objectives of the plan .  
The planned growth  set out in this  Local Plan is best summarised by  six key ideas:  
1. The Blackbu rn Growth Axis : an economic  framework linking strategic development  
sites and key growth corridors across the  Borough and beyond;  
2. The Darwen Town Investment Plan : a series of major improvements for Darwen  
supported by the Darwen Town Deal ; 
3. A North East Bla ckburn Strategic Housing Site : a new neighbourhood on the edge of 
the town;  
4. A South East Blackburn Strategic Employment Site : to attract jobs and investment at 
a key motorway location;  
5. Blackburn Town Centre Major Development Sites : a unique opportunity to boost the 
vitality of Blackburn town centre; and  
6. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan : an important series of interventions to improve 
infrastructure for all, such as roads, schools and health facilities . 
We believe that this final draft Local Plan strikes the  right balance between the competing 
priorities of economic growth and environment protection although we accept that not everyone 
will agree with us . I would like to strongly encourage eve ryone to make your final views known  
to help us  ensure that the Bla ckburn with Darwen Local Plan (2021 -2037) is the best that it can 
be.

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  8 
 1. Introduction  
1.1. Planning affects us all. The homes we live in, the places we work, the greenspaces 
where we relax, and the roads we travel on are all a result of planning decisions. All 
Local Planning Authorities have a statutory duty to prepare a Local Plan. The Local 
Plan is the starting point for the determination of planning applications . 
1.2. The policy framework set out in this Local Plan will guide and shape development of 
Blackburn with D arwen for the next 15 years, to 2037. It sets the parameters for 
‘balanced growth’ to ensure that the area is open for business providing jobs and 
economic growth for future prosperity; that the climate emergency is tackled through 
new development (the Cou ncil’s ambition is to be carbon neutral by 2030); and that 
inequalities in health and deprivation across the Borough are addressed.  
1.3. The Blackburn with Darwen Local Plan 2021 -2037 sets a clear strategy for bringing land 
forward to address objectively assess ed needs in line with the presumption in favour of 
sustainable development. It is an important tool to give certainty and transparency to 
residents, landowners and businesses as to how the Borough will grow and develop. 
This will enable the Borough to attr act more funding and investment over this period.  
1.4. This Local Plan includes a combination of broad locations, land use designations and 
allocations to deliver the balanced growth strategy. It will seek to continue the recent 
transformation of the Borough by  ensuring that the planning policy framework facilitates 
the development of new growth sites to help create a sustainable, attractive, healthy 
and prosperous Blackburn with Darwen where people choose to live and work.  
1.5. This Local Plan is  prepared in accorda nce with the Town and Country Planning (Local 
Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 ). All references to Regulations in this document 
refer to these unless otherwise stated . A wide range of supporting documents provide 
the evidence and background context for the policies and proposals set out in the Plan. 
The Council has prepared the Plan in as positive a manner as possible in light of the 
evidence on which it is based . It has been prepared in accordance with relevant 
legislation, regulations and national policy set out in the Nation al Planning Policy 
Framework  (NPPF).  
1.6. This version of the Blackburn with Darwen Local Plan is referred to as the ‘Publication’ 
(Regulation 19) Local Plan. It is the version that the Council seeks to adopt, subject to 
examination, as the future framework for  decision making in the Borough. It builds upon 
feedback received during previous formal and informal consultations prepared under 
Regulation 18 and detailed here: Blackburn with Darwen Local Plan 2018 -2037 | 
Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council . 
1.1 Blackburn with Darwen’s Local Plan  
1.7. Blackburn with Darwen’s Local Plan currently comprises two documents – the Local 
Plan Part 1: Core Strategy (adopted January  2011) and the Local Plan Part 2: Site 
Allocations and Development Management Policies (adopted December 2015). This 
new Local Plan 2021 -2037 will replace both of these documents.  A list of existing 
policies in the adopted Local Plan documents, and their a nticipated status following 
adoption of the new Plan (in terms of their replacement, saving, or deletion) is set out in  
Appendix F – List of policies  saved /replaced .  
1.8. The current Part 1 and Part 2 Local Plan documents are supported by a number of 
different Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs), supplementary guidance notes  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  9 
 or planning advisory notes all of which are available to view on the Council’s website. 
These are listed in full in Appendix H – List of SPDs and other relevant documents. 
Confirm ation of  whether or  not they are intended to be retained, updated, or 
deleted/replaced following adoption of the new Local Plan  is provided . Appendix H also 
references a numbe r of new SPDs that are referenced in this document and that are 
intended to  expand upon  specific  policies set out in this Local Plan.  The programme for 
the preparation/update of SPDs will be set out in a future update of the Council’s Local 
Development Sch eme. 
1.9. The development plan is at the heart of the planning system with a requirement set out 
in law that planning decisions must be taken in line with the development plan unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise. Adopted Plan documents (and associ ated 
guidance documents) will continue to be applied and be the starting point for the 
determination of planning applications until they are formally replaced by adoption of the 
new Local Plan. Policies emerging in this new Local Plan may however be given some 
weight in determining planning applications. This will be determined in line with 
paragraph 48 of the NPPF.  
1.10.  The Local Plan (both the existing adopted plan and the emerging Local Plan to 2037) 
should be read alongside the Joint Lancashire Minerals and Waste Local Plan which is 
also currently under review. Local planning policy for minerals and waste - Lancashire 
County Council . The Blackburn with  Darwen Local Plan and the Joint Lancashire 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan comprise the full development plan for the area  
1.2 Document structure  
1.11.  The Local Plan comprises the following main sections  
Section 2: The Plan: setting the scene, vision and strategic o bjectives  
This section provides an overview of Blackburn with Darwen today, the challenges it 
currently faces, and the opportunities for the future. It then sets out a Vision to 2037 and 
a set of strategic objectives.  
Section 3: Core Policies (strategic po licies) 
This section sets out the overarching spatial strategy at the outset via two key policies: 
Core Policy 1: A Balanced Growth Strategy, and Core Policy 2: The Spatial Approach. 
This section then follows with a further set of 10 strategic policies set around the 
overarching themes of ‘People’, ‘Place’ and ‘Economy’.  
This Plan includes different types of policies. ‘CP’ policies are Core Policies and are all 
considered to be strategic policies in line with the NPPF.  
Section 4: De velopment Management Policies (non -strategic policies)  
This section details 39 Development Management (DM) policies again structured around 
the overarching themes of ‘People’, ‘Place’ and ‘Economy’. ‘DM’ policies are all 
considered local, ‘non -strategic’ p olicies.  
Section 5: Implementation, including Site Specific Policies (strategic policies)  
This section sets out how the Core & D M policies in the Plan will be monitor ed and 
delivered. It provides links to a monitoring framework alongside a site -specific po licy for 
each proposed site allocation setting out key development considerations. Site -specific  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  10 
 policies comprise ‘H’ housing policies, ‘E’ employment policies, ‘MU’ policies, and ‘GT’ 
Gypsy and Traveller policies. Site -specific policies are considered st rategic in nature, as 
successful development of them over the Local P lan period is key to delivery of the Plan.  
Public Consultation: h ow to submit your comments  
1.12.  We would like to thank you for your support and involvement so far in helping us reach 
this st age and invite you once again to comment on our plans before we submit them to 
the Planning Inspectorate for examination. This is the last opportunity to influence the 
Local Plan 2021 -2037.  
1.13.  In accordance with Regulation 20 comments at this stage may only r efer to points of 
‘soundness’ or legal compliance of the Plan. Paragraph 35 of the NPPF provides further 
information. For this reason any comments must be made using the official Regulation 
19 Representation Forms  to be valid. These are available:  
 online a t www.blackburn.gov.uk/localplan ; 
 at all Council libraries and the Barlow in Edgworth ; or 
 by contacting the Growth Team via email:  forwardplanning@blackburn.gov.uk  or 
calling 01254 585962     
1.14.  Please note that comments may be submitted from Friday 4th February  2022 up to 
5pm on Friday 18th March 2022 . Late submissions will not be accepted. The Council is 
also unable to accept comments u nless they are provided on the official form or provide 
all the information requirements set out on the representation form. Comments may be 
rejected if they are submitted in different formats and do not contain all the information 
requested on the officia l form.  
What happens next?  
1.15.  The Council will review all valid representations received during the consultation period 
and consider whether further modifications to the Local Plan are necessary and 
justified. A proposed response will be taken to Council Foru m for approval. The Council 
will then aim to submit the Local Plan to the Planning Inspectorate in the summer of 
2022.  
1.16.  The documents to be submitted will include the Local Plan, all supporting evidence 
base documents, valid representations received during  the Regulation 19 consultation 
period, and associated Council responses and proposed modifications. The formal 
Examination in Public (EiP) of the Local Plan 2021 -2037 will then commence.  
1.17.  The EiP is anticipated to take around 12 months from start to finis h. This will be 
dependent upon the nature and scale of issues raised during this consultation and by 
the Planning Inspector. The new Local Plan is therefore anticipated to be adopted in 
2023.  
   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  11 
 2. The Plan  
2.1 Blackburn with Darwen today  
2.1 Blackburn with Darwen’s Local Plan is based upon a detailed understanding of the 
Borough’s characteristics as well as the key challenges and opportunities it faces over 
the next 15 years of the Plan period and beyond. To achieve the vision and ambitions of 
this Plan, it is important to consider the underpinning evidence to ensure that the needs 
of the existing community are met, whilst enabling the potential for growth within the 
Borough and recognising the value of natural assets and the unique characteristics of 
the area .Located within a dramatic landscape setting, Blackburn with Darwen is a key 
geographical and cultural gateway to Pennine Lancashire. The Borough hosts a range of 
high quality environmental assets including two Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSIs), many  Biological Heritage Sites (BHSs) , a number of Local Wildlife Sites (LWSs) 
and four Local Nature Reserves (LNRs). Easily accessible to Manchester and Leeds, i t 
is also located close to internationally significant destinations of the Lake District and 
Yorkshire Dales. The Borough is characterised by relatively compact urban areas to 
create a hierarchy of settlements, with almost 40% of surrounding land designate d as 
Green Belt .A key ambition of this Plan is to achieve balanced growth, which is socially 
and economically inclusive as well as environmentally sustainable. Effective growth 
should utilise Blackburn with Darwen’s strengths to build cohesive, resilient and 
sustainable communities, broadly proportionate to their existing scale. Future growth 
should be supported by the timely delivery of infrastructure to effectively support planned 
development needs. This requires an understanding of existing infrastructu re capacity as 
well as future requirements, which should still allow some flexibility in terms of changing 
needs.  
Facts and Figures  
2.4 The Borough has a population of 150,030 (ONS, 2020), which has increased by 2.1% in 
the last 10 years. The Housing and Econo mic Needs Assessment (HENA) indicates that , 
based on baseline Office for National Statistics (ONS) projections,  the population is likely 
to decrease by 1% over th e Plan period . Following consideration of the ONS baseline 
position, the HENA details a realis tic economic growth scenario for the Borough that will 
lead to a population increase of around 4% (the scenario adopted in this Local Plan). 
Slow population growth (or decline) could become a risk if birth rates were to continue to 
decline, given the natio nal trend; however, birth rates in the Borough are higher than the 
national average. Life expectancy is lower in Blackburn with Darwen, compared to the 
average across England by approximately 3 years, so population growth has been 
moderate, despite higher birth rates. Life expectancy figures have also demonstrated the 
inequality across the Borough with the difference between the most and least deprived 
areas for males at 11.8 years and females at 7.6 years1.  
2.5 Population density is around twice that of the r egional average, estimated at 1,092 
persons per sq km2. The age structure for Blackburn with Darwen indicates that there is 
a younger age profile than average as 28% of the population is under 20 years old3. 
Over the Plan period, populatio n projections est imate the over -65 age group to increase 
by 28% and those over 80 years old to increase by 46%4. Recognising the current

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  12 
 demographic of the Borough  along  with changes to the age structure is key . This 
ensur es that policies, such as housing for instance, ref lects the requirements and 
aspirations of an ageing population as well as providing affordable homes for younger 
people in the Borough who want to continue to live here, supported by the jobs and 
quality of life to maintain that.  
2.6 The Index of Multiple Depr ivation provides an overview of statistics on poverty, health, 
education, crime, living environment, housing and access to services. Over one third of 
Blackburn with Darwen’s lower super output areas are among the most deprived decile 
(tenth) when compared  nationally, demonstrating the level of inequality across the 
Borough5. Health and wellbeing indicators in the Borough also highlight the inequalities, 
with headline figures that are generally worse than the UK average. The JSNA: 
Summar y Review 2020  sets o ut these indicators, including the healthy life expectancy, 
which ranks Blackburn with Darwen 21st lowest in England. Health inequalities are 
underpinned by the conditions in which people are born, live, work and grow older, which 
is also known as the soci al determinants of health. The environment, employment 
opportunities and living conditions are therefore a key factor of influence for health and 
wellbeing.  
2.7 The latest ONS population figures (2020) indicate that 10.1% of 16 -64 year olds in 
Blackburn with D arwen do not have any qualifications, which is above the national 
average of 6.4%. The largest sectors of employment in the Borough are health and 
social care, wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing, which in total make up almost 
54% of all jobs6. Skills and employment are also an important consideration for the Local 
Plan to help bring forward the right opportunities for residents to support the existing 
economy and education facilities.  
2.8 The vision and strategic objectives of this Plan are focused o n priority themes of 
‘People’, ‘Place’ and ‘Economy’, which are also reflected in policies to help achieve 
balanced growth to meet the needs of the population, whilst improving quality of life, 
supporting a carbon neutral agenda and nurturing the distincti ve qualities of the 
Borough.  
People  
2.9 The NPPF places great importance on the role of planning policies to consider health 
and wellbeing outcomes across the population, which encompasses physical and mental 
wellbeing as well as safety and accessibility. The  Department of Health sets outs the key 
elements of a holistic approach to promote wellbeing, which focuses on interventions to 
promote physical activity and fitness, volunteering, social interaction and community 
cohesion. The Blackburn with Darwen Corpor ate Plan also sets out its aims to reduce 
health inequalities and improve health across the Borough by giving people the 
opportunity to start well, live well and age well, which is strongly advocated by the ‘Social 
Determinants of Health’ model (PHE, 2017)7.  
2.10 As outlined above the JSNA considers some of the key indicators of health and 
wellbeing in the Borough, which also highlight the level of inequality. For example, 3% 
fewer of the Borough’s population reported good or very good health outcomes than the 
rest of England and 4% more than the country’s average reporting long term health 
limitations. Encouraging and enabling opportunity to foster healthy and active lifestyles

 over a life course can help prevent and reduce health issues as people get older. 
Blackburn with Darwen have also made a commitment (Local Government Declaration 
on Healthy Weight) to promote healthy weight within their health and wellbeing 
framework. Unhealthy weight is a serious public health problem that increases disability, 
disease a nd death and has substantial long term economic, well -being and social costs, 
with higher levels seen among lower socio -economic groups. This Plan also seeks to 
encourage active travel, enhance the provision and access to safe, open spaces as well 
as healt h facilities and services to help tackle some of the key issues across the 
Borough.  
2.11 A key aim for the policies within this  Local  Plan is to provide an integrated approach to 
consider the location of housing, economic uses and community facilities and servi ces 
that will meet the needs of residents and support their wellbeing with adequate private 
and shared spaces, which includes access to nature. Provision of high quality housing to 
offer sufficient choice for all residents is a key objective of the Local P lan, and a key 
factor in terms of supporting the needs of the community. The Housing and Economic 
Needs Assessment (HENA) was jointly commissioned between Hyndburn and Blackburn 
with Darwen to determine the need for various types of housing. Average house price is 
more affordable than the average in England and therefore home ownership in the 
Borough is quite high. Understanding the demographics of the population and specialist 
needs has helped shaped the polic ies for housing provision to deliver a timely s upply 
and an appropriate mix of types and tenures to support the growth of diverse 
communities.  
2.12 The NPPF reiterates the important role that Local Authorities play to help deliver the 
Government’s objective to meet local housing need requirement s, by identi fying a 
sufficient amount of land to come forward without unnecessary delay. There is also an 
important recognition that the housing stock needs to meet the needs of an ageing 
population, which should provide flexibility in terms of their needs and allow f or 
independent living through provision of suitable housing. The JSNA also outlines the 
projected rise in dementia in the Borough, which is expected to rise by 35% between 
2020 and 2030. The Council has engaged with health care providers to identify specia list 
needs and will continue to work closely with the commissioning team to consider future 
demands.  
Place  
2.13 Blackburn with Darwen’s landscape setting is one of its major assets adding distinctive 
character and bringing both environmental and economic benefi ts. The Borough falls 
within two National Character Areas – Lancashire Valleys and the Southern Pennines. 
By contrast the urban areas are classified as historic core, industrial age and suburban 
in the landscape character assessment, which demonstrates the  diversity in localised 
character across the Borough. This character and diversity of landscape and townscape 
should be protected and enhanced by appropriate development in the future and 
therefore the Local Plan has a key role in directing development to the right locations 
and paying respect to the historic, natural and built environment.  
2.14 Blackburn with Darwen declared a climate emergency in 2019 and has set a goal to be 
net carbon neutral by 2030. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is widely 
recognise d as a key factor in mitigating climate change, with the greatest contributors in 
the Borough associated with combustion of fuels in industrial and residential buildings 
followed by transportation. A number of interventions will be required to address the 
challenge in the coming years, which must seek to reduce emissions across all sectors 
including industrial and commercial buildings and processes, agriculture, energy supply, 
domestic buildings and transport. Since 2010 there has been a decline in carbon d ioxide  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  14 
 emissions per person; however this has slowed over time and the latest figures report a 
slight increase betw een 2018 and 2019 (DBEIS, 2021)8.  
2.15 The Local Plan Climate Change and Natural Capital Study (2021) provides an integrated 
assessment to identi fy how the Local Plan can contribute to the Council’s goals of 
becoming carbon neutral, whilst addressing the latest Government requirements to 
achieve Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) from new development. Through the process of 
habitat mapping, the report ide ntifies over 1,000 hectares for BNG focus as well as 
2,400 hectares of improved grassland that could be considered for woodland planting to 
increase carbon sequestration. The range of natural capital assets and ecosystems 
services that they provide, highli ght the value of assets in the Borough to support 
wellbeing and nature recovery. The Environment Act 2021 has also strengthened the 
legislative requirements on biodiversity, air quality, water pollution, resource efficiency 
and waste reduction.  
2.16 Although Bl ackburn with Darwen has 88% lower renewable energy capacity than the  UK 
average ( kW/100 households)9 it has a higher number of renewable energy installations 
per 100 households, indicating that these are generally smaller scale. Photovoltaic units 
generate  78% of total renewable energy and there is limited contribution to the energy 
mix from wind energy. Renewable and low carbon energy will be supported in the Local 
Plan to help realise the climate objectives for the Borough, as well as improving energy 
efficiency.  
2.17 Linked to wider targets for climate change, transport is also a key consideration for 
economic growth, health and wellbeing, sustainability, air quality and feasibility of 
development options. Although the level of car ownership in the Borough is  lower than 
regional or national levels, there is a high dependency on cars for commuting, especially 
in more rural areas. It is recognised that there is a need for modal shift and Local 
Authorities must use a range of interventions to support active trave l as well as ensuring 
a well connected public transport system. There is a lower rate of cycling to work than 
the regional and national average; however, walking to work is much higher in the 
Borough when compared to other areas. Provision of safe and acce ssible networks to 
facilitate active travel can help encourage further modal shift in the future to deliver 
multifaceted benefits to health and wellbeing as well as reducing carbon emissions and 
improving air quality.  
2.18 Around 515  hectares of land in the Borough is identified as having a medium probability 
of flooding  (Flood Zone 2)10, which is equivalent to app roximately 3.7 % of the total area  
(this includes all reservoirs in the Borough) . Of this land, around 352 hectares is 
identified  as having a high probability (greater than a 1 in 100 annual probability of river 
flooding, Zone 3), equivalent to 2.5% of the total area.   
2.19 Blackburn is situated on the River Blakewater and Darwen is located within the valley of 
the River Darwen. A number  of rural areas in the south of the Borough have been 
categorised as high priority areas, as has most of Darwen. The built up areas of 
Blackburn and Darwen are vulnerable to pluvial flood risk on a localised basis so 
consideration should be given to permea bility of surfaces, SUDs and green infrastructure 
as well as urban heat island effect. Good design can maximise the benefits of the natural

 surroundings to ensure the development site responds positively to the natural and 
existing built surroundings.  
2.20 The National Model Design Code (NMDC) provides detailed guidance to endorse 
successful design principles in local plan policies, setting out 10 characteristics of good 
design. Good design goes beyond the aesthetic context in terms of how a new 
development inte grates with its existing surroundings; it can also create healthy, safe, 
environmentally responsive and distinctive places. Well designed, energy efficient 
development proposals that provide a mix of uses, inclusive public spaces, enhance 
nature and integr ate with existing development will create more resilient places and 
diverse communities that can thrive and stimulate future balanced growth.  
Economy  
2.21 There are currently 67,600 economically active residents in the Borough, which 
represents 71% of the total  working age population and is 8% low er than the rest of the 
country11. Traditionally Blackburn and Darwen were associated with the textiles industry, 
which suffered sustained economic restructuring. The Borough has a higher proportion 
of process plant and machine operatives compared to the national average; however, 
the largest sector of employment is the health sector (public health and social care). 
There is a significantly lower proportion of workers in a professional occupation in 
Blackburn with Darwen compared to Great Britain, which is 23% higher, resulting in 
lower than average earnings in the Borough . 
2.22 There is a high level of net inflow commuters to the Borough, particularly for degree level 
jobs, which highlights a skills shortage and poor graduate retention. It is important that 
education and skills provision meets the needs of the existing and future  labour market, 
which must also consider effective skills retention, particularly for graduates (noting that 
there is no university facility in the area). It is important to have a diverse economy to 
support resilience and provide opportunities for all, wh ich includes enabling opportunities 
for older people and those with physical and mental health conditions to remain 
employed. There should also be a recognition of the rural economy and support 12for 
diversification, in particular for the sustainable use of  land and promotion of innovation in 
this area.  
2.23 Recent impacts of COVID 19 have contributed to significant changes in the way people 
live, work and travel, with many of these changes likely to have longer -term 
consequences. Many businesses and high streets  have struggled to adapt and maintain 
footfall throughout the pandemic; however, there are some patterns that continue to last 
into the future and certainly extending into the lifetime of this Local Plan. Local centres 
can have an important role to play in  the future and many of the trends that have 
emerged in the pandemic will shape demands in the coming years. For example, w ith 
more people working from home the concept o f the ’20-minute n eighbourhood’  should 
be an ambition of the Council and  endorsed to allow people to meet their daily needs in 
the course of a 20-minute  walk. This concept is underpinned by accessibility to nearby 
open space and parks for use as essential daily exercise and  with shared public outdoor 
spaces that can allow social interaction, for many that have experienced severe isolation 
throughout the pandemic. The Borough’s towns and local centres should therefore be 
the focus of a wide range of activity to ensure a healt hy local economy but also support

 2.2 The Vision  
2.24 Blackburn with Darwen’s Local Plan is the spatial manifestation of the wider ambitions 
and goals of the Council and its partners. It  is a product of the issues set out in Section 
2.1 and  sets out how the Council will guide investment and development in the area to 
2037 to help deliver the sustainable grow th of the Borough . 
The Vision: Blackburn with Darwen 2037  
1. In 2037 Blackburn with Darwen will be: a thriving, carbon neutral Borough13 ; recognised 
as a place of strong leadership and community cohesion; a place that has invested in its 
communities and infr astructure; a place with a high quality built and natural environment; 
a place strengthened by the contributions of the different communities who live and work 
here.  
 
a. The People : the population of around 157,000 residents will have significantly 
improved health, education, social and economic well -being outcomes; poverty, 
deprivation, inequalities of health and inequalities of access to services will be 
significantly reduced; suitable homes, services and facilities will be in place to ensure 
that the needs  of all parts of the community are met.  
 
b. The Place:  residents will take pride in their local neighbourhood as an attractive, 
clean and safe place to live, work, visit and move around in; improved infrastructure 
will have enhanced connectivity and encourage d modal shift to more sustainable 
modes of transport14; the Borough’s historic environment will be celebrated and 
enhanced; it will demonstrate increased resilience to the impacts of climate change; 
renewable energy will have been embraced; it will have enh anced green 
infrastructure networks (including access to and use of its waterways); and nature 
recovery projects will have significantly improved the biodiversity of the Borough;  
  
i. Blackburn  will remain a centre of regional importance; provide the widest r ange of 
high-order services in Pennine Lancashire; have a stronger economy and highly

 The Vision: Blackburn with Darwen 2037  
c. The Economy:  the local economy will be strong, resilient and inclusive, supporting 
around 79,000 jobs, helping to facilitate social mobility in the Borough; our town 
centres, businesses and employment areas will be flourishing; the rural economy will 
have strengthened through farm diversification and there will be an enhanced role for 
tourism.  
 
 
2.3 The Strategic Objectives  
2.25 Twelve strategic objectives are set out to ass ist in delivery of T he Vision: Blackburn with 
Darwen 2037. The objectives are grouped around the priority themes of ‘People’, ‘Place’ 
and the ‘Economy’.  
2.26 The strategic objectives and subsequent policy framework seek to address the inherent 
conflicts of development: the Council’s  strong ambitions for growth and regeneration; 
challenging carbon neutral goals and environmental net gains; and improving people’s 
quality of life and well -being. For this reason it is essential that the strategic objectives 
are considered complementary t o each other . They will not be  applied in an isolated, 
exclusive fashion.  To ensure effective delivery of the vision all new developments and 
subsequent planning decisions should seek to deliver social, environmental and 
economic net gains.

 3. The Spatial Strategy: Core Policies  
3.1. The Vision and Strategic Objectives set out above provide the framework for the new 
Local Plan for Blackburn with Darwen.  They set clear ambitions to help ensure a better 
quality of life for everyone, both now and for future generations.  
3.2. In order to achi eve these ambitions the Borough needs to grow. A growth strategy will 
continue the success of recent investment and regeneration. It will provide the 
opportunity to improve the health and well -being of residents, the productivity and 
success of businesses and the quality of the environment.  
3.3. To ensure that this growth takes places in an appropriate, sustainable way a suite of 
strategic Core Policies are set out in this section. These policies provide the main 
strategic policy framework for the Borough. They  emphasise the complementary social, 
environmental and economic roles that the planning system must perform to deliver truly 
sustainable development. These three roles cannot be undertaken in isolation as they 
are mutually dependent of one another.  
3.4. The str ategic Core Policies firstly set the ‘Spatial Principles’ for new development, 
making clear that the growth strategy is one of ‘balanced growth’. Following the spatial 
principles are thematic policies around ‘People’, ‘Place’ and the ‘Economy’. The policie s 
taken as a whole will ensure new housing and employment growth will be accompanied 
by supporting infrastructure and environmental improvements.  
3.5. The strategic Core Policies (CPs) are presented as follows:

 3.1 Spatial Principles  
Core Policy 1 (CP1): A Balanced Growth Strategy  
3.6. Policy CP1  summarises the overarching  policy framework against which all future 
development proposals in the Borough are to be considered. It reflects the principles on 
which the Local Plan is based: a local sustainable development policy:  
Core Policy 1 (CP1) : A Balanced Growth Strategy  
1. The Council will pursue a ‘Balanced Growth’ strategy over the plan period. The policies 
set out in the Local Plan ensure that this will be achieved through:  
 
i. The quantum of development  – an appropriate balance of new homes and 
jobs will be provided: the Council will ensure that its economic growth 
ambitions can be met; that corresponding levels of new homes are provided 
to stem net out -migration; and to ensure a sufficient working age population 
is resident in the Borough to support the planned economic growth;  
 
ii. The distribution of development  – a balanced distribution of growth will 
take place to ensure that settlements receive levels of growth that are 
broadly proportionate to their existing size and role; and  
 
iii. The overall approach to development  – a balance of ensuring that 
development proposals consider their impact on people, place and the 
economy: development is expected to demonstrate social, environmental 
and economic net gains against the strategic objectives of the plan.

Core Policy 2 (CP2): The Spatial Approach  
3.7. Policy CP2  sets the general principles for the direction of future development and 
investment in the  Borough. CP2 confirms  where development should be located and 
what types of development the Council will support in each location; what the Council 
sees as the roles of the two main towns, smaller settlements and the countryside; and 
the Council’s approach to development proposed within the Borough’s Gree n Belt or on 
designated Safeguarded Land.  
3.8. Policy CP2  supports  the six key ideas on which the balanced growth strategy of the Plan 
is based .  
3.9. The six key ideas  are:  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  22 
 1. The Blackburn Growth Axis  – an economic framework of strategic and local 
development site s and  opportunities that link the M65, key growth corridors and 
Samlesbury Enterprise Zone, a future economic driver of the Borough, with Blackburn 
Town Centre ; 
2. Darwen Town Investment Plan  – delivery of a series of wide -ranging improvements 
for Darwen i ncluding a transformed town centre core, and a combination of new and 
regenerated housing , and higher value employment  and mixed -use sites supported by 
the Darwen Town Deal fund;  
3. North East Blackburn Strategic Housing Site – a significant new urban extension 
neighbourhood providing up to 1,500 new homes over the Plan period and beyond 
through an urban extension (on former safeguarded land);  
4. South East Blackburn Strategic Employment Site – a large -scale employment site 
at a key motorway location to attract jobs and investment to help improve the qualitative 
offer of development opportunities;  
5. Blackburn Town Centre Major Development Site s – a major opportunity to boost 
the vitality of Blackburn Town Centre through new res idential, commercial and 
educational developments  – part of a wider programme of investment in the Town 
Centre East Investment Area ; and  
6. Infrastructure Delivery Plan  – an important series of interventions to support 
development proposals and improve i nfrastructure for all including  roads, schools, health 
facilities; green infrastructure and sustainable travel.  
Core Policy 2 (CP2): The Spatial Approach  
1. The majority of new development over the plan period will be in the urban areas of 
Blackburn and Darwen  as shown on the Polic y Map.  
 
2. The focus for future investment decisions and growth in spatial areas will be guided by 
the following key principles:  
 
i. Blackburn urban area  - Blackburn will continue to accommodate the majority of 
the Borough’s strategic deve lopment needs including a new strategic housing site, 
strategic town centre mixed use site and strategic employment allocation. 
Additional growth sites and infrastructure improvements will supp ort the ‘Blackburn 
Growth Axis’17 to become the key future econo mic driver of the Borough.  
 
ii. Darwen urban area - Darwen will accommodate more general development needs 
of an appropriate scale to support the existing population and services. This will 
include a range of housing, mixed use, employment and educational deve lopments 
to help reduce the need to travel out of the town. Development proposals should 
support Darwen’s transition to a modern market town, and a destination ‘maker -
town’ in line with the aims of the Darwen Town Investment Plan. Developments 
that support  the role of Darwen as a tourism, leisure and recreation gateway to the 
West Pennine Moors18 will also be supported.

18 As defined on the Polic y Map  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  23 
 Core Policy 2 (CP2): The Spatial Approach  
 
iii. Rural Villages  - new development outside of the urban areas should be focused 
within the village boundaries of Edgworth, Chapeltown, Hoddlesden, Belmont and 
Pleasington.  
 
iv. Countryside Areas  - outside villages, within the designated Countryside Areas, 
the amount of new development will be tightly limited. Individual opportunities  that 
help to diversify the rural economy or support tourism  will be supported where they 
are appropriate in nature and scale to the rural area. If major developed sites 
within the open countryside become available for redevelopment, the priority will 
be to minimise the amount of new development that takes place an d the level of 
activity that a new use generates, while securing a satisfactory outcome of renewal 
considering landscape and biodiversity impacts.  
 
v. Green Belt  - new development proposed in the Green Belt shall be regarded as 
inappropriate unless it falls within one of the  exceptions set out in the NPPF19 (or 
any successor document). Inappropriate development in the Green Belt should not 
be approved except in very special circumstances.  
 
vi. Safeguarded Land  – areas identified as Safeguarded Land on the Polic y Map will 
not be granted planning permission for permanent development during the Plan 
period, unless a Local  Plan review has commenced and proposes the 
development  or other speci fic circumstances are justified20.

3.10.  To ensure an efficient and effective use of land the Local Plan supports a spatial 
approach that balances regeneration and renewal of the urban areas with urban 
extensions in the most sustainable locations. Blackburn will be the focus for new 
strategic dev elopment sites (housing, employment and town centre allocations) to 
support development of the Blackburn Growth Axis  economic framework . Darwen will 
see its own programme of proportionate regeneration and development, including 
housing,  employment and mixe d-use allocations. All new development will be 
underpinned by a supporting infrastructure delivery plan (IDP).

20 Such circumstances would have to align with the vision and strategic objectives of this Local Plan or related plans, 
for example a site’s potential to contribute significantly to the Climate Emergency was demonstrated.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  24 
 3.11.  National policy attaches great importance to the protection of the Green Belt, with the 
fundamental aim being to prevent urban sprawl  by keeping land permanently open. The 
essential characteristics of the Green Belt includes its openness and permanence. Any 
changes to Green Belt boundaries must be fully evidenced and justified, through the 
preparation or updating of plans.  
3.12.  The Blackburn  with Darwen Green Belt Assessment (December 2019) provides an 
independent, robust and transparent assessment of the Borough’s Green Belt. The 
Green Belt Assessment was undertaken in two stages: the first being a high level 
appraisal identifying broad stra tegic variations in contribution across the Borough of the 
Green Belt to the five purposes set out in NPPF; the second providing more specific 
information on the potential harm of releasing specific areas of Green Belt. The Council 
has used this assessment  to make decisions regarding the release of Green Belt land in 
the Borough  
3.13.  This Local Plan releases a significant area of land from the Green Belt located at 
Junction 5 of the M65 in Blackburn. As outlined in Policy CP10: The Economy (and 
Growth Site Allo cation E179) this strategic site is allocated for development to enable the 
Borough’s identified employment requirements to be met in full over the plan period and 
represents a key part of the employment strategy of the Plan. Additional land adjacent to 
the propose allocation is also removed from the Green Belt and safeguarded to allow for 
longer -term employment needs to be met. This will ensure that the revised Green Belt 
boundary will have permanence and endure beyond the Plan period in line with the 
NPPF . 
3.14.  Additional minor modifications to the existing Green Belt boundary are included on the 
Polic y Map. These relate to improving the alignment of the urban/village boundaries with 
ground features and resolving mapping inconsistencies or errors from the previ ous Local 
Plan which did not include the same level of digitisation and online map provision. These 
can only be rectified through a Local Plan review process.  
3.15.  The Polic y Map identifies the revised Green Belt boundary for Blackburn with Darwen. 
Land within the Borough’s Green Belt will be strictly protected from inappropriate 
development in accordance with national policy.  
Countryside Areas  
3.16.  In addition to the Borough’s Green Belts, which have a specific purpose in preventing 
the uncontrolled growth of the ur ban area, Blackburn with Darwen also has large areas 
of open countryside.  These areas are a valuable resource, serving environmental 
functions as important habitats and landscapes, social functions as areas for our 
communities to enjoy and interact with t he countryside, and economic functions as the 
base of our rural economy.  
3.17.  These economic uses will include development needed to sustain or encourage local 
employment as part of the diversification of the rural economy as opposed to that which 
could be mor e appropriate in urban or village areas. Policy CP2: The Spatial Approach 
aims to preserve what is important in the countryside and manage change in a way that 
balances sometimes competing pressures.  
 
 
Safeguarded Land   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  25 
 3.18.  The Plan identifies two areas of Safe guarded Land to meet the Borough’s longer -term 
development needs.  Although these sites have been removed from the Green Belt, they 
are not allocated for development before 2037. This ensures that the revised Green Belt 
boundary identified by the Plan will  endure well beyond 2037.  
3.19.  Policy CP2: The Spatial Approach ensures that these areas remain able to 
accommodate development in the longer term, and that their development potential is 
not compromised by piecemeal change or unacceptable development in advanc e of this. 
These areas will only be developed if a clear need is identified, or at a future plan review 
stage.  
3.20.  The identification of an area of land in this policy does not guarantee that the whole of 
that area will be deemed suitable for development at s ome future stage.  A future Plan 
review, or detailed planning application, considering the release of any land identified 
under this policy will need to undertake a full appraisal of the area suitable for release, 
and the impact on landscape and other cons iderations of doing so.  
3.21.  The NPPF refers to Strategic Policies as those which ‘set out an overall strategy for the 
pattern, scale and design quality of places’. They should provide ‘a clear strategy for 
bringing sufficient land forward, and at a sufficient rate, to address objectively assessed 
needs over the plan period, in line with the presumption in favour of sustainable 
development. This should include planning for and allocating sufficient sites to deliver 
the st rategic priorities of the area’21.

Core Policy 3 (CP3): Health and Well -being  
3.23.  Improving the physical and mental health and the well -being of residents, workers and 
visitors is a key strategic objective of the Local Plan. Our policies recognise the 
important link between the natural and built environment and long -term health and 
wellbeing outcomes.  Policy CP3 sets o ut our strategic approach to helping manage new 
development to influence health and well -being in the most positive way possible. This is 
necessary both in terms of a scheme’s design but also in its wider impacts beyond the 
site boundary . 
Core Policy 3 (CP3): Health and Well -being 
1. To help tackle health inequalities in the Borough, new development will be required, as 
far as is practicable, to:  
 
i. Maximise its contribution to enable and support health and wellbeing outcomes;  
ii. Avoid or mitigate any potential n egative impacts of new development (such as 
adverse impact on air or water quality, loss of shared or open space and the Green 
and Blue Infrastructure network, including Nature Recovery Networks);  
iii. Support healthy lifestyles, including the adoption of Active Design and active travel 
principles to make physical activity an easy, practical and attractive choice; and  
iv. Consider the local food environment, including access to local food shops and 
integrat ion of community food growing.  
 
2. A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is required for all development that requires an 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and any other proposal where the local 
planning authority considers it appropriate.

3.24.  Creating environments that encourage people to be physically active has the potential to 
improve the physical and mental health and well -being of the Borough’s population. 
Active Design  is rooted in Sport England’s aims and objectives to promote the role of 
sport and physical activity in creating healthy and sustainable communities. It is a key 
guidance document intended to help unify health, design and planning by promoting the 
right conditions and environments for individuals and communities to lead active and 
healthy lifestyles. It identifies Ten Principles of Active Design: activity for all; walkable 
communities; connected walking a nd cycling routes; co -location of community; network 
of multifunctional open space; high quality streets and spaces; appropriate infrastructure; 
active buildings, management, maintenance, monitoring and evaluation; and activity 
promotion and local champion s.  
3.25.  Policy CP3 will ensure these design principles and guidelines are central to all 
development proposed in the Borough. BREEAM , Home Quality Mark  (HQM) and 
CEEQUAL  are all schemes that  can be used to ensure that the high -level principles of 
active design are met and implemented where possible durin g each stage of a project’s 
lifecycle.     
3.26.  To ensure that development promotes and contributes to a healthy living environment, 
proposals should consider health outcomes at pre -application stage, taking into account 
relevant adopted strategies and policies . Policy CP3 requires a Health Impact 
Assessment to accompany the most significant new development proposals over the 
plan period to maximise the opportunities for promoting healthy lifestyles within new 
development. This will include any application subje ct to Environmental Impact 
Assessment but also additional schemes that the Council considers significant in terms 
of their proposed use and/or location. The fundamental principles of how to carry out 
good qu ality Health Impact Assessments  are set out in th e Department of Health’s 
‘Health Impact Assessment Tools ’ (2010).  
3.27.  Developments should consider how their proposals can improve the local food 
environment for both consumption and production of healthier food options, for example 
through incorporating on -site community food growing spaces, ensuring landscaping is 
flexible so that spaces may be adapted for growing opportunit ies and increasing access 
to healthy food convenience stores . 
Core Policy 4 (CP4): Housing Development  
3.28.  The delivery of new housing of the right type, in the right locations and at the right time 
will be a key factor in implementing the Balanced Growth Stra tegy set out in Policy CP1. 
The Local Plan must ensure that sufficient homes are delivered to support the Council’s 
economic growth ambitions (see Policy CP10) and that the type of homes delivered 
meet the needs of all of Blackburn with Darwen’s existing a nd future residents, whilst 
contributing towards the goal of a carbon neutral Borough.  
3.29.  Core Policy CP4: Housing Development confirms the Plan’s overall housing requirement 
figure and sets out where new homes will be delivered and over what time period. It  also 
sets the strategic policy framework around affordable housing, self and custom build 
housing, quality and type of housing required, and gypsy and traveller accommodation 
provision.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  29 
  Core Policy 4 (CP4): Housing Development  
Housing requirement, location and delivery  
1. The Council will seek to deliver a minimum of 447 net new dwellings per annum (dpa) 
over the plan period 2021 -2037 in line with the mix set out in Policy DM3. Suitable land 
will be allocated to include a buffer to allow for flexibilit y, choice and competition.  
 
2. A range of site sizes and locations will be provided. Site allocations are identified in the 
Housing Growth Allocation Policies. A new strategic housing site ( Policy H 195) in North 
East Blackburn will be allocated to ensure del ivery of the qualitative and quantitative 
housing requirement for this plan period, and provide additional land for beyond the 
plan period.  
 
3. The housing trajectory sets out the projected rate of housing delivery over the plan 
period. The Council will monit or delivery rates annually and take action as necessary to 
ensure that adequate delivery rates are maintained.  
 
Affordable housing needs   
 
4. On developments of 10 or more dwellings at least 20% of homes delivered will be 
expected to be affordable units in accordance with Policy DM5 and the Council’s 
Affordable Housing Guide for Developers SPD. Affordable rent or shared ownership 
products must b e retained as affordable units in perpetuity. On -site provision is 
preferred to encourage mixed communities, however provision off -site via commuted 
sums may be appropriate in limited circumstances.  
 
Self and Custom Build Housing  
 
5. The Council will identif y sufficient plots and grant planning permission for self -build and 
custom -build housing to meet the need set out on the Council’s register.  
 
Housing for Older and Vulnerable People  
 
6. In residential developments of 10 dwellings or more, at least 20% of ho mes should be 
deemed appropriate to accommodate the needs of older and vulnerable people. The 
nature of this provision will be determined on a site-by-site basis depending on demand 
in a particular area and the site context and may incorporate bungalow pro vision, 
lifetime homes, or accessible and adaptable homes in line with Policy DM3.  
 
7. The overall need for new care home beds, and housing units with  support and  care 
over the plan period will be identified through a local strategic assessment  (which will 
be updated by commissioners on a regular basis) . The Council will  support applications 
for supported and extra care housing as a component of this supply  that are:  
 
a. In line with strategic demands and supported by the Council’s commissioning 
team; and  
b. Are in accessible locations  and in accordance with other relevant policies in the 
Plan;   
 
Gypsy and Traveller pitch requirement, location and delivery  
 
8. A need for a minimum of 17 net additional gypsy and traveller pitches is identified 
between 2018 -2037, along with a need for 5 new transit pitches. The Council will  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  30 
  Core Policy 4 (CP4): Housing Development  
allocate specific sites to provide at least five years’ supply of gypsy and traveller 
provi sion. Site allocations are identified in the Gypsy and Traveller Growth Site 
Allocation Policies  
 
9. Development that would result in the loss of existing permanent pitches or sites that 
are authorised for gypsy and traveller use will not be supported unless evidence is 
provided:  
 
a. clearly demonstrating that there is an overall surplus of pitches in the Borough; or  
b. alternative provision is proposed elsewhere in accordance with policy DM4

Housing requirement, location and delivery  
3.30.  The Council’s updated Housing and Economic Needs Assessment (HENA) (2021) 
estimates a need for 447 ne t new dwellings per annum to support the economic growth 
scenario for the Borough.  This is an increase from the estimated need of 411 net new 
dwellings in the 2018 HENA. The 447 new dwellings per annum is to be seen as a 
minimum requirement, with no maxim um cap.   
3.31.  The increase in the housing needs figure (from 411dpa to 447 dpa) is explained by:  
i. updated demographic data showing changes in the base population and 
economically active population in the Borough;  
ii. an updated economic growth scenario which is driven by historic performance as 
well as known market signals and planned investment (further details are set out 
under CP10); and   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  31 
 iii. the tie of housing requirements to forecast jobs growth over the plan period 
assuming a commuting ratio of 1:1 (i.e. no net in commuting)22. 
 
3.32.  Policy CP4 confirms that the Council will plan to deliver housing to align with the 
economic growth scenario. Sufficient Housing Growth Allocations are identified to 
provide flexibility and for competition and choice. This will help to sup port an increase in 
household formation rates in the Borough which the HENA highlights as having been 
suppressed over recent years. This in turn will help to reduce overcrowding which is 
believed to have played a significant contributing factor to the spre ad of Covid -19 in 
Blackburn with Darwen.  
3.33.  Further details of the specific sites that will help meet the identified housing need are 
provided in the Housing Growth Allocation section of this Plan, and the housing 
trajectory is set out in Appendix B . 
Affordab le housing needs  
3.34.  The HENA identifies the need for affordable housing in the Borough. The evidence 
suggests that affordable housing delivery should be maximised where opportunities 
arise, particularly of affordable housing to rent. NPPF’s definition of affo rdable housing 
now also includes households who are unable to access the private rented sector but 
who cannot afford to buy. The HENA highlights that there is limited evidence for a need 
for this type of housing in Blackburn with Darwen – the typical cost of housing to buy in 
the area (in the second -hand market) is sufficiently affordable such that there is no need 
for a discounted new build product. Affordable housing that provides rental or shared 
ownership products should be retained in perpetuity, eithe r through retaining benefits for 
all future occupiers, or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing 
provision. The Council will provide further details in its Affordable Housing Guide for 
Developers SPD.  
Self and custom build housin g 
3.35.  In line with the Government’s aspirations to enable more people to build their own 
homes, the Council will consider applications for self -build properties favourably. Since 
2016 the Council has kept a register of people who are interested in self or cust om built 
housing and have used this (alongside planning permissions previously granted) to 
identify sufficient sites to meet the requirement in the Borough. The Local Plan identifies 
eight self -build plots in Queen’s Park, Blackburn as part of Housing Grow th Site 
allocation H068.  
Housing for older and vulnerable people  
3.36.  The HENA highlights a notable increase projected in the older person population over 
the plan period, with the total number of those aged 65 and over expected to increase by 
over 28%, and tho se aged 80 and over expected to increase by 46% . Given this trend 
and the higher levels of disability and health problems amongst older people other 
vulnerable groups, there is likely to be an increased requirement for suitable housing. 
This could include bungalows and/or homes built to the M4 (2) and/or M4 (3) 
accessibility standards.  
                                                
22 The 2018 HENA assumed a continu ation of the 2011 Census commuting ratio whereby Blackburn with Darwen 
was a net importer of workers   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  32 
 3.37.  New development will be expected to contribute towards meeting the needs of older and 
vulnerable persons’ accommodation.  However a ttitudes and demand for housing with 
care h ave changed dramatically over the last few years which will impact upon previous 
projections of need for specialist housing options moving forward.   
3.38.  The need for these for ms of housing will be set out by the Council in a local strategic 
assessment23, and include an annual statement . The Council may also provide  a formal 
Market Position Statement  in partnership with the County Council and the Health and 
Social Care Partnership . These will be used by the Council’s commissioning team to 
inform whether o r not new developments can be supported  in line with Policy CP4 . 
3.39.  Figures set out below show the latest strategic assessment  for specialist housing types 
indicated by 5 -year period. These are provided as indicative  only as these will be subject 
to change th rough the annual statements to be published by the Council.  All figures 
provided are cumulative requirements over the period stated and represent lease/sale 
requirements (no rented units).

Extra c are housing  0 units  0 units  0 units  20 units  
Registered c are beds  0 units  52 units  135 units  267 units  
3.40.  The adopted Blackburn with Darwen Residential and Supported Accommodation 
Planning Advice Note provides further advice and clarification on how the Council will 
ensure that good quality accommodation is available in appropriate premises and 
locations within the Boroug h to meet the needs of vulnerable people requiring care and 
support. Policy DM39: The Effect of Development on Public Services will be particularly 
relevant in such decisions.  
Gypsy and travellers  
3.41.  The Council’s Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showperson Accommodation 
Assessment (GTAA) evidenced the need for 17 additional permanent and 5 transit gypsy 
and traveller pitches in the Borough over the period 2018 -2037. With the plan now 
covering the pe riod 2021 -2037 there is a need to extrapolate these figures to identify the 
5 year Local Plan need for additional pitches between 2021 -2026.   
3.42.  The GTAA identified a residual need for 4 additional permanent pitches between the 6 
year period 2018/19 – 2023/24. As there has been no new pitches delivered within the 
Borough since 2018/19, it can be assumed that this need remains. In addition to 
providing an extra 2 pitches to cover years 2024/25 and 2025/26, a total requirement of 
6 additional pitches is n eeded between 2021 -2026.  
3.43.  The Council has identified specific, deliverable sites to meet this requirement through 
Policy CP 4 and Gypsy and Traveller Growth Allocations of the Local Plan. Broad 
locations for growth are also identified for years 6 -15 of the p lan within the urban area of 
the Borough. Any proposals for new pitches coming forward in these broad locations will 
                                                
23 using a local Housing -LIN model   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  33 
 be subject to consideration of Policy DM4. No requirement for travelling showperson 
plots was identified in the GTAA.  
3.44.  To ensure that the nu mber of unauthorised developments and encampments are 
minimised, existing sites approved for Gypsy and Traveller use will be safeguarded from 
re-development. The only circumstances under which re -development of existing sites 
will be approved is where clea r evidence can be provided that there are sufficient pitches 
in the Borough over the plan period, or alternative provision that satisfies all other 
relevant policies (particularly DM4) can be provided.

 3.3 Place  
Core Policy 5 (CP5): Climate Change  
3.45.  Buildings (new and existing) and transport are major contributors to greenhouse gas 
emissions in the Borough. The Local Plan is therefore a key mechanism through which 
the spatial aspects of decarbonisation and climate adaptation can be addressed. The 
Council’s Clim ate Emergency Action Plan and Adaptation Strategy both reinforce this 
point.  
3.46.  Policy CP5 seeks to ensure that the Local Plan contributes to the Council’s carbon 
neutral ambitions alongside the UK’s ambition to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2050. 
It expec ts that all new development will seek to provide environmental enhancements 
wherever possible and leave the natural environment in a better state than before.  
 Core Policy 5 (CP5): Climate Change  
1. Development will be required to contribute to both mitigati ng and adapting to climate 
change, and to meeting targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  
 
2. Developers will be required to use the Council’s Climate Impacts Framework24 to inform 
what will be expected from a new development, to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to demonstrate appropriate climate change resilience and 
adaptation of the proposed scheme.  
 
3. Planning permission will not be granted for development th at would, as assessed by the 
Council’s Climate Impacts Framework:  
 
ii. Lead to an unacceptable contribution to climate change;  
iii. Be itself at high risk from the effects of climate change; or  
iv. Cause an increase in the level of risk from the cumulative effects of c limate 
change in another location.  
 
4. Mitigation measures that must be implemented off -site (after the hierarchy of avoidance, 
mitigation and compensation has been exhausted) will be directed to priority 
Environmental Opportunity Areas (EOA).  These areas wi ll play a key strategic role in 
the enhancements of biodiversity and green space, assisting in carbon management 
and flood risk mitigation over the plan period.  
 
5. Policy DM12 provides further details on renewable and low carbon energy. Areas 
identified as p otentially suitable for renewable and low carbon energy schemes are

3.47.  Proposals for new development will be evaluated against the Council’s Climate Impacts 
Framework (CIF). All new development is required to demonstrate how it contributes to 
cutting carbon emissions as part of mitigation and adaptation to climate change and the 
CIF is the practical means of doing so. Applicants must complete and submit a CIF in 
support of new development applications for them to be validated for development 
management purposes.  
3.48.  The CIF will be the key tool to aid decision making on climate impacts, increasing 
transparency and accountability in decision -making. This will help support the Council’s 
Climate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP) and the CIF will be updated  as required to 
support the CEAP or as and when climate change policy evolves.  
3.49.  The CIF will help to ensure that the concept of the ’20 -minute neighbourhood’ is 
embedded into future developments in Blackburn with Darwen. It will also take into 
account a ran ge of criteria around sustainable transport, the natural environment, 
flooding/SUDS and energy. It will be used to inform discussions during the application 
process on how a development can be improved from a climate mitigation, adaptation 
and biodiversity  perspective. Where necessary the CIF may be used as a basis to 
develop proposals and charging to an environment fund (for carbon offsetting) in the 
Borough, in line with the expectation for planning contributions set out in Policy CP12.  
3.50.  Both the NPPF and the Council’s Local Plan are clear that new developments must take 
into account implications on climate change. Where adverse impacts cannot be 
adequately mitigated on -site, off -site mitigation measures will be required. Off -site 
mitigation within the Boro ugh will be preferred to ensure co -benefits (funding an 
equivalent carbon dioxide saving within the local authority boundary). The Council is 
looking to further develop the idea of Authority Based Insetting (ABI) to help stimulate 
such projects. In the abs ence of projects/opportunities within the Borough then offsetting 
(funding an equivalent carbon dioxide saving elsewhere to compensate for emissions) 
could be used.  
3.51.  The Council has identified Environmental Opportunity Areas (further details set out in 
Policy DM14) to help focus delivery of such measures within the Borough. Priority 
Environmental Opportunity Areas denote locations where there is potential to improve 
existing green and blue infrastructure for one or more purposes, such as enhancing or 
creatin g important habitat, carbon sequestration, flood risk management, recreation,  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  36 
 heritage and accessibility and well -being. Due to their poor condition, heather moorland 
and peat bog habitats are potentially losing around 2,400 tonnes of carbon to the 
atmosph ere each year. The priority must be to improve the condition of moorlands to 
ensure neutral carbon emissions (as a minimum), and that the carbon stored is depleted 
no further.  
3.52.  Enhancements to EOAs will also augment the Borough’s green and blue infrastructu re, 
improving connectivity across the Borough and with neighbouring authorities and, where 
appropriate, create new recreational facilities.  Where opportunities can be linked to 
statutory and non -statutory designated sites they will ultimately form part of  the nature 
recovery network. Policy DM14 provides further details on how these areas will be used 
in decision -making.  
3.53.  If Blackburn with Darwen is to achieve its ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 
2030 then energy demand from existing building s, new development and transport must 
be minimised and generation of energy from low carbon and renewable sources 
increased. The Polic y Map identifies areas that are potentially suitable for wind and heat 
networks in the Borough based on initial feasibilit y work. Further work around the 
potential for solar schemes is planned, along with more detailed techno -feasibility 
studies on the potential for heat networks. Policy DM12 provides further policy on Clean 
and Green  Energy in decision -making and the Council  will prepare an SPD on 
Renewable Energy to provide further policy guidance on this work.  
 
 Core Policy 6 (CP6): The Natural Environment  
3.54.  The natural environment has to be protected and enhanced to sustain wildlife habitats, 
species and natural capital. Nature Recovery Networks (to be defined by a Local Nature 
Recovery Strategy25) have to be strengthened and connected to stem the loss of nature 
and deliver a significant net gain in the Borough’s overall biodiversity value, allowing 
nature to recover, flour ish and have greater resilience to the changing climate.  
3.55.  Policy CP6 (and Environmental Opportunity Areas set out in CP5) provide a policy 
framework within the Local Plan to support and facilitate this.  
 Core Policy 6 (CP6): The Natural Environment  
1. New de velopment will be required to conserve and enhance biodiversity, geodiversity 
and landscape features ensuring:  
 
i. A measurable biodiversity net gain of no less than 10% is achieved . Where this 
is not possible on -site local compensatory habitat or development  contributions 
will be sought  in line with Policy DM15 ; 
ii. That statutory and non -statutory protected sites are protected, enhanced and 
supported;  
iii. That recognised priority species and habitats are protected, enhanced and 
supported;  
iv. That appropriate and long -term management of new or existing habitats is 
secured to ensure a network of nature recovery.  
                                                
25 Environment Act (20 21)  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  37 
  Core Policy 6 (CP6): The Natural Environment  
 
2. Development is required to protect, enhance and ext end the Nature Recovery 
Network26 and the green and blue infrastructure network in the Borough by helping to 
maximise their extent, interconnectedness, multi -functionality, and quality.  
 
3. Development should:  
 
i. Safeguard the long term capability of the best and most versatile agricultural 
land (Grades 1, 2 and 3a in the Agricultural Land Classification (ALC)) as a 
resource for the future;  
ii. Avoid disturbance or damage of soils, especially those of high environmental 
value, such as peatlands and wetlands;  
iii. Ensure soil resources are conserved and managed in a sustainable way;  
iv. Be able to demonstrate that it will not be at an unacceptable risk of unstable or 
contaminated land.  
 
4. Proactive management of the upland areas (heather moorland and peat bog habitats) 
for the benefit of carbon retention, biodiversity and natural flood management will be 
supported;  
 
5. All development sho uld have a neutral or positive impact on air and water quality;  
 
6. Major developments should seek to achieve the Building with Nature Design Award as 
part of pre -application or outline planning permission approval.

 3.56.  Natural capital as a concept offers a balanced focus on natural  assets in ecological 
terms (their quantity, condition and sustainability) and the social and economic benefits 
that derive from those assets.  It re -frames nature positively as an asset, rather than 
simply as a constraint on or a victim of development.  A  natural capital assessment may 
be required where the local planning authority considers it appropriate where the nature 
or scale of a proposal merits it.  
3.57.  The Nature Emergency is every bit as critical as the Climate Emergency.  C entral 
Government has commi tted27 to protect and improve 30% of UK land by 2030 to combat 
biodiversity loss and adapt to climate change.  The Council has a similar ambition to 
make space for nature to allow it to recover and become more abundant.  A total of 
5,272ha of land (38% of la nd in the Borough) is identified as some form of ‘green 
infrastructure’ (in line with Policy DM16: Green and Blue Infrastructure), with 1,750ha of 
this (13%) of the Borough) having some form of biodiversity designation. Policies set out 
in this Local Plan,  and forthcoming Local Nature Recovery Strategies and designation of 
Nature Recovery Networks will be a means of achieving this aim. When healthy, natural 
habitats sustain more wildlife and provide benefits for people such as: reducing the risk 
of flooding ; improving people’s health and wellbeing; as well as maintaining healthy 
soils, clean water and the pollinators needed for crops to promote a balanced ecosystem  
3.58.  Strategic areas identified as being suitable for biodiversity net gain are shown as part of 
the Environmental Opportunity Areas on the Polic y Map. A Supplementary Planning 
Document (SPD) will be prepared to provide further guidance on this and other natural 
environment matters (including green infrastructure and trees/woodland) . 
Core Policy 7 (CP7) : The Historic Environment  
3.59.  Blackburn with Darwen has a vast number and wide range of historic assets. The Local 
Plan seeks to deliver new development in a way that respects and complements this rich 
history, the historic buildings, parks and gardens, water ways, conservation areas, 
archaeology and areas of distinct local character and townscape. The emphasis of the 
plan is on the proactive management of change, reflecting the Borough’s capacity to 
move forward while preserving its irreplaceable heritage.  
3.60.  Policy CP7 below sets out our strategic policy approach to protecting and enhancing the 
Borough’s diverse and rich historic environment.  
 Core Policy 7 (CP7): The Historic Environment  
1. The Council will, through decision making and fulfilling its wider functions, proactively 
manage and work with partners to protect and enhance the significance, character, 
appearance, and archaeological and historic value of the Borough’s heritage assets.   
This will include exploring opportunities to aid the promotion, u nderstanding and 
interpretation of important heritage assets as a means of reinforcing the Borough’s 
identity and maximising wider public benefits.  
 
2. The Council will support proposals that positively conserve and where appropriate 
enhance the Blackburn and  Darwen’s Historic Environment and heritage assets, 
including their setting.

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  39 
  Core Policy 7 (CP7): The Historic Environment  
3. Key elements which contribute to the Borough’s identity and distinctiveness, and which 
therefore will be a priority for safeguarding and enhancing into the future, includes:  
 
i. The Borough’s distinctive historic character predominately of stone and red brick 
buildings set against the significant backdrop of the West Pennine Moors;  
ii. The legacy of mill buildings and their associated infrastructure including engine 
houses, chimneys and mill lodges and the relationship to nearby terraced 
workers housing;  
iii. The network of historic open spaces, parks, gardens, and cemeteries;  
iv. Pre-industrial farmhouses and weavers cottages;  
v. The Leeds  and Liverpool canal which forms part of the strategic and local green -
blue infrastructure network, linking development opportunities, urban and rural 
communities , as well as habitats , and is an important non -designated heritage 
asset;  
vi. The significant number of undesignated assets from the period of prolific 
histo rical growth in the 19th Century that are not protected and could be under 
threat from loss.  
 
4. In addition to fulfilling its statutory obligations, the Council will:  
 
i. Develop a positive strategy to safeguard the future of any heritage assets at risk;  
ii. Promot e heritage -led regeneration  and development ; 
iii. Seek to recognise  currently unidentified local heritage assets;  
iv. Produce/update conservation area appraisals and management plans;  
v. Maximise opportunities to increase the understanding and interpretation of the 
Borough’s historic environment.

3.61.  Blackburn with Darwen has ancient origins. The towns grew incrementally until the 
Industrial Revolution, when a major phase of growth and building took place focused on 
the cotton, paper, engineering and chemical industries, which , in turn, helped  create the 
places we see today. At the time Pennine Lancashire, including Blackburn with Darwen, 
was the main centre of globally significant industries, home to major producers and the 
origin of many invention s and developments that changed the nature of manufacturing. 
The existence of industry on this scale permeated every aspect of our towns. It 
underpinned the development of major elements of our housing stock and the 
establishment of transport routes, some of which are still important today , while othe rs 
have taken on a different role. The architectural styles and materials used at the time in 
housing, industrial premises and civic buildings remain the towns’ main architectural 
vernacular.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  40 
 3.62.  As a result, our area has a rich historic environment. It is ess ential that the most 
important elements of this are protected as positive assets which will promote ongoing 
growth. At the same time, the Council does not wish the area to stand still. A key 
objective therefore is to ensure that change comes forward in a m anaged way, and is 
informed by a proper understanding of the evidential, historic, aesthetic and communal 
significance of the heritage asset.  
3.63.  In addition to our designated heritage assets, Blackburn with Darwen also contains a 
number of buildings and othe r structures that are not formally designated as heritage 
assets, but which nevertheless contribute to the character of the area. These are 
identified on the Blackburn with Darwen Local List which will be updated as necessary to 
ensure a comprehensive reco rd of locally important assets. Policy CP7 offers protection 
to both nationally and locally designated heritage assets and aims to maximise 
opportunities to enhance these assets, including their settings.  
Core Policy 8 (CP8): Securing High Quality and Incl usive Design  
3.64.  High quality design is essential to making places more attractive, locally -distinctive, 
sustainable and safe. It can help reduce and mitigate the impacts of climate change, 
promote healthier lifestyles and create safer and more accessible places for people to 
live in and use.  
3.65.  Good design rests upon analysis of the character of the area to create coherent and 
interesting places. It should respond to local character and history while not preventing 
or discouraging appropriate innovation. The Local Plan seeks to plan positively for high 
quality, inclusive design by creating places that function well, and that establish a strong 
sense of place for people to live, work and visit. Creating well -designed places that 
incorporate all aspects of desig n in an inclusive manner can help to deliver a high quality 
of life. Policy CP8 sets out our strategic approach to securing high quality and inclusive 
design in new developments, which focuses on consistency with national design guides, 
the use of planning  briefs and design codes, and the use of design reviews.  
 Core Policy 8 (CP8): Securing High Quality and Inclusive Design  
1. The Council will require all new development to be of a high standard of design 
consistent with principles set out in the National De sign Guide and the National Model 
Design Code. Development that is not well designed will be refused.  
 
2. The Council will require the preparation of masterplans by developers for strategic scale 
developments, which will include design codes. The Council will  consider the use of 
planning briefs and design codes on other development sites where appropriate.  
 
3. Any proposed development considered to have a significant impact on local townscape 
or landscape will be expected to complete a design review at an early s tage in its 
design.

 3.66.  The NPPF makes clear that creating high quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and 
places is fundamental to what the planning and dev elopment process should achieve28. 
By way of providing additional guidance on this element of the NPPF, the National 
Design Guide and National Model Design Code outlines the Government’s priorities for 
well-designed places and these reflect the design criterion set out in Policy DM27: 
Design in New D evelopments. The Council will expect all new development schemes to 
be consistent with these principles and will refuse schemes that are not well designed.  
3.67.  Developments will be planned carefully with the use of masterplans and design codes 
including commun ity engagement through the process. This will help to ensure the 
integration of new and existing communities as well as creating attractive places to live. 
In appropriate cases, the Council will expect applicants to complete a design review to 
consider the  design quality of proposals. The Places Matter  design review is an 
independent organisation, hosted by RIBA, and comprised of local design experts. The 
aim of the Panel i s to promote and encourage high standards in design of the built 
environment across the North West.   
Core Policy 9 (CP9): Transport and Accessibility  
3.68.  An effective transport network is needed to support a strong economy and community, 
and is a key part of the ‘Balanced Growth’ Strategy. The Local Plan must ensure that 
new development is located in the most sustainable locations and is accessible by a 
choice of active travel modes, including walking, cycling and public transport. This will 
help reduce the ne ed for people to travel by car for services and recreation, minimise 
congestion, improve road safety, contribute to a healthier lifestyle and meet climate 
change emissions reduction targets.  
3.69.  Policy CP9: Transport and Accessibility sets out the approach th e Council will adopt in 
managing the transport implications of development.  
 Core Policy 9 (CP9): Transport and Accessibility  
1. New development will be located in the most sustainable locations to minimise the need 
to travel by car and is easily accessed by  non‐car means including public transport, 
walking and cycling. Development which is poorly accessible by non ‐car means will only 
be permitted in exceptional circumstances.  
 
2. New development which is likely to generate significant numbers of car journeys wi ll be 
required to:  
 
i. provide a travel plan setting out the measures that the developer, either alone or 
in conjunction with neighbouring uses, shall adopt to reduce reliance on the use 
of the private car for journeys to and from the site; and   
ii. be supported  by a transport statement or transport assessment, identifying the 
effects of the proposals on existing transport systems. Where necessary, 
developers or operators will provide or contribute to such enhancements of the 
transport network as are necessary to  accommodate these effects.  
 
3. The Council will prepare a Travel Plan SPD to provide further guidance on their 
formulation, implementation and monitoring arrangements.

3.70.  A number of transport evidence base documents have been prepared to support the 
Local Plan. These appraise the potential impact of proposed growth sites on the local 
pedestria n, cycling, public transport and highway networks. They have also identified a 
wide range of potential interventions and a strategy for improvements to adequately 
support new developments. These improvements range in scale from strategic to local in 
nature . Suggested improvements are identified in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery 
Plan which sits alongside the Local Plan.  
3.71.  The Blackburn with Darwen Local Transport Plan (LTP3) provided a long term strategy 
and delivery programme of transport investment an d service improvements for the 
period 2011 -2021. A number of transport schemes identified in LTP3 have been 
successfully delivered, including the Freckleton Street link road, Clitheroe to Manchester 
rail enhancements and the Pennine Reach rapid bus transpo rt scheme. Work is now 
progressing between the three Transport Authorities of Blackburn with Darwen, 
Blackpool and Lancashire to prepare a Joint Lancashire Local Transport Plan 4 (LTP4) 
covering the period 2021 -2046. Emerging key themes are:  
 Improving acc ess into, between and within areas of economic growth and 
regeneration;  
 Improving people’s health, safety, quality of life and wellbeing;  
 Reducing the environmental impact of transport; and  
 Maintaining our assets.  
3.72.  Additional work is ongoing on other transport plans and strategies such as a local Bus 
Service Improvement Plan (BSIP) and a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan 
(LCWIP). These will be incorporated into a local delivery/implementation plan for the 
Borough once complete.  
3.73.  Public healt h considerations including the direct health impacts of air pollution, road 
transport emissions and an invigorated focus on active travel modes are likely to feature 
prominently within the plan. LTP4 is programmed for adoption in 2022.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  43 
 3.74.  Initial projects ide ntified in the emerging LTP4 are contained within the IDP and include 
electric charging vehicle points in the town centres, Blackburn Railway Station 
redevelopment and the development of new Public Rights of Way in and around 
Darwen. Any additional updates  required to the IDP following adoption of LTP4 will be 
made accordingly.  
3.75.  The policy agenda around smart cities is expected to develop considerably in future 
years and has the potential to radically change the Borough by the end of the plan 
period, helping  the area to function more effectively. Ambitions and opportunities in this 
policy area that will have implications on new development in the Borough will be taken 
into account at the next Local Plan Review stage.  
3.76.  The Council will prepare a Travel Plan Sup plementary Planning Document (SPD) to 
provide additional guidance on implementing Policy CP9.

 3.4 Economy  
Core Policy 10 (CP10): The Economy and Skills  
3.77.  The provision of appropriate land for businesses to invest, expand and adapt is a key 
part of the Balance d Growth Strategy of the Local Plan. The Plan must ensure that 
businesses are supported to help create new jobs and also protect existing jobs – a 
healthy, diverse jobs market is a fundamental part of the area’s long -term future.  
3.78.  Core Policy CP10: The Eco nomy and Skills seeks to do this in three key ways:  
 by providing a portfolio of new development land to accommodate a wide variety of 
different types of businesses at different stages of their growth;  
 by protecting existing employment areas, particularly  the highest quality sites, 
supporting their flexible expansion and the re -configuration of existing premises; 
and 
 by supporting the retention of, and improvements to, educational infrastructure in 
the Borough.  
 Core Policy 10 (CP10 ): The Economy and Skills 
Employment land requirement and location  
 
1. The Council will seek to deliver at least 46.4ha of new employment land over the period 
2021 -2037. A range of employment and mixed -use sites will be allocated to ensure that 
sufficient, suitable land can pr ovide a minimum of 198,000s qm of new employment 
floorspace29 over the Plan period to support future jobs growth.  
 
2. Site allocations are identified in the Employment Growth Allocation Policies. A new 
strategic employment site (Policy E179 ) at Junction 5 of th e M65 will be allocated to 
ensure delivery of the qualitative and quantitative employment land requirements for 
this Plan period.   
 
Existing employment areas  
 
3. The Council will continue to protect existing employment areas from re -development for 
alternative uses. Losses in the existing employment land supply will be resisted in line 
with the hierarchical approach to existing employment site s set out in Policies DM30 -
DM3230.  
 
Education establishments  
 
4. The change of use or redevelopment of educational establishments will only be 
permitted if they are proven surplus to educational requirements.  
 
5. The extension or expansion of existing educational facilities, and creation of new 
facilities, will be supported subject to their accordance with the  criteria of other relevant 
policies within the Local Plan.

Employment Land Requirement  
3.79.  The Council’s Housing and Economic Needs Assessment (HENA) (2021) sets out a 
realistic economic growth scenario for the Borough. It concludes a minimum need for 
198,451sqm of new employment floorspace in the Borough over the period 2021 -2037. 
Creation of new employment floorspace at this scale will help to facilitate net growth of 
around 5,000 new jobs. It will also align with the proposed housing growth set out in 
Policy CP4: Hous ing Development.  
3.80.  Converted to land requirements the HENA highlights that a minimum of 46.4ha of new 
land is required over the Plan period 2021 -37. The HENA identifies a potential further 
34.3ha of land as being justified for allocation to ensure increased choice in the market 
(a land buffer) and to ensure that the impact of historic and future losses of employment 
land is minimised  
3.81.  Policy CP10 plans for the minimum land requirement to ensure that the economic growth 
scenario is fully supported. A portfolio of sites is identified in the Local Plan (including 
existing commitments) that can accommodate around 230,000sqm of new employment 
floorspace. This equates to a buffer of around 16% (on identified floorspace 
requirements). This approach will allow sufficie nt flexibility and ensure that a choice of 
sites is made available to support delivery of the minimum floorspace requirements.  
3.82.  Available land includes a proposed new strategic employment site at Junction 5 of the 
M65, and a range of other employment and mi xed-use land allocations. Details of all 
sites and their expected delivery of new employment floorspace are set out in Appendix 
C. 
3.83.  Development of the new strategic employment site will be expected to follow a 
masterplan -based approach to avoid potential pi ecemeal development and ensure that 
appropriate infrastructure is delivered at the right time. The Council will need to agree on 
any masterplan prior to development taking place.  
Existing Employment Areas  
3.84.  Alongside the provision of new employment sites, th e Council will focus on protecting 
existing employment areas. A number of Development Management policies (DM30 -32) 
set the detailed policy framework for these areas.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  46 
 Education establishments  
3.85.  Existing educational establishments will be protected and enhanc ed through the Plan 
period in accordance with Policy CP10. This will help ensure that the Borough attracts 
and retains skilled and qualified people. Policy CP10 is also clear in supporting new 
facilities in principle to help ensure the faster delivery of p ublic service infrastructure in 
line with paragraph 96 of the NPPF. Where the loss of educational facilities may impact 
on school playing fields Policy DM20: Playing Fields, Indoor and Outdoor Sports 
Facilities, will apply.  
Core Policy 11 (CP11): Town Cent res and Commercial Development  
3.86.  Promoting the growth of commercial development and other town centre uses such as 
leisure, entertainment, offices, education, arts, culture, tourism facilities and housing is 
important for maintaining the vitality and viabili ty of existing centres in the Borough and 
ensuring that they continue to act as a focus for the community.  
3.87.  Policy CP11 identifies the Borough’s hierarchy of centres and sets out the scale and 
type of investment that should be encouraged in each. These cent res are identified on 
the Polic y Map and fall under four tiers: Blackburn Major Town Centre (Tier 1); Darwen 
Town Centre (Tier 2); District Centres (Tier 3); and Local Centres (Tier 4).  
 Core Policy 11 (CP11 ): Town Centres and Commercial Development  
1. Proposals for commercial development (Use Classes E(a -f)), other main town centre 
uses (including leisure), and uses that can support the future vitality and viability of the 
centre will be directed in accordance with the following centre hierarchy:  
 
i. Black burn Major Town Centre (Tier 1) – is the major sub -regional shopping 
centre and the principal location for new commercial, leisure and other main town 
centre development, particularly that of a larger scale. The strategic mixed -use 
sites (MU210 and MU211) will be expected to play a key role in the future 
development of the town centre, alongside wider regeneration  and development  
within the Blackburn Town Centre East Investment Area, as shown on the Polic y 
Map. The investment area will seek to increase town  centre living and support

masterplan.  
 
ii. Darwen Town Centre (Tier 2)  – is an important commercial centre for the south of 
the Borough, providing significant comparison and convenience retailing services 
for its distinct local community. The Darwen Town Investment Plan31 will be 
expected to play a key role in the future development of the town centre, in 
regenerating and developing the town centre core.  
 
iii. District Centres (Tier 3) – the Di strict Centres consist of more localised 
commercial uses and community facilities and services that help to reduce the 
need to travel and contribute towards more sustainable and neighbourhood -scale 
living.

iv. Local Centres (Tier 4) – these Centres contain smaller clusters of commercial 
units and play a key role in supporting 20 -minute neighbourhoods.  
 
2. Proposals for development of any main town centre use outside the hierarchy of 
designated centres that is of an appropriate scale for the location may still b e permitted 
where the sequential test can be satisfied32.  
 
3. Retail proposals located outside the hierarchy of designated centres and above gross 
floorspace thresholds set out in Policy DM33 will also be required to undertake a retail 
impact assessment33.

3.88.  The Council’s Retail and Leisure Study (completed in 2019  and updated in 2021) 
provides an assessment of retail and leisure needs over the Plan period. It also reviewed 
the health of the Borough’s to wn and district centres. A comprehensive review of smaller 
local centres has also taken place to help define a four -tier centre hierarchy in the 
Borough. Policy DM34 provides further details on the individual breakdown of 
District/Local centres that are no t set out in Policy CP11.  
3.89.  The Retail and Leisure Study confirms that there is no quantitative capacity to support 
additional retail floorspace over the Plan period. However , qualitative improvements to 
retail provision may be justified in some parts of the  Borough.  
3.90.  Other main town centre uses will be supported in particular a need for new food and 
drink outlets in Blackburn. The strategic mixed -use sites will be expected to deliver a 
range of uses to support the future vitality and viability of the town ce ntre, which may 
include employment uses, residential (as part of a town centre living strategy) and 
educational facilities. A masterplan will be prepared to support delivery of the strategic 
mixed -use sites as part of investment in the wider area shown on the Polic y Map 
(Blackburn Town Centre East Investment Area).

 3.91.  The Council is supportive of the concept of creating ’20-minute neighbourhoods’ , the 
idea that people can meet most of their daily needs by taking a 20 -minute walk.  The 
identification of a network of Local Centres within the centre hierarchy helps to support 
this concept. The identification of Local Centres in the new Local Plan is not a 
commitment to provide a specific  number o r set of services at each of these locations . It 
is a means to assist the provision of more compact, connected neighbourhoods  where 
this is possible  through new developments arising over the Plan period. Creation of 
neighbourhoods  where people can meet the ir everyday needs within a short walk or 
cycle will help to achieve many cross -cutting benefits and objectives of the Local Plan. 
Further details are provided in Policy DM34 : District and Local Centres . 
3.92.  Proposals in other locations outside of defined centr es will be supported: where they are 
of an appropriate scale; where they can assist in improving accessibility to key services 
and helping to create walkable neighbourhoods; and where they can satisfy the 
sequential test for retail set out in the NPPF and Policy DM33.  
Core Policy 12 (CP12): Infrastructure and Delivery  
3.93.  The growth identified in the Local Plan will increase demands on physical infrastructure 
such as roads, social infrastructure (which includes health and education facilities) and 
green infrast ructure such as open spaces. The Council will work with relevant providers 
to help bring forward any required infrastructure.  
3.94.  Policy CP12: Infrastructure and Delivery outlines the types of infrastructure required to 
support the level of growth set out in t he Local Plan and how this infrastructure will be 
delivered.  
 Core Policy 12 (CP12 ): Infrastructure and Delivery  
1. Development proposals will be expected to contribute to the provision of new 
infrastructure, or the improvement/replacement of existing infrastructure, that is required 
to meet the needs arising from the development, to mitigate its impacts, and/or to serv e 
the needs of the wider area.  
 
2. Appropriate matters to be funded by planning contributions include, but are not limited 
to: 
 
i. Affordable housing  
ii. Education provision  
iii. Transport and travel improvements  
iv. Highways infrastructure  
v. Health infrastructure  
vi. Community f acilities  
vii. Open space, public realm and leisure  
viii. Flood defence and water management  
ix. Biodiversity net gain and environmental improvements  
x. Carbon reduction  including decentralised energy34; 
xi. Digital infrastructure  
 
                                                
34 This could include contributions towards an Environment Fund including carbon -offset monies. The Council will set 
out details of any such scheme in appropriate supplementary planning documents   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  49 
  Core Policy 12 (CP12 ): Infrastructure and Delivery  
3. Delivery of appropriate infrastructure necessary as a result of new development may 
include direct provision of on -site or off -site infrastructure that will be secured by:  
 
i. Section 106 (S106) planning obligations (or other legally binding agreements) 
(including monitoring fees); or  
ii. Section 278 conditions for delivery of offsite highway works.  
 
4. In agreeing  any S106  requirements , the Council will take into account the total 
contribution liability incurred by developments arising from all policy and site -specific 
requirements.  Its objective will b e to ensure that the overall level of contribution 
required will allow developments to remain viable, wherever this is compatible with 
securing essential works that are fundamental to the acceptability of the proposal. It will 
also seek to ensure a balance  of contributions towards mitigating economic, social and 
environmental related infrastructure impacts wherever feasible.  
 
5. The Local Plan Viability study has informed the minimum  contribution  that sites are 
expected to be able to provide and these  are set out in the relevant Growth Allocations 
policies  and supporting text to Policy CP12 for non -allocated sites . These will be used 
to help determine appropriate  S106 requirement s taking into account expected  sales 
values, development densities and cost assumptions  on each development35. A 
Developer Contributions SPD will be prepared to support delivery of Policy CP12.  
 
6. Where a developer seeks to negotiate a reduction in standards that would normally 
apply to d evelopment, or a form of development that would not normally be acceptable, 
on grounds of financial viability, the Council will require the developer to supply 
evidence as to the financial viability of the development  
 
7. Infrastructure must be provided in a timely and, where appropriate, phased manner to 
serve the occupants and users of the development. For sites that are proposed for 
delivery over a number of phases/years, a Phasing and Delivery Strategy will be 
required to be submitted as part of the planni ng application.

35 The policy approach of identifying minimum feasible contribution rates is provided as an indication only . The onus 
is on the developer to assess their application prior to submission in the context of the findings and assumptions set 
out in the Plan Viability Study  which will then inform any S106 requirement.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  50 
 3.95.  The provision of high quality infrastructure to support Local Plan growth will be a key 
element of delivering the Balanced Growth Strategy set o ut in Policy CP1. To support 
Policy CP12 and comply with national policy the Council has prepared an Infrastructure 
Delivery Plan (IDP) that sits alongside the Local Plan. It has been prepared through a 
process of ongoing engagement with key infrastructure  providers.  
3.96.  The IDP identifies the main items of infrastructure needed to support the planned 
development identified in the Local Plan, and includes details on its phasing, costing and 
delivery. Where appropriate to specific development sites, these are h ighlighted in the 
the Growth Allocation policies under the key considerations. The Council will keep the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan regularly reviewed and use this to prioritise the infrastructure 
necessary to support the growth of Blackburn with Darwen.   
3.97.  In line with the Balanced Growth  Strategy a combination of economic, social and 
environmental based infrastructure and mitigation will be required over the plan period.  
3.98.  Infrastructure improvements set out in the Local Plan and in the IDP will be  provide d in 
various ways. This will include new infrastructure, improvements to existing 
facilities/services or improvement through co -location or expansion of existing 
services/facilities. Infrastructure improvements will be delivery through a package of 
measure s including S106 developer contributions , S278 conditions, grant funding and 
local authority funded works.  
3.99.  In order to determine the level and range of developer contributions (including ‘in kind’ or 
financial contributions that can be sought without prej udicing the financial viability of 
different types of development in different areas of the Borough), a Plan Viability Study 
has been prepared as part of the Local Plan evidence base. This has been used to 
identify the expected minimum contributions set ou t in the respective Growth Allocation 
policies  and Table 3 below . Any S106 requirements will be sought in line with  the full 
findings of the Plan Viability Study and  paragraph 57 of the NPPF where they are:  
 Necessary to make the development acceptable in planning terms;  
 Directly related to the development; and  
 Fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the development.  
3.100.  The Council will prepare a Developer Contributions SPD to help support the delivery of 
infrastructure in the Local Plan. It will provide further clarity to developers, officers, 
stakeholders and local residents about the overall approach to seeking develop er 
contributions. This will include how the Council will apply the Plan Viability Study to 
determining appropriate S106 requirements  for non -allocated sites. It will also expand 
upon aspects such as how calculations on education contributions will be deter mined, 
and how the Sport England Sports Facility Calculator and Playing Pitch Calculator will be 
used.  
3.101.  Table 3 provide s an indication of the expected minimum levels of planning contributions 
that proposals for new residential development will be expected to be able to bear on 
non-allocated sites where infrastructure/mitigation is required. Further details will be set 
out in an SPD  including how these values are likely to change over time . An SPD will 
also cover instances whereby S106 contributions may be s ought for minor residential 
windfall sites (<10 dwellings) which are not subject to affordable housing or open space 
contributions .  
3.102.  Figures  set out in Table 3  are in addition to the specific policy requirements set out 
elsewhere in the Local Plan that wil l have  direct cost  implications on new development 
(e.g. affordable housing provision  at 20% , water efficiency measures, SuDs, onsite open  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  51 
 space and play, playing pitch contributions, biodiversity net gain and provision of electric 
vehicle charging points) . They are based on cost and density assumptions set out in the 
Local Plan Viability Study and therefore represent indicative minimums  only. Where 
these assumptions vary to specific proposals coming forward then any S106  
requirements will also vary.  
3.103.  Contri butions are  split by the following site typologies  as defined in the Local Plan 
Viability Assessment:  
 Primary  sites are predominantly greenfield sites in higher value areas, many of 
which are located on or close to the existing settlement boundary. These s ites are 
likely to be developed at a density of around 30 dwellings per net developable 
hectare, and will provide a range of house types including detached dwellings and 
a number of larger 4 and possibly 5 bed houses;  
 Secondary  sites are in the majority br ownfield site although there are also a small 
number of greenfield sites. The sites are mainly infill sites within the existing 
settlement areas and in some cases may be situated in slightly lower value areas 
in comparison with the primary sites. Developme nt will typically take place at a 
slightly higher density of 35 dwellings per net developable hectare; and  
 Tertiary sites are brownfield sites situated in the older, inner urban areas of the 
Borough and will be developed at a higher density of around 45 dw ellings per 
hectare with a greater number of smaller dwellings.  
Table 3: Indicative minimum  planning contributions that new development is expected to 
be capable of providing (assuming Local Plan Viability study assumptions and in 
addition to other Local Plan policy requirements including  20% affordable housing 
provision  and play provision on -site)

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  52 
 3.104.  Environmental Opportunity Areas are identified on the Polic y Map. Some of these areas 
are identified as playing a role in the delivery of biodiversity net gain where this is not 
feasible on -site. Such schemes would be considered to be part of the appropriate 
matters to be funded under part 2ix of  Policy CP12. The C ouncil will use any Developer 
Contributions SPD to provide further details on the role that an Environment Fund in the 
Borough could play in delivering such infrastructure.   
3.105.  It is up to the applicant to demonstrate whether particular circumstances justify  the need 
for a viability assessment to be submitted at the application stage, A clear explanation 
for the reasons why, in accordance with the Planning Practice Guidance38 (PPG), will be 
expected. Any reduction in planning contributions will then only be pe rmitted where it 
can be clearly justified through a robust site -specific financial viability appraisal (FVA). 
The FVA should be prepared on an open book basis in accordance with the 
requirements of the PPG and associated RICS Guidance and will include full  supporting 
evidence and explanation to justify all costs and revenues.  
3.106.  The level of detail required in such an appraisal will always be proportionate to the scale 
and complexity of the development proposed. The FVA will be expected to include 
details of the purchase price for the land and expected developers profit return together 
with an assessment of benchmark land value prepared in accordance with the PPG.  
FVAs will be independently appraised and the developer will be expected to pay for 
this39.   
3.107.  A Pha sing and Delivery Strategy will be required for larger developments that are to be 
delivered over a number of years/phases. The Strategy must demonstrate 
communication with infrastructure providers and outline how each phase interacts with 
other phases. Wh en necessary, the Strategy must be updated to reflect any changing 
circumstances between each phase(s). Any associated strategies must be consistent 
with the updated site wide Infrastructure Strategy.  
3.108.  Where planning contributions are secured (regardless of  the mechanism of securing 
those funds) the Council will report annually on total payments received, works 
committed and projects delivered. This information will be set out in the Infrastructure 
Funding Statement (IFS) and published on the Council’s websi te. The IFS also details 
the approach to charging monitoring fees as part of S106 agreements in the Borough.

 4. Development Management (DM) Policies  
4.1 People  
DM Policy 1 (DM1): Health  
4.1. Blackburn with Darwen experiences significantly higher than average level s of poor 
health among its population.  Particular issues are obesity and related illnesses, 
diseases related to smoking, and the effects of alcohol.  The Council and its partners are 
also particularly concerned about the health of young people, both in te rms of immediate 
term safeguarding and the potential long -term consequences that aspects of their 
lifestyles will have for their health.  
4.2. Policy DM1 sets out our approach to managing specific developments that influence 
these issues.  
DM Policy 1 (DM1): Health 
Health Facilities  
 
1. Improvements in health facilities, including GP surgeries, health centres and dental 
surgeries will be supported, responding to the changing needs and demands of both 
existing and new residents, including through:  
 
i. The provision of new or improved health facilities as part of new developments;  
ii. Enabling the continued enhancement and successful operation of the Royal 
Blackburn Hospital; and  
iii. Facilitating greater integration of health and social care, and the provision of 
integrated wellness hubs, including the co -location of health, community and 
wellness services.  
 
Hot Food Takeaways  
 
2. The development of hot food takeaways, or of hybrid uses incorporating such uses, will 
not be permitted in wards where more than 10% of year 6 pupils are classified as 
obese40.    
 
3. Where the development of a hot food takeaway, or a hybrid use incorporating such a 
use, is acceptable under paragraph 2, the Council will only consider granting planning 
permission where:  
 
i. There are no more than 3 existing hot food takeaways within 400m of the 
proposed site;  
ii. The location and design is acceptable and the proposed use does not 
detrimentally affect the vitality of the shopping area;  
iii. there is no harm or loss of amenity to the living conditions of near by residents, 
including that created by noise and disturbance from other users and their 
vehicles, odour and litter; and

 DM Policy 1 (DM1): Health 
iv. parking and traffic generation is not a danger to other road users, public 
transport operators or pedestrians.  
 
4. Where appropriate, the Council will consider imposing a condition restricting a business’ 
opening hours to reduce the likelihood of it being visited by young people and impose 
personal permissions41 on hot food takeaway applications, working with the business to 
ensure a healthie r offer.  
 
Local Shops  
 
5. Where the development of a new local shop is acceptable in principle under other 
policies, planning permission will only be granted where a condition can be imposed 
that prevents the subsequent establishment of a stand -alone off -licence without the 
need to apply for planning permission.  
 
Shisha cafes  
  
6. The Council will regard the development of shisha cafes, or of hybrid uses incorporating 
such uses, as falling into a sui generis use and will be subject to specific planning 
control.  Developments with these characteristics will not be granted planning 
permission unless it is very clearly demonstrated that the proposed use will have no 
negative impact on the health of individuals or the public at large.  
 
Healthy Food Environments  
 
7. Prop osals for new development that will help contribute to a more sustainable, local 
food network (in terms of food production, distribution, procurement and waste 
management) will be strongly supported in principle.

4.3. The Council and its partners are engaged in a range of long -term actions to address the 
health of the Borough’s residents, as well as to encourage people to take greater 
responsibility for the choices they make themselves.  Planning is one aspect of these 
actions.  In some instances a proposed development may have a direct impact on 
                                                
41 This may include restricting menus and other requirements to ensure healthy food choices   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  55 
 people’s health. In other cases it may indirectly contribute to poor health by encouraging 
or making it easy for individuals to make unhealthy choices.  Our evidence clearly sho ws 
that making it more difficult for people to make these unhealthy choices reduces the 
likelihood that they will do so; and that this change in behaviour will improve health 
outcomes over time.   
Health Facilities  
4.4. The Council will work with the Blackburn with Darwen CCG to ensure that the capacity of 
health facilities in Blackburn with Darwen increases in line with growing and changing 
needs. Improving the overall quality and (where needed) capacity of Blackburn wit h 
Darwen’s primary care facilities will be important to supporting good health and quality of 
life.It should also help to reduce pressure on hospital facilities. Maximising the 
accessibility of facilities to residents will promote their use therefore town and local 
centres will often be a suitable location for them.  
4.5. Health and social care facilities in England have traditionally been administered and 
accessed separately. As a result of people living longer on average, an increasing 
number of residents requ ire both health and social care services and Policy DM1 aims to 
facilitate the integration of the two services.  
Hot Food Takeaways  
4.6. NICE (2010) Guidance42 on prevention of cardiovascular disease outlines that food from 
hot food takeaways and the ‘informal ea ting out sector’ comprises a significant part of 
many people's diet. It indicates that local planning authorities should exercise their 
powers to prevent the establishment of new hot food takeaways where there is local 
evidence  that hot food takeaways are causing harm or there is an over -concentration of 
existing premises. It recommends that local planning authorities should be encouraged 
to restrict planning permission for hot food takeaways as well as consider the 
concentration of hot food takeaways in sp ecific areas to address disease prevention.  
4.7. In 2018, Publi c Health England published data43 on the number and density of fast food 
outlets in local authorities across the country. In England, there was an average of 96.5 
hot food takeaways per 100,000 head  of population compared to a total of 147.5 outlets 
per 100,000 population in Blackburn with Darwen. This ranked the Borough 13th  highest 
in terms of the density of outlets in the country and the fourth highest in the North West 
region.  
4.8. Childhood obesity  and excess weight are significant health issues for children and their 
families. There can be serious implications for a child’s physical and mental health, 
which can continue into adulthood. The number of children with an unhealthy and 
potentially danger ous weight is a national public health concern.  2019/20 f igures from 
the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP)  published by Public Health 
England  highlights 22% of Year 6 children in Blackburn with Darwen were  obese , of 
which 4.5% were severely obese .  
4.9. The proportion of food eaten outside the home has increased in recent years which is an 
important factor contributing to increasing levels of obesity44. Food eaten outside of the

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  56 
 home is more likely to be high in calories and hot food takeaways tend to s ell food that is 
high in fat and salt, and low in fibre, fruit and vegetables. In response to this, Policy DM1 
seeks to prevent the establishment of new hot food takeaways in areas where there are 
high levels of childhood obesity and where there is a conce ntration of these uses in a 
particular area of the Borough, as well as maximising opportunities to encourage people 
to make healthier food options.  
4.10.  The Healthier Place, Healthier Future (HPHF) Childhood Obesity Trailblazer  is one of 
five Childhood Obesity Trailblazer programmes funded by the Department of Health and 
Social Care. This three -year programme aims to tackle childhood obesity across  the 
Pennine Lancashire area. One of the aims of the trailblazer is to use the planning 
system to restrict food retailers that do not offer healthier options, introduce ‘personal 
planning permissions’ to regulate the opening of new hot food takeaways and t o 
encourage food businesses offering healthy food options to sign up to the ‘Recipe 4 
Health ’ scheme.  
4.11.  A Planning for Health Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) was adopted by the 
Council in April 2016. The Council will update this SPD as appropriate fol lowing adoption 
of the new Local Plan.  
Local shops  
4.12.  The Council wants to prevent and reduce the harm caused by alcohol. Policy DM1 aims 
to assist in reducing alcohol consumption in the Borough by controlling the 
establishment of new off -licences, making it more difficult for people to access alcohol, 
theref ore requiring subsequent permission for any proposals for such use.  
Shisha Cafes  
4.13.  Shisha smoking is harmful to health. A study published  by the British Medical Journal45 
described shisha smoking as a ‘major global public health epidemic’ with potential hea lth 
consequences including acute carbon monoxide poisoning, lung cancer and heart 
disease. The Council wants to prevent the establishment of new shisha cafes, or hybrid 
uses incorporating shisha smoking.  
Healthy Food Environments  
4.14.  The Council strongly suppo rts the principles of local food growing, distribution and 
procurement initiatives. Such enterprises strongly reflect all three tiers of sustainable 
communities (economic, social and environmental) and the Council will encourage and 
support proposals where ver possible.  
DM Policy 2 (DM2): Protecting Living and Working Environments  
4.15.  Development brings many benefits to local people.  It can provide new housing, new or 
better jobs, or an improved environment.  At the same time, it is important that we 
manage new  development so that it does not adversely affect people’s lives.  
4.16.  Policy DM2 sets out the Council’s approach to ensuring the Borough’s living and working 
environments are protected.

 DM Policy 2 (DM2): Protecting Living and Working Environments  
1. Development will be permitted where it can be demonstrated that:  
 
i. It will, in isolation and in conjunction with other planned or committed 
development, contribute positively to the overall physical, social, environmental 
and economic character of the area  in which the development is sited;  
ii. It would secure a satisfactory level of amenity and safety for surrounding uses 
and for existing and future occupants or users of the development itself, with 
reference to noise, vibration, odour, light, dust, other pol lution or nuisance, 
privacy / overlooking, open space provision and the relationship between 
buildings;  
iii. In the case of previously developed, other potentially contaminated or unstable 
land, a land remediation scheme can be secured which will ensure that th e land 
is remediated to a standard that provides a safe environment for occupants and 
users and does not displace contamination;  
iv. The development will have a neutral or positive impact on air quality. A 
comprehensive mitigation strategy will be required fo r any development likely to 
give rise to a deterioration of air quality; and  
v. The development incorporates positive measures aimed at reducing crime and 
improving community safety, including appropriate detailed design, the 
provision of adequate facilities  for young people, and the creation of a suitable 
mix of uses.

(2018)  
4.17.  Some development can have a very direct impact on people close to it.  It is important 
that planning manages this impact and ensures that no -one suffers from unsatisfactory 
conditions as a result of new development. The NPPF is clear that planning should 
always seek to secure high quality design and a good standard of amenity for all existing 
and future occupants of land and buildings. To this end, all development must have 
regard to its actual or potential impact on people’s living and working cond itions and the 
existing operations of adjacent premises.  
4.18.  The protection of amenity covers both living and working conditions. This means firstly 
that new development should provide for adequate day -to-day living and working 
conditions for those who will b e occupying it. Secondly, it means that development 
should not have undesirable amenity impacts on the living conditions of neighbouring 
residents or compromise the continued operation of uses and activities which are 
already established in the locality.  
4.19.  When considering development proposals, the Council will consider the risk of pollution 
arising from contamination and the impact on human health, property and the wider 
environment. Contamination is not, however, restricted to previously developed land but  
it can also occur on greenfield sites and it can arise from natural sources as well as from 
human activities. Developers should undertake a preliminary risk assessment to identify 
any contamination on site. Where sites are known to be contaminated, or whe re  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  58 
 contamination is subsequently discovered, any development proposals on the land will 
only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that the contamination can be mitigated.  
4.20.  The stability of land, insofar as it affects potential land uses, is a material  consideration 
that should be taken into consideration when determining planning applications. As well 
as the health and safety risks associated with the collapse of former workings, new 
development could also disturb mine gases and present a risk of explo sion. The Coal 
Authority High Risk Areas are indicated on the planning constraints map  and applicants 
will be expected to submit a Coal Mining Risk Assessment if located in these areas.  
4.21.  Air quality has a significant impact on public health, both in terms of mortality and on 
people’s quality of life. Local Planning decisions have an important role to play as they 
influence how and where air pollution is emitted, and whether new people are brought 
into existing areas of poor air quality. The Council has decl ared four Air Quality 
Management Areas: Intack; Bastwell; Blackamoor and Four Lane Ends where air quality 
exceeds the national air quality objectives. The Blackburn with Darwen Air Quality 
Planning Advisory Note (2018) identifies how developers can take ac tion that will reduce 
the health impacts associated with development and transport emissions. It seeks to 
apply a proportionate and consistent approach to addressing air quality concerns, 
identifying when and how to assess air quality, and the appropriate mitigation required. 
Applicants should refer to this guidance where relevant  
DM Poli cy 3 (DM3): Housing Mix, Standards and Densities  
4.22.  The HENA highlights a range of factors that will influence the demand for different sizes 
of homes, including demographic changes, future growth in real earnings and 
households’ ability to save, economic performance and housing affordability. The 
Council seeks to widen the choice of housing types in the Borough, continuing a move 
away from the dominance of smaller terraced ho using stock. The latest evidence set out 
in the HENA should be used to guide the mix on larger development sites. Where more 
specific housing mixes are considered appropriate in any site allocations, these will be 
set out in the appropriate development con siderations policy or design code documents.  
DM Policy 3 (DM3): Housing Mix, Standards and Densities  
1. All new major housing schemes will be expected to widen the choice of housing types 
available in Blackburn with Darwen, reflecting the Council’s latest ev idence of housing 
need and market demand.  
 
2. All new dwellings must comply with the nationally described space standards, and 
optional higher water efficiency standards (equivalent to 110 litres/person/day)  
 
3. In residential schemes of 10 dwellings or more, a t least 20% of homes should be built to 
the ‘accessible and adaptable’ standard in Part M4 (2) of the Building Regulations, unless 
specific site conditions make this impractical. The Council will also seek 5% of new 
homes to be wheelchair accessible (or ea sily adaptable) in accordance with Part M4 (3a) 
of the Building Regulations.  
 
4. To ensure the best use of land and buildings new housing developments will be expected 
to achieve minimum density standards of 45 dwellings per hectare (dph) (net developable 
area) in town centres and other locations that are well served by public transport. 
Minimum densities of between 30 -35dph (net developable area) will be considered 
appropriate in other locations.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  59 
 DM Policy 3 (DM3): Housing Mix, Standards and Densities  
 
5. Other variations in density may be needed in order to mitiga te harm to a heritage asset 
and/or relate to local character, for example. Densities will be expected to have a positive 
relationship with the existing character of a place, any distinctive features, the historic 
environment and the surrounding landscape. Site-specific densities may be introduced 
through area -based character assessments, design guides, design codes or masterplans 
in line with paragraph 125 of the NPPF.

Housing mix  
4.23.  Analysis set out in the 2018 Housing and Economic Needs Assessment provides the 
latest evidence on an appropriate mix of housing for the Borough. The table below sets 
out the mix broken down by market and affordable homes and is a starting point for 
considering the most appropriate mix in new developments . 
Table 4: Required housing mix by tenure  
House Type 1-bed 2-bed 3-bed 4+-bed 
Market housing  0-5% 35-40% 40-45% 15-20%

Affordable rent  30-35% 30-35% 25-30% 5-10% 
4.24.  In applying these mixes to individual development sites the Council will have regard to 
the nature of the development site and character of the area. It will also take into 
account any up -to-date evidence of need as well as the existing mix and turnover of 
properties at the local le vel. 
Housing standards  
4.25.  The National Planning Practice Guidance provides the basis for the Council to set 
standards relating to the optional technical standards on space , water  and accessibility. 
The Council has used its HENA and Plan Viability Study to inform the requirements for 
these standards in the new Local Plan . The construction costs of the optional technical 
standards have all been applied in the Local Plan Viability St udy. This work has involved 
specific consultation with the development community. Evidence demonstrates that the 
standards are needed and deliverable.  
4.26.   The northwest is an area of Moderate water stress and may be able to be a water 
exporter to areas of wat er stress by 2050.  This will only be feasible if demand is 
managed as the region grows and drops from the current average of 134 litres per capita 
per day to 110 litres by 2050.  The Council will require  the optional water efficiency  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  60 
 standard of 110 litre s per person per day, as described in Part G of Schedule 1 to the 
Building Regulations 2010, in all new residential development to improve security of 
supply  
Densities  
4.27.  The minimum density standards specified in Policy DM3 are applicable to any 
application involving residential use. Consideration of optimal density for making the 
most effective use of land should include an assessment of local market conditions and 
viability, local prevailing character, and ensure that a scheme maintains high quality 
design.  Supporting documents to some site allocations may demonstrate that alternative 
densities are more applicable, details will be set out in relevant development 
considerations policies  
DM Policy 4 (DM4 ): Assessing Planning Applications for Gypsy, Traveller 
and Travelling Showpeople Sites  
4.28.  The accommodation needs of the Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Showpeople 
communities set out in Policy CP4: Housing Development is one part of the overall 
picture of new housing requirements in Blackburn with Darwen.  Pla nning for these 
needs involves addressing a wide range of linked issues including access to education 
for young people, health and social care which are all covered by Policy DM4 below.  
DM Policy 4 (DM4): Assessing Planning Applications for Gypsy, Travelle r and 
Travelling Showpeople Sites  
1. The following criteria will be used in determining planning applications for Gypsy, 
Traveller and Travelling Showpeople Sites.  
 
In terms of their broad location sites will:  
i. Have good access to local services and facilities; and  
ii. Be primarily located within urban areas.  
 
In terms of their specific location, the site will:  
iii. Be in an area of low flood risk;  
iv. Safeguard the health of occupiers and provide a satisfactory level of amenity for 
them, by reference to a range o f factors including but not limited to the space 
available for each family, noise, odour, land contamination, other pollution or 
nuisance, and the disposal of refuse and foul water;  
v. Have good vehicular and pedestrian access from the highway and prioritise 
walking and cycling;  
vi. Not give rise to an unacceptable impact on amenity for users in the vicinity of the 
development, or, in the case of nearby commercial users, result in the imposition 
of new constraints on the way in which such users can operate their b usiness.  
 
2. Self-sought provision will be positively considered where it accords with this policy and 
other relevant policies in the Local Plan. Transit sites should provide safe and convenient 
access to road networks and be located so as to cause minimum di sruption to 
surrounding communities. Land contamination, flood risk issues and any health and 
safety risks that may arise for occupants from adjoining land uses, must also be 
considered.

4.29.  One of the overall aims of our Local Plan is to widen the choice of housing that is 
available in Blackburn with Darw en.  This is an important way in which planning can help 
people from all backgrounds to fulfil their aspirations, and can create sustainable and 
cohesive communities.  At the same time, it is important that new development comes 
forward in a planned and ma naged way, so that potentially competing objectives can be 
balanced, and any potential negative impacts of development dealt with at the planning 
stage.  
4.30.  New Gypsy and  Traveller sites should be planned sensitively to take account of the 
needs of both the tr avelling and settled communities. Specific considerations Policy DM4 
addresses include:  
 The promotion of integrated co -existence between the site and local community;  
 Access to local schools to enable G ypsy and  Traveller children to attend school 
regularly;  
 Access to local shops;  
 Access to employment opportunities;  
 Consideration of the effect of local environmental quality , such as noise or air 
quality, on  the health and well -being of any G ypsy and  Traveller or others as a 
result of the development.  
4.31.  In order for Gypsy  and Traveller  sites to benefit from convenient access to facilities and 
services such as health and education, the Borough’s urban areas will be the first 
preference for the development of new pitch es.  
DM Policy 5 (DM5): Affordable Housing and Rural Exception Sites  
4.32.  The provision of affordable housing to meet the Borough’s identified need is an 
important objective of the Local Plan and is set out in Core Policy CP4: Housing 
Development. Policy DM5 below provides additional detail on affordable housing 
requirements in addition to our approach to assessing proposals for development 
located outside of village boundaries to meet a local affordable housing need.  
DM Policy 5 (DM5): Affordable Housing and Rural Exception Sites  
Affordable Housing  
 
1. In meeting the identified Affordable Housing target set out in CP4: Housing Development, 
the Council will take into account issues affecting delivery including: availability of grant; 
evidence on the economic viability of individual developments; and up to date evidence 
on market c onditions.  
  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  62 
 DM Policy 5 (DM5): Affordable Housing and Rural Exception Sites  
2. The type of affordable housing provided should meet the requirement for at least 25% of 
the affordable units to be First Homes and then seek to meet the needs identified in the 
latest housing evidence in terms of type, tenure, size and suitabil ity to meet the needs of 
specific groups. Any local eligibility criteria will be set out in the Council’s Affordable 
Housing Developers Guide.  
 
Rural Exception Sites  
 
3. Outside the defined Urban Area and Village Boundaries, planning permission for 
residentia l development not specifically allowed for by other policies will only be granted 
where all the following criteria are met:  
 
i. A need is identified for affordable housing in the locality;  
ii. It is demonstrated that land is not available to accommodate the devel opment 
within the defined boundary of the village nearest to the proposed development 
and any others as may be appropriate;  
iii. The occupancy of the dwellings can be restricted to individuals accepted as 
requiring affordable housing in the locality; and  
iv. The dwellings provided will be made available as affordable housing in perpetuity.  
 
4. Where a new dwelling or dwellings are acceptable in principle under this policy, they shall 
in the first instance be located on land immediately adjoining the existing boundary  of a 
village.  New build dwellings in the open countryside will not be acceptable under this 
policy.  
 
5. Where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council that market housing is 
essential to cross -subsidise the delivery of affordable housing on  rural exception sites:  
 
i. The proportion of market housing must not exceed 5 0%; and  
ii. The market and affordable housing must not be distinguishable in design quality.

Affordable Housing  
4.33.  In accordance with Policy CP4, and the expectation set out in paragraph 63 of the 
NPPF, affordable housing should be on -site unless robustly justified. In assessing any 
potential variation to the overall target requirement set out in Policy CP4: Housing 
Development for affordable housing within a new development scheme, consideration 
will be given, through nego tiation with the Council, to “open book” evidence supplied by 
the developer relating to the viability of individual developments.  
Rural Exception Sites  
4.34.  In certain circumstances, small, predominantly affordable housing developments to meet 
local needs will be permitted outside but adjacent to defined settlement boundaries  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  63 
 where ordinarily there is a policy constraining new housing development. To enable this 
exception, it needs to be demonstrated that there is a proven need for the number and 
type of dwellin gs proposed, and that the Council is satisfied that the affordable housing 
will remain affordable and exclusively available for local needs in perpetuity. When 
considering the suitability of rural exception sites it should be demonstrated to the 
satisfacti on of the Council that there are no suitable and deliverable previously 
developed sites that could comply with the policy before consideration is given to the 
release of a greenfield site.  
4.35.  The Council expects all rural affordable housing proposals submitte d under this policy to 
be accompanied by a local housing need survey . This will provide information on the 
number of households that are currently and likely to be in housing need in the next five 
years, their incomes and the type of accommodation required  to meet their housing 
need. When a proportion of market housing is also proposed, the local housing needs 
survey must identify the type of market housing that is required. If a survey of local 
housing need supporting an application has been conducted more  than four years prior 
to a planning application being submitted, the Council will require the housing need and 
affordability data to be updated.  
4.36.  Any proposal that includes market housing must include a robust, independently -
prepared and audited viability assessment of the proposed development, prepared on an 
open book basis. This is needed for the Council to assess whether the market element 
of the proposal is justified. The extent of the funding gap to be bridged in order for the 
proposal to be viable, in cluding the income from cross -subsidy generated through open -
market sales that will assist in creating the additional scheme revenue that can fund the 
affordable housing on the site without requiring additional public subsidy, must be clearly 
set out.  
DM P olicy 6 (DM6 ): Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)  
4.37.  Over recent years Blackburn with Darwen has seen a considerable increase in the 
provision of HMO accommodation across the Borough. Evidence demonstrates that this 
has included providing for needs imported  from outside of the Borough. The Council now 
considers there to be an over -provision of such accommodation. Concentrations of 
HMOs (including hostel provision) have significant impacts on the Councils ability to 
address the housing supply imbalance, incre asing the stock of small, poor quality 
housing in the Borough. They also have been associated with a significant increase in 
the demand for a wide variety of frontline services from substance abuse, 
homelessness, social care, police and ambulance services.   
4.38.  Policy DM6 therefore seeks to prevent any new HMO developments coming forward 
over the plan period. This will help to widen the choice of high quality, safe and healthy 
homes in line with Strategic Objective 3, and help to support ambitions for regenerat ion 
of the town centres.   
DM Policy 6 (DM6): Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)  
1. Proposals for new HMOs, including hostel accommodation, will not be permitted in any 
part of the Borough during the plan period. This applies to both new build development 
and proposed conversions of existing dwellings or buildings.  
 
2. Occupancy conditions may be imposed on planning applications for other forms of 
accommodation to prevent them from becoming HMOs in the future.

Key supporting docs/evidence  Blackburn with Darwen HMO Licence Register  
 
4.39.  Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) (including hostel provision) have an important 
role to play in a balanced housing market, contributing to the overall supply of cheaper 
accommodation in the Borough, particularly for students, young people and those on 
lower incomes. However, larger scale HMO properties, and over provision  in general of 
HMOs in an area, can lead to significant social and environmental problems.  
4.40.  Blackburn with Darwen has areas of poor quality housing in the Borough, particularly in 
the private rented sector. Furthermore the dominance of terraced housing in m any parts 
of the Borough means that there is a limited choice of housing available, and residents 
may suffer problems such as overcrowding, lack of amenity space, noise and 
inconvenient or unsafe access. These issues are often increased when dwellings are 
converted to Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs). The nature of Blackburn with 
Darwen’s housing areas means that these issues are concentrated into particular areas. 
This is resulting in fundamental changes to the character of the local area, and for an 
area’s housing choice to be skewed away from family accommodation or become 
dominated by a single, narrow sector of the market. This impacts negatively on the 
image of a neighbourhood and hence on demand, both from potential residents who are 
in a position to choose where they live, and from developers.  
4.41.  The Council regards this as an undesirable outcome and Policy DM6 seeks to restrict 
new HMO development to support the strategic objectives for the Borough and to help 
prevent further increased pressure on r esources for local services and infrastructure. 
The Council will use the combination of policies set out in the Local Plan, Article 4 
Directions, and appropriate Supplementary Planning Documents to help achieve these 
policy aims.  
4.42.  Where appropriate the Coun cil may impose occupancy conditions on any planning 
application for other forms of accommodation that may otherwise revert to HMO use or 
alternative inappropriate accommodation (for example temporary sleeping 
accommodation such as Airbnb).  
4.43.  In February 201 2 the Council introduced an Article 4 Direction within a number of wards 
in the Borough (Shear Brow, Corporation Park, Wensley Fold, Mill Hill, Ewood, Sudell 
and Sunnyhurst). This removes permitted development rights enabling the conversion of 
a C3 dwellin g house to a C4 ‘small’ HMO with 3 -6 occupiers within these areas. The 
Council will seek to extend the use of Article 4 Directions to other appropriate areas to 
fulfil the intended policy aims of DM6.  
 
  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  65 
 DM Policy 7 (DM7 ): Conversion of Buildings in the Countryside  
4.44.  A key objective of our Local Plan is to manage change in Blackburn with Darwen’s rural 
areas in a way that ensures they have a sustainable future.  One aspect of this is to 
create scope for redundant buildings to be re -used.  This can assist in maintaining  the 
viability of farms, either through diversification of the farm business itself or through the 
release of part of the farm’s holding; and can introduce new uses into the rural area that 
support the development of a diverse and robust economy.  
4.45.  Policy D M7 sets out criteria against which proposals for the conversion of buildings in 
rural areas will be assessed, and explains how this type of development will be managed 
so as to protect the character and appearance of the rural area.   
DM Policy 7 (DM7): Conversion of Buildings in the Countryside  
1. Outside the defined Urban Area and Village Boundaries, the conversion of a building will 
be permitted provided that the proposal satisfies all the following criteria:  
 
i. In the case of proposals for residential conver sions, the building must be shown to 
be unsuitable for industrial, tourism, non -retail commercial, other than farm shops, 
or other commercial use because of its location, size, form, general design, or 
relationship with neighbouring properties. Application s for conversion to 
residential use where this has not been demonstrated must be supported by 
evidence that every reasonable effort has been made to secure a suitable 
business or other non -residential use for the property over a period of at least 12 
month s; 
ii. So far as is reasonable and practicable, the development is accessible or can be 
made accessible by sustainable modes of transport;  
iii. The buildings are of a permanent and substantial construction and are capable of 
conversion without major or complete rec onstruction. A structural survey should 
accompany the planning application;  
iv. The buildings are large enough for the proposed use without the need for an 
extension which would be out of scale with the host building or incompatible with 
the character of the a rea; 
v. In the case of a building erected under the General Permitted Development Order 
the Council must be satisfied that it was originally erected for genuine agricultural 
purposes and  
vi. In order to maintain control over the future development of the site, in  appropriate 
cases the Council will remove permitted development rights, and / or restrict 
conversions to the particular use applied for in the case of commercial 
conversions.

 4.46.  In support of the Council’s objective of supporting the development of a diverse and 
robust economy, the Council’s preferred use for converted buildings in the rural area is 
commercial use, excluding freestanding retail uses which are expected to be 
concentrated into existing centres and villages.  New residential development in the 
countryside conflicts with our overall development strategy in general terms, but it is 
recognised that there will be instances in which residential use is the most appropr iate 
end use for a building, and can result in the sustainable re -use of a building which 
otherwise would have had no viable future.  
4.47.  In all cases where development is proposed as being supported by this policy, the 
Council will need to be satisfied that th e development genuinely represents the 
conversion of an existing building.  Proposals which effectively involve the creation of a 
new building, or where there is to be a very significant increase in the footprint of the 
building, will not be supported by t his policy and are contrary to our overall planning 
strategy.  They will be considered against our overall policy framework.  
4.48.  The Council has previously adopted ‘The Conversion of Buildings in the Countryside 
Supplementary Planning Guidance’ which provides  additional guidance on converting an 
existing building in the countryside to another use.  
DM Policy 8 (DM8 ): Replacement Dwellings in the Countryside  
4.49.  The replacement of an existing dwelling with another can be acceptable in the rural area 
because no new u nits are added.  Where such development is proposed, the key issues 
are to ensure that a) the development genuinely represents the replacement of an 
existing dwelling; and b) the impact of the new dwelling on the countryside is not 
significantly greater th an that of the original. Policy DM8 sets out the Council’s 
requirements in relation to these developments.   
DM Policy 8 (DM8): Replacement Dwellings in the Countryside  
1. Outside the defined Urban Area and Village Boundaries, the replacement of an existing 
dwelling will be permitted provided the proposal satisfies all the following criteria:  
 
i. The existing dwelling can be lawfully used for residential purposes at the present 
time;  
ii. The size of the proposed dwelling does not result in an increase in the scale o r 
footprint of the existing building to an extent that would unacceptably impact on 
the character and openness of the rural area or on biodiversity;  
iii. The proposed dwelling and any boundary treatments are appropriate in terms of 
siting, materials, design, an d do not detract from the landscape character areas, 
or the residential amenity of any adjacent property.  
 
2. In order to maintain control over the future development of the site, the Council will 
consider removing permitted development rights in appropriate cases.

DM Policy 9 (DM9 ): Rural Workers’ Dwellings in the Countryside  
4.50.  There are circumstances in which there is a need for rural workers, particularly those 
engaged in agriculture or forestry, to live at or near their place of work.  In assessing 
whether this is the case, the Council will need to be satisfied of the need, from a 
functional and fina ncial point of view, for the worker’s dwelling to be in the specific 
location proposed; and that the enterprise concerned is likely to remain in operation for a 
reasonable period of time.  We will also need to ensure that the operational justification 
for such a dwelling continues to exist, and that development permitted as an exception 
on this basis does not over time become established as a freestanding dwelling.   
DM Policy 9 (DM9): Rural Workers’ Dwellings in the Countryside  
1. Outside existing settlements, planning permission will only be granted for a new rural 
worker’s dwelling within the land holding of the source of employment where it is 
demonstrated that the proposal satisfies all the following criteria:  
 
i. The worker is full time or primari ly employed in agriculture, forestry or another use 
demonstrably requiring them to be present on site almost of the time, and a 
condition can be imposed restricting occupancy to a worker in this position;  
ii. There is a clear operational need for an additional  dwelling for the worker to live 
close to the enterprise;  
iii. The enterprise is established and economically viable;  
iv. The accommodation can be related to an existing group of buildings connected to 
the business. The Council will not consider applications for is olated dwellings 
unless it can be shown that this is the only practical solution, or where other 
exceptional circumstances apply; and  
v. In the case of agricultural dwellings, there is no evidence of farm buildings which 
were suitable for conversion to a dwel ling having been sold off separately from 
the farmland concerned.  
 
2. Where a new dwelling is essential to support a new farming activity, satisfying the above 
criteria, permission will be granted for temporary accommodation for a period of no more 
than three  years. The temporary accommodation must be removed at the end of the 
period, and successive extensions will not be granted to the temporary permission.  
 
3. The Council will seek to ensure that any new dwellings granted planning permission 
under this policy a re proportionate in size to the nature of the undertaking to which they 
are attached and no larger than required to meet the needs of the worker.

DM Policy 10 (DM10 ): Residential Gardens and Boundaries   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  68 
 4.51.  The extension of a residential garden or boundary can provide useful additional private 
garden space.  However, it can also result in the introduction of domestic feat ures and 
maintained land into an otherwise unaltered landscape or area of amenity land.  Policy 
DM10 explains how the Council will manage this issue.   
DM Policy 10 (DM10 ): Residential Gardens and Boundaries  
1. Outside of the urban boundary, an extension to a  residential garden or boundary will only 
be permitted where it will not, in isolation or in combination with other committed or 
completed development, lead to any detriment to visual amenity or to the character of the 
surrounding landscape.  In appropriat e cases, the Council will remove permitted 
development rights in order to protect the character and amenity of the landscape.  
 
2. Proposals to extend a residential garden within the urban boundary will be assessed 
against all other relevant policies of the pl an. All proposals will consider issues around 
privacy, overlooking and amenity, and should be of an appropriate scale or size for the 
area.

4.52.  Applications for garden extensions will be considered on their own merits having regard 
to all relevant policies in the plan. Retrospective applications will be considered in the 
same way. In all cases, garden extensions will be  expected to relate well to the existing 
built form of the settlement. Applications within the urban boundary are more likely to be 
considered acceptable, provided that the land involved would not detract from important 
open space or other land that forms an important part of the form and character of the 
settlement.  
4.53.  Garden extensions should not be of an excessive scale and size, with garden extensions 
that are larger than the existing garden associated with the property unlikely to be 
approved. A ‘rounding -off’ of a rear garden boundary to a line similar to that of 
neighbouring properties or to a prominent natural boundary are more likely to be 
appropriate.  
DM Policy 11 (DM11 ): Safeguarding Community Facilities  
4.54.  Facilities such as small shops, post offices, public houses and community halls are an 
important part of life in our towns and rural areas.  They provide for everyday needs, but 
also serve a social function and act as a focus for communities.  In rural areas in 
particular, they also contribute to sust ainable living, ensuring that residents do not need 
to travel into the main towns so frequently.  However, such facilities can often be under 
threat due to changes in lifestyles and economic pressures on businesses.  Given their 
importance to the vitality of the rural area and urban neighbourhoods, it is important that 
our planning framework enables them to be retained wherever possible.   
4.55.  Policy DM11 sets out how we will manage change of this type.  It will also be relevant in 
cases where a local facility has been designated as an Asset of Community Value.    
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  69 
 DM Policy 11 (DM11 ): Safeguarding Community Facilities  
1. Development at or in association with existing rural facilities, including but not limited to 
shops, post offices or public houses, will be granted  planning permission where it is 
demonstrated that this will enable the retention of the facility.  Forms of enabling 
development that are acceptable in principle under this criterion include partial changes 
of use and the diversification of the range of u ses permitted.  
 
2. Proposals for the complete change of use of buildings or land identified as being an asset 
of value to the local community or otherwise considered to be of importance to the 
sustainability of the community which it serves, will not be permi tted except where it can 
be demonstrated that the use is no longer economically viable or required by the local 
community, and that the use is not capable of being supported by enabling development 
or a diversified use.  
 
3. Applications for the change of use of buildings identified as assets of value to the local 
community, or otherwise considered to be of importance to the sustainability of the 
community which it serves, must be supported by evidence that the unencumbered 
freehold or equivalent long leasehold  for the property has been offered for sale, through 
appropriate channels, on the open market for a period of at least 12 months at a realistic 
price; and that no reasonable offers have been refused.

financially viable, this includes consideration of grant funding and other income streams 
that might be available. The applicant will also be expected to demonstrate that they 
have considered the re -use of t he site for other types of community facilities. Alongside 
this, evidence of a suitable marketing exercise should be provided, undertaken free of tie

 4.2 Place  
DM Policy 12 (DM12): Clean and Green Energy  
4.57.  A key part of achieving the Council’s carbon neutral ambitions and helping to mitigate 
the impacts of climate change will involve the reduction of consumption of fossil fuels. 
Energy efficiency, clean energy and renewable and low carbon energy schemes have  a 
key role to play in promoting more sustainable forms of development and reducing the 
production of greenhouse gases. The Council will encourage higher standards of energy 
efficiency in development , utilisation of decentralised energy networks  and the pr ovision 
of renewable or low carbon projects .  The Council  will balance the immediate impact of 
the proposals on the amenities of the local environment with their wider contribution to 
reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.  
4.58.  For the purposes of Policy DM 12, the means of generating renewable or low carbon 
energy include (but are not restricted to) onshore wind generation, photovoltaic cells, 
passive solar heating systems, combined heat and power, biomass and air/ground 
source heat pumps.   
DM Policy 12 (DM1 2): Clean and Green Energy  
1. The Council will encourage enhanced emissions reducti on from new development 
through:  
i. Energy efficiency measures above the requirements of current Building 
Regulations ; 
ii. Connection to a heat network in within an area already served by a heat network 
or connection -ready within an area proposed for heat network developm ent; 
iii. Incorporat ion of  renewable and low carbon energy in frastructure  
 
Major d evelopment proposing enhanced emissions reduction should be accompanied by 
an Energy Statement.  
 
2. Commercial development (Use Classes B2, B8 and E) of 2,500m2 or more should 
achieve, as a minimum, BREEAM Good or an accepted equivalent standard46; 
 
3. Planning permission will be granted for renewable or low carbon energy developments 
provided th at they:  
 
i. Do not cause demonstrable harm to residential living environment; and  
ii. Do not harm the historic environment; and  
iii. Can demonstrate no adverse effect on the natural environment, including 
statutory and non -statutory designated sites, priority habi tats and species, and 
soils of high environmental value, such as peatlands and wetlands; and  
iv. Do not have an unacceptable visual impact which would be harmful to the 
character of the area; and  
v. Will not have a detrimental impact on highway safety.

4. Wind e nergy development will be permitted in areas of the Borough identified as 
potentially suitable for Wind Energy Development (as shown on the Polic y Map) where, 
in addition to satisfying requirements of 3i -v above,  it can be clearly demonstrated that:  
 
i. Following consultation, the planning impacts identified by any local community 
that would be affected have been fully addressed;  
ii. The proposal would not cause significant harm, both individually and cumulatively 
with other developments, to the quality and enj oyment of the landscape and 
related views; and  
iii. There would be no unacceptable impact on amenity or safety in terms of noise, 
shadow flicker, vibration, topple distance, air traffic safety, radar and 
telecommunications or visual dominance.  
iv. There is no risk to the public water supply. Where proposals are proposed on 
catchment land used for public water supply, a risk assessment of the impact on 
public water supply may be required with the identification and implementation of 
any necessary mitigation measures.

Energy Hierarchy  
4.59.  The energy hierarchy is a classification of energy options prioritised to assist progress 
towards a more sustainable energy system and carbon reduction goals.  Its inclusion in 
Policy DM12 is to encourage progress towards these objectives over the Local Plan 
period. The hierarchy is:  
i. Lean: use less energy  – by reducing demand and using energy more efficiently  
ii. Clean: supply energy efficiently  – seek to maximise delivery of space heating 
requirements such as through district heating;  
iii. Green: use renewable or low carbon energy  - generate heat or electricity on site 
to further reduce emissions from the development . 
4.60.  All stages in the hierarchy may be implemented in development and d evelopers can  use 
the Climate Impacts Framework  to set out their proposals.  
Building Standards  
4.61.  For non -residential development BREEAM Good rating (or an equivalent accepted 
standard) will be expected as a minimum for all commercial developments over 
2,500m2. The level of BREEAM rating requested has been informed by results from the 
Plan viability testing for offices and industrial development. This demonstrates that 
development on a speculative basis is generally not viabl e in the Borough. 
Developments are typically met by public sector funding or in the case of mixed -use 
schemes cross -subsidised by other more viable forms of development. Development has  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  72 
 still been shown to come forward in the Borough over recent years, mot ivated by specific 
circumstances such as: an owner occupier wishing to expand; a scheme benefitting from 
public sector funding support; or pre -lets, pre -sales or development by owner occupiers 
of serviced plots. It is however marginal and so the BREEAM Goo d rating requirement 
represents an appropriate balance.  
4.62.  For residential development the Government plans to introduce The Future Homes 
Standard by 2025, which will require new build homes to be future -proofed with high 
standards of energy efficiency and lo w carbon heating, mandating the end of fossil -fuel 
heating systems in all new houses from 2025. Amended standards will be incorporated 
into design code or specific policy at a later stage as further details become available. 
Requirements of Policy DM12 aro und energy and performance will be applied to existing 
dwellings where appropriate (‘retrofitting’ as part of regeneration and renewal schemes).  
Heat Networks  
4.63.  Initial heat network masterplanning work completed by the Council, focusing on some 
early priorit y areas, indicates the potential for network opportunities in Daisyfield, 
Blackburn, Blackburn Town Centre and Shadsworth, Blackburn. Further work is planned 
looking at the technical and economic feasibility of the Town Centre and Shadsworth 
locations. The se areas are identified on the Polic y Map to highlight their potential for 
future development.  
4.64.  New development coming forward in these areas will be expected to take account of the 
potential opportunities and be connection ready should future schemes be p rogressed. 
Other suitable areas may be identified and/or developers may come forward with their 
own proposals for heat networks that will be supported.  
4.65.  The Leeds  and Liverpool Canal offers a potential energy source for sustainable heating 
and cooling of de velopment adjacent to the waterway, subject to separate agreement 
with the Canal and River Trust.  
Wind Energy  
4.66.  The NPPF refers to the need to identify suitable areas for renewable and low carbon 
energy in Local Plans ‘where this would help secure their development’47. Whilst the 
identification of suitable areas is considered unnecessary to help secure development 
for most renewable technologies in Blackburn with Darwen, onshore wind energy 
developments are a different cas e. National planning policy48 and g uidance49 currently 
restricts the granting of new on -shore wind energy developments to areas that are 
identified as suitable for wind energy development only in a Local or Neighbourhood 
Plan. Policy DM12 therefore provides a framework to help facilitate new  onshore wind 
energy development where they meet other relevant criteria set out in the policy.  
4.67.  Stages 1 and 2 of the Blackburn with Darwen Wind Energy report of 2015 are used as a 
basis for identifying potential areas suitable for wind. This desktop site screening 
process highlights areas considered to have potential for accommodating either small 
(100- 500kW), medium (501kW -1.5MW) or large (over 1.5MW) turbines. It comprises 
constraints mapping (the more significant environmental / planning constraints), 
residential buffers and wind speed data. The Polic y Map show s areas suitable for

 turbines using this method. Further feasibility work (into grid connection, key risks and 
mitigation of any constraints) will be expected prior to progression to business case  
development or any planning submission phase.  
4.68.  For a proposal to be considered acceptable and satisfy the criteria set out in Policy  
DM12 it will  need to clearly demonstrate any impacts of the proposal on the following: 
Local  Nature Reserves; Biologica l Heritage Sites; Scheduled Monuments; Listed 
Buildings;  Registered Parks and Gardens; Conservation Areas; surface water features; 
flood zones;  public rights of way; roads; rail, overhead electric lines; underground gas  
pipelines/electricity cables; cou ntryside areas; Green Belt land; landfill sites; and  
aviation facilities. Applicants should set out how impacts are, in the first instance, 
avoided or, where this is not possible, mitigated to acceptable levels.  
4.69.  The planning framework for wind turbine dev elopment needs to balance the competing 
objectives of supporting a shift in the country’s energy mix while protecting the character 
of our most sensitive upland and rural areas. In addition, it needs to ensure that the 
direct impact of turbines on people l iving nearby is adequately managed. Policy DM12 
should help the Council achieve this aim.  
4.70.  The Council will prepare a Renewable and Low Carbon Energy SPD to provide further 
guidance on the application of matters set out in Policy DM12.  
DM Policy 13 (DM13 ): Flooding/SuDS  
4.71.  Both the NPPF and the Flood and Water Management Act (2010) highlight the need for 
an effective flood risk management strategy and proactive Local Plan policies that take 
account of flood risk to ensure the impacts of climate change are fully  considered and 
mitigated. A new Local Flood Risk Management Strategy for Lancashire has been 
adopted for the period 2021 -2027. Policy DM13 below sets out the Council’s approach to 
managing flood risk and surface water  specifically through new developments .  
DM Policy 13 (DM13 ): Flooding/SuDS  
1. Development will be required to demonstrate that it is safe from all types of flooding and 
that it will not exacerbate flood risk elsewhere in the Borough, including neighbouring 
agricultural land. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site -specific 
flood risk assessment50. 
 
2. Where appropriate this will include a requirement to demonstrate that there is no 
sequentially preferable location in which the development could take place, and if 
necessary, tha t the development complies with the Exception Test.  
 
3. Surface water should be managed as close to its source as possible and drained using a 
sustainable drainage system (SuDS), unless there is clear evidence that this would be 
inappropriate, to reduce or ha ve a neutral effect on flood risk, minimise water pollution 
and enhance biodiversity.  Natural flood management techniques should be prioritised 
wherever possible as part of any mitigation scheme.  Measures such as rainwater 
recycling, green roofs, water b utts and permeable surfaces will be encouraged to mitigate 
the impact of potential flood risk.  
 
                                                
50 In line with paragraph 167 of the NPPF   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  74 
 DM Policy 13 (DM13 ): Flooding/SuDS  
4. Surface water should be discharged in the following order of priority:  
 
i. An adequate soakaway or some other form of infiltration system;  
ii. An attenuated discharge to surface water body;  
iii. An attenuated discharge to public surface water sewer, highway drain or another 
drainage system;  
iv. An attenuated discharge to public combined sewer.  
 
5. Applicants wishing to discharge to public sewer will need to submit clear evidence 
demonstrating why alternative options are not available as part of the determination of 
their application.  
 
6. Applications for detailed approval will be expected to be supplemented by appropriate 
maintenance and management regimes for the lifetime of any sur face water drainage 
schemes.

Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) Level 2 (2021)  
BwD Drainage Planning Guidance (2020)  
4.72.  The Council has undertaken both a Level 1 and Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (SFRA) to help inform site selection of Growth Allocation sites and to inform 
both policy on flood risk and site specific policies. Proposals for development on non -
allocated sites should consult the SFRA to identify the likelihood of flooding. A site 
specific Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) (or completion of a Level 2 SFRA) w ill be 
required to be completed prior to planning permission being granted for development in 
any location identified at risk of flooding.  
4.73.  The NPPF directs development away from areas of high risk from flooding, and where 
development within these areas is  necessary, makes it safe for users without increasing 
the risk of flooding elsewhere (sequential test and exception tests). A Level 1 Strategic 
Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA) provides the necessary information for the sequential 
and exception test to be app lied to support the initial allocation of sites for development. 
New development has the potential to interfere with existing drainage systems, decrease 
floodplain storage, reduce permeable surface areas and increase the volume and speed 
of runoff through a catchment, ultimately leading to significant changes to river 
catchment characteristics and subsequently increase flood risk.  
4.74.  The Level 1 SFRA identified a number of proposed Growth Allocation sites that required 
a more detailed assessment of flood risk prior to their allocation in the Local Plan. A 
SFRA Level 2 has been prepared for these sites and recommen dations from the 
assessment have  been included within the relevant Growth Allocation Policies. The 
Level 2 SFRA also identifies site-specific  requirements for Flood Risk Assessment s 
(FRA) which should be addressed as part of the planning application process for 
developing these sites .   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  75 
 4.75.  Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are designed to mimic the natural drainage 
arrangements of a site, and are  used to manage surface water flows, providing an 
important tool in minimising flood risk. The design of SuDS should be considered at the 
earliest possible stages of the planning process so that they can be incorporated into the 
design, and the best manage ment practices can be used. Wherever possible, multiple 
benefits from SuDS should be sought, such as the provision of open space, wildlife 
improvements and water conservation.  The whole life cyle of an asset should be 
considered at the design stage and all  proposed SuDS features are to include detailed 
future maintenance programmes.   
4.76.  Policy DM13 should be read in conjunction with the Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy for Lancashire (2021 -2027), and the Council’s Drainage Planning Guidance 
(2020) for more  detail on Flood Risk Assessments and management of surface water 
discharge.  
DM Policy 14 (DM 14): Environmental Opportunity Areas  
4.77.  Development can play an important and direct role in enhancing its immediate 
environment and the Council will take these impacts into account in decision -making.  
Proposals that can help contribute to environmental improvements in the Borough will be 
considered particularly favourably. Policy DM14 identifies how the Council will ensure 
that this is achieved even when on -site enhancements may not be possible .  
DM Policy 14 (DM14): Environmental Opportunity Areas  
1. The Council will ensure that proposals for development during the plan period seek to 
protect, enhance and maintain the natural capital of Environmental Opportunity A reas 
(indicated on the Polic y Map). These areas have been highlighted for their specific value 
in terms of habitats, biodiversity, carbon management and/or flood risk mitigation.    
 
2. Requirements for carbon or biodiversity offsetting schemes arising from n ew 
developments will be directed towards these areas in the first instance, or the wider 
Green and Blue Infrastructure network.

benefits in terms of habitats, carbon sequestration and water management.  Offsetting 
away from the application site will only be countenanced when the hierarchy of 
avoidance, mitig ation and compensation on or, failing that, close to an application site 
has been properly examined and found wanting.  
4.79.  The Environmental Opportunity Areas set out on the Policy Map are informed by the 
Council’s Climate Change and Natural Capital Study: pa rticularly Chapter 7 (Natural 
capital and ecosystem services), Chapter 8 (Green infrastructure mapping) and Chapter 
9 (Habitat mapping, connectivity and biodiversity net gain). The potential for carbon 
sequestration and storage by habitat type is set out i n Appendix F.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  76 
 4.80.  Where appropriate, Environmental Opportunity Areas  may be linked to statutory and 
non-statutory designated sites and ultimately form part of nature recovery networks in 
the Borough and in neighbouring authorities.  Further appropriate guidanc e will be 
provided through a Supplementary Planning Document after Defra has determined the 
responsible authorities for nature recovery strategies, and the Council has developed the 
Environmental Opportunity Areas concept further.  
DM Policy 15 (DM15 ): Biodiversity

DM Policy 15 (DM15 ): Biodiversity  
1. Demonstration of biodiversit y net gain (Policy CP6) will be required as part of all new 
development s51 through application of the latest Biodiversity Metric52 and submission of a

2. Development likely to harm, damage or destroy statutory or non -statutory designated 
sites (as shown on the Polic y Map)  or habitats or species of:  
 
i. International or national importance  (Sites of Special Scientific Interest)  will not 
normally be permitted;  
ii. Principal importance,  (Biological Heritage Sites or habitats and species listed in

iii. Local importance  (Local Wil dlife Sites  and Local Nature Reserves)  will not be 
permitted unless the harm caused is outweighed by other planning considerations 
and an appropriate mitigation strategy can be secured.  
 
3. Nature Recovery Networks, as identified in the Local Nature Recovery Strategy should 
not be compromised;  
 
4. Where it has been comprehensively demonstrated that negative impacts on habitats or

Local Nature Recovery Strategy (expected 2023)  
4.82.  Nature Recovery Networks have to be strengthened and connected to stem  the loss of 
nature and deliver a significant net gain in the Borough’s overall biodiversity value, 
enabling nature to recover and have greater resilience to the changing climate.  Existing 
wildlife site designations, along with identified Environmental Op portunity Areas (see 
Policy DM14) are expected to support this aim and feed into any future Local Nature 
Recovery Strategy.  
4.83.  Wildlife site designations are intended to identify discrete areas of national, regional and 
local importance. These are identified on the Polic y Map.  If overlap occurs the higher 
designation takes precedence and the remainder of the site is reviewed to establish if it 
still qualifies as an area of wildlife importance.  
4.84.  A small number of Local (District) Wildlife Sites coincide with B iological Heritage Sites.  
Boundaries have been re -drawn to separate the designations on the Polic y Map.  All 
Local (District) Wildlife Sites are to be resurveyed in 2022 and assessed against site 
selection guidelines to bring the designations and boundari es up to date.  Lancashire 
County Council is to carry out a review of all (County) Biological Heritage Sites, which 
will include an assessment of the sites overlapped by the West Pennine Moors SSSI.  
4.85.  In advance of a Local Nature Recovery Strategy being prep ared then Environmental 
Opportunity Areas and wildlife site desi gnations set out on the Policy  Map will be used to 
identify whether habitats have ‘strategic significance’ in the context of the Biodiversity 
Metric.  
4.86.  To satisfy Policy DM15 the consideration o f negative impacts on habitats or species 
should include:  
 air quality impacts (e.g. traffic impacts from new development, new agricultural 
developments (such as pig and poultry intensive farming) and the associated air 
quality impacts on SSSIs. Policy DM2 provides further details;  
 water related impacts (water quality, and/or quantity); and  
 light pollution impacts.  
4.87.  Any compensatory habitat provided as part of addressing the policy requirements of 
DM15 to address biodiversity net gain must ensure that appropriate management and 
protection of such habitat is secured for the long -term. Compensation must also be 
greater and better than that which has been lost.  
4.88.  Where necessary, further guidance will be provided as part of the Natural Environment 
SPD propos ed under Policy CP6: The Natural Environment.  
DM Policy 16 (DM16): Green and Blue Infrastructure  
4.89.  Blackburn with Darwen benefits from a wide range of green spaces such as parks, 
amenity space, natural and semi -natural spaces and sites of importance to biodi versity

 is important to protect the network of green and blue spaces across Bla ckburn with 
Darwen for different needs such as recreation, biodiversity and flood protection.   
DM Policy 16 (DM16): Green and Blue Infrastructure  
1. All development must be designed to make a positive contribution to Blackburn with 
Darwen’s Green and Blue I nfrastructure network through:  
 
i. Inclusion of multi -functional landscaped public open space in the development;  
ii. Retention and enhancement of existing ecological and landscape features and 
spaces;  
iii. Incorporation of features in the built fabric that support and enhance key local 
species;  
iv. Provision for active travel on foot or bicycle;  
v. Physical and functional connections with neighbouring sites with connectivity into 
the Council’s Public Rights of Way (PROW) and infrastructure network; and  
vi. Protecting, enhancin g and maintaining existing trees (including veteran trees), 
woodlands (including ancient woodlands) and hedgerows and contribute to the 
expansion of tree cover in the Borough.  
 
2. Where it has been comprehensively demonstrated that negative impacts on green a nd 
blue infrastructure cannot be avoided or mitigated on site, local compensatory habitat or 
a development contribution to the local offsetting scheme will be required.  
 
3. Applicants will be expected to incorporate site drainage as part of a high quality gre en 
and blue water environment. Green infrastructure proposals should consider what 
contribution can be made to reducing surface water run -off and eventual discharge.

4.90.  Green and Blue Infrastructure is the term used to describe the network of multi -functional 
green and blue spaces and features in urban and rural areas that can deliver quality of 
life improvements and environmental benefits for communities. The green and blue 
infrastructure network in Blackburn with Darwen is a complex network of integrated 
spaces and features in urban and rural areas including parks, wildlife sites, rivers, 
woodland s, grassland, Leeds and Liverpool canal, allotments, sports fields, reservoirs,  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  79 
 moorland, churchyards and private gardens.  The Green and Blue Infrastructure networks 
are shown on the Policy Map.   
4.91.  Nature Recovery Networks are a discrete element of Green and  Blue Infrastructure, 
identified for biodiversity and the movement of natural assets (habitats and species), 
rather than human quality of life in the first instance.  These and some other features 
have their own specific policy approach, such as Environmen tal Opportunity Areas 
(Policy DM14), Biodiversity (Policy DM15) and Local Green Spaces (Policy DM2 1). 
4.92.  Networks of continuous green infrastructure have greater benefit to people and wildlife 
than isolated pockets of open space, particularly where they also connect with the open 
countryside.  Contiguous spaces enhance the multi -functionality of green infrastructure, 
facilitate active travel on foot or bicycle and assist the movement of wildlife.  Green 
infrastructure therefore needs to be integral to the desi gn of development, reflecting and 
enhancing an area’s character, and contributing to the development and extension of the 
network’s physical and functional connectivity.  
4.93.  All development will be expected to incorporate elements of green and/or blue 
infrastr ucture on site to enhance biodiversity, contribute to the health and wellbeing of all 
residents and to help mitigate the impacts of climate change. The Council recognises the 
importance of protecting and enhancing the existing areas of open space in Blackb urn 
with Darwen to ensure that as the population grows, there are good quality green spaces 
for everyone to enjoy. Development should seek to avoid negative impacts on green and 
blue infrastructure but where this is not possible, the Council will require c ompensation 
and mitigation measures to offset the loss.  
DM Policy 17 (DM17 ): Trees and Woodland  
4.94.  Trees perform a number of important functions. Individual trees, groups of trees and 
woodlands can have amenity value relating to the character and appearance o f a site 
and its setting. The urban tree population as a whole is also important in terms of 
ecosystem services such as reducing flooding, supporting biodiversity, reducing air 
pollution and carbon sequestration and storage. Developments should therefore 
incorporate the retention of established trees as well as the planting of new trees.   
DM Policy 17 (DM17 ): Trees and Woodland  
1. Proposals for new woodlands will be supported and should consider any relevant 
woodland and forestry strategies to guide and support their management and expansion.  
The Council will prepare a new Tree and Woodland Strategy to inform and guide tree 
planting and management in the Borough.  
 
2. All development should:  
 
a. Include appropriate landscaping plans, which incorporate suitable tree planting 
that integrates well with existing trees. This should be done in accordance with 
guidance contained in national guidance BS.5837:2012 and any subsequent 
document;  
b. Incorporate existing trees and hedgerows into the design and layout of the 
sche me; 
c. Both new and existing trees should be maintained by the owner of the site in 
accordance with guidance contained in BS.5837:2012 and any subsequent 
document;   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  80 
 DM Policy 17 (DM17 ): Trees and Woodland  
d. Promote an increase in tree cover where it would not threaten other vulnerable 
habitats; and  
e. Avoid encroachment into the root protection area of trees considered worthy of 
retention.  
 
3. If the removal of one or more trees is permitted as part of a developme nt, compensatory 
planting must take place at a ratio of at least 3:1 .54 Where this level of tree planting is not 
achievable on site, it may be appropriate to contribute to tree planting in the Borough 
through a planning contribution (including for appropriate long -term maintenance) in line 
with Policy CP12.  
 
4. Development that would result in the loss of, or damage to, woodlands or trees of 
significant amenity, screening, wildlife or historical value will only be permitted where:  
 
a. The development is required to meet a need that could not be met elsewhere; 
and 
b. Where the benefits of the development clearly outweigh the loss or damage.   
 
5. Impacts on the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient woodland 
and ancient or veteran trees) will be assessed in line with the NPPF.

4.95.  Woodland tree cover in Black burn with Darwen currently stands at around 12% 
(compared to 10% for England, 13% for the UK). The Council’s Climate Change and 
Natural Capital Study highlights the need to achieve an additional 395ha of planting by 
2030 (bringing total woodland to 14.88% of the Borough) to meet the Committee on 
Climate Change recommendations for minimum planting and land coverage.  
4.96.  Consistent with the NPPF’s advice on protecting valued landscapes, the presumption of 
this policy is that existing trees, hedgerows and other sh rub masses of value should be 
protected unless their loss is unavoidable. Where new development is proposed the 
preference will always be to incorporate trees, significant hedges, and shrub masses into 
the development.  
4.97.  Where the loss of any tree is unavoi dable as part of a development, replacement 
provision is required at a minimum ration of 3:1 and will be considered in terms of 
replacement value on a case by case basis. The Council acknowledges that each 
development site and each tree is different and de cisions on the replacement value will

 be determined as part of a fully detailed landscaping scheme, in consultation with the 
Council’s arboricultural officer (currently through Growth Lancashire). The Council’s Tree 
and Woodland Strategy will be used to in form this assessment . Further guidance, as 
appropriate, will be provided as part of a Natural Environment SPD, referenced in Policy 
CP6.  
4.98.  British Standard 5837:2012 ‘Trees in relation to design, demolition and construction’ 
recognises that trees need to be  properly protected during construction periods. This 
document provides guidance on planting and protecting trees during construction and 
the level of information required for full surveys. Where a proposed development retains 
existing trees on -site, a sat isfactory arboricultural impact assessment should be 
submitted in accordance with BS5837:2012 (or the equivalent applicable standard 
should this be superseded over the plan period).  This statement should analyse the 
potential impact on the retained trees.  Where proposed development would have an 
impact on trees, particularly where it would impinge on root protection areas of trees 
both within and outside the development site, a site specific arboricultural method 
statement should be submitted. The statemen t should demonstrate mitigation measures 
are in place to ensure that development works do not harm the existing tree.  
4.99.  Policy DM17 encourages the creation of new trees and woodland but this must not 
undermine any existing habitats or species, avoiding areas  of deep peat.  
DM Policy 18 (DM18 ): Public Open Space in New Developments  
4.100.  Policy DM18 sets out how we will aim to achieve the enhancement and extension of the 
area’s green infrastructure through provision of additional open spaces or improvements 
to the qu ality and/or accessibility of existing open spaces as part of new developments.  
For proposals involving the provision of new playing fields, indoor and outdoor sports 
facilities, Policy DM20 will apply .  
DM Policy 18 (DM18 ): Public Open Space in New Devel opments  
1. All new residential development will contribute to the provision of high quality open space 
for its residents, through provision of public open space on site and, where appropriate, 
through financial contributions towards improving the quality and /or accessibility of 
nearby existing spaces. The Council will prepare an SPD to provide further guidance on 
open space in new residential developments.  
 
2. The Council will work with developers to determine the most appropriate means of 
providing open space f or residents, having regard to the most up to date assessment of 
open space requirements or provision across Blackburn with Darwen.  It will adopt a 
design -led approach to planning for new open space within a development, having 
regard to the location and character of the development proposed.  
 
3. All development that includes an element of green space will be required to secure the 
appropriate maintenance of the space in the long term.

Appendix H:  
Open Space in New Residential Developments SPD (TBC)  
4.101.  Green open space in new development is of vital importance in enhancing local amenity, 
helping to promote better health and well -being and fostering community cohesion, as 
well as providing essential green infrastructure, establishing habitats and network s of 
ecological and wildlife value and contributing greatly to the character and appearance of 
the Borough.  
4.102.  The Council’s Open Space Audit provides information on the quantity, quality and 
accessibility of open spaces55 in the Borough. In particular, it:  
 Identifies those neighbourhood areas with a surplus or deficit of a particular open 
space typology compared to the Borough -wide average provision rates;  
 Identifies areas of the Borough that do not meet local accessibility thresholds; 
and 
 Assesses the quality of open spaces.  
4.103.  Proposals for new development should use the information contained within the audit to 
determine the most appropriate means of providing open space for residents.  Specific 
priorities identified in the audit that the L ocal Plan will aim to address include:  
 
 Increasing amenity greenspace provision in Blackburn North and Darwen 
Neighbourhood Areas;  
 Increasing natural and semi -natural greenspace provision in Blackburn North and 
East Neighbourhood Areas;  
 Improving the quali ty of existing open spaces, especially children’s play areas.  
4.104.  With respect to play areas the Council has used the thresholds set out below for 
provision on -site and these costs have been included in the supporting plan viability 
evidence and are reflected  in the anticipated contributions set out in Policy CP12 and 
relevant growth allocation policies.  
 Local Area Play (LAP) – 50-99 dwellings  
 Local Equipped Area for Play (LEAP) – 100-499 dwellings  
 Neighbourhood Equipped Area for Play (NEAP) – 500+ dwellings  
4.105.  An updated Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) on open space in new residential 
development will be prepared to support this policy.  
DM Policy 19 (DM19 ): Development of Open Spaces  
4.106.  The Council will resist development proposals that would result in the los s of designated 
open space unless at least one of the criteria in Policy DM19 below has been satisfied. 
When assessing if a proposal would comply with these criteria, the Council will take

 account of the most recent assessment of the Borough’s open space p rovision and 
needs set out in the latest Open Space Audit. Where development would result in the 
loss of playing fields, indoor or outdoor sports facilities, Policy DM20 will apply.   
DM Policy 19 (DM19 ): Development of Open Spaces  
1. Development affecting open space will not be permitted unless:  
 
i. An up to date needs assessment has been undertaken which clearly 
demonstrates that the open space is surplus to requirements and is not required 
to meet a current and future need; or  
ii. The open space that would be lo st would be replaced by new provision that is 
equivalent or better in terms of quantity and quality in a suitable location; or  
iii. The proposed development is for alternative sports and/or recreational provision, 
of which the benefits to the development of spo rt, physical activity and health and 
well-being would clearly outweigh the loss of the existing open space.  
 
2. In all cases, including where the proposal would involve development on a smaller open 
space (not identified on the Polic y Map), it should not have  a detrimental effect on the 
open space, the historic environment, environmental, landscape character and local 
distinctiveness or biodiversity value of the green infrastructure network as a whole.

DM Policy 20 (DM20): Playing Fields, Indoor and Outdoor Sports Facilities  
4.107.  The Borough’s playing fields and other areas for outdoor sports are an important 
recreational resource requiring protection and, where possible, enhancement by the 
provision of better facilities. Ma ny outdoor sports areas are of special significance for 
their contribution to other green space functions, such as being part of the biodiversity 
network and are also designated as part of the Green and Blue Infrastructure Network. 
School playing fields ar e considered important outdoor sports facilities and are protected 
as such under Policy DM 20.  
4.108.  Indoor sport and recreation facilities are also important to supporting the health and 
wellbeing of communities. Often these facilities are linked to outdoor facilities and help 
enhance their usefulness and capacity, for example changing rooms and pavilions. 
Indoor sport and leisure facilities are also protected under Policy DM20, unless they are 
shown to be surplus or are to be replaced.   
DM Policy 20 (DM20 ): Playing Fields, Indoor and Outdoor Sports Facilities  
In order to provide appropriate sports facilities for the communities of Blackburn with Darwen, 
the Council will:   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  84

1. Protect existing playing fields, indoor and outdoor sports facilities, unless:

i. They are proven to be surplus to need56; or  
ii. Improved alternative provision57 will be created in a location well related to the 
functional requirements of the relocated use and its existing and future users.  
 
And in all cases:  
 
iii. The proposal would not result in the loss of an area important for its amenity or 
contribution to the character of the area in general.  
 
2. Support provision of new playing fields, indoor and outdoor sports facilities where:  
 
i. They are readily accessible by public transport, walking and cycling; and  
ii. The proposed facilities are of a type and scale appropriate to the size of the 
settlement; and     
iii. They are listed in an action plan in any emerging or subsequently adopted Sports 
Strategy (currently BwD Playing P itch and Outdoor Sports Strategy and Built

3. Ensure that major residential developments contribute, through land assembly and/or 
financial contributions, to new or improved sports facilities where development will 
increase demand and/or there is a recognised shortage in the locality that would be 
exacerbated by the increase in demand arising from the development.

 identified (e.g. Cherry Tree, Darwen , and  Edgworth  cricket clubs , and  re-instatement of 
former  football pitches at  Everton Playing Fields) these are included in the Council’s 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan. New development may provide an opportunity to help fund 
this work in line with Policy CP12: Infrastructure and Delivery and/or appropriate Growth 
Site Allocation Pol icies set out in Section 5.  
4.111.  Replacement facilities should be better in terms of quantity and quality. In suitable 
circumstances, the alternative provision could be in the form of significant improvements 
to existing outdoor sports facilities, such as the p rovision of pavilions/changing facilities, 
improved drainage or an all -weather surface, 3G pitches and floodlights, which would 
enable it to be more intensively used as an all -weather facility. Where this increased 
quality would also lead to significantly increased capacity beyond that which already 
existed, then this is likely to be considered an acceptable replacement.  
DM Policy 21 (DM21): Local Green Space  
4.112.  A Local Green Space designation is a way to provide additional protection to those sites 
that demonstrate particular importance to local communities, in line with the criteria set 
by national planning policy58. Local Green Spaces also form a part of the wider Green 
and Blue Infrastructure network in the Borough (see Policy DM16).  
4.113.  Policy DM21 below i dentifies the sites designated as Local Green Spaces within 
Blackburn with Darwen and sets out the Council’s approach to managing development 
on these sites.   
DM Policy 21 (DM21 ): Local Green Space  
1. Local Green Spaces are designated on the Polic y Map and have been determined as 
demonstrably special to the local communities they serve. Development proposals which 
result in the loss of part or all of a Local Green Space or would have a negative impact 
on the features that make it locally significant  will not be permitted unless very special 
circumstances can be demonstrated59.

DM Polic y 22 (DM22): The Borough’s Landscapes  
4.117.  The Borough’s landscape setting is one of its key assets, for its environmental value and 
for its economic role in making the Borough an attractive place to invest. Development 
and public realm works will be designed to maximise views of landscapes, recreation 
and tourism based on the landscape will be encouraged where this can be achieved 
without environmental damage.  
4.118.  Policy DM22 will ensure key features of the Borou gh’s landscapes are protected and that 
new development takes advantage of the Borough’s landscape setting.   
DM Policy 22 (DM22 ): The Borough’s Landscapes  
1. New development will be required to take advantage of its landscape setting by 
maximising the availab ility of and existing local and distant views for users of buildings 
and public spaces, and by creating and / or improving networks of routes between urban 
and rural areas.  
 
2. The key features of landscapes throughout the Borough will be protected in accorda nce 
with the most up to date Landscape Character Assessment. Development likely to affect 
landscapes or their key features will only be permitted where there is no unacceptable 
adverse impact (either in isolation or cumulatively) on them. The level of prot ection 
afforded will depend on the quality, importance and uniqueness of the landscape in 
question.  
 
3. The active use of the Borough’s landscapes through leisure and tourism will be promoted 
where this is compatible with objectives relating to their protecti on.

4.119.  Many parts of the Borough’s landscapes are sensitive to change, and easily damaged 
through the loss of key features61. At the same time we recognise that some areas are 
less sensitive, and that development and change in these areas can be justified without 
destroying a valuable resource. Therefore, the landscape on the edge of towns will be 
protected, and in particular t he key features that make this landscape valuable and

 unique; but development will be permitted in individual situations where the landscape is 
of relatively low value and the impact is outweighed by the benefits of a development.  
4.120.  Proposals should have re gard to the Lancashire Landscape Character Assessment and 
Landscape Strategy (2000) which are both still relevant. The Council has adopted ‘The 
Conversion of Buildings in the Countryside Supplementary Planning Guidance’, which 
provides additional guidance on proposals potentially affecting the Borough’s 
landscapes.  
DM Policy 23 (DM23 ): Equestrian Development  
4.121.  Horse riding is a popular activity in parts of Blackburn with Darwen, and can be an 
important means of diversifying the rural economy. Policy DM23 is a pplicable to any 
development proposed in the Borough for private or commercial stables/equestrian 
recreational facilit ies that  are located outside the urban area.   
DM Policy 23 (DM23 ): Equestrian Development  
1. Developments outside the urban area for private  or commercial stables/equestrian 
recreational facilities will be permitted where the Council is satisfied that there is suitable 
access to existing vehicular and field accesses, tracks and bridleways and that the 
development would not have an adverse impa ct on the character, visual and residential 
amenity or biodiversity value of the area . 
 
Key strategic objective links  SO6: Natural Environment

Key supporting docs/evidence   
4.122.  Where there is an intensive equestrian use, or where buildings and other infrastructure 
are provided to cater directly for horse riders, there can be an impact on the character of 
the countryside.  The following factors are examples of what will be taken i nto account in 
determining whether planning applications in such locations are likely to have adverse 
impacts or not:  
• The appearance of buildings;  
• Change to the appearance or physical condition of land as a result of erosion;  
• The visual impact of ju mps and other equipment;  
• The introduction of areas of hard standing; and/or  
• The vegetation and wildlife value of the land to be used.  
4.123.  In addition, there is a need to ensure that riders can use their horses safely, with 
adequate access to rights of way and no need to travel on busy road routes.  
DM Policy 24 (DM 24): Outdoor Advertisements  
4.124.  Outdoor advertisements can take many forms. Among the most common are fascia and 
projecting signs, pole signs, menu boards and advance signs alongside roads. Signs 
and a dvertisements are important to the commercial life of an area and if they are well 
designed, they can contribute to its character or appearance.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  88 
 4.125.  The Council can only consider applications for advertisement consent with regard to their 
effect on amenity or public safety, including the cumulative impact on these. “Amenity” 
means the effect of an advertisement upon the visual amenity of the neighbourhood. 
“Public safety” refers to the safety of people using any form of transport, including 
pedestrians, likely to be affected by an advertisement.   
DM Policy 24 (DM24): Outdoor Advertisements  
1. Proposals for advertisement consent will be permitted providing the following specific 
amenity and public safety considerations are satisfied:  
 
Specific Amenity Considerations:  
 
i. The number, size and siting of signs in the area or on the building will not create 
clutter or excessive advertising;  
 
Specific Public Safety Considerations:  
 
ii. The proposal does not obscure visibility or distract the atten tion of users of the 
highway;  
iii. The colours of the advertisement or its illumination would not obscure or reduce 
the clarity of any functional or traffic sign; and  
iv. Pedestrian movement is not hindered

DM Policy 25 (DM25 ): Telecommunications  
4.126.  Fast, reliable and universally available digital communication is an essential factor in 
supporting and growing our economy and enabling people to live their lives the way they 
wish to.   
4.127.  Telecommunications providers are making very significant investment in new 
infrastructure to facilitate this.  Much of the new infrastructure required is either installed 
below the ground under the providers’ powers as statutory undertakers, or as permitted 
development.  However, certain types of telecommunications equipme nt do require 
consent from the Council in some instances.   
4.128.  Policy DM25 sets out the criteria that the Council will apply in assessing applications of 
this type. Service providers should also refer to the Government’s Street Works Toolkit  
that offers advice and best practice for engaging in street works.   
DM Policy 25 (DM25): Telecommunications  
1. Applications for the siting of new telecommunications equipment will be permitted 
provided that:  
  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  89 
 DM Policy 25 (DM25): Telecommunications  
i. It has been demonstrated that co -siting the equipment with existing equipment, or 
in the case of antennae, their siting on an existing building, mast or stru cture, is 
not a viable option;  
ii. It is not located in nor likely to have an unacceptable harmful impact on a Site of 
Special Scientific Interest, Biological Heritage Site, Local Nature Reserve, other 
sensitive landscape setting, or on the historic environmen t including heritage 
assets and their setting, unless it can be demonstrated that no technically 
acceptable alternative site is available and the need for the development 
(including where necessary, the public benefits) outweighs the level of harm 
caused;  
iii. A highway assessment has been undertaken to ensure the siting of equipment is 
not detrimental to highway safety; and  
iv. The impact of the development on the landscape or townscape is minimised, 
within the constraints of operating requirements, through siting,  design, materials 
and colour.

DM Policy 26 (DM26 ): Heritage Assets  
4.129.  The Council has a duty to conserve and enhance the character and appearance of the 
Borough’s heritage assets when carrying out its statutory functions through the planning 
system, in accordance with their significance. Not all of  the heritage assets in Blackburn 
with Darwen are necessarily designated. It is therefore also important to recognise the 
value of our undesignated historic environment in planning for the future. Many buildings 
are of significance, particularly to the env ironment, even though they may not be 
protected by law.  
4.130.  In accordance with the NPPF, Policy DM26 sets out how we will manage change 
affecting the historic environment in a way that focuses on and is proportionate to the 
significance of the asset.   
DM Policy 26 (DM26 ): Heritage Assets  
Development Affecting Heritage Assets  
 
1. The Council will support proposals which conserve or, where appropriate, enhance the 
historic environment of Blackburn with Darwen.  
 
2. Development that affects a designated heritage asset (or an archaeological site of 
national importance), including their setting, should sustain or enhance elements which 
contribute to the significance of the asset.  Harm to such elements will only be perm itted 
where there is a clear justification and this is outweighed by the public benefits of the 
proposal.  Substantial harm or total loss to the significance of the designated heritage

asset (or an archaeological site of national importance) will only be p ermitted in 
exceptional circumstances.  
 
3. Development that affects an undesignated heritage asset that has been identified by the 
Council as having local significance will only be permitted where it does not harm the 
significance of the asset and where the b enefits are considered sufficient to outweigh the 
harm to the asset or the character of the local area.   
 
4. Development that affects an archaeological site of less than national importance will only 
be permitted where its significance is sustained or enhanc ed in line with the importance 
of the remains.  Preference will be for in situ preservation, unless the public benefits of 
the proposal can be demonstrated.  Where this is not justified, the proposal will be 
required to carry out a programme of excavation and recording before or during 
development.  
 
5. Development within or affecting the setting of a conservation area will only be permitted 
where it conserves and enhances its special character and appearance, in particular 
those elements that have been identif ied as making a positive contribution to its 
significance in any conservation area appraisal.  
 
6. Proposals affecting all heritage assets (including conservation areas) will be expected to 
be accompanied by detailed information which allows the full impact of  the development 
proposal on the heritage asset to be properly assessed.  This should include the 
significance of the heritage asset, in isolation and as part of a group or as an area as 
appropriate; including its contribution to the character or appearanc e of the area and its 
setting.   
 
7. The level of information required will be proportionate to the assets significance and to 
the scale of the impact of the proposal.  This will include (but are not limited to):  
 
i. The analysis of the significance of the asset  including its history and evolution.  
ii. The retention and restoration of historic features and details (both external and 
internal, above and below ground) that contribute to the asset’s significance;  
iii. The detailed design of any work to be carried out, inclu ding scale and proportions, 
materials and construction details;  
iv. The compatibility of the proposed use with the protection of the asset’s 
significance.  
v. The condition of the asset and the cost of any repairs and enhancement works 
that need to be undertaken;  
vi. The wider setting and significance of the asset/area including open spaces, 
landscape, views, historic surfaces, materials and other features that contribute to 
the significance of the heritage asset.  
vii. Identification of positive elements of its character an d appearance.  
 
8. Where permission is granted for a development that would result in total or partial loss of 
a heritage asset, approval will be conditional upon the asset being fully recorded, prior to 
the commencement of any work and the report deposited wi thin the Local Historic 
Environment Record.  Consent will not be granted for demolition until an acceptable 
redevelopment scheme has been approved and there is evidence that a contract has 
been let for the full implementation of the scheme.

Heritage assets local list  
4.131.  National heritage lists are administered by Historic England. Assets on the lists are of 
clear national significance and include listed buildings, scheduled monuments and 
registered parks and gardens. Conservation areas are also designated heritage assets.  
Heritage assets are an irreplaceable resource, so it is vital that they are conserved in a 
manner appropriate to their significance. Heritage significance can be represented in an 
asset’s form, scale, materials and architectural detail and, where relevant , the historic 
relationships between heritage assets. Development that affects the setting of a heritage 
asset should respond positively to the assets’ significance, local context and character to 
protect the contribution that the setting makes to the asse t’s significance. In particular, 
consideration will need to be given to impacts from development that is not sympathetic 
in terms of scale, materials, details and form.  
4.132.  Where development is proposed within the Borough which affects a designated heritage 
asset, a heritage assessment will be required that is appropriate to the level of 
significance of the asset. The assessment needs to explain its significance and the 
impacts of the proposals. Substantial harm or loss of significance should be wholly 
excepti onal and could only be justified if it is necessary to achieve substantial public 
benefits that outweigh the harm or loss, taking into account the significance and benefits 
of conserving the asset. Conservation area appraisals (where they exist) are the st arting 
point for understanding significance and significant features and assets of conservation 
areas.  
4.133.  Non-designated local heritage assets can also make a place special and they should be 
given consideration at the design stage to ensure that any adverse impacts are either 
avoided or mitigated and that local character is enhanced or conserved. A local list of 
heritage assets  is compiled and maintained by the Council. T he Local List identifies the 
assets of local significance within the Borough.  
DM Policy 27 (DM27): Design in New Developments  
4.134.  Achieving high quality design is one of the main elements of our vision for the Borough. 
This aim is supported by the NPPF, which makes clear a high standard of design is a 
key part of sustainable development. Policy DM27 sets out the design requirements 
expected of all new developments in the Borough.   
DM Policy 27 (DM27 ): Design in New Developments  
1. All development shall achieve a high quality, sustainable design consistent with the 
following characteristics62:

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  92 
 DM Policy 27 (DM27 ): Design in New Developments  
 
i. Context: enhances the surroundings  
ii. Identity: attractive and distinctive  
iii. Built form : a coherent pattern of development  
iv. Movement : accessible and easy to move around  
v. Nature : enh anced and optimised, integrating with the green and blue 
infrastructure and nature recovery networks  
vi. Public spaces : safe, social and inclusive  
vii. Uses : mixed and integrated  
viii. Homes and buildings : functional, healthy and sustainable  
ix. Resources : efficient and resi lient 
x. Lifespan : made to last, with an emphasis on quality and simplicity  
 
2. All design and access statements will be required to clearly explain how the proposed 
development delivers each of these characteristics and the other design -related policies 
of this  plan63.

National Design Guide (MHCLG, January 2021)  
4.135.  High quality design is not just about how development looks; it is also about how it 
responds to the site and the environment around it. High quality design creates 
environments where people want to live, work a nd visit and which are safe, long lasting 
and adaptable to changing needs. High quality design can also respond effectively to a 
wide range of issues such as tackling climate change, improving local biodiversity, 
enhancing a sense of place, promoting inclu sivity and providing healthier and more 
active places. Important design considerations therefore feature in other policies in this 
plan, particularly in relation to heritage, biodiversity, flood risk and sustainable transport. 
Being able to respond appropr iately to all of these considerations and understanding 
how they interact is a key part of achieving high quality design.  
4.136.  While the principles of good design are well -established, there are many ways of 
describing how it can be achieved. For example, the N PPF sets out six characteristics of 
well-designed places, the National Design Guide sets out ten characteristics, and there 
is useful guidance produced by specialist organisations in relation to specific design 
issues. These include:  
 Sport England’s Active  Design Guidance and The Ten Principles of Active Design;  
 Designing Out Crime published by the Design Council;  
 Manual for Streets;  
 Building with Nature; and

principles set out in the National Design Guide, applicants will also be expected to 
demonstrate how their proposals meet the requirements and principles in other relevant 
policies of this plan and in additional d esign -related guides, including those identified 
above.  
DM Policy 28 (DM28 ): Development Affecting Watercourses, Bodies, and 
Catchment Land  
4.138.  The protection and improvement of our watercourses and bodies and the land around 
them (including water catchment land) is vital if they are to continue to support wellbeing 
and sustainable development across the Borough. As well as significant wellbeing 
benefits, our watercourses, bodies and catchment land provide a critical function in 
terms of water drainage and therefore flood management.  
4.139.  Policy DM28 relates to any development proposed adjacent to a watercourse or body. It 
seeks to ensure development e ngages with the water, promoting access and activity as 
well as ensuring development is appropriately located and controlled. Opportunities to 
generate power from the adjacent watercourse to offset carbon should be explored in 
such development proposals.   
DM Policy 28 (DM28 ): Development Affecting Watercourses, Bodies, and Catchment 
Land 
1. Development will not be permitted within the functional floodplain unless development is 
water compatible64. 
 
2. Development alongside watercourses or bodies should, wherever possible, make active 
use of the water through the layout and orientation of development and the integration of 
the water and its environs into the development’s public space.  Such developments 
should provide positive engagement/frontages to the waterway wherever possible  
 
3. Development alongside watercourses or bodies should enhance the waterside 
environment and boost the green infrastructure function of the watercourse or body.   
 
4. Development close to watercourses or bodies should not sever recreational routes, 
prejudice recreational uses, reduce water quality, diminish the ecological value of the 
water body or environs, increase flood risk or interfere with culverts or drainage unless 
required to enable the development and appropriate mitigation measures  are provided as 
part of the development proposals;  
 
5. Development alongside watercourses or bodies will only be permitted if it can be 
demonstrated that it would not adversely impact on the structural integrity of the 
waterway or its related infrastructure and assets.  
 
6. Development proposals on land use d for public water supply catchment purposes (as 
shown on the Polic y Map) will be required to consult with the relevant water undertaker. 
The first preference will be for proposals to be located away from land used for public 
water supply purposes. Where proposals are proposed on catchment land use for public

DM Policy 29 (DM29 ): Transport and Accessibility  
4.140.  The Local Plan sets out a clear expectation that new development should be accessible 
by a choice of means of transport  and not be excessively reliant on car journeys, as set 
out in Policy CP10. As well as issues of overall accessibility, the effect of development 
on transport considerations also needs to be managed at a local level. The overriding 
aim is to ensure that de velopment is capable of being accessed and serviced safely.  
4.141.  Policy DM29 sets out the approach the Council will adopt in managing the transport 
implications of development.   
DM Policy 29 (DM29 ): Transport and Accessibility  
1. Development will be permitted provided it has been demonstrated that:  
 
i. Road safety and the safe, efficient and convenient movement of all highway users 
(including bus passengers, refuse collection vehicles, the emergency services, 
cyclists and pedestrians) is not prejudiced;  
ii. Appropria te provision is made for vehicle access and off -street servicing;  
iii. Appropriate provision should be made for parking (vehicle, powered two wheelers 
(PTWs) and cycle facilities) and charging for plug -in and other ultra -low emissions 
vehicles in accordance wit h the Council’s latest standards to assist with the 
decarbonisation of transport over the plan period.  
iv. Access by public transport is catered for either by providing for bus access into 
the site where appropriate, or by ensuring that safe and convenient acc ess exists 
to the nearest public facility;  
v. Measures are included to encourage access on foot and by bicycle;  
vi. Public rights of way and accesses should be protected and enhanced to maintain 
and improve connectivity for active travel; and  
vii. The needs of disable d people are fully provided for, including those reliant on 
community transport services.

 4.3 Economy  
DM Policy 30 (DM30 ): Primary Employment Areas  
4.143.  A range of quality and typ es of employment areas existing in the Borough. Those that 
are considered to be of the highest quality due to their scale, location and/or setting are 
identified as Primary Employment Areas on the Polic y Map.  
4.144.  Policy DM30 sets out a framework for managing these sites to ensure that they retain 
their strategic role in the Borough and help to support the objectives of the Local Plan.   
DM Policy 30 (DM30 ): Primary Employment Areas  
1. Primary Employment areas are the highest quality areas in the Borough66 and will  be 
retained for employment uses (B2/B8/E(g) and sui generis uses of a similar nature and 
character to the area. Proposals to redevelop land for other uses will be strongly resisted, 
with those in the Borough’s flagship employment locations only permitted in exceptional 
circumstances.  
 
2. Within the Primary Employment Areas, planning permission will also be granted for an 
appropriate range of supporting uses, including gyms, cafes / canteens, small scale 
convenience shopping, crèches, and financial services, p rovided that the scale of such 
uses, and their location and arrangement within the employment area, means that they 
will primarily serve those employed in that area.  
 
3. Proposals for forms of development in Primary Employment Areas that are not directly 
supp orted by 1 or 2 above will only be granted planning permission where it is clearly 
demonstrated that the specific use is required to secure the development of the wider 
site.

Key supporting docs/evidence  Employment Land Review (2019)  
4.145.  Primary employment areas are considered to be those that can accommodate the 
highest quality employment uses, and which, in most cases, are also the most 
straightforward to dev elop.  These sites are a limited resource, and so it is essential that 
we manage the mix of uses that is located on them to ensure that they provide the 
maximum benefit to the local economy and remain available to accommodate a wide 
range of investment.  A t the same time it is essential that these business areas remain 
sustainable, and provide an environment which makes them appealing for people to 
work in and hence for operators to locate in.   
4.146.  There are a total of thirteen Primary Employment Areas identif ied in the Local Plan on 
the Polic y Map, the largest of which include:  
 Shadsworth Business Park, Blackburn (66ha)  
 Walker Park, Blackamoor Road, Blackburn (49ha)

DM Policy 31 (DM31): Secondary Employment Areas  
4.147.  Employment sites considered to be of a lower grade than Prim ary Employment Areas 
but still form a particularly important role in the local economy are identified as 
Secondary Employment Areas on the Polic y Map.  
4.148.  Policy DM31 sets out a policy framework that enables greater flexibility in the future 
development of Se condary Employment Areas while maintaining their overall emphasis 
on commercial and employment generating uses.   
DM Policy 31 (DM31 ): Secondary Employment Areas  
1. Secondary Employment Areas play an important role in supporting jobs and economic 
growth. Proposals to redevelop land for other uses in these areas67 will be resisted but 
considered more flexibly than in Primary Employment Areas. They will be expected to 
demonstrate that:  
 
i. The site/premises are no longer suitable or reasonably capable of being 
redeveloped for employment purposes;  
ii. The site/premises has been actively marketed for employment purposes for a 
reasonable period of time (minimum of 12 months) at a reasonable market rate 
(i.e. rent or capital value) as supported through a documented forma l marketing 
strategy and campaign; or  
iii. There will be a significant community benefit which outweighs the impact of losing 
the employment site/premises  
 
2. Proposals that retain some employment opportunities will be encouraged over those that 
provide no employm ent such as residential use.

4.149.  Blackburn with Darwen has a wide range of secondary employment areas.  Typically 
consisting of traditional employment areas, with a mix of original and more recent 
building plots, these are of considerable importance to our local economy. They employ 
large  numbers of people and allow businesses to start and grow with relatively low 
accommodation costs.  They are suitable for any employment generating use subject to 
other relevant policy and amenity considerations set out in the Local Plan.

 4.150.  Secondary Emplo yment Areas are able to accommodate a wider range of uses than 
traditional employment use classes - for example those whose nature means they may 
benefit from locating in a mainly commercial area. This may include trade counters; vets 
practices; builders /  plumbers’ merchants; tyre / exhaust centres and some 
leisure/training uses such as training centres, nurseries/children’s play facilities and 
activity centres that do generate employment opportunities.  
4.151.  There are seventeen Secondary Employment Areas identi fied in the Local Plan on the 
Polic y Maps. The largest of these include:  
 Copy Nook/Higher Eanam/Gorse Street, Blackburn (46ha)  
 Hollins Grove, Darwen (42ha)  
 Goose House Road and land east of the railway, Darwen (16ha)  
 Bank Top/George Street West/Wensley Ro ad, Blackburn (13ha)  
 Cross Street/Junction Street, Darwen (10ha)  
DM Policy 32 (DM32): Protection and Re -use of Existing Employment Sites  
4.152.  Policy DM32 applies to any employment sites that are not located within an existing 
‘Primary’ or ‘Secondary’ employment  area (covered by Policy DM30 and DM31).   
DM Policy 32 (DM32 ): Protection and Re -use of Existing Employment Sites  
1. The re -development of existing employment sites away from employment uses that do 
not sit within identified Employment Areas will be supported in the following 
circumstances:  
i. The present (or previous, if vacant or derelict) use causes significant harm to the 
character or amenities of the surrounding area;  
ii. It is demonstrated that no other appropriate viable alternative employment use 
could be attracted to the site; or  
iii. Mixed -use redevelopment would provide important community and/or 
regeneration benefits with no significant loss of jobs, potential jobs, and the 
proposed mix of uses accords with other planning policies.  
 
2. Where employment pr emises not meeting any of the criteria set out in Paragraph 1 fall 
vacant, the Council will work with partners to secure their re -use or the redevelopment of 
the site for a new employment use. In cases where a site remains suitable for 
employment developme nt but it is demonstrated that this is not economically viable, the 
Council may give favourable consideration to an element of higher -value “enabling” 
development, having regard to the balance of uses that would result on the site and in 
the wider area.

Key policy links  CP11: The Economy and Skills  
Key supporting docs/evidence  Employment Land Review (2019)  
4.153.  The Council’s overall spatial strategy for employment is to provide a broad portfolio of 
sites for em ployment uses in sustainable locations. Policies DM30 and DM31 provide a 
framework for the most significant employment areas and grants them extra policy 
protection. However there remains a large number of other sites around the Borough, 
integrated into th e existing urban area, that make up an important component of supply. 
Policy DM32 seeks to retain these sites as they remain a key source of land/premises for  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  99 
 smaller scale businesses and will help reduce pressure on land being developed 
elsewhere, outside  of the existing urban area.  
4.154.  In some cases the presence of industrial uses within a mainly residential area can create 
problems with amenity for residents, and can be a factor for contributing to low demand 
for housing in some instances. Where isolated ind ustrial uses within older residential 
areas cause nuisance and loss of amenity to residents through noise, activity from large 
vehicles and so on, alternative uses, including employment generating mixed -use 
schemes and residential development, may be consi dered appropriate on these sites if 
they become vacant.  
4.155.  In certain specific cases it is recognised that a site may no longer be suitable for the 
demands of the market for employment development, and therefore stands little prospect 
of being brought into a  beneficial employment use in a reasonable timescale. Where it is 
demonstrated that this is the case, the policy provides flexibility for the site to be 
redeveloped for a different use.  
DM Policy 33 (DM33): Town Centres  
4.156.  Blackburn and Darwen town centres ar e at the heart of our communities. They provide 
an important focus for providing jobs and services in our towns and fostering civic pride. 
They also play a major role in defining the way that the wider towns are perceived from 
outside of the Borough. This makes them central to the economic prospects of our area.  
4.157.  Future public and private investment will be encouraged in both of the Borough’s town 
centres in line with Policy DM33.   
DM Policy 33 (DM33 ): Town Centres  
1. Within the Town Centres as defined on the  adopted Polic y Map, planning permission will 
be granted for development which contributes to one or more of the following objectives:  
 
i. Strengthening and focusing the shopping offer;  
ii. Expanding the role of the town centres to support vitality and viability;  
iii. Protecting and enhancing the leisure offer and developing an evening economy;  
iv. Establishing a vibrant town centre residential population (except where it would 
cause unacceptable harm to the operations of existing town centre uses68). 
 
2. Development proposals  within the town centres should (where applicable) demonstrate 
how the proposal contributes to enhancing the following key attributes of the centre:  
 
i. The overall attraction of the centre to local communities;  
ii. The accessibility from/to the centre and within  it; and  
iii. The amenity of the local environment within the town centre.  
 
3. Proposals that may include retail use (Class E(a)) will be directed to the Primary 
Shopping Area in the first instance through the application of the sequential test. In 
Darwen Town Cen tre, the town centre boundary will be interpreted as the Primary 
Shopping Area.

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  100 
 DM Policy 33 (DM33 ): Town Centres  
4. The Council will support and encourage a mix of complementary uses in the town 
centres.  
 
5. Planning permission fo r specific types of development69 may be restricted to ensure that 
no unacceptable impacts on sensitive land uses occur, or over proliferation of uses 
occur. Sensitive uses include but are not limited to residential uses, educational uses or 
businesses which operate in a quiet setting. Th e Council will maintain appropriate 
Supplementary Planning Documents to support these aims.

4.158.  The NPPF is clear that planning policies and decisions should support the role that town 
centres play at the heart of local communities. Local Plan policies should take a positive 
approach to their growth, management and adaptation. In combination the crit eria set 
out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Policy DM33 will help to achieve this key aim. Where 
proposals for main town centre uses are put forward then Policy DM35 will also play a 
key role in the decision making process.  
4.159.  The Councils ambitions around regener ation and renewal of both Blackburn and Darwen 
town centres set out in this Local Plan will be progressed with the key attributes around 
the attractiveness of the centre, the accessibility, and the amenity of the local 
environment foremost in mind. Amenity  considerations include issues around reducing 
congestion, improving air quality and provision of enhanced public/shared space.   
DM Policy 34 (DM34): District and Local Centres  
4.160.  There will be a general presumption in favour of development within District C entres 
(Tier 3). As set out in Policy CP11, one of the roles of District Centres is to facilitate more 
sustainable living by providing localised facilities and services. The presumption 
therefore is that smaller scale facilities are brought forward within the District Centres, in 
line with their position on the retail hierarchy below the defined Town Centres. Larger 
scale proposals that seem out of proportion with the role of a District Centre may be 
required to demonstrate their predicted impacts on other centres within the hierarchy, 
and on traffic and general amenity. Local Centres (Tier 4) are also designated in the 
Local Plan to help support development of 20 -minute neighbourhoods in the Borough.  
4.161.  Policy DM34 sets out a policy framework for appropriate developments in these lower 
tiers of the centre hierarchy.

 DM Policy 34 (DM34 ): District and Local Centres  
1. The Borough’s District Centres are defined on the Polic y Map and include:  
 
 In Blackburn : Audley Range, Bastwell, Bolton Road, Ewood, Johnstone Street, Little 
Harwood, Mill Hill, Roe Lee, Whalley Banks, Whalley Range  
 In Darwen : Duckworth Street  
 
2. Within the defined District Centres planning permission will be granted for small -scale 
proposals for commercial or other main town centre uses (including  residential). For the 
purposes of applying the sequential test for proposals that may include retail use (Class 
E(a)) the District Centre boundary will be interpreted as the Primary Shopping Area.  
 
3. The location of the Borough’s Local Centres are identifie d on the Polic y Map and include:  
 
 In Blackburn : Accrington Road (St Jude’s); Audley Range; Bastwell; Blackburn 
Cemetery; Bolton Road (Ewood Bridge); Brookhouse; Brownhill; Cherry Tree North; 
Cherry Tree South; Copy Nook; Earcroft; Feniscowles; Fishmoor Drive; Four Lane

 In Darwen : Blackburn Road (Birch Hall); Bolton Road (Sough); Bolton Road 
(Whitehall); Suddell Road;  
 In the rural  areas : Edgworth, Hoddlesdon  
 
4. Local Centres will provide a small range of shops and other local services which help 
meet the day to day needs of r esidents. Local shopping opportunities and facilities within 
Local Centres will be supported and safeguarded where possible. Due to their small -
scale nature Local Centres do not have defined boundaries. Planning permission will be 
supported for small -scale  proposals for commercial or other main town centre uses that 
can demonstrate it will support and enhance existing provision of the Local Centre.  
 
5. New Local Centres will be supported as part of any significant new developments where 
they can be demonstrate d to support and enhance the existing network of Local Centres 
and support the concept of 20 -minute neighbourhoods.

Local Centres Methodology (2021)  
4.162.  The health of the Borough’s District Centres have been reviewed as part of the Retail 
and Leisure Study in support of the Local Plan. Boun dary alterations and recommended 
re-classification of some former District Centres (to Local Centres) have been adopted to 
help support the continued vitality and viability of these important areas to the local 
communities that they serve based on this upd ated evidence review. Some of these 
centres have faced particular challenges in adapting to changing retail patterns over 
recent years. National changes to the Use Class Order and permitted development 
regime have also been introduced in an attempt to assi st the future development of such 
areas.   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  102 
 4.163.  Whilst the District Centres principally provide for local needs shopping, some have roles 
that are more specific because of their location. Uses can be diverse and include places 
of worship, community centres and ha lls, health facilities such as doctor’s and dental 
surgeries and other service uses ranging from hairdressers and beauty salons to funeral 
parlours.   
4.164.  Local Centres are defined on the Polic y Map in line with the Local Centres Methodology 
document. A total of 34 Local Centres are defined. Local Centres are identified where 
clusters of at least six relevant uses (community, retail or service uses) were identified in 
close proximity to one another at the point of assessment.  The methodology employed 
to identi fy Local Centres should be used in case making and consideration for the 
suitability of any proposed new facilities in the absence of Local Centre boundaries 
being defined.  
4.165.  The Retail and Leisure Study identified the need to consider three new Local Centre s 
within the local centre hierarchy. The Haslingden Road Local Centre is identified to 
support this approach around the Blackburn Hospital site locality. The requirements 
identified at northeast Blackburn (Brownhill) and southwest Blackburn as part of 
significant new developments would be supported through Policy DM34.  
DM Policy 35 (DM35): Assessing Applications for Main Town Centre Uses  
4.166.  It is essential that our two town centres remain the focus for both convenience and 
comparison retail growth and for the development of other main town centre uses over 
the plan period.  New out -of-centre developments, extensions to existing ones, and larg e 
developments that are in existing centres but out of scale with them, all have the 
potential to compete with town centres and draw trade and development pressure away 
from them.  This prevents the creation of a “critical mass” of demand and activity in t he 
town centres, impacting on the viability of existing and future investment within them.  
4.167.  Policy DM35 sets the framework for how the issues of appropriate scale of proposals will 
be considered in this context, and how the sequential test and impact test will be applied 
to proposals for new developments in the Borough.   
DM Policy 35 (DM35 ): Assessing Applications for Main Town Centre Uses  
Scale 
 
1. Retail development will be permitted provided that the development, in terms of the 
overall magnitude of additional floorspace proposed and the size of individual units within 
it, is appropriate to the position of the centre concerned within the hierarchy of centres in 
Blackburn with Darwen. In making its assessment on this issue the Council will refer to all 
available evidence including but not limited to the indicative maxima for these factors set 
out in the table  below.  
 
Centre Tier  Indicative maximum un it size 
1 – Major Town Centre  No limit  
2 – Town Centre  4,000sqm as food store, otherwise 1,000sqm  
3 – District Centre  500sqm  
4 – Local Centre  280sqm  
 
The Sequential Test  
  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  103 
 DM Policy 35 (DM35 ): Assessing Applications for Main Town Centre Uses  
2. Planning permission for retail development outside the Primary Shopping Areas of  
Blackburn and Darwen town centres or the District Centres (as identified on the Polic y 
Map), or for other main town centre uses outside Blackburn and Darwen town centres or 
the District Centres, will only be granted if the proposal complies with the remai nder of 
this policy, and one or both of the following criteria are met:  
 
i. The development is specifically supported by another policy in the Local Plan; or  
ii. It is demonstrated that no sequentially preferable site is available or likely to be 
available within  a reasonable timescale to accommodate the development; and 
that in discounting any sequentially preferable site, the developer / operator has 
applied a sufficiently flexible approach to their requirement in respect of scale, 
format and car parking provisi on. 
 
3. Where an edge - or out -of-centre development is justified under this policy, preference will 
be given to locations that are well connected to an existing town centre , or are location in 
existing out -of-centre retail parks,  and appropriate measures will  be required to maximise 
connectivity between the development and the centre.  
 
Assessing Impact  
 
4. Retail developments which are not specifically supported by other policies, and are not in 
a town or district centre as defined on the Polic y Map, and which will create additional 
floorspace at or above the levels set out in the table  below, will be required to be 
accompanied by a retail  impact assessment.  
 
Location of development  Floorspace 
threshold  Centres required to be 
assessed for potenti al impact  
Within 500m of any district 
centre boundary or a local centre  250sqm  All district centres or local centres 
within 500m  
Darwen urban area (south of the 
M65)  500sqm  Darwen town centre plus all 
district centres / local centres 
within 500m  
Blackburn urban area (north of 
the M65)  1,000sqm  Blackburn town centre plus all 
district / local centres within 500m  
Any location outside of the 
defined urban area  100sqm  To be determined on a case by 
case basis  
Note: Development close to the boundary between Blackburn and Darwen meeting the floorspace 
thresholds may require impact assessments on both town centres.  
 
5. Where an impact assessment is required, proposals will only be granted planning 
permission where it is demonstrated that there will be no unacceptable impact on the 
vitality and viability of existing centres.  In making its assessment on this issue the 
Council will take account of the following main issues along with any that are specific to 
the development in question:  
 
i. The impact of the pr oposal on existing, committed and planned public and private 
investment, in a centre or centres within the catchment of the proposal;  
ii. The impact of the proposal on town centre vitality and viability, including local 
consumer choice and trade in the town ce ntre and the wider area, up to five 
years from the time the application is made.  For major schemes where the 
impact will not be realised in five years, the impact should also be assessed up to 
10 years from the time the application is made;   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  104 
 DM Policy 35 (DM35 ): Assessing Applications for Main Town Centre Uses  
iii. The appropria teness of the proposal to the general character of the area and its 
contribution to an active ground floor street frontage; and  
iv. The ability of the impact to be mitigated through measures secured through 
planning conditions or a planning agreement.  
 
6. Where t he proposal involves retail sales in association with another primary use, or 
where a development involves retail sales but the mix of uses is such that no main use is 
identifiable, the Council may impose planning conditions to enable the retention of cont rol 
over the future use of the land or buildings and to prevent the establishment of a separate 
retail planning unit.

Key supporting docs/evidence  Retail and Leisure Study (2019)  
Retail and Leisure Study Update (2021)  
4.168.  The 2021 Retail and Leisure Study has identified no quantitative need for new retail 
floorspace over the plan period. This is on the basis of retaining existing market sh are 
and qualitative improvements are acknowledged as being required. New development 
proposals will come forward over the plan period and Policy DM35 therefore sets out our 
“town centre first” approach to locating development, and gives an indication of th e scale 
of retail development that should take place in each centre.  
4.169.  National planning policy requires that when considering applications for retail and leisure 
development outside of town centres, which are not in accordance with an up to date 
Local Plan,  local planning authorities should require an assessment considering how the 
development will affect the vitality, viability and future prospects of other centres in the 
area, if the development is over a proportionate, locally set floorspace threshold.  I f there 
is no locally set threshold, the default threshold is 2,500 sq m.  
4.170.  The Retail and Leisure Capacity Study work considers that the overall quantity of retail 
floorspace in the town and district centres, and the scale of individual retail units typical ly 
found in these centres, mean that a development of 2,500 sq m (around 25,000 sq ft) 
would potentially represent both a significant proportion of the total and a very large unit 
in the local context.  Such a development would therefore have the potential  to 
significantly affect the sustainability of shopping patterns in the area.  In view of these 
factors, in the local context, there is a need for retail developments of under 2,500 sq m 
to be assessed for their impact.  Whilst the 2021 Retail and Leisure Study update 
recommends a minimum impact threshold of 500 sq m this does not take into account 
the introduction of Local Centres into the retail hierarchy. Therefore thresholds that have 
been used in the Local Plan Part 2 (2015) are being retained . 
DM Policy 36 (DM36): Local and Convenience Shops  
4.171.  Small -scale shopping provision, whether in the form of individual shops, small groups of 
shops or shopping parades, has traditionally played an important role in meeting 
households’ day to day needs, particu larly in the older residential parts of the Borough. 
Additionally, it reduces the need for additional vehicular trips, has provided a valuable 
resource for the less mobile and assisted the sustainability of neighbourhoods.    
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  105 
 4.172.  However, such shopping faciliti es, often run by independent traders, have experienced 
severe competition in recent years from an increasingly car -mobile population that are 
easily able to travel further and a move by some of the national supermarket chains into 
convenience store retaili ng either on solo sites or garage forecourts in association with 
petrol filling stations. New smaller housing developments rarely provide facilities for new 
shops but larger -scale developments may justify the provision of additional local 
shopping faciliti es. 
4.173.  Policy DM36: provides the policy framework for considering such provision that falls 
outside of the centres hierarchy.   
DM Policy 36 (DM36 ): Local and Convenience Shops  
1. Planning permission will be granted for retail developments, which are not in association 
with existing defined centres or specifically allowed for by other policies, where all the 
following criteria are met:  
 
i. The proposal caters for local needs only and individual units do not exceed a 
maximum of 250 sq.m. in gross floor area;  
ii. There are no vacant existing shops within reasonable walking distance (typically 
500 metres) of the proposal which would be capable of accommodating the 
development and providing for the need proposed to be served;  
iii. EITHER the development is within or immed iately adjacent to an existing group 
of local shops, OR there are no other shopping facilities providing for local need 
within a reasonable walking distance (typically 500 metres) of the proposal.

DM Policy 37 (DM37): Tourism  
4.174.  In common with the rest of Pennine Lancashire, Blackburn with Darwe n has a rich urban 
and cultural heritage, coupled to a dramatic landscape setting.  In the context of the 
north of England it is also located close to internationally -significant tourism destinations 
in the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales, and to the  city of Manchester.  It is easily 
accessible by road and by air (to Manchester and Leeds -Bradford airports) and is 
generally well served by infrastructure.  
4.175.  Given these factors, there is considerable scope for the area to develop further as a 
tourist desti nation.  This has the potential to bring a range of benefits to the area, 
including:  
 An enhanced profile, a stronger sense of place and greater attractiveness as a 
place to live or invest;  
 The establishment of a diverse and robust rural economy;  
 The renovation or improvement of elements of our industrial heritage which may 
be underused or derelict;  
 Greater vitality and viability in our town centres, including a stronger evening 
economy;   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  106 
  The potential to secure wider benefits such as improved land mana gement in the 
rural area;  
 Opportunities for direct and indirect employment.  
4.176.  In achieving this, it will be important to focus on Blackburn with Darwen’s unique assets 
and ensure that we establish a clearly differentiated tourism offer.  Policy DM37 aims to 
support the development of Blackburn with Darwen’s visitor economy in this way by 
encouraging tourism -based development that relates to our key assets, while respecting 
the sensitivity of some of the areas where such development may take place.   
DM Policy 37 (DM37 ): Tourism  
1. Tourism -based development will be supported in principle, subject to other policies within 
the Plan, with priority given to the following locations:  
 
i. Blackburn and Darwen town centres as defined on the Polic y Map;  
ii. The West Pennine Moors  as defined on the Polic y Map for uses associated with 
the recreational use of the Moors.  Within this area uses likely to generate large 
numbers of trips should either be located within the villages of Edgworth, 
Chapeltown and Belmont, or be associated wi th an existing tourism or leisure 
facility.  All recreational development must be sensitive to the natural 
environment and landscape that is the tourism asset of the West Pennine Moors 
and secure appropriate maintenance of the facility in the long term;  
iii. At or in the vicinity of Ewood Park, for uses associated with the operation or 
development of Blackburn Rovers Football and Athletic Club;  
iv. Along the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, for uses associated with use of 
the canal as a recreational or cultur al resource  and supporting the Pennine 
Lancashire Linear Park proposals ; 
v. In converted buildings or in association with historic land uses, for uses 
associated with the Borough’s built or economic heritage; and  
vi. In other areas of Blackburn with Darwen provid ed there is no conflict with the 
priorities set out in i) to v) above.

4.177.  The West Pennine Moors  (WPM)  is an area of open countryside  covering 90 square 
miles  and attracts a large numbers of walkers, cycli sts, horse riders and day visitors  
each year . It comprises uplands, reservoirs, wooded valleys and historic villages and is 
bounded by Blackburn and Darwen to the north, Bolton and Bury to the south, Chorley to 
the west and Haslingden to the east.   
4.178.  The Wes t Pennines  are a valuable asset for  wildlife, businesses, outdoor recreation and 
water provision.   Balancing the needs of all these interests is critical to the  conservation 
of this upland landscape.  In recognition of its national scientific importance , in 2017, 
Natural England approved  parts of the WPMs to be designated a SSSI. Working with 
owners and occupiers, Natural England aims to ensure that the West Pennine Moors 
SSSI is managed in a way that  safeguards its national scientific  importance  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  107 
 whilst  maxi mising the benefits to businesses and  those seeking enjoyment and a sense 
of wellbeing from the area.   
4.179.  The WPMs  also form part of the South Pennines Park which stretches between the Peak 
District and the Yorkshire Dales National Parks. The South Pennines Park works to 
improve people’s health, quality of place and biodiversity, while growing local jobs, 
providing opp ortunities and boosting prosperity. Further information can be accessed at

4.180.  The Pennine Lancash ire Linear Park  is a vision and programme for change along a 23 -
mile section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal corridor between the Boroughs of 
Blackburn with Darwen and Pendle. It seeks to bring life back to the places and 
infrastructure that once supporte d thriving industry and created the places along its 
route. It seeks ot marry physical improvement to landscape, infrastructure and buildings, 
to expansive programmes of environmental, cultural, leisure, education and economic 
activity.

cultural heritage, promote sustainable regeneration and encourage enjoyment and 
sustainable tourism.  
DM Policy 38 (DM38): Major Infrastructure Schemes  
4.182.  It is important that new development in Blackburn with Darwen is supported by the 
appropriate infrastructure, as required by Core Policy 12: Infrastructure and Delivery. 
Providing and improving access to educational, health and community facilities greatly  
improves the quality of life for residents, builds strong communities and also helps to 
address inequalities.  
4.183.  The growth planned for in the Local Plan is contingent on the implementation of a range 
of major infrastructure schemes which are identified on the Polic y Map and in the 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP). Policy DM38 ensures that development proposals 
sufficiently safeguard the delivery of these schemes.   
DM Policy 38 (DM38 ): Major Infrastructure Schemes  
1. Development proposals that would prejudic e the delivery of the Major Infrastructure 
Schemes identified on the Polic y Map will not be permitted unless an acceptable 
alternative can be provided or it can be demonstrated that there is no longer a need.  
 
2. Development of Major Infrastructure Schemes wi ll be expected to take into account the 
requirements of, and integrate with, other relevant smaller scale infrastructure needs set 
out in the Council’s Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP).

4.184.  The implementation of major infrastructure schemes identified on the Polic y Map, in 
addition to delivery of smaller scale infrastructure projects is required in order to be able 
to accommodate future planned growth in Blackburn with Darwen. The Council’s 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) sets out a detailed list of infrastructure requirements, 
incorporating physical infrastructure, social infrastructure and green infrastructure 
schemes which are required to support new development over the plan period.  
4.185.  Due to their scale and nature, major infrastructure projects have the potential to impact 
negatively on both the local environment and environs some distance away. This could 
include impacts on air and water quality an d groundwater supply. As with any planning 
application for development, planning applications for these major schemes will be 
required to ensure that any negative environmental impacts, including any impacts on 
European sites, are avoided or mitigated in l ine with national and legislative policies , and 
Local Plan Policies CP6 and DM15. This may include the requirement to undertake a 
Habitats Regulation Assessment (HRA) to ensure these impacts are thoroughly 
assessed.  
4.186.  A total of thirteen new  schemes set out in the IDP are identified on the Polic y Map. 
These relate to new road schemes or junction improvements, school expansions, or 
waste . The y are the more significant, major infrastructure projects that are considered 
key to delivering the balanced growth stra tegy set out in the Local Plan. The new 
schemes identified on the Polic y Map are summarised below.  
Highways  
 New link roads  and associated junctions  at North East Blackburn, Bog Height Road 
and Moulden Brow / Livesey Branch Road  
 Major j unction improvements  at: 
o Junction 5 of the M65  
o Haslingden Road  – Strategic Employment Site access  
o Blackamoor Road / Haslingden Road  
o A666 / Jack Walker Way (South)  
o Goose House Lane / Chapels  
 Additional junction improvements and s ustainable transport measures  will be set 
out in the IDP and corresponding transport plans such as the Bus Service 
Improvement Plan (BSIP), Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) 
and Local Transport Plan 4 (LTP4)  but not identified on the Policy Map .  
Education  
 Pupil Pl ace Forecasting work undertaken in support of the new Local Plan has 
identified the need for n ew primary and secondary school places in the Borough 
across the Plan period . Specific projects currently identified are a potential new 
Primary school in West Bl ackburn, an extension of Lammack Primary School in 
North Blackburn and a possible extension of St Peter ’s Primary School in Darwen.  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  109 
 Work is progressing with the Council’s Education department to increase the 
number of Secondary School places in the Borough . 
 The Local Education Authority has confirmed that a local nursery school extension 
is also needed in the South East area of the Borough . Longshaw Infant School and 
Nursery  is proposed to be amalgamated o nto one site, creating an additional 19 
early years p upil places (increasing from 53 to 72) to meet the additional demand ; 
Waste 
 A new Household Waste Recycling Centre is identified in Darwen to better serve 
the needs of the Borough , increase recycling rates, and reduce carbon emissions 
from vehicle trips . 
4.187.  The Council will keep the IDP regularly reviewed, and use this  and other relevant 
documents  to prioritise the infrastructure necessary to support the growth of Blackburn 
with Darwen  over the plan period . 
DM Policy 39 (DM39): The Effect of Development on Pu blic Services  
4.188.  The attractiveness of our “offer” is determined partly by the quality of infrastructure 
available to residents.  At a time when resources to public providers of infrastructure are 
under substantial pressure, it is important that the most effe ctive use is made of those 
that are available. Policy DM39 ensures development proposals consider the effect on 
the Borough’s existing public services.   
DM Policy 39 (DM39 ): The Effect of Development on Public Services  
1. Development will be granted planning  permission provided that infrastructure, facilities 
and services exist, or can be provided via the development, which will allow the 
development to proceed without an unacceptable adverse impact on existing provision.  
 
2. Development likely to cater, or prov ide accommodation, for users of publicly -provided 
support services, including but not limited to mental health services, substance misuse 
treatment and adult social care, will only be permitted where it is clearly demonstrated 
that: 
 
i. A need for the develop ment exists arising from the requirements of people 
already ordinarily resident in Blackburn with Darwen or of Blackburn with Darwen 
service users currently receiving service outside the authority area;  
ii. Where the development consists of a facility directly  providing a support service, 
the nature and scale of the facility is in line with the Council’s commissioning 
strategies, such that resources are likely to be available to refer individuals to the 
facility and it can be reasonably expected that people alr eady ordinarily resident 
in Blackburn with Darwen, or Blackburn with Darwen service users currently 
receiving service outside the authority area will be the principal users of the 
facility; and  
iii. The development will not lead to an increase in the level of d emand for any 
publicly -provided support service, to an extent that is likely to result in a 
deterioration of the level of service available to existing users.

Effect of New Development on Public Services SPD (TBC)  
4.189.  Blackburn with Darwen currently ranks as the 14th most deprived authority in the country 
according to the Government’s 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation.  Alongside this, parts 
of the area’s population have significant levels of support needs relating to a range of 
services provided by the Council or other parts of the public sector including  mental 
health, treatment for substance misuse and adult social care.  Of particular concern is 
the fact that a significant proportion of this demand is from service users who have 
moved into Blackburn with Darwen from outside the area.  
4.190.  In order to continu e to meet current and future emerging demands, the Council and its 
partners are keen to ensure that there is a strategic approach to commissioning new 
services and facilities in Blackburn with Darwen, and that their commissioning approach 
is reflected in d ecision making elsewhere.  As such, the Council has developed a Market 
Position Statement which sets out its plans for commissioning social care services 
across all user groups.  The Statement will support providers to make proactive business 
and investmen t decisions and ensure that initiatives and resources are appropriately 
targeted.  It is essential that planning reflects this approach and contributes to managing 
demand for services.  
4.191.  In an era of limited resources, the Council and its partners are keen t o focus on meeting 
local needs in the first instance, and to ensure that the proportion of their overall 
resources that need to be directed towards providing support services is kept under 
control.  
4.192.  They are concerned about development which ostensibly prov ides accommodation or 
services used by vulnerable people, but which is provided in an ad -hoc way with little or 
no reference to wider strategies for commissioning support services.  This can result in 
users going on to require a wide range of other support  services provided by the public 
sector.  This is firstly an undesirable situation for the service users themselves, since 
development that is not supported by capacity in an appropriate range of services results 
in them being unable to access the support they require.  Secondly, it can have an 
impact on perceptions of Blackburn with Darwen more generally, as areas become 
associated with poor quality accommodation or with perceptions of crime perpetrated by 
service users who are not receiving proper support .  Policy DM39 sets out how we will 
manage development in line with the following objectives:  
 To ensure that planning decisions as far as possible support the commissioning 
strategy for facilities and services;  
 To assist in managing demand for support serv ices so as to ensure that 
appropriate levels of service to existing users within Blackburn with Darwen can 
be maintained; and  
 To assist in improving Blackburn with Darwen’s overall offer, and perceptions of 
its offer, by reducing levels of crime, anti -social behaviour and the perceived 
threat of these.

 4.193.  Two Planning Advisory Notes have been prepared by the Council to assist in 
implementing Policy DM38. These are:  
 Adults Social Care and Support Accommodation Planning Advisory Note 
(January 2021)  
 Children’s Residential and Supported Accommodation Planning Advisory Note 
(December 2020)  
4.194.  A Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) will also be prepared to provide further 
guidance on implementing this policy.

 5. Implementation  (including Growth Site  
policies)  
 
5.1 Delivery  
5.1. Delivery of the development needs  (for housing and employment)  set out in the Local 
Plan is key to the success of the overall strategy. Growth s ites are expected to deliver 
the majority of  identified needs  over the plan period. Sections 5.3 - 5.7 provide a site -
specific policy for each of the growth sites identified on the Policy map. These policies  
includ e the  key development considerations.  
5.2. Infrastructure is  also critical to the delivery of the strategic objectives of the Local Plan 
and is a key element of the Balanced Growth Strategy. The Council has prepared an 
Infrastructure Delivery Plan (IDP) (2022) to sit alongside the Local Plan and that links to 
Policy CP12: Infrastructure and Delivery. Delivery of  the identified growth sites will help 
assist with the delivery of infrastructure, however other sources of funding and support 
will also be required.  
5.3. The IDP has been prepared with a wide range of partners and infrastructure providers . It 
will be regularly monitored and kept under review, seen as a ‘living document’ . It sets out 
key infrastructure schemes required to facilitate development and secure delivery of the 
Local Plan. Whilst the main infrastructure requirements from development will be set out 
in the IDP, it is n ot intended to be a definitive list of all kinds of infrastructure at a local 
neighbourhood level.  
5.2 Monitoring  
5.4. To ensure the policies and proposals contained within the Local Plan are effective in 
delivering the Vision and Objectives, the Council has prepar ed a monitoring framework 
consisting of a number of key indicators and targets. This has been informed by the 
Sustainability Appraisal work and other relevant evidence base studies. The monitoring 
framework is set out in Appendix D.   
5.5. The Council will publi sh progress against relevant indicators and targets on an annual 
basis in the Authority Monitoring Report (AMR). The AMR will be used to measure the 
overall effectiveness of the Local Plan once adopted, as well as recommending any 
actions required to ensur e the delivery of the Plan. The Council will undertake a full or 
partial update of the Local Plan if an assessment indicates that changes to policy would 
better support delivery or if monitoring indicates an amended development strategy 
would be more effec tive. A requirement for Plan review is now in place every five years 
at a minimum.  
   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  113 
 5.3 Housing Growth Site Allocation Policies  
5.6. The housing growth site policies set out in this section identify the key development 
considerations that are applicable to each housing growth site identified on the Polic y 
Map. They are not a comprehensive list of all policy requirements or implications on the 
development of a site.  
5.7. The Local Plan should always be read as a whole. Additional planning considerations 
over and above t hose listed in the site -specific policies below may also be raised at a 
planning application stage.

Key Development Considerations  
1. Planning obligations (CP12) – a planning contribution may be required to help mitigate 
the impacts of development. Specific infrastructure requirements and planning 
contributions will be identified in line with Policy CP12  and the ‘Primary’  site typology  set 
out in Table 3; 
 
2. Housing mix and standards (DM3 and DM5) – development of this site will be required to 
provide an appropriate mix of housing tenure, types and quality in line with Policies DM3 
and DM5;  
 
3. Flooding / water management (DM13) –  
a) a small area of the site is located within Flood Zone 3b (see SFRA Level 1) which 
should be omitted from the developable area of the site;  
b) flood risk should be manageable through careful consideration of site layout and 
design around the flood risk early on in the planning stage; and  
c) early dialogue with United Utilities and the Council’s Drainage team will be required 
prior to the submission of a planning application for developing the site due to its 
location within an identified drainage area.  
 
4. Ecology (DM15) - potential ecological impacts must be considered as part of any 
planning application to develop the site due to its greenfield nature ; 
 
5. Open space (DM16 and DM18) - the Council’s Open Space Audit (2021) identif ies a 
deficiency of both amenity greenspace and natural and semi -natural greenspace in the 
Blackburn North Neighbourhood Area. Development proposals should seek to address 
these deficiencies wherever possible , along with provision of a L AP onsite  (or 
contr ibution of £35,000, in addition to costs under para 1, for provision elsewhere) ; 
 
6. Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application to develop the site will need to be 
accompanied by an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment and/or the results of an 
archaeologic al field evaluation. The development will in all likelihood require a level of 
archaeological mitigation, which might take the form of preservation in situ, or by record, 
depending on the significance of the features encountered;  
 
7. Highways and access (DM29 ) – suitable vehicular access to the site is available off 
Clarence Park.

site (including some TPOs to the  south east boundary). Development will be required to 
avoid loss of and minimise harm to existing trees;  
 
7. Open space (DM18) – development proposals will be expected to provide a LEAP onsite 
(or contribution of £80,000, in addition to costs under para 1, f or provision elsewhere);  
 
8. Playing pitches  (DM20) - the area of playing field to be lost as a result of the proposed 
development will be replaced, prior to the commencement of development, by a new 
area of playing field of equivalent or better quality; and of equivalent or greater quantity; 
and in a suitable location; and subject to equivalent or better accessibility and 
management arrangements;   
 
9. Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application to develop the site will require  an 
Archaeological Desk Based Ass essment and/or the results of an archaeological field 
evaluation. The development will in all likelihood require a level of archaeological 
mitigation, which might take the form of preservation in situ, or by record, depending on

out in the Bank Hey Masterplan (adopted March 2020) and associated Infrastructure 
Delivery Strategy;  
 
2. Planning obligations (CP12) - a minimum planning contribution of £9,692  per dwelling will 
be require d to help mitigate the impacts of development in line with the Bank Hey 
Masterplan. This will contribute towards additional primary school places in West 
Blackburn, highways infrastructure improvements (Bog Height Link Road and 
improvements to Jack Walker Way/A666) and other specific infrastructure requirements 
identified in line with Policy CP12;  
 
3. Utilities infrastructure (CP12) - early dialogue with United Utilities will be required prior to 
the submission of a planning application for developing the site  due to presence of 
utilities  infrastructure within the site;  
 
4. Contamination / site safety (DM2) – due to the presence of infilled land in the area and a 
known landfill on the site, completion of appropriate ground investigation works will be 
required to e stablish the extent of any ground contamination and any required mitigation 
measures . In addition, the overhead lines  present on the site will be incorporated  into the 
design of development and statutory safety clearances between overhead lines, the 
groun d, and built structures must not be infringed;  
 
5. Housing mix and standards (DM3 and DM5) – development of this site will be required to 
provide an appropriate mix of housing tenure, types and quality in line with Policies DM3 
and DM5;  
 
6. Flooding / water management (DM13) –  
a. a small area of the site is located within Flood Zone 3b (see SFRA Level 1) which 
should be omitted from the developable area of the site;  
b. surface water flood risk should be manageable through careful consideration of 
site layout and design around the flood risk early on in the planning stage;  
c. a holistic drainage strategy is to be agreed prior to the submission of planning 
application , with the ponds and drains running west to east through the site to be 
retained within  the development design;  
 
7. Environmental Opportunity Areas (DM14) – the site is expected to include new strategic 
green infrastructure links and/or habitat, biodiversity, carbon management and flood risk 
mitigation measures;  
 
8. Ecology (DM15) - potential ecol ogical impacts must be considered as part of any 
planning application for developing the site due to its greenfield nature and its location in 
close proximity to Higher Bog Pasture Biological Heritage Site and the presence of 
important species and habitats  within the site;  
 
9. Public Rights of Way (DM16) - the development layout and scheme should incorporate 
existing Public Rights of Ways and create a new network of routes for both pedestrians 
and cyclists;  
 
10. Trees (DM17) - important features present on the sit e such as woodland s (two areas of 
trees present within the site are protected by TPOs) and hedgerows should be protected;

contribution of £140,000, in addition to costs un der para 1, for provision elsewhere);  
 
12. Heritage assets (DM26) – the New Row Wesleyan Methodist Chapel  is a Grade II listed 
building located adjacent to the western boundary of the site on Heys Lane and is in a 
poor state of repair. Bog Bank Farmhouse, a Gr ade II listed building is also located close 
to the site. As the site is on exposed, high ground, development is likely to have a 
significant visual impact upon the surrounding area and these listed assets. The Heritage 
Impact Assessment prepared for the s ite identifie s a number of mitigation measures to 
minimise any impact on these assets. Development should maintain the visual 
connection to these assets and maintain some sense of openness, limiting development 
directly opposite and in close proximity to t he listed Chapel. A landscape buffer should be 
retained on the western edge of the site and development on the southern parts of the 
site should be limited as these areas will appear more visually prominent ; 
 
13. Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application t o develop the site will be accompanied 
by an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment and/or the results of an archaeological 
field evaluation. The development will in all likelihood require a level of archaeological 
mitigation, which might take the form of pr eservation in situ, or by record, depending on 
the significance of the features encountered ; 
 
14. Highways and access (DM29) – the Bank Hey Masterplan identifies a number of suitable 
vehicular access points to the site off Jack Walker Way, Heys Lane, Moorland Road and

Key Development Considerations  
1. Adopted masterplan - Development is to be brought forward in line with the principles set 
out in the Holden Fold Masterplan (adopted February 2021) and associated Infrastructure  
and Delivery Plan. A co -ordinated approach to phased development in line with 
supporting infrastructure works will be required;  
 
2. Planning obligations (CP12) - a minimum planning contribution of £4,618 per dwelling will 
be required to help mitigate the imp acts of development in line with the Holden Fold 
Masterplan. This will contribute towards additional primary and secondary school places, 
off-site highways and Square Meadows upgrade and other specific infrastructure 
requirements identified in line with Po licy CP12.  
 
3. Utilities infrastructure (CP12) - early dialogue with United Utilities will be required due to 
presence of utilities  infrastructure within the site and its location in close proximity to an 
identified drainage area. More detailed assessments will be required  in conjunction with 
United Utilities to determine the most appropriate option to establish a new clean  water 
connection;  
 
4. Contamination (DM2) - completion of appropriate ground investigation works  will be 
required  to establish the extent of  any ground contamination and any required mitigation 
measures due to former mining activities on the site and its location  in close  proximity  to 
a former landfill site ; 
 
5. Housing mix and standards (DM3 and DM5) – development of this site will be required t o 
provide an appropriate mix of housing tenure, types and quality in line with Policies DM3 
and DM5;  
 
6. Flooding / water management (DM13) – the site is partially located within a Critical 
Drainage Area. A holistic drainage strategy is to be agreed prior to the submission of any 
planning application for developing the site;  
 
7. Environmental Opportunity Areas (DM14) – the site includes the green infrastructure 
opportunities identified in the Holden Fold Masterplan as potential Environmental 
Opportunity Areas  
 
8. Ecology (DM15) - potential ecological impacts must be considered as part of any 
planning application for developing the site due to its greenfield nature ; 
 
9. Public Rights of Way (DM16) - a network of Public Rights of Way cross the site and run 
along the nort hern boundary. The development layout and scheme detailing will be 
required to provide good connectivity to this established network including mitigation of 
any adverse impacts;  
 
10. Open space (DM16 and DM18) - the Council’s Open Space Audit (2021) identified  a 
deficiency of amenity greenspace  in the Darwen Neighbourhood Area which  
development proposals should seek  to address wherever possible. A community sports 
pitch known locally as Square Meadow is located on the eastern boundary of the site  and 
developmen t proposals should explore the opportunities to extend/enhance this use and 
create linkages with the on -site and surrounding network of open spaces;  
  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  125 
 Policy H044 -46: Land at Holden Fold, Darwen  
Key Development Considerations  
11. Heritage assets (DM26) – the site is located adjacent a number of designated heritage 
assets and their settings, including Manor House Farm Cottage and the church buildings 
at Lower Chapel and Church of St James’ that must be protected. The proposed 
development site falls uphill of Manor House and development is likely t o impact on its 
setting. The Heritage Impact Assessment prepared for the site requires a landscape 
buffer to be retained in the south east corner of the site whilst retaining glimpsed views of 
the listed Manor House Cottage. The levels of any development i n this part of the site will 
need to be maintained to avoid development dominating views within the wider setting;  
 
12. Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application to develop the site will be accompanied 
by an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment and/or the results of an archaeological 
field evaluation. The development will in all likelihood require a level of archaeological 
mitigation, which might take the form of preservation in situ, or by record, depending on 
the significance of the features encountered ;  
 
13. Landscape character (DM22) - the site is located within the West Pennine Moors. 
Development proposals will be required to be designed so as to minimise the potential 
impacts of development on the landscape character, ecological and recreational value of 
the West Pennine Moors. Important landscape features such as the area of adjacent 
ancient woodland  will be protected ; 
 
14. Highways and Access (DM29) – the Holden Fold Masterplan identifies suitable vehicular 
access points to the site at Holden Fold, Moor Lane  and Roman Road.

the impacts of development in line with the ‘Tertiary’ site typology  set out in Table 3  of 
Policy CP12. Specific infrast ructure requirements and planning contributions will be 
identified in line wit h Policy CP12 and Table 3 ; 
 
2. Utilities infrastructure (CP12) - early dialogue with United Utilities will be required prior to 
the submission of a planning application for developi ng the site due to the presence of 
utilities  infrastructure within the site;  
 
3. Safeguarding amenity (DM2) – adequate mitigation measures will be required  within 
development proposals to ensure any amenity impacts associated with the site’s  
proximity to the railway line  are adequately addressed ; 
 
4. Housing mix and standards (DM3 and DM5) – development of this site will be required to 
provide an appropriate mix of housing tenure, types and quality in line with Policies DM3 
and DM5;  
 
5. Flooding / water management (DM13) - the Level 2 SFRA identifies a need for a 
Drainage Strategy to be prepared at the FRA stage to manage surface water risk on and 
off the site. There is an open channel watercourse running along the southern boundary 
of the development site. Any development proposals on the site should ensure an 8m 
riparian buffer is retained along this watercourse;  
 
6. Heritage a ssets (DM26) - any development proposed on the site must assess the

Key Development Considerations  
1. Green Belt (CP2) - The site is  previously developed land located within the Green Belt. 
Development  proposals  must therefore comply with relevant national policy ; 
 
2. Planning obligations (CP12)  - a planning contribution may be required to help mitigate 
the impacts of development in line with the ‘Primary’ site typology  set out in Table 3  of 
Policy CP12. Specific infrastructure requirements and planning contributions will be 
identified in l ine wi th Policy CP12 and Table 3 ; 
 
3. Utilities infrastructure (CP12) - early dialogue with United Utilities will be required prior to 
the submission of a planning application for developing the site due to its location within 
close proximity to a reservoir flood zone;  
 
4. Contamination (DM2) – a number of landfills were formerly present on the site which has 
resulted in significant  contamination  issues . This must be thoroughly  investigated and 
resolved p rior to development of the site;   
 
5. Housing mix and standards (DM 3 and DM5) – development of th e site will be required to 
provide an appropriate mix of housing tenure, types and quality in line with Policies DM3 
and DM5;  
6. Flooding / water management (DM13) – the SFRA Level 1 highlights an area of the site 
is located with in Flood Zone 3b which is to be omitted from the site’s developable area. 
Flood risk should be manageable through careful consideration of site layout and design 
around the flood risk early on in the planning stage . Attention will be required to drainage 
within and from the site to ensure that there is no impact on the nearby watercourse;  
 
7. Ecology (DM15) - potential ecological impacts must be considered  as part of any 
planning application for developing the site  and appropriate buffers included where 
requir ed due to its rural location, proximity to nationally and regionally important wildlife 
sites (SSSI, BHSs, nature reserve), watercourses and its position within an ecological 
network;  
 
8. Public Rights o f Way (DM16) - the development layout and scheme detaili ng should 
provide good connectivity to the established Public Rights of Way network including 
mitigation of any adverse impacts;  
 
9. Open space (DM18) – development proposals will be expected to provide a LEAP onsite 
(or contribution of £80,000, in addition t o costs under para 2, for provision elsewhere);  
 
10. Landscape character (DM22) -  
i. the site is located within the West Pennine Moors. Development proposals will be 
required to be designed so as to minimise the impact of development on the 
countryside and to enhance access to the countryside;  
ii. development must be informed by a landscape masterplan identifying strategic 
areas of planting that are required to integrate the development i nto the 
surrounding countryside;  
iii. development will be required to be compatible  with the rural character of the 
surrounding area, with particular attention to the massing and distribution of 
buildings, architectural vernacular, materials and landscaping / boundary 
treatments;   
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  132 
 Policy H080: Springside Works, Belmont  
Key Development Considerations  
 
11. Heritage a ssets (DM26) - two Grade II listed buildings  are located in close proximity to 
the site – Lower Folds Farmhouse to the north west and Dingle House to the south east. 
The Heritage Impact Assessment prepared for the site requires any new development to 
preserve the wooded framework enclosing the site to screen views and minimise harm to 
these listed buildings. The assessment also identifies the Springside Works site itself as 
a non -designated heritage asset. Some further recording of the above ground structures 
to capture the evidential value of the site will mitigate the very low level loss  of the 
building ; 
 
12. Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application to develop the site will need to be 
accompanied by an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment and/or the results of an 
archaeological field evaluation. The development will in all likelihood require a level of 
archaeological mitigation , which may take the form of preservation in situ, or by record, 
depending on the significance of the features encountered.  
 
13. Highways and a ccess (DM29) – suitable existing vehicular access point to the site is 
available.  
 
14. Proposals for development will ne ed to be accompanied by a comprehensive plan for the 
long term management of the wider land holding that accompanies the industrial site;

 Policy H195: North East Blackburn Strategic Housing Site  
Key Development Considerations  
1. Masterplan - the site is to be brought forward in line with a masterplan including the 
preparation of a Design Code and Infrastructure and Delivery Strategy covering the 
whole of the all ocation. The masterplan must be agreed by the Council prior to the 
granting of planning permission  on any part of the site ; 
 
2. Planning obligations (CP12) - a plannin g contribution of at least £9,75 0 per dwelling will 
be expected to help mitigate the impacts  of development in line with the site specific 
financial appraisal set out in the Plan Viability Study . This will include funding provision of 
additional  primary and secondary school places, a new link road and any other specific 
infrastructure requirement s identified in line with Policy CP12 and the masterplan;  
 
3. Utilities infrastructure (CP12) - United Utilities has confirmed  that the existing clean water 
network in the immediate vicinity of the development site is not currently able to support 
the additio nal demand required to provide connections for the proposed development. It 
is anticipated that network reinforcement works will be required to provide adequate 
capacity to service the development site. United Utilities should be contacted at the 
earliest opportunity to confirm the extent of reinforcement works required.  A holistic 
drainage strategy is to be agreed prior to the submission of planning application and 
early dialogue with United Utilities will be required due to presence of utilities  
infrastru cture within the site;  
 
4. Site safety (DM2) – a high voltage power line crosses the site on pylons. An overall 
easement corridor must be incorporated into scheme design in accordance with National 
Grid guidance;  
 
5. Housing mix and standards (DM3 and DM5) – development of this site will be required to 
provide an appropriate mix of housing tenure, types and quality in line with Policies DM3 
and DM5;  
 
6. Flooding / water management (DM13) –  
a. the SFRA Level 1 highlights a small area of the site  is located within Fl ood Zone 3b 
which should  be omitted from the site’s developable area.  
b. opportunities to de -culvert the watercourse flowing from east to west through the 
southern end of the development site before flowing under Brownhill Drive should be 
explored as part of  the site’s development  to provide biodiversity net gain, river 
restoration and natural flood management benefits;  
c. flood risk should be manageable through careful consideration of site layout and 
design around the flood risk early on in the planning stage;  
 
7. Public Rights of Way (DM16) –  
a. the existing Public Rights of Way network provides the opportunity for 
development of the site to make connections to the communities at the edge of 
the site and to the open countryside to the north and east ;  
b. development will be required to provide new footpath routes to connect  to existing 
communities  and the surrounding open countryside , facilitating sustainable travel 
to the range of facilities and services that are established there;  
c. development will be req uired to improve  the quality of the  existing Public Rights of 
Way and ensure  routes are clearly defined and legible;  
  
Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  139 
 Policy H195: North East Blackburn Strategic Housing Site  
Key Development Considerations  
8. Open space (DM16 and DM18) - the Council’s Open Space Audit (2021) identified a 
deficiency of both amenity greenspace and natural and semi -natural greenspace in the 
Blackburn North Neighbourhood Area. Development proposals should seek to address 
these deficiencies wherever possible . Proposals will also be expected to provide a NEAP 
onsite (or contribution of £140,000, in addition to costs un der para 1, for provision 
elsewhere);  
 
9. Landscape c haracter (DM22) – the Landscape Character Assessment prepared for the 
site identifies a number of requirements for development, including:  
a. retain, enhance and conserve existing woodlands and hedgerows and s eek to 
create a stronger landscape structure to integrate development by increasing the 
presence of hedgerow trees and provide native woodland planting;  
b. retain, enhance and conserve the network of drystone wall field boundaries, in 
particular along the Wha lley Old Road frontages;  
c. include appropriate soft landscape zone around the perimeter of the location in the 
context of existing dwellings which ‘back on’ to development;  
d. form a strong landscape character treatment along the eastern boundary to 
integrate d evelopment into the wider rural area;  
e. avoid visually intrusive development on more elevated areas of the site ; 
f. maintain a n adequate buffer  between the hard edge of development and the site 
boundary to allow for an appropriate transition to the open land th at is characteristic 
of the Green Belt and to also ensure the permanence of the adjacent Green Belt 
boundary located within Hyndburn ; 
 
10. Heritage a ssets (DM26) – Upper Mickle Hey Farmhouse and attached buildings (Grade II  
listed ) and Eddy Holes Stable and Shippons to Eddy Holes (Grade II*  listed ) are both 
located within the site boundary and Myles Wife Hey ( Grade II* listed ) located to the 
south of the site .   There are also a number of non -designated heritage assets located 
within and in close proximity to  the site which include Brownhill House and associated 
farm buildings, the site of Hollin Hall, the site of the former ropewalks (both in the south 
western corner), Bank Hey and Stone Hill Quarry site along the southern boundary. The 
Heritage Impact Assess ment prepared for the site identifies a number of mitigation 
measures that will be required as part of any development proposed on the site : 
a. consideration of the setting of both the designated and non -designated assets 
located within and in close proximity  to the site will be required at masterplanning 
stage to preserve an appreciation of the assets within the landscape;  
b. the development  layout will be required to retain the visual connection and some 
sense of openness between the land and the listed buildings located on site . 
Protecting the prominence of these sites, the historic access roads, stone boundary 
walls in the vicinity and the intervisibility between Eddy Holes and Upper Mickle Hey 
will be required as part of developing the site.  The buffer zone required either side of 
the power line provides a good basis for identifying an area of open land which 
preserves the intervisibility and setting of these assets ; 
c. housing development should be limited on more elevated parts of t he site.  
 
 
11.  Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application to develop the site will need to be 
accompanied by an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment and/or the results of an 
archaeological field evaluation due to the presence of sites of potential archaeological 
interest including Hollin Hall, the site of Stone Hill Quarry and a former Ropewalk off

Bank Hey Lane. The development will in all likelihood require a level of archaeological 
mitigation, which may take the form of preservation in situ, or by record, depending  on 
the significance of the features encountered ; 
12.  Public water supply (DM28) - Eddy Holes Service Reservoir is located within the site. 
Careful masterplanning is required  to mitigate the risk of pollution to public water supply 
and the water environment a nd to safeguard the vehicular access to the reservoir and 
associated network assets connecting to and from the reservoir;  
 
13. Highways and a ccess (DM29) – primary access to the site will be gained from two new 
junctions onto the highway network. These form li nks onto Brownhill Drive along the 
western boundary and to Whalley Old Road along the southern boundary. A distributor 
road will arc  through the site between these two junctions.

adjacent to the  Church of St Silas, a Grade II* listed building. The Derbyshire A lmhouses, 
a locally listed building also adjoins the site to the north of the Church. T he Heritage 
Impact Assessment prepared for the site requires any development to be limited (in both 
numbers and density) and to retain the general open character of the land adjacent to the 
Church  in order to minimise harm to the heritage assets . Development to the north of the 
Church would significantly detract from the immediate setting of the listed building and 
should be excluded from the site . Any harm to the conserv ation area and almhouses 
could be mitigated by detailed bespoke design approach and by limiting the scale and 
extent of any new development, especially in the area directly adjacent the locally listed 
building ;

Regulation 19 Publication Plan Con sultation (January 2022)  148 
 Policy H 224: Land off Bog Height Road , Blackburn  
Key Development Considerations  
1. Adopted m asterplan - due to location of site adjacent to the Bank Hey Housing Growth 
Allocation (H 042), any development proposals must be consistent with the adopted Bank 
Hey Masterplan (adopted March 2020) and should not compromise delivery of the wider 
allocated site;  
 
2. Planning obligations (CP12) – a minimum planning contribution of £9,692 per  dwelling 
will be required to help mitigate the impacts of development in line with agreement for the 
adjoining site H042 and the Bank Hey Masterplan. This will cont ribute towards additional 
primary school places in West Blackburn, highways infrastructure improvements (Bog 
Height Link Road and improvements to Jack Walker Way/A666) and other specific 
infrastructure requirements identified in line with Policy CP12;  
 
3. Housing mix and standards (DM3 and DM5) – development of this site will be required to 
provide an appropriate mix of housing tenure, types and quality in line with Policies DM3 
and DM5;  
 
4. Flooding / water management (DM13) – the SFRA Level 1 highlights an area of Flood 
Zone 3b within the site which is to be omitted from the site’s developable area. Flood risk 
should be manageable through careful consideration of site layout and design around the 
flood risk early on in the planning stage ; 
 
5. Open space (DM18) – development proposals will be expected to provide a LEAP onsite 
(or contribution of £80,000, in addition to costs under para 2, for provision elsewhere);  
 
6. Archaeology (DM26) – an archaeological desk -based assessment and walkover will be 
required as part of a ny planning application for developing the site to assess potential 
archaeological features on the site;  
 
7. Highways and a ccess (DM29) –access  to the site  is to be provided off the new link road 
connecting Bog Height Road to Ashwood Avenue.

required to establish the extent of any ground contamination and any mitigation 
measures required due to the presence of two historic landfills on site , its prior use as a 
mill and its location in close proximity to an existing EA IPPC Regulated site, active 
landfill and other EA Regulated facilities;  
 
4. Safeguarding amenity (DM2) - due to the site’s location close to a wastewater treatmen t 
works, an impact assessment, including  an odour impact assessment, will be required 
prior to any development taking place to ensure the proposed development can secure 
an acceptable level of amenity . Any development proposals must consider impacts on 
the West Pennine Moors SSSI, particularly in relation to potential air quality impacts;  
 
5. Flooding / water management (DM13) – the Level 2 SFRA identifies a need to model the 
Sunnyhurst Brook and the unnamed watercourse flowing through the site at FRA stage in  
order to quantify the risk from these watercourses. The site is located adjacent to the 
River Darwen (main river) and will require an 8m riparian buffer/easement to be 
incorporated in scheme design between the watercourse and development;  
 
6. Public Rights o f Way (DM16) - the development layout and scheme detailing should 
provide good connectivity to the established Public Rights of Way network including 
mitigation of any adverse impacts;

c. flood risk should be manageable through careful consideration of site layout and 
design around the flood risk early on in the planning stage;  
d. the site is a ffected by surface water flooding which needs to be managed through 
SuDs on site. Surface water from the site could be directed to Newfield Brook;  
e. development will be required to incorporate a suitable easement for the culvert that 
crosses the site or inco rporate measures to ensure that any development does not 
impact on the integrity of the culvert;  
f. the developer should explore the option of de -culverting to improve ecology and 
reduce dangers of blocked/collapsed culvert;  
 
4. Ecology (DM15) - potential ecolog ical impacts must be considered as part of any 
planning application for developing the site due to its greenfield nature ; 
 
5. Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application to develop the site will need to be 
accompanied by an Archaeological Desk Based Assessm ent and/or the results of an 
archaeological field evaluation due to presence of pre -1778 farmsteads close to the site. 
The development will in all likelihood require a level of archaeological mitigation, which 
may take the form of preservation in situ, or by record, depending on the significance of 
the features encountered;  
 
6. Highways and a ccess (DM29) – suitable vehicular access to the site is available off Issa

the impacts of development. Any specific infrastructure requirements and planning 
contributions will be identified in line with Policy CP12;  
 
2. Utilities infrastructure (CP12) –  
a. early dialogue with United Utilities will be required prior to the submission of a 
planning application for developing Plot 3  due to  the presence of utilities  
infrastructure within the site , and the site’s  location within close proximity  to an 
identified drainage area;   
b. United Utilities has confirmed the existing clean water services immediately 
adjoining the development are not currently able to support the additional demand 
required to provide connections  for the proposed development. It is anticipated that 
network reinforcement works will be required to provide the required capacity to 
service the development site and United Utilities should be contacted at the earliest 
opportunity to identify the works n eeded;  
c. a 3 metre easement is required to be maintained between development and the 
electricity and BT cables located on Plot 1;  
 
3. Contamination (DM2) - completion of appropriate ground investigation works will be 
required to establish the extent of any ground contamination and any mitigation 
measures required  for all plots ;

planning application for developing the site due to  features  identified  within Plots 2 and 3  
and within close proximity to Plot 1 ; 
 
7. Canal asset (DM28) – Plot 2 is located adjacent to the Leeds and Liverpool canal where 
it is within a cu tting. Any development on the plot would need to be offset from the top of 
the canal cutting to protect its structural integrity. D evelopment should have a good 
relationship with the adjacent transport gateway and the adjoining Leeds and Liv erpool 
Canal .  
 
8. Archaeology (DM26) - any planning application to develop the plots will need to be 
accompanied by an Archaeological Desk Based Assessment and/or the results of an 
archaeological field evaluation due to likely presence of buried remains of 19th Century 
occupation. The development will in all likelihood require a level of archaeological 
mitigation, which might take the form of preservation in situ, or by record, depending on 
the significance of the features encountered;  
 
9. Heritage assets (DM26) - the Grade II  listed Imperial Mill is located to the north of Plot 2 . 
As identified in the Heritage Impact Assessment for the site, careful consideration of 
scheme design and the extent/scale/height of development on Plot 2 will be required to 
minimise the visual impac t on the listed building.  Large, single mass buildings will

wide masterplan and infrastructure delivery strategy covering the whole of the parcel . 
The masterplan must be agreed by the Council either at the time of, or prior to , the 
granting of planning permission . At least 50% of new floorspace on the site should be 
industrial (B2)71; 
 
2. Green Belt (CP2) – any development brought forward on the site w ill be required to  
provide compensatory improvements to the environmental quality and accessibility of 
remaining Green Belt land. This should contribute to  offset ting the impact of removal of  
this site  from the Green Belt72;  
 
3. Planning obligations (CP12) - a planning contribution will be required to help mitigate the 
impacts of development , particularly  in relation to  transport impacts73 and green belt 
compensation measures set out above . Any further specific infrastructure requirements 
and planning contribut ions will be identified in line with Policy CP12 ; 
 
4. Utilities infrastructure (CP12) – a holistic drainage strategy is to be agreed prior to the 
submission of a planning application and early dialogue with United Utilities will be 
required due to presence of  utilities  infrastructure within the site and its location in close 
proximity to an identified drainage area;  
 
5. Contamination/ site safety (DM2) - incorporation of overhead lines into the design of 
development  will be required. Statutory safety clearances b etween overhead lines, the 
ground, and built structures must not be infringed. In addition, a contamination and 
geotechnical assessment will be required to set out an appropriate remediation strategy 
for the site74. 
 
6. Flooding / water management (DM13) – the SFRA Level 1 highlights a small area of the 
site is located within Flood Zone 3b which is to be omitted from the site’s developable 
area. Flood risk should be manageable through careful consideration of site layout and 
design around the flood risk early o n in the planning stage;  
 
7. Public Rights of Way (DM16) – development will be required to improve the quality of the  
existing  Public Rights of Way and ensure routes are clearly defined and legible;  
 
8. Landscape character (DM22) – the Landscape Character Assessment prepared for the 
site identifies a number of requirements for development of the site, including:  
a. integrating a strong landscape structure into the boundary treatment including an 
appropriate buffer zone around the perimeter. Any change should e nhance and 
conserve existing field boundaries and public rights of ways and avoid visually 
intrusive development on the more elevated areas;  
b. retain, enhance and conserve the network of drystone wall field boundaries;  
                                                
71 In line with the evidence base  including the latest economic needs assessment (Iceni, 2021), evidence on market 
demand (BwDBC, 2021), and the economic case for the new strategic employment site (Turley, 2020)  
72 Possible measures are set out in the  ‘Potential Compensatory Improvements t o the Green Belt’ report  (LUC, 2021)  
73 As set out in the M65 J5 Strategic Employment Site Transport Study (Section 7)  
74 In line with the recommendations set out in the Junction 5, M65 Employment Land Preliminary Risk Assessment 
(LK Consult, 2021)

Key Development Considerations  
c. retain an appropriate area to maintain a setting around the existing farmsteads of 
Blackhill Farm and the cottages on Haslingden Road and School Lane;  
d. form a strong landscape character treatment along the western boundary adjacent 
to the M65 motorway to int egrate development into the wider setting;  
e. avoid visually intrusive development on more elevated areas of the location in the 
south east corner of the site.  
 
9. Heritage assets (DM26) - careful consideration should be paid to ensure the integrity of 
the local  war memorial on Haslingden Road  is maintained ;

the submission of a planning application for developing the site due to the presence of 
utilities  infrastructure and its location in close proximity t o an iden tified drainage area. A 
significant sewer runs through the site and options must be assessed early to ensure the 
layout of the proposed development fully consider s limitations posed with such assets;  
 
4. Heat n etworks (DM12) - the site is  of strategic signifi cance and  identified as being 
adjacent to  an area with potential for heat network development. Development of this site 
should be designed to be connection ready;  
 
5. Flooding / water management (DM13) – the SFRA Level 1 highlights an area of Flood 
Zone 2 wit hin the site which is to be omitted from the site’s developable area;

building assessment will be required as part of any planning application for developing 
the site as some are as of survival are possible;  
 
7. Heritage a ssets (DM26) – a cluster of Grade II listed buildings are located to the east of 
the site within the  Eanam Wharf Conservation Area (warehouses of Entwistle and Oddy 
Ltd; British Waterways Office; Canal House; Bank Co ttage and iron structure at east end 
of warehouses west of Navigation Bridge). Holy Trinity Church (Grade II), St Johns 
Church (Grade II) and Blackburn Cathedral (Grade II*) are prominent buildings in the 
skyline which are likely to be seen in the same con text as development on the site. The 
Heritage Impact Assessment prepared for the site highlights the level of visual impact on 
these assets will greatly depend upon the design and extent/scale/height of any new 
development, especially on the eastern edge. Any development should consider wider 
townscape views across the site  especially when viewing westwards off Barbara Castle 
Way towards Blackburn Cathedral and St John’s Church. The alignment and layout 
between buildings should consider glimpsed views of Bl ackburn Cathedral’s tower and 
steeple ;

measures  required due to the site’s industrial history;  
 
5. Heat networks (DM12) - the site is of strategic significance and identified as being 
adjacent to an area with potential for heat network development. Development of this site 
should be designed to be connection ready ; 
 
6. Flooding / water management (DM13) –  
a. the Level 2 SFRA  identifies significant issues with flood risk on the site . The River 
Blakewater (Main River) runs through the centre of the site as a culverted 
watercourse and both fluvial and surface water risk from climate c hange  are present 
on the site;  
b. additional modelling and investigative work s will be required to identify suitable 
mitigation options  prior to any development progressing on the site ; 
c. development proposals should explore  opportunities to de -culvert the River 
Blakewater to allow Biodiversity Net Gain, river restoration and natural flood 
management to be achieved. If this is not possible, an 8 metre easement between 
the culvert and new development will be required;  
 
7. Ecology (DM15) - potential ecological impacts must be considered as part of any 
planning application for developing the site due to its greenfield nature ; 
 
8. Archaeology (DM26) – an archaeological watching brief on investigation works on the 
site ha s identif ied buried remains. A desk-based assessment and walkover is therefore 
required as part of any planning application for developing the site to assess potential 
archaeological features on  the site;   
 
9. Heritage a ssets (DM26) – the site is located i mmediately adjacent to the Richmond 
Terrace conservation area which contains a number of listed buildings including the 
Grade II listed Church of St John Evangelist. Sensitive development with appropriate

Assessment prepared for the site highlights that the level of visual impact on both the 
conservation area and the listed building will depend on the design and 
extent/scale/height of any new development, especially on the western edge. Any 
development should consider wider townscape views across and through the site and the

 Accessible and Adaptable Homes Standards: Standards for layout and circulation space.  
 
Active Design: A combination of 10 principles established by Sport England and Public Health 
England, that promote activity, health and stronger communities through the way towns, cities 
and neighbourhoods are designed and built.  
 
Affordable Housing: Housing for sale or rent, for those whose needs are not met by the  
market (including housing that provides a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is for 
essential local workers); and which complies with one or more of the following definitions:  
Affordable housing for rent : meets all of the following conditions: (a) the rent is set in 
accordance with the Government’s rent policy for Social Rent or Affordable Rent, or is at 
least 20% below local market rents (including service charges where applicable); (b) the 
landlord is a registered provider, except where it is incl uded as part of a Build to Rent 
scheme (in which case the landlord need not be a registered provider); and (c) it includes 
provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households, or for the subsidy 
to be recycled for alternative afforda ble housing provision. For Build to Rent schemes 
affordable housing for rent is expected to be the normal form of affordable housing provision 
(and, in this context, is known as Affordable Private Rent).  
Starter homes : is as specified in Sections 2 and 3 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 
and any secondary legislation made under these sections. The definition of a starter home 
should reflect the meaning set out in statute and any such secondary legislation at the time 
of plan preparation or decision maki ng. Where secondary legislation has the effect of limiting 
a household’s eligibility to purchase a starter home to those with a particular maximum level 
of household income, those restrictions should be used.  
Discounted market sales  housing is that sold a t a discount of at least 20% below local 
market value. Eligibility is determined with regard to local incomes and local house prices. 
Provisions should be in place to ensure housing remains at a discount for future eligible 
households.  
Other affordable ro utes to home ownership  is housing provided for sale that provides a route 
to ownership for those who could not achieve home ownership through the market. It 
includes shared ownership, relevant equity loans, other low cost homes for sale (at a price 
equival ent to at least 20% below local market value) and rent to buy (which includes a 
period of intermediate rent). Where public grant funding is provided, there should be 
provisions for the homes to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households, or 
for any receipts to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision or refunded to 
Government or the relevant authority specified in the funding agreement.  
 
Air Quality Management Area (AQMA): An area that a local authority has designated for 
action where the national air quality objectives cannot/are not being met.  
 
Agent of Change:  Principle which places the responsibility of mitigating the impact of 
nuisances (including noise) from existing nuisance generating uses on proposed new 
developmen t close by, thereby ensuring that residents and users of the new development are 
protected from nuisances, and existing uses are protected from nuisance complaints. Similarly, 
any new nuisance generating development, for example a music venue, will need to  put in place 
measures to mitigate noise impacts on existing development close by.  
 
Ancient or Veteran Tree: A tree which, because of its age, size and condition, is of exceptional 
biodiversity, cultural or heritage value. All ancient trees are veteran tre es. Not all veteran trees 
are old enough to be ancient, but are old relative to other trees of the same species. Very few 
trees of any species reach the ancient life:stage.   
Regulation 19 (January 2022) – Appendix A (Glossary)  191 
  
Ancient Woodland: An area that has been wooded continuously since at least 1600 AD. It

development rights granted by that Order.  
 
Authority Monitoring Report (AMR): A report that sets out our progress against the Local  
Development Scheme (LDS), which details when and how we will produce new planning 
documents and policies acts as a record of how the District is performing and how much 
development is taking place.  
 
Biodiversity: The variety of plant and animal species in a defined area.  
 
Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG): Increase in the quality and/or quantity of habitats in comparison 
to the original condition or baseline i.e. enhancement over and above the level required to 
mitigate or compensate for detrimental impact, or which is otherwise prescribed or committed to 
happen (e.g . as part of pre:existing planning consent).  
 
Biological Heritage Site (BHS): Local wildlife sites in Lancashire that are identified using a set 
of published guidelines .

comprehensive list of previously developed land suitable for housing development or schemes 
where the predominant land use is housing.  
 
Brownfield Site: A site that has previously been developed o r occupied by a permanent 
structure which is available for redevelopment but does not include garden land. This excludes: 
land that is or has been occupied by agricultural or forestry buildings; land that has been

 Appendix B – Housing Trajectory  
 
  
Regulation 19 (January 2022) – Appendix B (Housing Tra jectory)  202 B.1  The table s and graph below outline  the projected housing trajectory over the plan period 
2021 -2037. Whilst annual projected completions vary against the annual average 
housing requirement, sufficient sites are identified to secure delivery of 447 net 
additional dwellings per annum over the  whole plan period.  
B.2 In the short -term the housing programme is more dependent on the supply of existing 
commitments (see page 229) and previous plan allocations carried forward into this 
Plan. The trajectory includes a 15% lapse rate on committed housi ng sites. The mid -
term to long -term is more reliant upon supply from some of the larger greenfield Growth 
Housing Allocations identified (such as the North East Blackburn Strategic Housing 
Site).

E.1  The Blackburn with Darwen Local  Plan Policy Map show s the location of allocations  and 
policy constraints  relevant to (and referenced within) this Local Plan.  Please note that 
the online version of the Policy Map is the definitive reference map as some constraint 
layers  may alter over ti me (for example Local Wildlife Site or Biological Heritage Site 
updates)  and therefore render any  print version out of date.  An interactive version of t he 
Regulation 19 Local Plan Policy Map is available to view online through the Council’s 
online mapping system : Aurora (statmap.co.uk)75 
 
Constraints – important notes 
E.2 The Local Plan Policy Map shows some key policy constraints that are referenced within 
the Local Plan  written document. However not  all relevant constraints are identified on 
the Policy  Map. For example, constraint layers that may be subject to r egular alterations 
and updates and therefore not shown on the Policy Map include:   
 Listed buildings ;  
 Tree preservation orders ;  
 SSSI consultation zones ; 
 Public Rights of Way;  and 
 Coal Authority High Risk areas . 
These are  provide d via  a separa te planning c onstraints reference map  that sh ould be 
consulted  alongside the Local Plan Policy Map  if you are considered submitting an 
application for development : go to  Planning map | Blackburn with Da rwen Borough 
Council . 
E.3 Further mapping sites from external organisations such as the Flood map for planning  
and the HSE’s Planning Advice Web App  may also need to be consulted to gain a full 
picture of development constrai nts on sites in the Borough.  
E.4 Finally, t he Local Plan Policy Map should be read in conjunction with the Lancashire 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan  Proposals Map, including identified Site Allocations and 
Mineral Safeguarding Areas, for a full picture of the Development Plan for the area.  
E.5 Applicants or developers are advised to consult all these relevant mapping resources 
regularly to ensure that they have the most up to date information at the time of any 
application, and to use the Planning department’s pre -application service to confirm all 
relevant policy constraints prior to any major application.  
Printed Local Plan policy maps  
E.6 For th e purpose s of printing, the Policy Map  splits into five separate sheets:  
 3 A0 maps covering a Blackburn Section , Darwen Section and Rural South Section;  
 2 A2 maps showing Blackburn Town Centre Inset  and Darwen Town Centre Inset  .

  243 H.1  Over previous years t he Council has prepared a number of different types of supporting 
documents to  help support  the planning policies set out in its development plan. These 
are all available to view on the Council’s website  Planning policies, strategies and guides 
| Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council . These documents are material considerations 
in relation to planning decisions  and fall in to two different categories:  
1. Supplementary Planning Documents / Supplementary Guidance Notes (SPD s / 
SPGs) – these have been prepared in accordance with relevant planning 
legislation  in place  at the time  of their preparation. As a result of these d ocuments 
being produced  in accordance with relevant  legal and procedural requirements 
set out in secondary legislation  they carry  the most weight in decision making  and 
have  formal status as SP Ds / SP Gs. 
 
2. Other relevant documents, including Masterplans and  Planning Advice Notes 
(PANs)  – these have not been prepared in accordance with any planning 
legislation and therefore do not carry as much weight in decision -making. They 
are however still important  material considerations in the determination of 
planning  applications.  
H.2  Table  H-1 and Table H-2 confirm  the Council’s intention in terms of the status of  each of 
these  two types of document  after adoption  of the new Local Plan (2021 -2037).  
Proposed new documents are shaded and highlighted in italics for ease of reference.
