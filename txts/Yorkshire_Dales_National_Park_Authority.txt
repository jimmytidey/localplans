Consultation No.2: Exploring our options  
 
AMBITIONS  
 
 
This is the first of three ‘Exploring our options’ consultations des igned to gather your thoughts on  the 
direction of the travel that the new Local Plan should take.  
 
 
Establishing a vision  
 
The new Local Plan will contain a ‘vision ’ and a set of ‘strategic objectives ’ which will guide all development 
that takes place in the National Park during the Plan’s lifetime.  
 
We have already consulted widely on a vision for the National Park a s part of the National Park 
Management Plan, published last year.  It is very important that the Management Plan and the Local Plan 
work in harmony and we believe that the Management Plan’s vision , which has been endorsed by all the 
District Councils,  still holds true:  
 
By 2040, the Yorkshire Dales National Park will be:  
 A distinctive, living, working, cultural landscape that tells the ongoing story of generations of people 
interacting with their environment.  
 A friendly, open and welcoming place with outst anding opportunities to enjoy its special qualities.  
 Home to the finest variety of wildlife in England.  
 Resilient and responsive to the impacts of climate change, storing more carbon each year than it 
produces.  
 Providing an outstanding range of benefits  for the nation based on its natural resources, landscape 
and cultural heritage, which underpin a flourishing local economy.  
 Home to strong, self -reliant and balanced communities with good access to the services they need . 
  
 
Facing up to new challenges  
 
At the same time, we recognise that there have been a whole host of changes in  the planning landscape 
since the last Local Plan was published, and it’ s essential that our  new Plan  is responsive . It may be 
necessary for the new Plan to strengthen its polici es or forge ahead in a new direction to ensure that we 
are addressing these challenge s.  We’ve highlighted some of these below.

We’ve taken your ideas from the ‘Setting the agenda’ consultation , drawn out three of the most critical  
issues and set out three separate approaches for each that the Plan might take.   
 
These are Community sustainability , Carbon futures  and On-farm development .  
 
To help you to consider  which options to go for, we’ve thought about some of the likely impacts of each 
option . These impacts can be positive, negative or neutral, depending on your point of view. We’ve split 
these impacts into categories to make comparison easier . The categorie s are as follows:  
 
  
Impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  
 
  
Impacts on the landscape.  
 
 Impacts on natural capit al* and ecosystem services **. 
 
 
 
  
Impacts on cultural heritage.  
 
 
  
Impacts on tourism and recreation opportu nities for locals and visitors.  
 
 
  
Impacts on access.  
 
 
 Impacts on communities, including on housing, wellbeing and serv ices such as 
shops and schools.  
 
  
Impacts on the local economy.  
 
* Natural capital  describes the world’s stocks of natural assets which include geology, soil, air, water and all living 
things.  
** Ecosystem services  are derived from natural capital and these make human life possible. They include  food, 
water and the plant materials we u se for fuel, building materials and medicines. Other less visible ecosystem services 
include the climate regulation and natural flood defences provided by forests, the billions of tonnes of carbon stored by 
peatlands, or the pollination of crops by insects . Also included are spiritual and cultural services and the benefits 
which nature brings to our wellbeing.

AMBITIONS  
 
 
Community sustainability  
 
These numbers have been taken from the strategic housing market assessment  commissioned by the 
Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority. It is available to view on our website.

level but age imbalance 
remains a factor.  
 
Maintaining population level 
supports  existing services.  
 
Lack of young people 
means that local schools 
may close.   Offers highest level of 
populatio n growth and best 
chance to redress age 
imbalance (as long as young 
people can afford the new 
homes).   
 
Population growth retains 
services and encourages 
creation of new services.   
 Population decline means 
fewer workers and lower 
local spending.  Potential to maintain 
working age population and 
local spending.  
 
Housebuilding supports the 
local construction industry.  More households in the 
Dales means more workers 
and more local spending.

Consultation No. 2: Exploring our options  
 
AMBITIONS  
 
Carbon futures  
 
The chart below shows the ‘production -based’ sources  of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the 
Yorkshire Dales using the most recent data set s available ( 2006 for carbon dioxide; 2008 for methane and 
nitrous oxide). On the basis of national trends, it is likely that carbon dioxide emissions will have fallen by 
around 30% since then . 
 
 
 
 
Total emissions from the National Park are relatively low due to the small population and relative l ack of 
development.  However, emissions per head of population are relatively high. This is  because of the 
distance to services ; high dependency on travel by car, and the relative inefficiency of much of the housing 
stock.  
 
The most significant source of e missions is farming and land management. However, it is also the most 
powerful potential tool for removing  carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – through things like peatland 
restoration, improved soil management, and woodland planting. This is what the fina l column of the chart 
shows. The section on the Future of Farming and Land Management explores how this could be supported 
using different planning policy approaches.  
This section focuses on what contribution the built environment can play in reducing carb on emissions. It is 
worth bearing in mind that national policy has an enormous part to play here.  A new national  ‘Future 
Homes Standard’ is currently being developed, so local planning authorities are discouraged from imposing 
their own energy efficiency standards for new homes. However, this does not stop us exploring how the 
new Local Plan could deliver low carbon futures.

Consultation No. 2: Exploring our options  
 
AMBITIONS  
 
On-farm development  
 
There are  many changes coming to UK farming. Though we don’t know precisely what farming in the Dales 
will look like in the future, we  do need to consider what planning policies will be needed to support the 
sector moving forward  and what impacts these might have . Below are three possible options  for the future 
of farming  in the Dales . The likelihood is that all three will be implemented in  different locations , but by 
asking you to consider how these changes will affect the built landscape we can use this input  to help 
create the most effective policies for the new Local Plan.
