Section 1:  
Introduction
The Local Plan
1.1 All local councils are required to produce an up-to-date local plan for their 
area, to guide the spatial development of the borough over the next 15 years.
1.2 A local plan must achieve sustainable development for the area it covers. As set out in national planning policy, sustainable development has three 
overarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in 
mutually supportive ways (so that opportunities can be taken to secure net 
gains across each of the different objectives):
• an economic objective - to help build a strong, responsive and competitive 
economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in 
the right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and 
improved productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of 
infrastructure;
• a social objective - to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by 
ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to 
meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well-
designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open 
spaces that reflect current and future needs and support communities’ 
health, social and cultural well-being; and
• an environmental objective - to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use 
of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently, 
minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate 
change, including moving to a low carbon economy.
1.3  Lambeth adopted its Local Plan in September 2015 and started work on a 
partial review of this Plan in 2016. 
1.4 This revised Local Plan sets out:
• the national, regional and local policy context (this section)
• the evidence base and a summary of the spatial issues affecting the 
borough (section 2)
• the spatial strategy, vision and strategic objectives to be achieved (section 3)
• the process, mechanisms and policies for delivery and monitoring of the strategy (section 4)Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 1: Introduction T o table of contents3
• borough-wide policies setting out the strategic policy approach with 
supporting development management policy and site allocations where 
required (sections 5 to 10, organised by topic)
• policies (including a limited number of site allocations) for shaping individual 
places and neighbourhoods (section 11). 
1.5 The policies in this revised Local Plan are designed to be read and applied as a whole, alongside the policies in the London Plan. Proposals for development 
should address all relevant policies in both plans, including site allocations 
where relevant. Existing site allocation policies have been retained where still 
relevant in order to:
• add value to the strategic and development management policies
• provide greater clarity and steer about the sort of scheme that is likely to 
be acceptable over and above the assessment required against the other 
policies in the Local Plan
• assist the council’s development management function in its consideration 
of proposals
• secure the delivery of essential infrastructure in some cases.
1.6 Additional site allocation policies will be brought forward in a subsequent Site Allocations Development Plan Document.
1.7 A limited number of supplementary planning documents (SPDs) will elaborate on particular aspects of policy in the Local Plan. These are listed in the Local 
Development Scheme 2019, although others may be brought forward if 
considered necessary at a later date.
The Process
1.8 The revised Local Plan updates the spatial strategy, vision and strategic objectives of the Lambeth Local Plan adopted in September 2015. The 
approach to some policy issues has been reviewed in light of the council’s 
Borough Plan update 2019, new evidence, the publication of the revised 
National Planning Policy Framework in February 2019 and associated Planning 
Practice Guidance, and new the London Plan. 
1.9 Consultation on issues for the partial review of the Lambeth Local Plan took place between October and December 2017. A full Draft Revised Local Plan 
underwent public consultation for an eight-week period between October and 
December 2018. 
1.10 This revised Local Plan has been the subject of ongoing sustainability appraisal during its preparation. The sustainability appraisal includes assessment 
of equalities and health and wellbeing impacts and was published for 
consultation at each stage of the plan preparation process. Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 1: Introduction T o table of contents4
National Planning Policy Framework
1.11 Government sets out national planning policy in the form of the National 
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF February 2019).
1.12 Lambeth’s revised Local Plan only elaborates on national planning policy where this is considered necessary to meet local objectives and achieve 
local distinctiveness. Otherwise, cross-references are made to national 
policy. The NPPF is a material planning consideration in the determination of 
planning applications.
1.13 The revised Local Plan will be examined by an independent inspector whose 
role is to assess whether the plan has been prepared in accordance with 
legal and procedural requirements, and whether it is sound. A ‘sound’ plan 
must be:
• Positively prepared – the plan should provide a strategy which seeks to meet objectively assessed development and is informed by agreements 
with other authorities so that unmet requirements from neighbouring 
authorities is accommodated where it is practical to do so and consistent 
with achieving sustainable development.
• Justified – the plan should be an appropriate strategy, when considered 
against the reasonable alternatives, based on proportionate evidence.
• Effective – the plan should be deliverable over its period and based on effective joint-working on cross-boundary strategic priorities that have been 
dealt with rather than deferred, as evidenced by the statement of common 
ground.
• Consistent with national policy – the plan should enable the delivery of sustainable development in accordance with the policies in the NPPF.
The London Plan
1.14 The London Plan is the spatial development strategy for London, produced by the Greater London Authority on behalf of the Mayor of London. Every London 
borough local plan must be in general conformity with the London Plan. The 
policies in the London Plan and in Lambeth’s Local Plan together constitute 
the statutory local development plan for the London Borough of Lambeth, 
along with neighbourhood development plans once made. 
1.15 As with national policy, Lambeth’s Local Plan only elaborates on London Plan policy where this is considered necessary to meet local objectives and achieve 
local distinctiveness. Otherwise, cross-references are made to London Plan 
policies and these will be applied in addition to the policies in the revised 
Local Plan.
1.16 All references to ‘The London Plan’ in this revised Local Plan relate to the 
London Plan 2021. Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 1: Introduction T o table of contents5
1.17 The objectives of the London Plan are to ensure London achieves good 
growth by:
• building strong and inclusive communities
• making the best use of land
• creating a healthy city
• delivering the homes Londoners need
• growing a good economy
• increasing efficiency and resilience
1.18 In relation to Lambeth, the London Plan:
• requires at least 1,335 net additional homes to be delivered in Lambeth every year between 2019/20 and 2028/29
• requires the borough to contribute to the Mayor’s strategic target of 50 per cent affordable housing 
• designates Waterloo and Vauxhall/Nine Elms/Battersea (now referred to as Nine Elms Vauxhall or NEV) as Opportunity Areas, promoted to 
accommodate both new jobs and new homes with a mixed and intensive 
use of land
• designates the north of the borough as part of the Central Activities Zone, promoted for finance, specialist retail, tourist and cultural uses and activities
• designates the South Bank, along with neighbouring Bankside in Southwark, as a Strategic Cultural Area
• designates a River Thames Policy Area to protect and enhance the special character of the River Thames and Thames-side
• designates Clapham Common, Jubilee Gardens (and part of the adjacent Hungerford car park), Brockwell Park, Streatham Common, Abbotswood 
Road Playing Field and Woodfield Recreation Ground as Metropolitan 
Open Land
• identifies the town centres of Brixton and Streatham as Major Centres, with an additional seven District Centres in Lambeth (of which four cross 
borough boundaries)
• identifies CAZ retail clusters at Waterloo and Vauxhall 
• requires no release of industrial floorspace capacity in Lambeth, although 
intensification is encouraged in defined circumstances
• sets London wide targets for minimising carbon dioxide emissions
• identifies a waste apportionment of 220,000 tonnes per annum by 2041
•  seeks the promotion of tall buildings on suitable sitesLambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 1: Introduction T o table of contents6
• protects strategic views including those of the Palace of Westminster and 
St Paul’s Cathedral.
Neighbourhood Planning
1.19 Neighbourhood plans are an opportunity for local communities to develop additional, area-specific policies that are in general conformity with strategic 
policies. Once made, they form part of Lambeth’s development plan. 
1.20 Lambeth’s first community-led neighbourhood plan has been made (adopted) 
for the South Bank and Waterloo neighbourhood area. Others are coming 
forward in Kennington, Oval and Vauxhall, Tulse Hill and West Norwood. 
There are aspirations to bring forward neighbourhood plans in Herne Hill and 
Upper Norwood. 
Duty to Co-operate
1.21 The Localism Act 2011 and the tests of soundness in the National Planning 
Policy Framework require public bodies, including local authorities, to co-
operate on planning issues that cross administrative boundaries, particularly 
those which relate to strategic priorities such as housing, retail and 
commercial development, infrastructure, climate change and conservation and 
enhancement of the natural and historic environment. 
1.22 Lambeth has borders with the City of London and the London boroughs of Westminster, Southwark, Croydon, Merton, Wandsworth and Bromley. Each 
of these boroughs has its own local plan at various stages of preparation or 
review. Meetings have been held with these boroughs and other public bodies 
periodically, both individually and collectively, to help achieve a full assessment 
of cross-border issues and strategic alignment of objectives and policies. There is a well-established governance framework for NEV, which includes 
the London Borough of Wandsworth. In addition, neighbouring boroughs and 
other public bodies have been formally consulted at each stage of preparation of the Lambeth Local Plan. A Statement of Common Ground has been agreed 
between Lambeth and each of its neighbouring boroughs. 
1.23 Neighbouring boroughs and other public bodies will continue to be actively 
engaged during the delivery and implementation of the revised Lambeth 
Local Plan.
1.24 The key cross-border strategic planning issues affecting Lambeth are:
• the regional and sub-regional housing market affecting housing need and 
supply, within the context of London Plan housing targets
• protected strategic views and setting of the Westminster World Heritage Site and St Paul’s Cathedral in Westminster and the City, which requires 
assessment of impact by development proposed in north Lambeth
• Nine Elms Vauxhall Opportunity Area which is partly in Wandsworth and is 
the subject of a joint Opportunity Area Planning FrameworkLambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 1: Introduction T o table of contents7
• the Central Activities Zone, which spans all or part of several central 
London boroughs
• the status of South Bank/Bankside as a Strategic Cultural Area spanning the border with Southwark
• four district centres (Herne Hill, Lavender Hill/Queenstown Road, Camberwell and Upper Norwood), and one local centre (Clapham South) 
that cross borough boundaries
• a sub-regional labour market which means that Lambeth residents travel 
outside the borough and others travel in to the borough to work. This has 
implications for public transport
• the Overground line from Clapham Junction to north of the river spanning 
Southwark, Lambeth and Wandsworth
• improvements to rail services in south London to improve frequency, capacity and reliability to achieve the objectives of ‘metroisation’ 
• existing and planned strategic bus corridors and cycle routes running through Lambeth and neighbouring boroughs to enable orbital as well as 
radial journeys 
• the planning and management of controlled parking areas and area 
traffic management measures around borough boundaries and parking 
policies in central London which have the potential to attract private motor 
vehicle trips 
• potential extension of the Croydon Tramlink to Crystal Palace 
• the provision of school places which affects pupils travelling across borders to attend schools in neighbouring boroughs, as well as other provision for 
children and young people
• the management of waste arisings, a proportion of which currently travels 
out of Lambeth
• the approach to meeting needs for gypsy and traveller accommodation
• planning for flood risk and mitigating and adapting to climate change 
Strategic and Local Policies
1.25 The NPPF 2019 requires Local Plans to identify which policies are strategic and which are non-strategic, to assist groups preparing neighbourhood 
development plans. All the policies in the London Plan are strategic. In 
addition, many of the policies in the revised Lambeth Local Plan are strategic 
because they contribute to achieving strategic objectives across the borough. 
The strategic and non-strategic policies in the revised Lambeth Local Plan are listed in Annex 11.  T o table of contents8

Evidence Base and Issues 
2.1 This section summarises the evidence base that has informed the 
development the Local Plan. It provides a brief spatial portrait of the borough 
and summarises the key spatial planning issues to be addressed in relation to 
six key themes.
Evidence Base
2.2 The following evidence has been used to develop this strategy:
• statistical data and borough-wide studies
• area based studies and masterplans 
• engagement with service and infrastructure providers
• the baseline review for the sustainability appraisal.
2.3 A full list of evidence base documents is provided in Annex 1. In some cases, evidence in relation to specific aspects of policy has been summarised into 
Topic Papers. These are also listed in Annex 1. 
2.4 References to evidence base documents and Topic Papers are used 
throughout the Local Plan to justify the statements made. 
Spatial Portrait - Lambeth Today
2.5 Lambeth is an inner London borough with a northern boundary on the Thames and situated mainly between the boroughs of Wandsworth and Southwark. 
It covers an area of approximately ten and a half square miles, including 
Waterloo and the South Bank, Vauxhall, the Oval, Kennington, Stockwell, 
Clapham, Brixton, Loughborough Junction, Herne Hill, Streatham, Tulse Hill, 
West Norwood, Gipsy Hill and Upper Norwood/Crystal Palace. The north of the borough has a mix of central London activities, while the south of the 
borough is predominantly suburban in character.
Population
2.6 In common with the rest of inner London, Lambeth’s population has grown 
rapidly in recent years, expanding from a quarter of a million in the 1990s to 
303,100 in 2011 (2011 Census data, ONS). The Greater London Authority 
(GLA) project that the population will grow to over 359,000 by 2035 (Lambeth 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA) 2017). 
2.7 Lambeth is among the most densely populated areas in the country, with 
over 11,300 people per square kilometre. The number of households in the 
borough is projected to grow from 143,655 in 2016 to 172,649 in 2036  T o table of contents10
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contents(Lambeth SHMA). Current household composition includes a high proportion 
of lone parent households with dependent children. One person households, 
in particular, are projected to increase.
2.8 Lambeth is a largely residential borough with many long-term residents. 
Around 80 per cent of the population has been resident in Lambeth for over 
two years and 50 per cent over five years. However, population turnover, or 
‘churn’, is high and is currently estimated at 22-24 per cent every year (State 
of the Borough (SOB) report 2016).
Diversity
2.9 Lambeth has an even more ethnically diverse population than the rest of 
the capital. During the early post World War II period the borough became 
known as an important focus for the Black Caribbean population. It also has 
a growing African population and is the district with the highest proportion 
of Portuguese-born people in the country (Census 2011). New job-seeking 
immigrants continue to settle in Lambeth. The largest group between 2002 and 2011 was from Poland, followed by African countries and Australia 
and New Zealand. More recently, Lambeth has seen significant levels of 
international migration from EU countries affected by the Eurozone crisis, especially from Spain, Italy and Portugal (SOB report 2016). 
2.10 The proportion of white British people in Lambeth decreased from 50 per cent to 39 per cent between 2001 and 2011 (Census data ONS). Lambeth 
ranks in the lowest ten per cent of districts nationwide for the proportion of 
the population that is white British (Census 2011). This is comparable to other 
inner London boroughs.
2.11 Lambeth has a relatively young age profile compared to both the whole 
country and London. A growing number of residents are aged between 
20 and 44 and this group now represents over half of the population (SOB 
2016). Though only eight per cent of people are aged 65 or over, a proportion 
that has been reducing, the number of older people is projected to rise 
(SHMA 2017). 
Deprivation
2.12 The 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) places Lambeth as the eighth most deprived borough in London and 22nd most deprived in England. 
This is an improvement over the position in 2010, but still places Lambeth 
in the top 10 per cent of most deprived local authorities in the country (SOB 
report 2016). 
2.13 Lambeth combines areas of affluence with areas of severe poverty and 
deprivation. The most deprived areas are spread throughout the borough but 
are particularly concentrated in Coldharbour and Vassall wards in Brixton and 
in parts of Knights Hill ward, in the south of the borough. The most affluent 
areas include the Thames-side part of Bishops ward, parts of Clapham and 
the Dulwich border area of Thurlow Park. Thirteen of Lambeth’s super-output  T o table of contents11
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsareas are in the top 10 per cent nationally, which has risen since 2012 when 
only eight areas were in this range (SOB report 2016). 
Housing
2.14 According to Census data, Lambeth’s housing stock is typical of inner London, with a large proportion of flats - 73 per cent in total. Around two-thirds of the 
flats are purpose built and one-third are conversions. A correspondingly small 
proportion, 27 per cent of the stock, are houses (SHMA 2017). Around 67 
per cent of households live in rented accommodation (both social and private 
rented) and 33 per cent own their own home, similar to other inner London boroughs. Seventeen per cent of households rented from the council in 2016, 
down from 29 per cent in 2001.The proportion of private renters increased 
from 18 per cent to 33 per cent during this period (SHMA 2017).
2.15 The average house price in Lambeth in July 2017 was £553,312, which is slightly higher than the average for London but more than double the national 
average (SHMA 2017). The average monthly private rent for a two-bedroom 
property in Lambeth in January 2017 was £1,447, slightly higher than the 
average rent in London (SHMA 2017).
2.16 Average rents in Lambeth equate to 56 per cent of average household 
income, highlighting that the private rented sector is unaffordable to many 
residents. Accordingly, the need for affordable housing in Lambeth is very high 
and there are over 23,000 households on the waiting list for affordable housing 
(SHMA 2017). 
2.17 There are 16 pitches for gypsies and travellers at the Lonesome Way site in 
Streatham Vale. Future need for gypsy and traveller accommodation was 
assessed during 2014 and updated in 2016. 
Economy
2.18 Lambeth is an important part of London’s economy, which has experienced 
growth more strongly than the rest of the UK as a whole. The north of 
Lambeth is an integral part of London’s Central Activities Zone (CAZ), home 
to significant employers and cultural and tourism assets. Further south are a 
series of important town centres including Brixton, Clapham, Streatham and 
West Norwood/Tulse Hill. As well as being an important employment location, Lambeth makes a crucial contribution to London’s economy as a place where 
young, highly skilled people live – over 45 per cent of residents are educated 
to degree level which is comparable with many inner London boroughs (SOB report 2016). 
2.19 The two biggest sectors for employment are human health and social work and administrative and support services. This is linked to the fact that two 
major hospitals – King’s College and St. Thomas’ Hospital are located within 
Lambeth and account for around 16,000 jobs – approximately half of the 
borough’s jobs in health and social work. Almost two-thirds of the jobs in the  T o table of contents12

to buildings and landscape activities (SOB report 2016). 
2.20 The borough has a large proportion of public sector jobs, much higher than those for most other inner London boroughs and consequently a lower share 
of employment is found in professional and business services. However, 
Waterloo and Vauxhall will see a large increase in employment space with 
capacity for 23,000 jobs, much of which will be in office based sectors. 
This coincides with sectors that are expected to grow and will help to offset declining public sector employment in the borough (SOB report 2016). 
2.21 Lambeth’s creative and digital industries sector provides 22,000 jobs and generates £1.8 billion for the economy. This sector includes businesses in 
design and fashion, crafts, creative tech, games, publishing, film and TV and 
advertising. They provide significant support and fuel growth in other parts of 
the economy, such as the visitor and night-time economy, which is one of the 
borough’s strengths (Lambeth Creative and Digital Industry Strategy 2018). 
2.22 The business base in Lambeth is comparatively small but the number of new businesses being created in the borough has increased significantly, with 
1,445 small business enterprises in the borough. Following the national trend, 
self-employment and part-time working have both increased in Lambeth 
and 35,000 Lambeth residents are estimated to be self-employed (Lambeth 
Investment and Opportunity Strategy 2015). 
2.23 Unemployment has fallen dramatically in Lambeth since 2010 and is lower than both the London and national rate. There are 11,500 residents who are 
unemployed; and social housing tenants, BME residents and residents aged 
over 50 are more likely to be unemployed than other residents (Lambeth 
Investment and Opportunity Strategy 2015). 
2.24 Lambeth is facing a period of unprecedented opportunity, and many residents 
have benefited from the economic recovery through rising asset prices and 
a strong labour market. However, there were 7,525 working age residents 
claiming benefits principally for the reason of being unemployed in Lambeth 
in November 2018 (ONS Claimant Count). By far the largest group of out-of-
work benefits claimants are claiming for health reasons, with 12,350 people claiming for Incapacity Benefits in November 2016 (DWP Benefit Claimants – 
working age group). 
2.25 64.4 per cent of working age residents (16-64 year olds) were qualified at 
NVQ Level 4 or above in 2016. 23,700 Lambeth residents qualified at NVQ 
Level 1 or below, totalling 9.7 per cent of working age residents. There is also 
evidence of Lambeth employers facing skills shortages in the local labour pool: 
25 per cent of the job vacancies in Lambeth in 2015 were hard-to-fill due to 
skill-shortages – above both the London (21 per cent) and England (23 per cent) averages (Lambeth Investment and Opportunity Strategy 2015).  T o table of contents13

 T o table of contentsChildren and Young People
2.26 Lambeth has five nursery schools, 62 primary schools and 17 secondary 
schools. There are also five special schools, two pupil referral units and 
five colleges. 
2.27 There was a 19 per cent increase in demand for Reception places in Lambeth 
schools between 2009 and 2014 and Lambeth responded by adding over 500 
permanent Reception places as well as over 800 temporary expansion places 
into schools. Lambeth built, refurbished and redeveloped schools across the 
borough to account for the fast-growing resident population and to meet the 
needs of pupils and the wider community. Overall 2,300 primary places were added during that time, the equivalent of one 1-form-entry and five 2-form-
entry schools. More places are still being added as these expansions proceed 
through the year groups in some areas. Planned additional primary places are proposed to be added in 2021 to Wyvil Primary School in Vauxhall and 
Sudbourne Primary School in Brixton.
2.28 Lambeth has also seen significant expansion of places in recent years for 
secondary provision. Four new academies and free schools were created 
between 2012 and 2014 adding 2,725 secondary places in Years 7-11. Since 
then two schools have permanently expanded and Woodmansterne opened 
a 5 form entry secondary department to become an all-through school. They 
opened to full capacity in September 2019. Durand Academy closed its secondary department in September 2018 bringing the total Year 7 places to 
2,643 in 2019. In addition, 450 additional sixth form places and 165 additional 
Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) places have been created. 
2.29 Around 150 community languages are spoken in Lambeth schools in addition to English; Portuguese and Spanish are the most common of these (SOB 
report 2016). Overall, educational attainment levels in Lambeth’s schools 
continue to improve and are now above the national average in some cases. 
Lambeth has a high rate of young people not in employment, education or 
training (NEET) at 6.4 per cent compared to 5.3 per cent in London as a whole (Department for Education 2017).
Transport 
2.30 Public transport infrastructure in the borough is generally good but while north and central Lambeth benefit from access to Underground services, 
providing fast and frequent connections to central London, in the southern 
part of the borough National Rail links do not provide the same level of 
service or reliability. There are 14 railway stations evenly spread throughout 
the borough and nine Underground stations predominantly in the north. The extension of the Northern underground line to Battersea is under construction 
and will see a new station opened at Nine Elms in 2021. The majority of rail 
and underground services operate at capacity from the central section of the borough, making it difficult to board trains at busy times. There are limited 
public transport options which connect the northern and southern sections 
of Lambeth together and east – west movements are not as well served  T o table of contents14
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsas connections into central London. Many Lambeth residents rely on bus 
services, particularly to access key interchanges such as at Brixton. 
2.31 A significant number of rail and tube stations in Lambeth lack step free access and this is severely detrimental to people with disabilities and others with 
specific access needs. Accessibility at Lambeth’s train stations is graded as 
poor at 8 of the 14 stations and of the nine underground stations, only Brixton 
and Vauxhall are fully step free along with the Jubilee line at Waterloo. 
2.32 Rail services in the borough are split across four franchises, the terms of 
which are set by the Department for Transport; South Western, South Eastern, 
Southern & Thameslink. In addition Transport for London is responsible 
for London Overground and Underground services. Over the past 10 
years growth in passenger numbers has been strong (Lambeth Transport 
Strategy 2019). 
2.33 During peak periods rail services in Lambeth are currently at or over capacity, particularly services from Clapham Junction to Waterloo and Herne Hill to 
Victoria and Blackfriars (Lambeth Transport Strategy Baseline Report 2017). 
Investment is needed to improve conditions for passengers, to provide full 
access to all stations and to enable the planned increases in resident and 
working population. The implementation of Crossrail 2 and metroisation will be required to meet future demand.
2.34 There are many bus routes with major interchanges at Waterloo, Vauxhall and Brixton. Public transport accessibility is good in north and central Lambeth. 
However, residents in Streatham and Norwood are without direct access to 
the underground and are dependent on rail and bus connections. With bus 
routes focussed on the main north-south radial routes into central London 
and a lack of east-west services, some areas of the borough continue to have relatively low levels of accessibility compared to the rest of Lambeth. Buses 
generally provide accessibility for those with disabilities and are therefore 
particularly important for this section of the population as an alternative to reliance on a private car.
2.35 The vast majority of trips made by Lambeth residents are walked, cycled or made by public transport. There is great potential for more walking 
and particularly more cycling in the borough and significantly improved 
infrastructure is required to enable this (Lambeth Transport Strategy 2019). 
The proportion of households with no car or van increased from 51 per cent 
in 2001 to 58 per cent in 2011 (Census data ONS). Traffic congestion is nonetheless an issue that is prevalent in parts of the borough. Average bus 
speeds have suffered in recent years due to congestion and in some parts of 
the borough there are problems with ‘rat running’ where drivers cut through residential areas to avoid congestion on main roads (Lambeth Transport 
Strategy 2019). 
2.36 Lambeth has a low live-and-work ratio: only 15 per cent of the 136,000 
Lambeth residents in employment, live and work in the borough. 87,000 
people commute into the borough and 116,000 commute out of the 
borough. Thirty per cent of borough residents commute to Westminster/City  T o table of contents15
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsof London, 8 per cent to Southwark, 7 per cent to Camden and 6 per cent 
to Wandsworth (Lambeth Transport Strategy 2019). Commuting by different 
modes varies across different parts of the borough with between 55.3 and 
66.9 per cent of commuting trips being made by public transport, which is 
higher than the national average (Transport Strategy Baseline Report 2017). 
2.37 The borough also benefits from river transport, both for passengers and 
transporting freight. There are two Thames Clipper stations in the borough. 
Environment
2.38 The total area of open space in Lambeth is just less than 844 hectares, representing 31 per cent of the area of the borough.
2.39 In 2016, Greenspace Information for Greater London (GiGL) prepared maps of deficiency for three different types of open spaces (local, small and pocket 
parks; district parks; and metropolitan parks) in the borough. This identified 
that around one third of the borough, generally areas focused around large 
open spaces, had sufficient access to the three types of open spaces but 
two per cent of the borough was deficient in access to all categories of open spaces – in locations near King’s College Hospital, Kennington and West 
Norwood (Lambeth Green Infrastructure Strategy 2018).
2.40 Sixteen parks or open spaces were awarded the Green Flag in 2019 in 
recognition of high environmental quality and management and access to the 
community. These are Archbishop’s Park, Brockwell Park, Kennington Park, 
Milkwood Community Park, Myatt’s Fields Park, Ruskin Park, The Rookery 
(Streatham), St. Paul’s Churchyard, Vauxhall Park, St John’s Churchyard, 
Eardley Road Sidings Nature Reserve, Hillside Gardens Park, Palace Road Nature Garden and West Norwood Cemetery. West Norwood Cemetery is the 
only council-owned burial space within the borough. Lambeth Council also 
owns and manages Streatham and Lambeth Cemeteries, both of which are located in the London Borough of Wandsworth.
2.41 Through the Lambeth Biodiversity Action Plan 2019 and the Lambeth Local Wildlife Sites Review 2018, seven priority habitats have been identified for 
the borough, with each habitat incorporating a diversity of priority species 
for London and the UK. There are 49 designated Sites of Importance for 
Nature Conservation (SINCs), including two Metropolitan, 24 Borough and 21 
Local Grade 96 per cent of the borough’s SINCs are or have been in positive conservation management in the five years prior to 2019. 13.8 hectares of 
Streatham Common was designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) in 
January 2013 with another site, Unigate Wood, newly adopted in 2020 and two other candidate sites, Eardley Road Sidings and Palace Road Nature 
Garden, being declared by 2022. 
2.42 Just under a quarter of properties in Lambeth are at risk of tidal flooding, but 
risk is low due to protection from the Thames Barrier. The Thames Estuary 
2100, November 2012 identifies Lambeth within Action Zone 2 – Central 
London. The Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 2013 also identifies spatial 
variation in flood risk from different sources of flooding. The Strategic Flood  T o table of contents16

2.43 The Government publishes national statistics on total final energy consumption at regional and local authority level for four main fuel categories including gas, 
electricity, road transport fuels and residual (non-electricity, non-gas and non-
road transport) fuels. This data shows that in 2017, total energy consumption 
in Lambeth equates to 3.1 per cent of the total energy consumption in 
London and Lambeth ranks 20
th out of the 33 London boroughs. Over the 
period 2007 – 2017 total energy consumption has fallen 14 per cent from 
408.7 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe) to 352.5 ktoe. The domestic 
sector accounts for 45 per cent of consumption in the borough and gas is the 
primary fuel type (over half), though this is reducing. It has been estimated that 
13,864 households in Lambeth are in fuel poverty, representing over 10 per cent of the households in the borough (Department for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy 2019), whereby the household is one which cannot afford to 
keep adequately warm by spending a reasonable proportion of its income).
2.44 In 2017, Lambeth had lower levels of carbon dioxide emissions at 2.8 tonnes per capita than London as a whole (3.4 tonnes) and England (5.1 tonnes) and 
the carbon dioxide emissions continue to fall (Department for Business, Energy 
and Industrial Strategy, June 2019).
2.45 The Government publishes national statistics on UK Local Authority and regional carbon dioxide emissions. This data shows that in 2017, 34 per cent 
(308.8 kt CO
2) of end-user CO2 emissions for Lambeth (excluding emissions 
from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry and those that could not be allocated) were attributed to the industrial and commercial sector, 41 per 
cent (375.3 kt CO
2) to the domestic sector and 25 per cent (226.0 kt CO2) to 
transport. The end-user CO2 emissions for Lambeth has fallen by 36 per cent 
since 2005, from 1,414.1 kt CO2 in 2005 to 909.8 kt CO2 in 2017 (Department 
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, June 2019).
2.46 The whole borough is within an Air Quality Management Area in relation to a breach of nitrogen dioxide (annual mean and hourly mean) and particulate 
matters (daily mean and annual mean) objectives as specified in the Air 
Quality Regulations 2000. Road traffic continues to be the primary cause of 
air pollution in London and in Lambeth the majority of air pollution is caused 
by road vehicles. The Greater London Authority designates Air Quality Focus Areas in London which are areas that have high levels of pollution and 
human exposure. In Lambeth, there are five Focus Areas which lie along 
major transport corridors (A23 from Brixton to Streatham, Kennington Oval/Camberwell New Road (A202)/Kennington Park Road (A3), Vauxhall Cross, 
Clapham Road (A3), Waterloo Road). The other major sources of emissions in 
the borough are from residential and commercial premises (mainly gas boilers) 
and construction sites (dust and machinery emissions) – with emissions from 
construction activities noted to be increasing (Lambeth Air Quality Action Plan 2017-2022). 
2.47 The main types of waste arising in Lambeth are household, business and construction waste. Lambeth produces around 121,000 tonnes of local  T o table of contents17
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsauthority collected waste a year and around 100,000 tonnes of business 
waste. The majority of Lambeth’s waste is exported to facilities within London 
in the first instances (Lambeth Waste Evidence Base 2019). The London-wide 
recycling target is 50 per cent by 2025. By achieving a 37 per cent household 
recycling rate and 60 per cent recycling rate of local authority collected 
commercial waste, Lambeth plans to achieve a 44 per cent Local Authority Collected Municipal Waste recycling rate by 2025 (Lambeth Municipal Waste 
Management Strategy 2011 – 2031). Lambeth’s current recycling rate for 
2018/19 was 23.7 per cent. 
Built heritage
2.48 Lambeth has approximately 2,500 listed buildings. The vast majority of these are residential properties erected between 1800 and 1850; they are 
generally in good condition. Typically two or three structures are added to the 
statutory list each year. There are 62 conservation areas in Lambeth covering 
approximately 30 per cent of the borough. Although largely residential in 
character, some cover town centres. Lambeth Palace and its environs are of particular significance, as are The South Bank, characterised by post-war 
cultural and civic buildings, and West Norwood Cemetery. Some have been 
subject to much investment and refurbishment. Others have been subject to a very gradual erosion of historic detailing through incremental change over 
many years. However, it should be noted that the character of some was 
already in a relatively eroded state at the time of designation - the objective 
at that time being their enhancement. The borough also has eight registered 
parks and gardens; two of which are private. Statutory listed buildings, conservation areas and registered parks and gardens are designated 
heritage assets. 
2.49 A local heritage list of buildings, designed spaces and archaeological priority 
areas was established in 2010 with a priority being placed on the identification 
of properties outside conservation areas. This list was last updated in 2017 
and will continue to be expanded and updated. Assets on the local heritage 
list are non-designated heritage assets.
2.50 Heritage assets, both designated and non-designated, are exceptionally 
important across Lambeth. They are our most recognisable landmarks and 
most cherished places - they contribute in very great part to reinforcing 
Lambeth’s local distinctiveness as part of the wider city. The range of 
significant buildings and places and the uses they contain create a unique 
and very distinctive sense of place which is what attracts residents, visitors and investors alike to Lambeth. In this respect their contribution to the local 
economy and to the perception of Lambeth as a place is significant.
Health and social care
2.51 Lambeth fares comparatively worse for health inequalities when compared 
to national rates. The burden of ill-health results from lifestyle issues as well 
as resulting diseases and/or long-term conditions such as heart disease  T o table of contents18
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsand cancer. Life expectancy in Lambeth has improved over time but the 
improvement has slowed down since 2010-2012. Male life expectancy is 
around a year lower than the national average at 78.7 years whereas female 
life expectancy is 0.4 higher than the national average at 83.5 years. In 
Lambeth male life expectancy is 4.8 years shorter than female life expectancy. 
However, in some of the most deprived areas in Lambeth, life expectancy is 5.5 years shorter for men and 3.7 years shorter for women when compared 
with the borough’s least deprived areas. This reflects the significant adverse 
effect of poverty and deprivation on health. 
2.52 Conditions that contribute to Lambeth’s lower (when compared against England) life expectancy include mainly circulatory diseases such as coronary 
heart disease and stroke; cancer (especially lung cancer); respiratory diseases 
(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); digestive diseases such as cirrhosis 
of the liver; and external causes such as suicide and violence in men (Joint 
Strategic Needs Assessment 2019 – 2020). The gap in life expectancy in Lambeth is due to an excess of deaths from circulatory diseases, cancers and 
respiratory diseases (Joint Strategic Needs Assessment 2019 – 2020).
2.53 The five most common causes of death in Lambeth are heart disease, 
dementia, lung cancer, chronic airways disease and lower respiratory 
infections. When this takes into account the age of death the main causes 
are heart disease, lung cancer, chronic airways disease, dementia and lower 
respiratory infections. The five most common conditions that people are living 
with include low back pain, migraine, neck pain, major depression and falls. However people often have more than one condition that they are living with. 
2.54 Preventable risk factors attributable to these deaths and conditions include smoking, obesity, dietary risks, alcohol use, high blood sugars, high blood 
pressure and drug use. 1.7 per cent of Lambeth’s population are dependent 
on alcohol compared to the national average of 1.4 per cent. Levels of sexually 
transmitted infections are also high. Obesity is a growing problem among 
children and young people in the borough (Joint Strategic Needs Assessment 2019 – 2020).
2.55 There are a growing number of people with learning disabilities living in the borough (estimated at 6,462 in 2019, projected to reach 7,016 people by 
2035). The proportions of people with mental health problems and with 
physical disabilities and older people helped to live at home are increasing. 
One-third of those aged 65+ is estimated to live alone. The number of those 
aged over 85 is expected to increase which will significantly increase age-related long-term conditions and demand for care services. This includes 
some people with enduring mental health needs who will become part of the 
ageing population, with particular housing needs.
2.56 Lambeth has a lower birth rate compared to London and England. Over the last five years the birth rate in Lambeth has been reducing (from 56 per 1000 
female in 2012 to 49 per 1000 female in 2017). The infant mortality rate (death 
in babies under 1 year) has decreased steadily in Lambeth but this has slowed 
recently and the latest data shows a slight increase of 4.7 deaths per 1,000  T o table of contents19
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentslive births, compared to 3.3 deaths per 1000 in London and 3.9 deaths per 
1000 in England (Lambeth Public Health Figures 2019). 
2.57 Lambeth Together is the council’s ambitious plan to put in place a new health and social care system for Lambeth. This will make services better and easier 
to access for everyone who lives or works in the borough and will help the 
population achieve better wellbeing for decades to come. Organisations 
include public bodies (including the council, NHS Lambeth CCG and South 
London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust), voluntary bodies (including Thames Reach and Certitude) and community groups. The Lambeth Public 
Health Directorate now sits within the council. 
Community Safety
2.58 Crime reduction and public safety are among the top concerns of Lambeth 
residents (SOB 2016). 
2.59 Crime and disorder in Lambeth has been reducing on an annual basis within a range of 2 – 4 per cent, however from 2017/18 Lambeth experienced the 
most significant reduction of 34 per cent. This is the biggest reduction in Total 
Notifiable Offences (TNOs) (all offences which are statutorily notifiable to the 
Home Office) in the last four years. Although Lambeth is ranked 5th highest for 
TNOs in London, this is an improvement from being 3rd in 2017. 
2.60 Knife crime offences experienced an unprecedented increase in 2017/18, although this had reduced by 50 per cent by September 2018. Lambeth is 
ranked 10th highest in London for this type of offence which is a reduction 
from being 3rd highest in London from the last reporting period. However, 
Lambeth’s gun crime offences have increased by 5 per cent from 2017/18 
to 2018/19. 
2.61 From 2017/18 to 2019/20 there has been a 38 per cent reduction in Serious Youth Violence offences in Lambeth. Lambeth has historically been in the top 
five offending London boroughs for Serious Youth Violence but is now ranked 
8th in London. 
2.62 Robbery has declined from 2017/18 by 36 per cent and decreased by a further two per cent in 2019. Lambeth is ranked 11th in London for robbery 
offences, an improvement from being ranked the 9th highest offending 
borough for robberies. Burglary has decreased by 32 per cent, the highest 
decrease in the last four years, but Lambeth frequently ranks in the top 10 
offending boroughs for burglary, appearing in the top ten three years running. 
Summary of Spatial Planning Issues 
2.63 Drawing on the evidence base and the many issues raised through public consultation since 2011, the spatial planning issues affecting Lambeth can 
be summarised under the following six key themes:
A. Accommodating population growth
B. Achieving economic prosperity and opportunity for all  T o table of contents20
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsC. Tackling and adapting to climate change 
D. Providing essential infrastructure
E. Promoting community cohesion and safe, liveable, inclusive 
neighbourhoods
F. Creating and maintaining attractive, distinctive places
 Each of these themes is explained more fully below.
A. Accommodating population growth
2.64 Lambeth is the fifth most densely populated local authority in England (SOB 2016) and there is very limited additional land available for new development. 
There is a high degree of competition for this land to meet different needs, 
including for the essential infrastructure to service the growing population. 
2.65 The Mayor has identified in the London Plan that there is a housing crisis across London, as housing supply has not kept up with identified needs. The 
housing crisis is apparent in Lambeth and demand for housing continues 
to increase, caused by factors such as population growth, current Lambeth 
children growing up and forming new households and existing households 
breaking up into smaller units. A mix of housing types and tenures will be required to meet the range of local housing needs (SHMA 2017). 
2.66 Affordability is a major challenge in Lambeth, where the entry level price for housing is very high in relation to average household income and average 
rents represent over half of a household’s income. Although there is already 
a large stock of social housing in Lambeth, there is little movement within 
this. Consequently there are over 23,000 households on the waiting list for 
affordable housing. Based on households spending 40 per cent of their gross income on rent, 1,047 affordable homes are needed annually to meet needs. 
The annual need for affordable homes would be 1,573 based on households 
spending 30 per cent of their gross income (SHMA 2017). 
2.67 The Welfare Reform Act 2012 introduced major changes to the calculation and entitlement to housing benefit, which have had a significant impact on the 
affordability of housing for some residents. The Lambeth Housing Strategy 
(2017) recognises that affordability is an issue and identifies the priorities of 
increasing the provision of family housing and ensuring the needs of vulnerable 
groups and those with social care needs (young people, old people, those with mental health issues and people sleeping rough) are met. 
2.68 The private rented sector is the largest source of housing for people who are not eligible for social rented housing and cannot afford to buy. According to 
the Census, 38,113 households in Lambeth rent privately, nearly a third of 
which are families with children, and the private rented sector is now estimated 
to represent 33 per cent of Lambeth’s housing stock (SHMA 2017). The 
council wants to ensure that the options for private renters improve with better management and more secure tenancies (Lambeth Housing Strategy 2017).  T o table of contents21
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsHouse prices and rent levels mean that households on low to middle incomes 
often have difficulty buying or renting in the private sector in Lambeth. 
B. Achieving economic prosperity and opportunity for all
2.69 In 2016 the council agreed a new Community Strategy known as ‘Future Lambeth – our Borough Plan 2016 – 2021’. This was updated in 2019 to 
reflect the changing context in which the public sector is operating. Over the 
coming years the council and its partners will increasingly focus on creating an 
economically, socially and environmentally sustainable borough by:
• Enabling growth and development in the borough
• Using the benefits of that growth to build community resilience
• Reforming the way the council commissions and delivers services with its 
partners to provide and promote care and independence 
• Making Lambeth a place where people want to live, work and invest 
2.70 The borough benefits from a unique mix of economic assets in the borough which include: 
• internationally recognised locations (Waterloo, the South Bank, the Thames, Vauxhall and Brixton)
• London’s most significant agglomeration of cultural facilities at the South Bank
• Europe’s busiest station terminal (Waterloo) with excellent connectivity over most of south London and London’s commuter hinterland, and an 
immediately surrounding area of development opportunity
• Thames-side locations with development potential and easy access to the 
West End and many of London’s key tourist destinations
• part of one of London’s largest opportunity areas which is already delivering growth (Nine Elms Vauxhall)
• one of London’s most distinctive and recognisable town centres in Brixton
• King’s College London and two of London’s largest teaching hospitals
• successful and strongly performing industrial locations (Key Industrial and Business Areas)
• established mechanisms to support people into employment and enterprise
• emerging sector specialisms, such as those in the creative and digital industries 
• an established and well-defined mix of residential locations distributed across the borough
• a high proportion of skilled residents compared to other inner London locations. T o table of contents22
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contents2.71 In order to drive growth in Lambeth, it is necessary to capitalise on these 
comparative advantages. However, it is important that economic growth 
and the benefits this brings for residents and businesses are realised across 
Lambeth, not just in the north of the borough, and that everyone is given an 
opportunity to participate.
2.72 Lambeth’s future sectoral growth will in large part be linked to that of 
London. Across London employment growth is projected to be the highest 
in the professional and technical sector, which will be served well by new 
development in Vauxhall and Waterloo (Investment and Opportunity Strategy 
2015). The number of people employed in the Creative and Digital Industries 
(CDI), which includes businesses related to art, design, architecture and media, is also expected to increase (Lambeth CDI Study 2017). The number 
of public sector jobs is expected to fall in Lambeth (Lambeth Borough Plan 
update 2019). 
2.73 Demand for premises to support this growth will vary enormously. Although continued growth is likely to be driven in part by companies who traditionally 
demand office space, the spatial demands of these companies is likely to 
change. Work patterns are becoming more fluid and flexible, particularly 
with the rise of technology, resulting in more efficiently utilised employment 
space and higher employment densities. As well as having the space to create a new generation of commercial accommodation in the north of the 
borough, Lambeth will also need to ensure that the right amount of flexible and 
affordable business space exists to support flexibility for small businesses and new entrepreneurs, including those in the CDI sector. 
2.74 The challenge is to build upon success in delivering workspace for small and medium enterprises and new start-ups and continue to ensure there is 
a strong supply of new, relevant and affordable space for small businesses, 
including move-on space. There is potential for new flexible business space 
in the vicinity of transport nodes which could provide a useful means of 
stimulating growth within the business community.
2.75 Lambeth’s 31 Key Industrial and Business Areas represent the borough’s strategic stock of land for industrial uses. They are well-occupied and provide 
land for lower value uses, support functions and the growing low-carbon 
economy (including waste management), as well as growth sectors such as 
the creative and digital industries and food preparation and distribution (see 
Annex 3 for a full list) (Review of KIBAs 2019).
2.76 The London Plan Opportunity Areas of Waterloo and Vauxhall present continued potential for commercial development and jobs growth in the 
borough, alongside their potential to provide new housing. Waterloo is a 
major office location, one of the capital’s most successful tourist areas and 
an international centre for culture and the arts. Vauxhall is undergoing rapid 
change linked to the wider regeneration of Battersea/Nine Elms. Both areas can make an even greater contribution to the central London economy than 
they already do, if they are planned and managed effectively as part of the 
London Plan Central Activities Zone, in partnership with key stakeholders.  T o table of contents23
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contents2.77 However, this will not happen unless the capacity of the public transport 
infrastructure servicing these areas also grows at a sufficient rate to meet 
the increased demand generated by new development. Although both areas 
are served by major transport interchange, these are already operating at 
capacity. Major developers will be expected to contribute to meeting the 
cost of increasing capacity in order to mitigate the impact of their schemes. This will be alongside significant public sector investment (Vauxhall Area SPD 
2013). The new Nine Elms Station in Lambeth that will bring the Northern 
line to the Vauxhall area will improve transport connections and open up a range of opportunities for the borough’s residents and businesses that would 
not otherwise come forward. Developers providing new jobs will also be 
expected to contribute to programmes of support for Lambeth’s unemployed 
or economically inactive residents, so that their chances of accessing these 
opportunities increase. 
2.78 Lambeth’s hierarchy of town centres presents another significant opportunity (see Annex 2 for a full list of centres in the borough). This includes recognising 
the significance of Waterloo and South Bank as an Opportunity Area (in the 
London Plan) and Central Activities Zone (CAZ) retail cluster. New shops, 
services and food and drink businesses need to be located in a way that 
supports rather than undermines Lambeth’s existing town centres, and in areas of high public transport accessibility. Maintaining active street frontages 
and an appropriate mix of ground-floor uses are priorities, along with the 
need to maintain and improve the environment, public realm and community safety. The evening economy presents a significant opportunity for economic 
growth and place-making, but its impacts need to be mitigated and carefully 
managed. The impact of betting shops, pawn-brokers and ‘money shops’ on 
town centre vitality, crime levels and public health is another issue.
2.79 Lambeth’s two major centres, Brixton and Streatham, have significant 
potential for new commercial and residential development, supported by 
an independent retail and cultural offer and a significant creative and digital 
industries sector in the case of Brixton. This will help to consolidate its role 
as one of London’s most distinctive town centres and a model for integrated 
town centre development. In Streatham, the priority is to diversify the retail offer to develop a more resilient town centre alongside an increased office and 
leisure provision. The Streatham Hub development has made a significant 
contribution but there is still a need to support local small businesses to achieve their aspirations and to increase the amount of office floorspace and 
workspace for creative and digital industries.
2.80 Some of Lambeth’s district centres are thriving, such as Clapham High Street. 
Others require carefully planned intervention to support their economic future, 
such as West Norwood/Tulse Hill, in place of town centre uses along the 
southern part of Norwood High Street. Lambeth’s local centres and street 
markets need strong protection given the essential contribution they make to 
neighbourhoods and communities, to local distinctiveness and to reducing the need to travel.  T o table of contents24
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contents2.81 Underpinning the Local Plan is the need to maximise the contribution of 
Lambeth’s limited employment land resources to job creation in the borough. 
2.82 Young people leaving education can face specific challenges in accessing employment. The rate of youth unemployment is above the London average 
in Lambeth, and with a smaller proportion of jobs requiring low levels of 
qualifications or experience, competition for entry level jobs in London is 
particularly fierce. 
2.83 The jobs being created in London are increasingly requiring higher levels 
of skills, placing an ever greater emphasis on the need for high levels of 
qualifications amongst Lambeth residents. High competition for jobs makes it 
particularly difficult for residents with low or no qualifications to find work.
C. Tackling and adapting to climate change
2.84 Climate change is an increasingly high priority for Lambeth residents as well as in European, national, regional and local policy. National legislation requires 
all greenhouse gas emissions to be net zero by 2050, compared with the 
previous target of at least 80 per cent reduction from 1990 levels. This is 
reflected in the London Plan. In January 2019, the council declared a climate 
emergency and in July 2019 it agreed a corporate carbon reduction plan to achieve net zero carbon for council operations by 2030. The council is also 
developing a wider Lambeth climate change response plan to be published in 
2020 and will be engaging widely, including through a Citizens’ Assembly. This requires approaches which contribute to tackling (or mitigating) climate change 
on the one hand, and to adapting to its effects on the other. This is important 
to maintain energy security, reduce fuel poverty and address the unequal 
effects of climate change on the most vulnerable communities. 
2.85 There are a number of ways in which Lambeth can make a contribution to 
mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The most important of these is 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to programmes to promote 
changes in the behaviour of individuals, businesses and public services, 
this will involve a growing emphasis on the following measures: engaging 
with appropriate partners to identify relevant local approaches to climate change; reducing the need to travel by meeting needs locally and investing 
in digital connectivity; promoting alternatives to the private car, including 
public transport, walking and cycling; increased use of the River Thames for transport of passengers and freight; the sustainable design and construction 
of buildings; the appropriate reuse of existing buildings in recognition of their 
‘embodied energy’; retrofitting existing buildings to achieve greater energy 
efficiency; renewable energy production through micro-generation and solar 
technologies; provision for and maximising connection to decentralised energy and heating; promoting design responses to flood risk, water efficiency and 
quality; safeguarding allotments and encouraging small-scale local food 
production on other appropriate sites; retaining existing trees and promoting 
further tree planting, urban greening, multi-functional green infrastructure and 
biodiversity-rich gardens; and reducing the amount of waste going to landfill.  T o table of contents25
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contents2.86 Waste is an increasingly significant resource which needs to be managed 
sustainably through the hierarchy of reduce, reuse and recycle. This will enable 
the reuse of scarce resources through recycling and composting. Waste can 
also be used to generate energy in some cases; all of Lambeth’s residual 
municipal waste is now transformed into energy at the Belvedere facility in the 
London Borough of Bexley. 
2.87 Lambeth is working with its residents and businesses to reduce the quantity of waste they produce and reuse and recycle as much of it as possible. However, 
as the population increases the quantity of waste produced in Lambeth will 
continue to rise. In addition, Lambeth is required by the London Plan to find 
additional land for sustainable waste management use in order to meet its 
share of London’s future waste management requirements. 
2.88 Measures to reduce carbon emissions can have positive impacts on other issues affecting Lambeth. More energy efficient buildings and micro- 
generation will make a significant contribution to reducing fuel poverty and 
deprivation. Recognising the ‘embodied energy’ in existing buildings helps to 
support the conservation of existing built heritage. The new ‘green industries’ 
are a growth sector covering construction, energy and waste management that will bring new jobs opportunities and skills for local people, including 
through social enterprise. 
2.89 Encouraging walking and cycling as alternatives to car use contributes 
to healthy lifestyles and helps to prevent obesity. Less car use increases 
road safety and reduces air pollution, which also have health benefits. 
Fewer parked cars frees up land for other uses for which there is a high 
demand, including housing, commercial floorspace, community facilities and 
essential infrastructure. Reduced lorry movements through increased use of river transport result in similar benefits. The contribution of electrically-
powered vehicles to reducing CO
2 emissions and improving air quality is also 
acknowledged, with implications for provision of charging points across the borough. However, there will still be a need for an appropriate level of car use 
for those with mobility difficulties, servicing local businesses and providing 
essential local services (such as GPs and nursing teams).
2.90 Maintaining and increasing biodiversity within Lambeth’s network of open 
spaces and along the river foreshore is also critical, both in tackling climate 
change and in monitoring its impact. Lambeth’s wildlife habitats and its natural 
environment need safeguarding and enhancing. This includes the significant 
contribution made by back gardens in residential properties and by the existing 
mature tree stock.
2.91 Adaptation to climate change is equally significant as rainfall levels become less predictable, extreme weather events and heat-waves more frequent, and 
flood risk more likely. Managing flood risk is a particular challenge, and can 
particularly affect vulnerable groups such as the elderly. A large part of the 
north of the borough is located within the highest flood risk zone (level 3a). 
The principal risk in this area is from tidal flooding of the River Thames. The floodplain is defended by the Thames Barrier and built flood defences, but it 
is necessary to manage the residual risk of flooding and take further action to  T o table of contents26
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsreduce the risk of flooding (now or in the future) (TE2100, Nov 2012). There is 
an additional risk of fluvial flooding close to the River Graveney in the south of 
the borough. Further risks arise across the borough from sewer and surface 
water flooding (Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 2013 and Addendum 2018). 
2.92 Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) are an effective method of dealing with excessive surface water run-off following heavy rainfall. These 
include measures to achieve urban greening such as green roofs, retention of 
existing trees, tree planting, living walls, new areas of ground-cover planting, 
resisting the paving over of front gardens, ‘re-greening’ those that have already 
been paved over and installation of rain gardens, all of which help to absorb excess water. Urban greening also provides extended natural habitats for 
wildlife and helps to reduce the growing ‘heat-island effect’ by absorbing heat 
and providing natural shade. 
2.93 Rainwater collection and reuse of grey water are additional effective ways to manage water resources in an urban environment, alongside the more 
extensive infrastructure requirements of Thames Water. These include the 
proposed Thames Tideway Tunnel to deal with London’s current sewage 
effluent into the Thames at times of high rainfall. Finally, water quality is 
an issue as it can be affected by previously contaminated land causing contamination of local aquifers. 
D. Providing essential infrastructure
2.94 Lambeth’s future housing growth, economic development and environmental sustainability cannot be achieved without a wide array of essential 
infrastructure provided by a combination of council run services, partner 
statutory agencies and private sector companies. 
2.95 The Infrastructure Delivery Plan provides a list of infrastructure necessary to be provided to deliver growth, the agencies responsible for their delivery and their 
current infrastructure strategies or programmes.
2.96 Some areas of infrastructure provision are particularly critical over the next 15 
years because they are already subject to considerable pressure for resources 
and/or additional land and facilities are required in order to support projected 
population and economic growth. These include public transport, school 
places, parks and open spaces, utilities and health and social care services. 
2.97 As already highlighted under section B above, it will not be possible to 
achieve the significant levels of housing and economic growth set out in 
the Local Plan without the supporting transport infrastructure required for 
people to travel to and from work, shops and leisure destinations. Existing 
public transport in Lambeth is already very well used and over capacity in 
some cases, and current improvements will not achieve the level of capacity increase that is needed. Public transport accessibility also varies, with some 
parts of the borough – particularly in the south – quite poorly served. Overall, 
radial transport (into the centre of London) is better in Lambeth than orbital transport (east-west). Investment in station capacity, track layouts and 
signalling improvements as part of the ‘metroisation’ of rail services is required  T o table of contents27
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsto support the transport infrastructure capacity needed in the borough. 
Improved sustainable transport links will also help to reduce borough wide 
carbon emissions.
2.98 Following the recent expansion of school places, and taking account of 
additional planned provision, the council has a sufficient supply of school 
places to meet future primary, secondary and sixth form education needs to at 
least 2025/26. This position will be monitored through the annual pupil place 
planning process. 
2.99 In further education, the support for and creation of regional centres of 
excellence within high-quality educational buildings is required in order to 
attract investment and talent to the borough. Lambeth College is the largest 
provider of adult and community learning in the borough. It has recently 
become a member of the London South Bank University group of educational 
providers and is reviewing its plans to redevelop its estate.
2.100  The configuration of health and social care facilities is undergoing considerable change across London to meet the current and future needs of the growing 
population, the challenges of high population turnover and the requirements 
of modern service delivery. This includes additional GP provision and the 
reconfiguration of the Kings College Hospital, Guy’s and St Thomas’ and 
South London and Maudsley NHS Trust estates to ensure future requirements are met. 
2.101  Lambeth has many highly valued areas of open space (see Annex 5 for the list of the most significant Metropolitan Open Land, district and local open 
spaces) but residents in some parts of the borough are deficient in access 
to multiple types of open space. With the planned population increase, 
pressures on open space will become even more intense across the borough. 
The same will be true of burial space in the borough. Existing open space (including burial space) therefore needs to be safeguarded and its quality and 
access improved. There are very limited opportunities to create new public 
open space in the borough; one is the extension to Jubilee Gardens. Existing open spaces can be linked and other opportunities may arise through the 
redevelopment of major sites, such as the new green spine in Vauxhall/Nine 
Elms. Growing levels of usage places increasing demands on the management 
and maintenance of these valued spaces. 
2.102  Green Infrastructure is a multifunctional resource capable of delivering a wide 
range of environmental and quality of life benefits for local communities, such 
as climate change adaptation (flood alleviation and cooling urban heat-islands), 
space and habitat for wildlife and improvements to health and wellbeing. 
2.103  A general theme running through many partners’ infrastructure programmes – particularly in the public services - is the trend towards neighbourhood-
based service delivery. Neighbourhood community facilities need increasingly 
to accommodate services promoting health and wellbeing, housing support, 
adult learning, skills training, English language tuition, employment support, 
childcare, play, youth provision, and community policing, for example.  T o table of contents28
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contents2.104  This presents a unique opportunity to co-locate services within 
neighbourhoods through a co-ordinated partnership approach and to achieve 
a significant improvement to the strength and cohesiveness of communities 
as a result. The co-location of services within neighbourhoods can optimise 
use of facilities, minimise the need to travel (where it is not essential to deliver 
specialist services more centrally) and maximise opportunities for social networking and integration. This includes the co-location of services with local 
shops and community meeting spaces, and the dual use of facilities such as 
the use of school premises after hours. 
2.105  Digital technology is increasingly important for people to communicate and collect information and its use is likely to further increase. Investment in the 
latest digital infrastructure will therefore be necessary to support businesses, 
visitors and residents and the council is working with partners to deliver free 
borough-wide Wi-Fi and improved network coverage. 
E. Promoting community cohesion and safe, liveable, accessible neighbourhoods
2.106  Alongside planning for housing, jobs, climate change and infrastructure, 
the Local Plan’s key priority is to maintain and develop safe, liveable and 
accessible neighbourhoods in accordance with the Mayor’s Accessible 
London Supplementary Planning Guidance. Many of Lambeth’s 
neighbourhoods are already known and valued for their mixed communities 
that include both young and old, people with and without disabilities, a variety of income levels and the full range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The 
‘lifetime’ neighbourhoods of the future need to maintain and improve this mix 
while providing high-quality, well-serviced residential environments with a sense of place, in which people and families wish to settle and prosper.
2.107  At present, some communities feel that their neighbourhoods lack stability and that not enough households stay long enough to put down roots and 
contribute positively to community life. Residents in some parts of the 
borough feel particularly strongly that families are an essential part of a stable 
community and that the loss of family housing to conversions is damaging 
this. There is also a growing issue, particularly in the north of the borough, with homes that are bought primarily as an investment or second home, rather than 
for every-day occupation. 
2.108  A number of Lambeth’s neighbourhoods are currently struggling with high 
levels of ill-health (including mental ill-health), educational under-achievement, 
child poverty, worklessness, crime and fear of crime, gang-related and youth 
violence and anti-social behaviour. In addition, large parts of the borough are 
identified as Strategic Areas of Regeneration in the London Plan which are 
areas that fall within the most 20 per cent most deprived areas in England, according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (see Annex 13). These multiple 
problems are frequently (although not always) concentrated on existing social 
housing estates and this concentration of problems can create numerous barriers for individuals, families and communities wishing to make positive 
changes to their lives. Lambeth is bringing forward an ambitious programme to  T o table of contents29
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsrenew its own housing stock and implement the Lambeth Housing Standard; 
and to deliver 1,000 new homes at council rents through Homes for Lambeth.
2.109  In order to become strong, safe, healthy and self-reliant, communities need local spaces that can accommodate a wide range of community activity. 
This is particularly true in Lambeth, which is home to such diverse groups. 
Community activity contributes positively to community cohesion and 
wellbeing and can include active citizenship and volunteering, activities and 
meeting space for young people, parenting support, projects to prevent social isolation among the elderly and vulnerable and among people recently arrived 
in the borough, social events, cultural, cross-cultural and inter-generational 
activity, community group meetings, social enterprise and enterprise start-up, internet access, interest in co-housing and the aspiration for community 
gardens and local food production. Above all, communities need local 
spaces that allow informal day-to-day contact and social interaction among 
their members that are equally accessible to all users irrespective of mobility 
or disability.
2.110  There is already a wide range of community facilities across Lambeth that can help to meet these needs, including parks, open spaces, play areas, 
allotments, community gardens, customer centres, community centres, day 
care centres, nurseries, children’s centres, youth centres, local schools with 
extended opening hours, faith buildings (such as churches, church halls and 
mosques), libraries, leisure centres, pubs, cafes, post offices, post boxes and local shops. There is potential for investment in and consolidation of some 
facilities to improve the quality and distribution of provision. Faith groups may 
continue to need support in finding appropriate premises in the borough.
2.111  Community, play and youth facilities, libraries, and meeting spaces are therefore an essential part of the social infrastructure required by 
neighbourhoods. In some cases, where they are lacking, these can be 
provided alongside essential services and as part of a multifunctional local 
centre. The secondary and primary school programmes are seeking to 
enhance the facilities available to community users, with all recent new school sites and buildings being designed for use by the community out of school 
hours, and future developments will also carry this requirement.
2.112  Lambeth currently offers a good range of play facilities with recent 
improvements made in a number of cases. As the population of the borough 
increases, access to quality play provision will become an increasing priority 
across the borough as a whole. 
2.113  An additional, critical feature of strong neighbourhoods is community safety. People who live in, work in or visit the borough have a right to expect that they 
can move about without unreasonable concern for their safety and can feel 
safe in their homes. Opportunities for crime and criminal behaviour can be 
prevented through the design of buildings and the public realm, as can the risk 
of fire. It is also important to address communities’ fear of crime because this influences the way people behave and interact in public spaces. This involves 
designing the urban environment in a way that enables communities to ‘own’ 
and take pride in their local spaces. To achieve this, the council will work  T o table of contents30
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contentsin partnership with Metropolitan Police Designing Out Crime officers using 
Secured by Design principles. 
2.114  Another element of community safety is resilience to terrorism. This is a key issue for Lambeth as the borough contains part of the government’s Security 
Zone on the South Bank and some of south London’s major transport hubs, 
and there is a history of terrorist incidents and attempts in the borough in 
recent years.
F. Creating and maintaining attractive, distinctive places 
2.115  Lambeth needs to shape and maintain distinctive places across the borough, 
drawing on each community’s heritage and contributing to the development of 
local community identity and to quality of life. 
2.116  Lambeth has many heritage assets which play a significant role in creating a 
local sense of place, but many of these are currently under-used. Distinctive 
places can be shaped through investment in the historic built and natural 
environment and cherished local landmarks, alongside excellent new design 
in buildings, public spaces and art in the public realm, to provide a unique 
environment of which Lambeth’s communities can be proud and which will attract new businesses and visitors. New design can draw on Lambeth’s 
cultural diversity. 
2.117  Place-shaping will need to take place in the context of Lambeth’s listed 
buildings, conservation areas, protected strategic views (see Annex 6), 
local views and landmarks, historic registered parks and gardens and 
archaeological priority zones. 
2.118  The River Thames is a key local and regional asset, used and valued equally by local communities, workers and visitors, and flora and fauna. Access to 
the river for water-based uses and the Thames riverside path contribute to the 
enjoyment of the river. Lambeth’s riverside is increasingly used to celebrate 
public events, often using the River Thames as a London focus. The river, 
with its piers, is also increasingly important as a mode of transport for people and freight. 
2.119  High-density development will continue to be an essential element in meeting Lambeth’s many needs over the next 15 years, and excellent design and 
management will be key to preventing problems that can be associated with 
high density, such as noise, disturbance, overlooking and poorly maintained 
shared areas. Tall buildings are one form of high-density development that can 
be appropriate for some uses and in some locations, again subject to excellent design, protection of strategic views, good public transport accessibility and 
consideration of the impact on the surrounding area. They can also provide 
more opportunities for the creation of space between buildings than is possible through lower level development involving extensive site coverage. Tall 
buildings can also contribute to place-shaping by providing landmarks and 
defining gateways. T o table of contents31
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 2: Evidence Base and Issues
 T o table of contents2.120  Lambeth is the proud home of numerous arts, sports and cultural assets, 
with a particular concentration in the north of the borough, including many 
of international, national and regional as well as local importance. While 
the London Eye, National Theatre, Southbank Centre, British Film Institute 
(BFI), Brit Oval and the Old and Young Vic theatres are commonly cited 
examples, other institutions such as the Black Cultural Archives also have major significance as an expression of Lambeth’s and Britain’s black heritage. 
Well-known cultural businesses such as the BFI IMAX cinema, Ritzy Cinema 
and Clapham and West Norwood Picturehouses, the Oval House theatre, the O2 Academy, B3 Media, Raw Material Music and Media, Photofusion, 
198 Contemporary Arts, the South London Theatre, the Cinema Museum, 
Italia Conti Drama School and Learning and Beaconsfield all make a vital 
contribution to the identity, economy and regeneration of their local areas and 
they wish to expand and grow in the borough (see the Creative and Digital Industries Strategy 2018). The council wishes to promote these assets by 
encouraging the growth of Creative and Digital Industries enterprises. The 
council was awarded a Cultural Impact Award and funding to provide skills, 
jobs and opportunities for young people and those underrepresented in the 
cultural workforce. In addition Streatham’s ice rink was reinstated in 2013 which is home to an extensive ice skating and ice hockey programme. Many 
of these organisations contribute to or deliver programmes of activity for young 
people and deprived communities, which have a direct impact on community cohesion and reducing worklessness. 
2.121  The large number of artists is another distinctive feature of Lambeth - as it is in neighbouring boroughs - contributing to local economic development, 
local skills development and the identity of local areas, including Brixton, 
Loughborough Junction, West Norwood/Tulse Hill, Clapham, Kennington/
Oval and Vauxhall. This includes visual artists, performers and musicians 
with specific needs for affordable studio, rehearsal, exhibition and performance space.
2.122  Finally, local shops, independent businesses and street markets are essential to the identity of the different parts of the borough, and much valued by local 
residents as well as the growing number of people who visit the borough. 
This includes the cluster of LGBT owned businesses and venues in Vauxhall, 
the unique multi-cultural indoor markets in Brixton, historic street markets in 
Brixton and Lower Marsh and newer markets in West Norwood, Clapham, Streatham and the Oval, Portuguese-owned businesses in and around 
Stockwell, Polish and Somali-owned businesses in Streatham, the valued local 
shops in Herne Hill and West Norwood and many other examples. T o table of contents32

3.1 This section sets out the Spatial Strategy, Vision and Strategic Objectives 
for the Local Plan. It also includes the Key Diagram showing the spatial 
distribution of future development and key infrastructure and Lambeth’s 
relationship with its neighbouring boroughs. 
Spatial Strategy 
3.2 The Local Plan sets out the spatial strategy for Lambeth for a fifteen year period between 2020 and 2035.
3.3 The new London Plan requires at least 13,350 additional dwellings in Lambeth over the period 2019/20 to 2028/29, with an annual target of at least 1,335 
net additional dwellings per annum (dpa). These targets are derived from 
an assessment of housing sites within the borough, carried out as part of 
the London-wide Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA 
2017). The housing trajectory for this ten year period is included in Annex 12, along with the indicative housing requirement figures for the five designated 
neighbourhood planning areas in Lambeth (or the part of those cross-border 
areas that fall within Lambeth). The indicative target for years 11-15 of the plan period is 5,066 net additional dwellings (or 1,013 dpa), based on the 2017 
SHLAA findings and by rolling forward the borough’s small housing sites figure 
in accordance with paragraph 4.1.12 of the London Plan. 
3.4 In addition, to meet various other needs and priorities in the plan period, the borough has potential to accommodate: 
• approximately 800m2 net additional comparison retail floorspace in the 
period up to 2041, taking into account existing commitments, the re-
occupation of vacant floorspace in the borough and changing patterns 
of retail behaviour (Consumer Expenditure and Comparison Goods 
Floorspace Need in London (Experian, October 2017)). 
• approximately 160,000m2 GIA net additional office floorspace between 
2016 and 2041, based on office employment projections with allowance for vacancy (London Office Policy Review 2017, figure 9.8).
• an indicative estimate of 3,368 net additional serviced visitor 
accommodation rooms between 2015 and 2041, based on GLA Working 
Paper 88 (Projections of demand and supply for visitor accommodation in 
London to 2050, April 2017 – table 20).  T o table of contents34

programme of flood-risk reduction measures.
• Cemeteries and Crematoria – measures to improve and increase capacity of the council’s cemeteries.
• Education – delivery of planned school expansion and new school projects.
• Emergency Services and Justice – provision of upgraded Fire Station at Albert Embankment
• Health and Social Care – reconfiguration and expansion of primary healthcare facilities to increase capacity.
• Community Facilities and Libraries –upgrade of community facilities (including youth and play), replacement archives facility and 
Waterloo Library. 
• Parks and Green Infrastructure – borough-wide programme of parks and 
green infrastructure improvements and extension of Jubilee Gardens. 
• Sports and Leisure – refurbishment of Brixton Recreation Centre, 3G sports pitches and facilities upgrades in parks and provision of additional leisure 
facilities in the north of the borough as part of new development.
• Transport/Public Realm – electric vehicle charging infrastructure, delivery 
of the Healthy Route Network, Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and Brixton 
Liveable Neighbourhoods, and a range of measures to improve the public 
realm and public transport accessibility borough-wide.
• Utilities – new digital infrastructure and waste infrastructure.
3.6 The projects to deliver this infrastructure are summarised in the Lambeth Infrastructure Delivery Plan, along with a list of additional regional and sub-
regional infrastructure in Lambeth that will support growth across London. 
3.7 There is a need for more open space in the borough to serve the growing 
population, but there is no land available to deliver a major new park. This 
need will therefore be met principally by safeguarding existing open space and 
improving its quality and access, as well as linkages between open spaces. 
Limited additional increases in quantity of open space will be pursued through 
the planned extension to Jubilee Gardens and on major development sites as opportunities arise, along with increases in the quantity and coverage of wider 
green infrastructure provision. 
3.8 The guiding spatial approach will be, in summary:
• promotion of both economic and housing growth across the borough, 
with housing supply supporting economic growth by helping to ensure an 
appropriate supply of labour at both local and sub-regional levels T o table of contents35

Spatial Vision 
By 2035 Lambeth will be a key part of, and contributor to, central London’s thriving 
economy and the benefits of this will be shared throughout the borough. This will 
include a rich mix of strategic functions in the Central Activities Zone locations of 
South Bank, Waterloo and Vauxhall and an enhanced role for the South Bank as an 
international centre for business and leisure and a world-class destination for the  T o table of contents36
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 3: Spatial Strategy, Vision and Strategic Objectives
 T o table of contentsarts, culture and creativity. Lambeth will be home to centres of innovation, a skilled 
workforce and a growing number of businesses and jobs providing opportunities for 
local people. The achievements of Lambeth’s young people will be widely celebrated 
and the levels of worklessness in the borough will have significantly declined. Lambeth 
will be at the forefront of tackling and adapting to climate change to contribute to 
achieving zero carbon London-wide. 
At least 13,350 additional dwellings will have been developed over the ten years to 
2029 and Lambeth will contribute to the Mayor’s target of fifty per cent new housing 
to be affordable. New offices and workspace will be developed, including affordable 
workspace for those businesses that need it to start up and grow in Lambeth. Growth 
in housing and jobs will be borough-wide, in addition to the continued focus on the 
Waterloo and Vauxhall (linked to Battersea/Nine Elms) Opportunity Areas and the major town centre of Brixton. 
This growth will be supported by planned additional school places, and reconfigured 
primary health care, hospital and social care facilities. Levels of walking and cycling 
will have increased substantially as a result of improved, healthy routes and supporting 
facilities. The capacity of the public transport infrastructure, including the interchanges 
at Waterloo, Vauxhall and Brixton, will have increased sufficiently to accommodate all those travelling to, from and through the borough for work, shopping, recreation and 
tourism. Lambeth’s air quality will be significantly better.
Lambeth will be known for its flourishing and distinctive business neighbourhoods in 
Waterloo and South Bank, Vauxhall, Brixton, Streatham, Clapham, Kennington/Oval, 
Stockwell, Herne Hill, West Norwood/Tulse Hill, Loughborough Junction and Upper 
Norwood/Crystal Palace, for its cutting edge culture and creativity, its access to the River Thames and to views of central London, and its international cultural and tourist 
destination on the South Bank.
Lambeth’s residential neighbourhoods will house mixed, cohesive, more stable 
communities that thrive on the diversity of their population, including different 
ethnic groups, faiths and sexual orientations, the young, the elderly and people 
with disabilities. They will be green, safe, accessible areas that enable healthy and sustainable lifestyles and foster wellbeing. 
Although high in density, all Lambeth’s neighbourhoods will excel in the sustainable 
design and management of their built and historic environment and public spaces, 
with a strong focus on culture, liveability, inclusion, reduced isolation, community 
safety, enhanced heritage assets and spaces with an improved sense of place.
This vision will be delivered co-operatively by Lambeth Council and its partners in 
consultation with all stakeholders including designated neighbourhood planning forums, supported by the policies contained in this Local Plan and Lambeth Council’s 
powers as a local planning authority. T o table of contents37
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 3: Spatial Strategy, Vision and Strategic Objectives
 T o table of contentsStrategic Objectives 
3.9 The following strategic objectives for the Local Plan are not listed in order of 
priority and have equal importance. They are grouped under the six key over-
arching issues, but it is recognised that many of the objectives address more 
than one of the issues.
A. Accommodating population growth
1. Increase the overall supply of housing by at least 13,350 net additional dwellings by 2028/29, and increase the mix and quality of housing to 
address the need for all types of housing, including affordable housing and 
the needs of different groups in the community, as identified through the 
Strategic Housing Market Assessment.
B. Achieving economic prosperity and opportunity for all
1. Support the growth of key economic sectors and innovation through 
the development of new offices and commercial premises including 
new affordable workspace by maintaining a varied supply of business 
premises, by maintaining industrial floorspace capacity to support the 
Central Services Area, and through plans for town centre regeneration and 
the development of a new MedTech, healthcare and life sciences cluster at Waterloo.
2. Increase the number and variety of job opportunities for local people by protecting land for commercial use within neighbourhoods and seeking 
contributions to employment and skills support programmes.
C. Tackling and adapting to climate change
1. Improve air quality and reduce carbon emissions by minimising the need to 
travel and private car use, promoting sustainable travel and by maximising 
energy efficiency, decentralised energy, renewable and low carbon energy 
generation in buildings and area regeneration schemes.
2. Safeguard and increase biodiversity through co-ordinated implementation of the Lambeth Biodiversity Action Plan.
3. Enable Lambeth to adapt to the effects of climate change, including drought, flood risk and urban heat islands, through the location of 
development, mix of uses and design of the built environment, sustainable 
design and construction, retention of existing trees, significant levels of 
urban greening, and sustainable urban drainage, an integrated approach to 
water management and protection of the supply of water.
D. Providing essential infrastructure
1. Provide the essential physical, social and green infrastructure to support population and economic growth through the co-ordinated delivery of 
infrastructure programmes.
2. Work in partnership with government, Transport for London, Network 
Rail and major developers to increase public transport capacity and  T o table of contents38
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 3: Spatial Strategy, Vision and Strategic Objectives
 T o table of contentsaccessibility, reduce reliance on the private car, promote walking and 
cycling, and provide alternatives to road-based freight transport.
3. Provide planned additional school places to meet existing and future demand in Lambeth and support the reconfiguration of further 
education premises.
4. Contribute to improving health and wellbeing and reducing health 
inequalities by supporting the reconfiguration and expansion of primary 
health care, hospital and social care facilities, and by encouraging healthy 
lifestyles in the design of the built environment.
5. Increase the quality of open space and multi-functional green infrastructure in Lambeth by safeguarding, linking and upgrading existing open space, 
improving access, retaining existing trees and planting more trees 
(through delivery of the Lambeth Green Infrastructure Strategy), and seek 
new open space wherever possible including through an extension to 
Jubilee Gardens.
6. Contribute to the delivery of Lambeth’s Sustainable Waste Management Strategy by maintaining an appropriate supply of land for waste 
management and operational use and seeking the most effective waste 
management facilities within new developments.
7. Supporting a low carbon circular economy/circular economy principles that improves resource efficiency and innovation to keep products and materials 
at their highest use for as long as possible.
E. Promoting community cohesion and safe, liveable neighbourhoods
1. Develop and sustain stable neighbourhoods with a high quality, liveable, 
green, healthy and inclusive residential environment, respect for local 
amenity, good access to local services and transport, and mixed 
populations (including different ethnic groups, faiths and sexual orientations, 
the young, older people and those with disabilities).
2. Increase community safety, including reduction in youth violence and 
resilience to terrorism by designing out crime and fear of crime in the built 
environment and through joint working within the Lambeth First (LSP): 
Safer Lambeth Partnership Executive.
F. Creating and maintaining attractive, distinctive places
1. Create and sustain distinctive local places through excellent design of buildings and the public realm, valuing heritage, identity, cultural assets, 
the River Thames and the natural environment.
2. Conserve and enhance the historic environment (with a particular focus 
on addressing Heritage at Risk), the setting and Outstanding Universal 
Value of the Westminster World Heritage Site and strategic views by 
working in partnership with Historic England, neighbouring boroughs and 
community groups. T o table of contents39

Zone in South Bank, Waterloo and Vauxhall and the regeneration and 
renewal of the London Plan Opportunity Areas at Waterloo and Nine Elms 
Vauxhall to reflect their role in central London, working in close partnership 
with the neighbouring boroughs of Southwark and Wandsworth and all 
key stakeholders.
4. Support the delivery of Lambeth’s Creative and Digital Industries Strategy and maintain and develop Lambeth’s strength in arts and culture. Ensure 
that the role of the South Bank as one of London’s leading international 
cultural and tourist destinations reflects its status as part of the South Bank 
and Bankside Strategic Cultural Area.

and Objectives
Policy D1: Delivery and monitoring
A. The council will deliver the spatial vision and strategic objectives of the 
Local Plan by:
B. working with a range of partners to ensure sustainable development and regeneration opportunities are fully explored, including optimising the use 
of previously developed land and vacant buildings and the beneficial use of 
vacant historic buildings commensurate with their conservation; 
C. encouraging and supporting sustainable development that enhances the local distinctiveness of neighbourhoods and delivers regeneration 
objectives defined in London Plan Opportunity Area Planning Frameworks 
and Areas for Regeneration, and local area masterplans. In particular, this 
will relate to the Central Activities Zone, the London Plan Opportunity Areas 
of Vauxhall and Waterloo, the town centres of Brixton, Clapham, Streatham, West Norwood/Tulse Hill and to other well defined localities such as 
Loughborough Junction, Stockwell, Herne Hill, Upper Norwood/Crystal 
Palace and Kennington/Oval; 
D. supporting various initiatives such as neighbourhood plans, town centre partnerships, Business Improvement Districts and similar business 
networks and business-led and other neighbourhood management 
schemes in order to promote centres, assist in attracting inward 
investment, and co-ordinate and manage improvements to the 
public realm; 
E. helping to promote and maintain mixed, balanced and diverse communities within neighbourhoods, ensuring maximum accessibility for people with 
disabilities and a child-friendly environment;
F. monitoring the implementation of policies and infrastructure on a regular 
basis and reviewing strategies for implementation as required.

4.1 A number of parts of the borough, including both town centres and residential neighbourhoods, are the subject of area regeneration programmes. In the case  T o table of contents42
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 4: Delivering the Vision and Objectives
 T o table of contentsof Waterloo and Vauxhall, the process is driven by the status of the areas as 
Opportunity Areas in the London Plan. These are the subject of Opportunity 
Area Planning Frameworks, with Vauxhall, Brixton Central and Norwood 
High Street also being supported by area-specific supplementary planning 
documents (SPD). 
4.2 The Local Plan reflects the visions and aspirations of these neighbourhood 
regeneration programmes in its policies for places and neighbourhoods. 
Programmes will be implemented through a range of area based partnership 
structures, including community-led design and community-led commissioning 
in some areas.
4.3 In some parts of Lambeth, community-led neighbourhood plans are coming 
forward to provide additional, area-specific policy that is in conformity with the 
strategic objectives and policies of the Local Plan. The council fully welcomes 
local groups’ interest in bringing forward neighbourhood plans and will work 
with groups from the beginning of the process to explore the scope for 
neighbourhood plan content within this strategic context.
4.4 The day-to-day management of places and neighbourhoods plays a critical role in achieving the objectives of the Local Plan, such as in the management 
of the historic environment. This includes management of the public realm, of 
town centres, of housing schemes and of wider residential neighbourhoods. 
Wherever possible, the council will seek to work co-operatively with 
communities to achieve effective neighbourhood management. The council supports business-led neighbourhood management initiatives such as the 
South Bank Employers Group and business improvement districts (BIDs), 
including Waterloo (WeAreWaterloo), Vauxhall (Vauxhall One) and Streatham (In Streatham). Further BIDs exist in Clapham (This is Clapham), Brixton (Brixton 
BID) and West Norwood and Tulse Hill (Station to Station). 
4.5 Delivery of the Local Plan will be monitored through a framework of 
performance indicators and periodic reviews of the infrastructure schedule. 
This information will be published in the authority’s monitoring report. The 
monitoring framework for the Local Plan is set out in Annex 7. 
Policy D2: Presumption in favour of sustainable development
A. The policies in this Plan reflect the presumption in favour of sustainable development contained in the National Planning Policy Framework. When 
considering planning proposals, the council will always work proactively 
with applicants jointly to find solutions which mean that proposals can be 
approved wherever possible, and to secure development that improves the 
economic, social and environmental conditions in Lambeth.
B. Planning applications that accord with the policies in this Local Plan (and, where relevant, with policies in neighbourhood plans) will be approved 
without delay, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.
C. Where there are no policies relevant to a planning application, or the 
policies which are most important for determining the application are out  T o table of contents43
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 4: Delivering the Vision and Objectives
 T o table of contentsof date the council will grant permission unless material considerations 
indicate otherwise – taking into account whether:
i. the application of policies in the National Planning Policy Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear 
reason for refusing the development proposed; or 
ii. any adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and 
demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the 
policies in the National Planning Policy Framework taken as a whole.
Supporting text 
4.6 The development management process is a key mechanism for achieving 
many of the objectives of the Local Plan. Most development requires planning 
permission (other than that allowed under ‘permitted development rights’) and 
Lambeth Council is the statutory local planning authority for Lambeth, with the 
power to determine planning applications and enforce the implementation of 
policies and decisions. (Some major and other applications are also subject to the Mayor’s powers of refusal or determination.) This provides an opportunity 
to manage the form that development takes in the borough, in relation to its 
location, scale, design and appearance, and the use of land.
4.7 Pre-application discussions are an important tool for achieving the best outcome on a site and for ensuring that wider spatial planning objectives are 
met, including the alignment of development proposals with infrastructure 
programmes and the delivery of green infrastructure. They also provide an 
opportunity to consider proposals in relation to area regeneration schemes 
and wider aspirations for neighbourhoods. Developers in both the private and public sectors are strongly encouraged to engage with the council’s planning 
service early in their thinking, and to seek initial advice from specialists 
(such as conservation and urban design officers, tree officers, sustainability officers, transport officers, crime prevention design advisors, Thames Water) 
and from statutory partners (such as Historic England, Natural England 
and the Environment Agency). The council will promote the use of planning 
performance agreements in appropriate cases. Community participation is 
also a key component in the delivery of good planning outcomes. Applicants are, in certain circumstances required by the Localism Act, and in all 
cases encouraged, to engage with the local community before submitting 
their applications.
4.8 With reference to policy D2 part (c), the NPPF sets out specific policies in the Framework to be taken into account when considering whether permission 
should be granted. T o table of contents44
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 4: Delivering the Vision and Objectives
 T o table of contentsPolicy D3: Infrastructure
A. In order to support growth in the borough, the council will safeguard and 
improve essential social, physical and green infrastructure and work in 
partnership with service providers to ensure the delivery of additional 
infrastructure. The potential and predicted infrastructure requirements over 
the lifetime of the Local Plan are identified in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. 
B. The council will encourage dialogue between service providers and 
developers. Where appropriate opportunities arise, the co-location of 
services and joint delivery of infrastructure by service providers will be 
supported. 
C. Generally, Community Infrastructure Levy will be applied, alongside other investment, to help deliver infrastructure. Site-specific planning obligations 
may also be used to secure delivery of infrastructure.
D. The council, where required and necessary, will co-produce co-operative 
local investment plans that identify, prioritise and cost projects to be 
delivered locally via agencies working in co-operation with the council or 
by the council itself. Projects will be brought forward as appropriate and 
relevant in mitigating the direct impact of development through section 
106 planning obligations or the council will retain funds on behalf of the community to deliver local neighbourhood facilities and improvements 
through the use of a neighbourhood funding element of CIL.

4.9 Physical, social and green infrastructure is provided and managed by a wide 
range of organisations in Lambeth. This includes Transport for London and 
Network Rail, statutory undertakers such as Thames Water, other parts of the 
public sector such as Lambeth College or the National Health Service (NHS 
Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group and Hospital Foundation Trusts), 
council services such as education, sport, leisure, parks and culture, and the private sector in the case of telecommunications and energy services. A full list 
is provided in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan.
4.10 Providers have been engaged in the preparation of the Local Plan and 
the plan’s objectives and policies address their various strategies and 
programmes. Infrastructure providers are encouraged to maintain a close 
dialogue with the council as their plans develop, to ensure that any issues are 
resolved at an early stage. 
4.11 In some cases, infrastructure provision is funded through the public sector 
and in others it is dependent on the private sector for delivery or a contribution 
to delivery. The Local Plan will play a key role in securing private sector 
involvement in infrastructure delivery and in aligning the programmes of the 
various providers. Appropriate partnership arrangements will be put in place to 
oversee infrastructure and investment programme delivery. T o table of contents45
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 4: Delivering the Vision and Objectives
 T o table of contents4.12 A number of infrastructure projects are critical to the successful 
implementation of the Local Plan because without them projected growth in 
the borough could not be achieved in a sustainable manner. This includes 
major transport projects, health facilities, school places and further educational 
facilities. Known infrastructure projects are listed in the Infrastructure Schedule 
in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, with information about the phasing of delivery, estimated cost and funding. 
4.13 The Infrastructure Schedule provides a framework for the monitoring of progress with the delivery of key infrastructure programmes. It will be updated 
annually through continuous engagement with the delivery agencies. Any 
issues with delivery will be addressed in discussion with the relevant agency 
and partnership body.
4.14 In addition, as development-led change occurs at a neighbourhood level, local 
infrastructure will be considered and co-ordinated to address local needs. 
Co-operative local investment plans will be considered and co-produced with 
citizens, developers and agencies during the plan period. This approach will 
help to link investment opportunities and achieve effective management. It is 
likely that delivery plans will draw on a range of tools to bring forward local infrastructure, including section 106 planning obligations where available; a 
‘meaningful proportion’ of the CIL receipts generated by development in the 
neighbourhood; and other area or regeneration based funds as they arise.
4.15 Sites required to deliver specific elements of essential infrastructure during the plan period are identified as site allocations in Sections 7 and 11.
Policy D4: Planning obligations
Section 106 planning obligations will be sought to: 
A. secure affordable housing (see policy H2);
B. ensure that development proposals provide or fund local improvements 
to mitigate the impact of the development and/or additional facilities and 
requirements made necessary by the development. Depending on the 
nature of the development, this may include:
i. provision of infrastructure, such as transport, education, health, libraries, sport and leisure, waste, energy, emergency services and 
cultural and community provision; 
ii. local public realm improvements including streetscape, local public 
open space, play facilities and community safety;
iii. mitigation of impacts on and/or enhancement of heritage assets;

Supporting text 
4.16 Section 106 planning obligations assist in mitigating the impact of development to make it acceptable in planning terms. Planning obligations 
must meet the statutory tests in the CIL Regulations (necessary to make 
the development acceptable in planning terms; directly related to the 
development; and fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the 
development). The obligations sought will depend on the nature of the development proposed. Further information about the requirements for 
the obligations listed in Local Plan Policy D4 is provided in relevant policies 
elsewhere in the plan. The policies in this plan and requirements for developer contributions have been tested for their cumulative impact on development 
viability and are therefore considered deliverable. In situations where it has 
been demonstrated that planning obligations cannot viably be supported by  T o table of contents47
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 4: Delivering the Vision and Objectives
 T o table of contentsa specific development, the priorities set out in London Plan Policy DF1 D 
will apply.
4.17 For some obligations, charging approaches for monetary contributions are set out in Annex 9, with further information in the relevant policies about how 
and when these charging approaches will be used. Planning obligations 
secured for improvements to open space and play space can be spent on 
all types of open space/play space, including those on housing estates. A 
monetary contribution to the monitoring of planning obligations will be sought and this will be calculated on a case-by-case basis according to the nature of 
the proposed development and the obligations secured. The overall level of 
monitoring fees will not exceed 5 per cent of the total value of the obligations secured in any given case. The council will report on developer contribution 
receipts and spend in an annual Infrastructure Funding Statement.
Policy D5: Enforcement 
A. The council will investigate reported breaches of planning control in 
accordance with its planning enforcement protocol. Cases will be prioritised 
according to the harm to amenity caused and resources available. 
Investigations will be carried out proportionately in relation to the breach of 
planning control identified. 
B. Where informal negotiations fail to resolve the identified breach of planning 
control, and where it is considered appropriate and expedient to do so 
having regard to the provisions of the development plan and any other 
material considerations, formal action will be taken.

5.1 The policies in this section support the implementation of the Lambeth 
Housing Strategy and the delivery of the London Plan ten year housing target 
for Lambeth (see London Plan policy H1 and Table 4.1).
Policy H1: Maximising housing growth
The council will seek to maximise the supply of additional homes in the borough to 
meet and exceed Lambeth’s housing requirement of 13,350 homes for the ten year period 2019/20 to 2028/29 by:
i. working with relevant partners to optimise the potential for housing delivery on all suitable and available brownfield sites, and in particular 
maximise the delivery of affordable housing, including through estate 
renewal and regeneration strategies;
ii. supporting development proposals that provide a mix of housing sizes, types and tenures to meet current and future housing need and accord 
with applicable policies set out in the development plan; 
iii. seeking to optimise levels of residential density in accordance with the 
design-led approach set out in London Plan policy D1B, having regard 
to site context; connectivity and accessibility by walking and cycling and 
existing and planned public transport (including PTAL); and the capacity 
and quality of provision of surrounding infrastructure;
iv. bringing forward a Site Allocations Development Plan Document to 
provide detailed policy for key sites, based on a design-led assessment 
of capacity; 
v. encouraging development on appropriate windfall sites not identified in 
the development plan;
vi. supporting the delivery of well-designed new homes on small sites; 
vii. supporting self-build and custom-build housing where it can be demonstrated that the residential density of the site has been optimised 
and other policy requirements have been met, including those for 
affordable housing.

5.2 Lambeth’s housing trajectory is included in Annex 12: this demonstrates how the council plans to meet and exceed its London Plan housing target over 
the ten year period 2019/20 to 2028/29 and identifies a supply of specific  T o table of contents50
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsdeliverable sites sufficient to provide a minimum of five years’ worth of housing 
against this housing requirement. The council will publish an annual update of 
this housing trajectory in a monitoring report. 
5.3 Lambeth has a strong track record of housing delivery. Lambeth’s ambition is 
to maintain this record and exceed its London Plan housing target by keeping 
levels of delivery as close as possible to those achieved in recent years. To 
fulfil this ambition, Lambeth will be pro-active in promoting opportunities for 
new housing development on all suitable sites, including windfall sites and 
small sites. 
5.4 The council will expect all schemes to optimise the housing potential of suitable under-used or vacant sites consistent with a high-quality environment 
for all and the principles of sustainable development. With reference to the 
London Plan, this means ensuring the best balance of numbers, quality, mix 
of tenure and different types of home, while respecting local context and 
shaping high quality places. Lambeth’s Design Code SPD provides guidance on optimising capacity through good design, including where new housing is 
proposed on small sites. 
5.5 Lambeth will bring forward a Site Allocations Development Plan Document 
to provide detailed policy for key sites, based on a design-led and viability 
tested assessment of capacity. It is anticipated this will add certainty to the 
planning process and accelerate delivery, whilst maximising provision of 
affordable housing. 
Policy H2: Delivering affordable housing 
A. The council will seek to maximise delivery of affordable housing in 
accordance with London Plan policy and the following borough-
wide approach:
i. Residential developments and mixed-use developments that include 
residential should provide affordable housing through the threshold 
approach set out in London Plan policy H5.
ii. Applications proposing more than 25 units (gross) must provide all 
affordable housing on site to be eligible for the Fast Track Route. 
Where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that this is 
not feasible, or that it would be more effective in meeting needs for 
affordable housing, off-site affordable accommodation provided by the 
developer may be accepted. Exceptionally, a payment in lieu may be accepted. Schemes of more than 25 units (gross) that propose off-

5.6 Affordable housing as defined in the NPPF (2019) is housing for sale or rent for those whose needs are not met by the market, including housing that provides 
a subsidised route to home ownership and/or is for essential local workers. 
It must comply with one or more of the definitions set out in the NPPF. 
Affordable housing should include provisions to remain at an affordable price 
for future eligible households or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision. 
5.7 Proportions of affordable housing should be measured by habitable rooms to ensure that a range of sizes of affordable homes can be delivered, 
including family sized homes, having regard to site-specific circumstances. 
Habitable rooms in affordable and market elements of the scheme should 
be of comparable size when averaged across the whole development. 
Applicants should present affordable housing figures as a percentage of total residential provision by habitable rooms, by units and by floorspace to 
enable comparison.
5.8 To be eligible for the Fast Track Route as set out in the London Plan, 
applications proposing 10 or more units (gross) must meet all of the 
following criteria:
i. meet and exceed the relevant threshold level of affordable housing on site 
without public subsidy (subject to paragraph 5.16 below); T o table of contents52
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsii. be consistent with Lambeth’s tenure split policy (H2(b)) up to the required 
threshold (although in accordance with London Plan policy H6B, the 
Fast Track Route is also available to applicants that elect to provide low 
cost rented homes in place of intermediate homes, provided the relevant 
threshold level is reached); 
iii. meet other relevant policy requirements and obligations to the satisfaction 
of Lambeth (and the Mayor where relevant): this includes policies and 
obligations where relevant relating to dwelling size mix and housing 
standards; residential amenity space and children’s play space; 
provision of employment floorspace and affordable workspace; town 
centre uses; mitigation of any visitor impacts; employment and training; provision of social infrastructure; transport and parking; air quality; open 
space and urban greening; zero and low carbon; sustainable design 
and construction; flood risk; sustainable drainage; sustainable waste management; and design; and 
iv. demonstrate they have taken account of the strategic 50 per cent target in London Plan policy H4 and have sought grant where required to 
increase the level of affordable housing beyond 35 per cent. 
5.9 Affordable housing is required on site in schemes providing more than 10 units 
(gross) and this is an essential requirement to be eligible for the Fast Track 
Route. Mixed-tenure developments are essential to provide the homes needed 
in Lambeth while creating mixed and balanced communities. In exceptional 
cases, where it can be demonstrated robustly and to the satisfaction of the 
council that this is not feasible in terms of site configuration and layout and the policies in the development plan, it may be provided off-site. Examples of 
circumstances in which off-site provision may be considered include where, 
having secured an alternative site, it would be possible to:
• secure a more mixed and balanced community
• secure a significantly higher level of provision than would otherwise be secured through on-site development
• address priority needs more effectively, especially for affordable family housing tenure and house type
5.10 Consideration will only be given to off-site provision where an alternative site has been identified and it can be delivered as part of the application 
process through a planning obligation. In the interests of ensuring successful 
mixed and sustainable neighbourhoods, and in particular the promotion of 
community cohesion and social diversity, the site identified for off-site provision 
should be located in the borough, as near as practicable to the principal site and no further than one mile. It should be supported by appropriate social, 
physical and green infrastructure. Applications will be required to demonstrate 
that the design, layout and location of both sites will enable the developments to be embedded within the wider community. The off-site provision should be 
deliverable prior to the on-site market housing being completed. T o table of contents53
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contents5.11 Where off-site provision is proposed the percentages of affordable housing 
set out in Local Plan policy H2(a) shall be applied to the total of the on-site 
housing provision and the off-site housing provision. Further detail regarding 
calculating off-site provision is set out in the Mayor’s Affordable Housing and 
Viability SPG 2017.
5.12 Where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that neither on-
site nor off-site provision is appropriate, a payment in lieu may be accepted. 
This will be calculated on the basis of the approach set out in the Mayor’s 
Affordable Housing and Viability SPG 2017 and the calculation of the 
proportion of affordable housing this would achieve should be based on land 
values within one mile of the application site. Contributions will be ring-fenced to secure additional affordable housing either on identified sites elsewhere in 
Lambeth or as part of an agreed programme for the provision of affordable 
housing in Lambeth. 
5.13 Viability alone is insufficient justification for off-site affordable housing provision or a cash in lieu payment.
5.14 If the level of affordable housing provided exceeds the threshold level, there is scope for flexibility in the tenure of those affordable units provided above 
the threshold level provided these homes are genuinely affordable as defined 
in London Plan policy H6. These schemes can follow the Fast Track Route 
provided all other eligibility requirements are met. 
5.15 For developments that provide 75 per cent or more affordable housing, it may 
be possible to consider a variation from the normal 70:30 tenure split for all 
of the affordable housing in the scheme. This will be considered on a case by 
case basis, having regard to the housing need met by the scheme and the 
level of public subsidy involved. The council will require all schemes proposing 
this approach to be viability tested, to ensure the level of genuinely affordable housing is maximised in every case.
5.16 The council acknowledges that schemes providing between 10 and 25 units (gross) may find it difficult to provide on-site affordable housing given the small 
numbers of units involved and difficulties in some cases in finding registered 
providers of affordable housing willing to manage them. In these cases, where 
a difficulty of this nature has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the 
council (through evidence of contact made with registered providers), the council will consider proposals to provide the threshold level of affordable 
housing as an in lieu payment under the Fast Track route. The value of the in 
lieu payment should be based on the relevant threshold as a percentage of on-site units. The payment in lieu should be calculated through two appraisals 
– one with the level of affordable housing required by policy and the other with 
100 per cent market housing: the payment in lieu will equate to the difference 
between the two residual values. Applicants should use the methodology 
set out in Annex 9, making use of the online calculator provided on the council’s website. 
5.17 The council’s preferred mix of rental levels for affordable housing secured through the planning system is set out in its Tenancy Strategy. This strategy  T o table of contents54
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsalso sets out the council’s preferences for provision of intermediate affordable 
housing, taking account of the relative affordability of different intermediate 
products and their ability to meet priority local housing need; and its approach 
to allocating this accommodation. Lambeth’s Tenancy Strategy will be a 
material consideration in the determination of planning applications required to 
provide affordable housing. As set out in the Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability SPG, shared ownership will not normally be appropriate in locations 
where market sales values exceed £600,000. In those areas London Living 
Rent should be the intermediate product provided. 
5.18 Rented affordable housing should normally be managed by a registered provider of social housing (other than in Build to Rent schemes, see Local 
Plan policy H12). The council will expect developers to demonstrate they have 
engaged with a registered provider prior to submitting a planning application 
and to have secured from them a commitment to provision. The council will 
seek to work with its preferred partners for delivery of affordable housing, to achieve the highest possible standards of management. Applicants should 
therefore set out how they have sought to engage with the council’s preferred 
register provider partners in the first instance. Where it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that it has not been possible to engage a 
preferred partner, an alternative registered provider may be considered. In that 
case, the council will need to be satisfied that the alternative provider can meet 
and sustain a high standard of management. 
5.19 Where a registered provider is not involved in the delivery of intermediate 
affordable housing, the affordable housing provider must be approved by the 
council, satisfy due diligence requirements and provide detailed information 
regarding allocation, management and maintenance arrangements, service 
charges and rent levels. In all cases affordable housing will be secured 
through a legal agreement to ensure it remains at an affordable price for future eligible households in perpetuity (or that the subsidy is recycled for alternative 
affordable housing provision in Lambeth). 
5.20 The council’s approach to provision of affordable housing in Build-to-Rent 
developments is set out in Local Plan policy H12. The approach to affordable 
housing in estate regeneration schemes is set out in Local Plan policy H11.
5.21 Where applications follow the Viability Tested Route, the council’s approach 
to transparency and viability appraisal methodology will be as set out in the 
Lambeth Local Application Requirements and Lambeth Development Viability 
Supplementary Planning Document 2017. 
5.22 The council will follow the approach to review mechanisms set out in London Plan policy H5 and associated supplementary planning guidance. For 
applications following the Viability Tested Route, the ‘cap’ on the additional 
provision that will be sought will be 50 per cent as required by the Mayor’s 
Affordable Housing and Viability SPG.  T o table of contents55

A. Existing self-contained C3 housing will be safeguarded in accordance with 
London Plan policy. Exceptionally, the net loss of self-contained residential 
accommodation may be acceptable where the proposal is for specialist 
non-self-contained accommodation (use class C2) to meet an identified 
local need in accordance with the requirements of Local Plan policy H8.
B. Where loss of existing affordable housing is proposed, the council will follow 
the approach set out in London Plan policy H8. 
C. Proposals that would bring back into use long-term empty homes and derelict empty homes will be supported. 
D. Homes should not be used as short-term holiday rental accommodation for a cumulative period of more than 90 days a year. Applications for change of 
use of permanent residential accommodation to short-term holiday lets will 
not be permitted.

5.23 The use of residential premises in London as temporary sleeping accommodation involves a material change of use requiring planning 
permission by virtue of the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1973 
(as amended) unless it benefits from the new exception introduced by the 
Deregulation Act 2015 which came into force on 26 May 2015. This provides 
that the use of temporary sleeping accommodation of any residential premises in London does not constitute a change of use, (for which planning permission 
would be required), if certain conditions are met. The conditions are: 1) that 
the sum of (a) the number of nights of use and (b) the number of nights of any previous use of the same premises as temporary sleeping accommodation 
in the same calendar year, does not exceed 90 nights 2) for each night 
counted under (a), the person who provided the sleeping accommodation 
must be liable to pay council tax (which would therefore include people who 
are liable to council tax but are in receipt of a discount). If the two conditions in the new exception are not met use as temporary sleeping accommodation 
of residential premises involves a material change of use requiring planning 
permission. The policy protects existing housing (C3) from change of 
use to non-permanent accommodation, including timeshare, short-term 
lets, C1 uses, and bed and breakfasts. Demand for short-term sleeping accommodation of these types in the borough should be met from appropriate 
sites in non-residential use, rather than sites used for permanent housing.
5.24 The Lambeth Housing Strategy 2017 seeks a reduction in the number of 
empty homes in the borough through better management.

Policy H4: Housing size mix in new developments 
A. The council will support proposals which offer a range of dwelling sizes and types to meet current and future housing needs. All residential 
developments are expected to provide a mix of dwelling sizes as set 
out below. 
i. The low cost rented element of residential developments should reflect the preferred borough-wide housing mix set out below. 
 
 
 1-bedroom units 2-bedroom units 3-bedroom+ units
Not more than 25% 25–60 % Up to 30% 
ii. For market and intermediate housing, a balanced mix of unit sizes 
including family-sized accommodation should be provided.
B. The size of accommodation provided through housing for specific community needs will be dependent the needs of the intended occupiers of 
the specialist housing. 
Supporting text 
5.26 The preferred borough-wide housing mix for social / affordable rented 
housing is informed by Lambeth’s 2017 Strategic Housing Market 
Assessment (SHMA). 
5.27 To ensure mixed and balanced communities, a range of dwelling sizes 
including family-sized housing will be sought from all new developments. 
Family-sized accommodation is defined as having three or more bedrooms (at 
least one of which is a double-bedroom as defined in the Nationally Described 
Space Standards 2017). 
5.28 While developments are expected to reflect the preferred dwelling mix set 
out above, rigid application of these requirements may not be appropriate 
in all cases. When considering the mix of dwelling sizes appropriate to a 
development, the council will have regard to individual site circumstances 
including location, site constraints, viability and the achievement of mixed and 
balanced communities. In all cases proposals will be expected to demonstrate that the provision of family-sized units has been considered. 
5.29 The dwelling mix requirements set out in Local Plan policy H4 (a) do not apply to developments that provide housing for specific community needs. In such 
developments, the appropriateness of the proposed mix of dwelling sizes  T o table of contents57
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing

Plan policy H11 for the approach to dwelling size mix in estate regeneration 
schemes and Local Plan policy H6 for the specific requirements relating to

Policy H5: Housing standards 
A. Proposals for new residential development, including new-build dwellings, conversions and change-of-use schemes where new dwellings are created, 
should accord with the principles of good design and will be expected to: 
i. provide dual-aspect accommodation, unless exceptional 
circumstances are demonstrated; 
ii. meet the minimum private internal space standards set out in London Plan policy D6; and
iii. meet the requirements for accessible housing in London Plan policy D7.
B. The council will require at least the following level of external amenity space for all residential units.
i. For new houses, 30m2 private amenity space per house should 
generally be provided. 
ii. For new flatted developments, amenity space should be provided to the following quantities: 10m
2 per flat either as a balcony/terrace/
private garden or consolidated with communal amenity space; and for 
development of 10 or more residential units a further 50m2 per scheme 
of communal amenity space.
iii. Houses, ground-floor flats, and family-sized units should preferably 
have direct access to a private garden.
iv. For non-self-contained accommodation, external amenity space of 50m
2 for developments up to 100 occupants should be provided, 
with a further 0.5m2 per each additional occupant.
C. Communal amenity space should: 
i. receive natural light; 
ii. be screened from parking areas; 
iii. be designed to be inclusive for all users; 
iv. be overlooked by habitable rooms to ensure safety and surveillance; 
v. incorporate sustainable landscape principles and practices, including effective water management, efficient energy use, use of sustainable 
materials, and promotion of biodiversity and, where appropriate, 
food growing;  T o table of contents58

5.30 The internal space standards and external amenity space standards apply to all new housing in Lambeth including new-build dwellings, conversions and 
change-of-use schemes where new dwellings are created. Applicants are 
encouraged to exceed minimum internal space standards wherever possible. 
See also Local Plan policy H11 Housing Estate Regeneration.
5.31 Guidance and standards relating to the design and quality of residential 
developments is set out in the London Plan and associated guidance. The 
Mayor’s Housing SPG defines dual aspect as those with ‘openable windows 
on two external walls’. It does not consider the provision of a bay window 
to constitute dual aspect. Units where the second aspect is on the same 
elevation within a recessed balcony offer only a slight improvement on single aspect and will not be treated as dual aspect because the opportunity for 
quiet, a second view and useful cross ventilation will be limited by the location 
within the balcony recess. 
5.32 Sufficient outdoor amenity space should be provided in all new residential developments. The policy contains Lambeth-specific amenity space 
standards. Private outdoor amenity space is highly valued and should be 
provided in all new housing developments. Where balconies and terraces are 
provided they should be located and designed so that they do not result in an 
unacceptable loss of privacy to existing residential properties or compromise the proposed living accommodation particularly with regard to sunlight 
and daylight. They should be designed as an integrated part of a building’s 
elevation. Subject to design, enclosing balconies as glazed, ventilated winter gardens may be considered an acceptable alternative to open balconies where 
the external environment would restrict the amenity value of open balconies.  T o table of contents59
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contents5.33 The council expects that all developments should be able to provide amenity 
space in accordance with the standards set out in policy Local Plan policy 
H5. The quality of amenity space should meet the requirements of Local Plan 
policy Q2. The use of roof areas for additional amenity or garden space is 
encouraged. Where buildings utilise roofs to provide private outdoor space 
and other outdoor amenity space the proposal should take into consideration issues of design, amenity (including overlooking), safety, crime prevention and 
the need to deliver other sustainability objectives (e.g. biodiversity and carbon 
reduction). Because of traffic and overlooking front gardens lack the privacy required to serve residents’ need for leisure, play or relaxation. For that reason 
front gardens should not be counted towards private or communal amenity 
space provision. See also Local Plan policy EN1 on open space. 
5.34 In exceptional circumstances, having regard to London Plan guidance, where it is demonstrated that site constraints make it impossible to provide private 
open space for all dwellings in flatted developments in line with the standards 
set out above, the provision of additional internal living space equivalent to the 
amenity space requirement within a proportion of dwellings may be accepted. 
In the case of houses, the policy requires 30m
2 private external amenity space 
per dwelling. In exceptional circumstances the council may consider a smaller 
quantity of private amenity space per house and some communal provision 
where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that the space 
provided will adequately meet the needs of the intended occupants. Proximity 
of a development site to an existing park or open space alone does not constitute a sufficient reason not to provide on-site external amenity space.
5.35 Play areas should be easily accessible, overlooked by habitable rooms and enclosed either through fencing, railings or other safety features. Appropriate 
play equipment that complies with current safety standards should be 
installed. As set out in London Plan policy S4, formal play provision should 
normally be made on-site and where development is to be phased, there 
should be an early implementation of play space. Off-site provision, including the creation of new facilities or improvements to existing provision, may be 
acceptable where it can be demonstrated that it addresses the needs of the 
development whilst continuing to meet the needs of existing residents. This is likely to be more appropriate for the provision of play facilities for older children, 
who can travel further to access it, but should still usually be within 400 metres 
of the development and be accessible via a safe route from children’s homes 
(measured by walking routes). Formal play space can be provided in a variety 
of forms, including playable space, natural landscaping features and more traditional play equipment. Arrangements for the exceptional provision of off-
site play areas will be secured through planning obligations. The methodology 
for agreeing off-site provision through payments to the council is set out in 
Annex 9. Planning obligations will also be sought for the maintenance of play 
equipment provided on-site; and for the maintenance of any additional or improved equipment provided for off-site.
5.36 In designing developments outdoor amenity space provision should take precedence over parking provision. Where parking is provided, this should 
comply with the standards set out in Local Plan policy T7. T o table of contents60
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing

incorporate appropriately designed security features and be designed having 
regard to the on-going management and future maintenance costs of, and 
responsibility for, the particular safety and security measures proposed (see 
also Local Plan policy Q3).
Policy H6: Residential conversions 
A. To ensure mixed and balanced communities with a choice of family-sized 
housing and to manage the cumulative effects of residential conversions on 
environmental quality and local amenity, the council will protect dwellings 
suitable for occupation by families of less than 130m2 (as originally 
constructed) from conversion into flats.
B. Where a dwelling has a floor area (as originally constructed) of at least 130m
2, conversion of the property into self-contained units may be 
acceptable provided:
i. the development provides a high quality of accommodation and each new self-contained unit meets the standards for new residential 
accommodation set out in Local Plan policy H5;
ii. the proposal provides a mix of unit sizes including the provision, where 
practicable, of a family-sized home; at ground-floor level with direct 
access to a rear garden;
iii. the conversion will not lead to an unacceptable level of noise and 
disturbance to occupiers and adjoining properties (see Local Plan 
policy Q2);
iv. the cycle parking and refuse storage arrangements are adequate and 
do not, by design or form, adversely affect the quality of the street 
scene (see Local Plan policies Q12 and Q13); cycle parking standards 
in Local Plan policy T3 will also apply;
v. where a Controlled Parking Zone is in place, no additional car parking permits will be issued to any occupiers of additional housing units 
created through the conversion; 
vi. where there is no Controlled Parking Zone the occupants of the 
additional housing units created will not be eligible for car parking 
permits in the event that a CPZ is introduced at a later date.

5.38 The conversion of larger homes into several flats can provide both additional 
housing and a range of accommodation sizes. However, numerous residential 
conversions in one street can affect the mix and balance of communities 
and result in stress arising from harmful cumulative impacts to environmental 
quality, local amenity and parking capacity. Local Plan policy H6 therefore  T o table of contents61
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsseeks to achieve the right balance in managing residential conversions by 
setting a minimum size threshold for the existing property to be eligible; by 
requiring conversions to include a mix of unit sizes, at least one of which is a 
family-sized home; and by restricting access to additional parking permits.
5.39 In applying this policy to existing dwellings being considered for conversion, ‘dwellings suitable for occupation by families’ means houses, purpose-built 
maisonettes and duplex dwellings with ground-floor access to a rear garden, 
with three or more bedrooms. These types of properties lend themselves to 
family occupation. The policy will also apply where a was originally constructed 
as a dwelling suitable for occupation by families and was subsequently converted to a non-residential use, assuming the loss of the non-residential 
use is acceptable under other development plan policies. If the existing 
property is in lawful use as a house in multiple occupation (HMO), Local Plan policy H9 will apply. 
5.40 Attempts to circumvent this policy, including through reconfiguration of the internal layout of the property, will not be permitted. 
5.41 ‘As originally constructed’ refers to the floor area of the property prior to any extensions being carried out. Extensions carried out pre-1948 can be included 
in the original floor area. Parts of the dwelling that were not originally habitable 
rooms (for example lofts and cellars) would not be included for the purposes of 
calculating original floor area. A more detailed definition of original floor area is 
provided in the Glossary.
5.42 Other council priorities to bring long-term empty properties back into residential use (Local Plan Policy H3 (c)) may be taken into account in the 
assessment of individual applications. 
5.43 Further guidance and standards relating to the design and quality of residential 
developments is set out in the London Plan and associated guidance. See 
also Local Plan policies Q7 Urban design: new development, Q12 Refuse/
recycling storage and Q13 Cycle storage. Proposals should demonstrate 
mitigation of potential noise disturbance to lower floor occupants arising from 
conversion.
5.44 The acceptability of conversions of statutory Listed Buildings will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and with a presumption against harm to their 
significance. The Design Code SPD will provide further guidance on residential 
conversions, including in Conservation Areas.
5.45 Outside of Controlled Parking Zones, future controls will be secured through planning obligations in section 106 legal agreements.

employment needs and the achievement of mixed and balanced  T o table of contents62

 T o table of contentscommunities. Proposals for student housing will be supported where it can 
be demonstrated that the development:
i. does not compromise capacity to meet the need for conventional dwellings, especially affordable family homes, nor displace other key 
uses such as employment development. Proposals should not result in 
the loss of employment land or floorspace, unless relevant policy tests 
(set out in section 6 of the Local Plan) are met, or the loss of existing 
self-contained dwellings;
ii. forms part of a mixed-use development; 
iii. is supported by evidence of a linkage with one or more higher education provider (HEP) in Lambeth, or within a reasonable travelling 
distance of Lambeth, as defined in the London Plan. This evidence 
must include confirmation that the proposed rental levels for the 
student accommodation are supported by the linked HEP(s) and 
that the majority of the bedrooms in the development including all of the affordable student accommodation will be secured through a 
nominations agreement for occupation by students of one or more 
HEP , for the lifetime of the scheme, as required by London Plan policy H15; 
iv. would not lead to an over-concentration of similar uses which may be detrimental to the balance and mix of uses in the area or place undue 
pressure on local infrastructure, and includes a student management 
plan that, to the satisfaction of the Council, will appropriately mitigate 
potential harm to residential amenity
;
v. is located in an area with good public transport access, and easy 
access to local shops, work places, services and community facilities; 
vi. provides a range of accommodation types, including cluster flats with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities unless justification is provided 
as to why this would not be appropriate;
vii. is well-designed, providing appropriate space standards and 
facilities and is sustainable by virtue of being adaptable to alternative 
residential use;
viii.  provides high-quality cycle parking facilities in accordance with Local 
Plan policies T3 and Q13. Pool bikes are particularly appropriate for 
student housing.
B. Student housing will be secured by planning obligation or condition relating 
to the use of land or to its occupation by members of specified educational 
institutions. Where the accommodation is not secured for students, the 
development will be considered large-scale purpose-built shared living and 
considered under London Plan policy H16 and Local Plan policy H13.

periods for ancillary uses will normally be supported.
F. The loss of existing student accommodation will be resisted unless it is demonstrated that the facility no longer caters for current or future 
needs and the floorspace is replaced by another form of residential 
accommodation that meets other development plan requirements.

5.46 Purpose-built student accommodation makes an important contribution to the diversity of housing in Lambeth. To ensure delivery against the London Plan 
housing target, the council will seek to ensure that addressing the demand 
for student housing does not compromise capacity to meet the need for 
conventional dwellings, especially affordable family homes, or undermine policy 
to secure mixed and balanced communities. 
5.47 When considering whether a proposal for student accommodation would compromise capacity to meet the need for conventional dwellings in the 
borough the council will have regard to:
• whether a proposal would displace existing C3 residential accommodation
• whether a site has been allocated for housing
• whether a site has been identified in the London SHLAA and/or Local Plan 
housing trajectory as having capacity for conventional housing
• whether a site has an extant or historic planning permission for C3 housing. 
5.48 Higher Education Providers (HEPs) are defined in London Plan footnote 77. While the council recognises that provision for specialist student 
accommodation is needed to support the growth of London’s higher 
education providers, speculative development of student housing will not be 
permitted. Proposals must be supported by evidence of a linkage with one or 
more higher education provider (HEP) This evidence should be provided on submission of a planning application, and will be requested at pre-application 
stage if this takes place. The accommodation should either be operated 
directly by a HEP or have a nominations agreement in place in accordance with London Plan policy H15 (see also London Plan paragraph 4.15.3). 
Applications that do not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the council that 
the accommodation is linked with a HEP will not be permitted. It is important 
for private providers of student accommodation to have early discussions 
with HEPs to ensure the accommodation is designed and built to meet their requirements. The council will expect developers to demonstrate that  T o table of contents64
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsthey have engaged with the appropriate organisations to ensure that new 
developments will meet identified need.
5.49 Tenancies should have regard to the likely level of financial support available to the intended occupiers. Proposed rental levels should be submitted, along 
with evidence that these levels are supported by the linked HEP(s). Where 
the development is not operated directly by a higher education provider, 
the affordable student accommodation bedrooms should be part of the 
purpose-built student accommodation that is subject to a nominations agreement with named HEPs, secured in a legal agreement. The affordable 
student accommodation should be allocated by the HEP(s) that operates the 
accommodation, or has the nomination right to it, to students it considers most in need of the accommodation. In applying part H7(c)(iii) of this policy, 
the council will have regard to paragraph 4.15.4 of the London Plan where 100 
per cent affordable student accommodation is proposed.
5.50 To be sustainable, sites should be located close to the institution they are intended to serve (reachable within 30 minutes) or otherwise have good public 
transport accessibility (Level 4 or above), and easy access to shops, services 
and community facilities. The council expects developments to provide high 
quality cycle parking facilities, which are secure, sheltered, integrated and 
accessible, in line with policies Local Plan T3 and Q13.
5.51 When considering the concentrations of students in a single area, the council will have regard to the character of the area, the existing mix of uses, and 
the particular impact on any permanent residential occupiers. An appropriate 
student management plan will be required to mitigate potential harm to 
residential amenity and monitoring of this plan will be secured as a planning 
obligation. Schemes will be considered on a site-by-site basis having regard to their scale and any existing concentrations (including any sites with 
extant planning permissions). Given the existing concentration of this type of 
accommodation in the Miles Street character area of Vauxhall (as shown in figure 5.01 and section 5.5 of the Vauxhall Area SPD), additional purpose-
built student accommodation is unlikely to be supported in this location to 
ensure a mixed and balanced community across the Vauxhall part of the NEV 
Opportunity Area.
5.52 Student accommodation should form part of a mixed-use development. 
Schemes that comprise solely student accommodation will not normally 
be supported.
5.53 Developments should not place undue pressure on local infrastructure, in 
particular transport or open space. In this regard, the council will consider 
whether public transport services have existing or committed capacity to 
accommodate the additional demand generated and whether public open 
space has adequate capacity to absorb further use, particularly in open space 
deficiency areas. Where there is an identified shortage of leisure facilities in the location of the proposal (particularly swimming pools, gyms and other 
indoor or outdoor sports facilities) as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, 
any leisure facilities of this type provided as part of the development should be made available for use by the general public at times to be agreed with  T o table of contents65
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsthe council. This provision and associated maintenance requirements will be 
secured through a legal agreement.
5.54 It is accepted that, due to the relatively short tenancies in student housing and the lifestyle of occupants, different amenity standards should apply from those 
for permanent accommodation. However, accommodation should still be well-
designed, providing appropriate space standards and facilities and good day-
lighting. The provision of amenity space will need to reflect the location and 
scale of the proposal. The ability to accommodate students with disabilities should be fully integrated into any student housing development, with 10 per 
cent of rooms wheelchair-accessible or easily adaptable for occupation by a 
wheelchair user in line with London Plan policy D7.
5.55 The council will expect schemes to include a range of accommodation, including clustered study bedrooms with shared facilities, double units, and 
single and studio units. Cluster flats with shared facilities are likely to be 
more affordable than en-suite single rooms and self-contained studio units. 
The provision of a variety of layouts will also allow for greater flexibility for 
conversion to permanent self-contained housing if in future the building is no longer needed as student accommodation, thus ensuring its sustainability. 
5.56 A student management plan should be submitted with all applications, to ensure student welfare and mitigate potential impacts on the local community. 
This should include an explanation of how student accommodation will be 
used and managed during university vacations. Examples of temporary use 
of purpose-built student accommodation during vacation periods for ancillary 
uses include providing accommodation for conference delegates, visitors, interns on university placements, and students on short-term education 
courses at any institution approved in advance by the council. Conditions 
and/or legal agreements will be used to ensure that the ancillary use does not result in a material change of use of the building.
5.57 Given the anticipated growth in numbers of full-time higher education students, existing student housing provision will be protected unless it has 
been replaced or there is no longer a demand for it. 
5.58 The council will continue to liaise with educational institutions, particularly 
those within and close to the borough, regarding their needs and student 
accommodation strategies. Student accommodation will be monitored 
as distinct from overall housing provision, including future demand /
supply relationships.  T o table of contents66

 T o table of contentsPolicy H8: Housing to meet specific community needs 
A. The council will support the provision of housing to meet specific 
community needs, across a range of tenures, where it is demonstrated that 
the accommodation:
i. would meet an identified local need; 
ii. will be suitable for the intended occupiers in terms of the standard of 
facilities, the level of independence, and the provision of support and/
or care; 
iii. is of a high design quality, relevant to client needs, including inclusive 
design and provision of internal and external space;
iv. will be accessible to public transport, shops, services, community facilities and social networks appropriate to the needs of the 
intended occupiers; 
v. makes adequate provision for parking for visiting health and care 
professionals and, where appropriate, for the safe storage of 
wheelchairs and mobility scooters, in accordance with London Plan 
policy H13B;
vi. is on a site and in a location suitable for that particular use, having regard to amenity, transport and other environmental impacts; and
vii. contributes to creating a mixed, balanced and inclusive community.
B. The loss of existing housing which meets identified specific community needs will be resisted unless it can be demonstrated that: 
i. the accommodation is no longer needed and the new accommodation will instead meet another identified priority local need; or
ii. the existing floorspace will be adequately re-provided to an equivalent or better standard on-site or elsewhere in the borough.
C. The council will support and encourage proposals which provide adaptations enabling residents to live independently and safely in their 
own homes.
D. The council will support new specialist older persons’ housing as defined in 
London Plan policy H13, where it meets identified need. The requirements 
of London Plan policy H13B will apply and applicants for specialist older 
persons’ housing should demonstrate how the design will address the 
needs of people with dementia and other long-term health conditions.

5.59 Housing to meet specific community needs in Lambeth can include temporary 
accommodation for homeless households, sheltered housing with care

 T o table of contentsfor victims of domestic abuse and/or violence, staffed hostels, residential-
care and nursing-care homes, extra-care housing, and supported housing 
provision for children, people with physical and learning disabilities or those 
with mental health issues who require additional support, older persons 
and other client groups. These forms of specialist housing often provide 
essential accommodation for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable residents. Housing to meet specific community needs does not include visitor 
accommodation. The need for short-term, medium-term and permanent 
supported and specialised accommodation within Lambeth is assessed in the Lambeth SHMA 2017. 
5.60 The council is working towards reducing the reliance on residential-care provision. Residents in Lambeth will be supported to live independently in their 
own homes or in the right supported-housing environment. However, they 
should also be able to access specialist housing if they need extra support. 
5.61 The need for specialist older persons’ housing in Lambeth over the plan period is set out in the Lambeth SHMA 2017 and reflected in the London 
Plan indicative benchmark of 70 additional units per annum (IND5 in the 
monitoring framework of this Plan, see Annex 7). Provision will be monitored 
against this indicative benchmark. This need is for the types of specialist 
accommodation identified in paragraphs 4.13.3 to 4.13.9 of the London plan and does not include nursing homes. There is sufficient nursing home 
accommodation in Lambeth to meet need over the plan period: the priority is 
to continue to support people to remain independent for as long as possible in their own home whilst also maintaining the stock of existing nursing home 
accommodation.
5.62 Proposals for the provision (or loss) of housing to meet specific community 
needs will be assessed having regard to Lambeth’s Housing Strategy and 
associated client group sub-strategies as well as the advice of the Council 
and NHS integrated commissioning service for adult health and social care. 
Proposals for the development of specialist housing should demonstrate that 
there is a local need for such accommodation. 
5.63 Proposals for specialist housing should also make provision, where appropriate, for properties with two bedrooms, to provide for live-in 
carers. The location, internal and external design of the buildings, and their 
accessibility should help facilitate independence and social integration. 
External amenity space provision should have regard to the Housing LIN 
Design Principles for Extra Care housing (2009) in the case of sheltered housing schemes; and to the Care homes for older people: national minimum 
standards (2003) in the case of residential and nursing care homes. Applicants 
are also advised to have regard to the ‘HAPPI’ design principles (Housing our Ageing Population Panel for Innovation Report 2009) and the Royal Town 
Planning Practice Guidance on Dementia and Town Planning (January 2017). 
Applications should demonstrate that appropriate provision is made on-site for 
the safe storage of wheelchairs and mobility scooters.  T o table of contents68

 T o table of contents5.64 The council will also seek to ensure that developments make adequate 
provision for parking with reference to policy Local Plan policy T7, including for 
visiting health and care professionals.
5.65 Applications should include detailed information regarding staffing 
requirements and visitors (including numbers of staff and visiting care 
professionals, staff working hours, visiting hours). 
5.66 London Plan policy H13 sets out specific requirements for specialist older 
persons’ housing, including in relation to delivering affordable housing when 
the accommodation falls into the C3 use class (which includes sheltered 
accommodation and extra care accommodation). Co-housing schemes for 
older people are encouraged, subject to meeting other policy requirements.
5.67 Local Plan policy H3 sets out the exceptional circumstances in which 
proposals for change of use from C3 to C2 accommodation may be 
considered, with reference to the tests in Local Plan policy H8(a). Proposals 
for change of use from C2 to C3 accommodation must meet the tests set out 
in Local Plan policy H8(b) and Local Plan policy H5 with regards to external 
amenity space.
Policy H9: Hostels and houses in multiple occupation
A. The council will support proposals for new hostels and houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) where it is demonstrated that the accommodation:
i. does not result in the loss of housing suitable for occupation by families as defined in Local Plan policy H6;
ii. would meet an identified local need; 
iii. will be suitable for the intended occupiers in terms of the standard of facilities; 
iv. will be accessible to public transport, shops, services, community facilities and social networks appropriate to the needs of the 
intended occupiers;
v. will not provide additional off-street car parking where a Controlled 
Parking Zone exists or is planned, will provide cycle parking 
in accordance with Local Plan policy T3 and will not have an 
unacceptable impact on parking conditions and traffic congestion 
in the area;
vi. is on a site and in a location suitable for that particular use, having 
regard to amenity, transport and other environmental impacts; and
vii. contributes to creating an inclusive community and would not result in an over-concentration of such uses within a neighbourhood that would 
harm the mix, balance and well-being of communities by giving rise to 
anti-social behaviour. T o table of contents69

5.68 HMOs are flats or houses permanently occupied by more than one household, where each household does not have exclusive access to all cooking, washing 
and toilet facilities behind a locked front door. They are classified as either 
‘small’ (housing 3 to 6 people) or ‘large’ (housing more than 6 people). The 
former are classified as class C4 in the Town and Country Planning (Use 
Classes) Order 1987 (as amended), while the latter are sui generis, meaning the use does not fall within a specific use class (see Glossary). This policy 
covers both categories, unless the proposal meets the Local Plan definition 
of large-scale purpose-built shared living (paragraph 5.120), in which case London Plan policy H16 and Local Plan policy H13 will apply.
5.69 There are permitted development rights which allow changes between small HMOs (Class C4) and residential (Class C3) without the need for planning 
applications. Planning permission is required for a change of use to a large (sui 
generis) HMO. 
5.70 For the purposes of this policy a hostel includes a building providing temporary non self-contained residential accommodation with an element of supervision, 
but with no significant degree of care. Hostels are a sui generis use.
5.71 In addition to planning requirements, some HMOs require an HMO licence 
from the council. HMOs let to five or more people living as more than one 
household, are subject to mandatory licensing requirements. These include 
minimum bedroom sizes of 6.51m2 for one person over 10 years of age, 
10.22m2 for two persons over 10 years of age and 4.64m2 for one child under 
the age of 10 years. HMO licensing does not grant exemption from the need 
to obtain planning permission. Further information about HMO licensing can 
be sought from the Lambeth Private Sector Housing Team.
5.72 HMOs and hostels can play an important role in providing accommodation for single people who cannot afford self-contained housing. To demonstrate a 
proposal is meeting an identified local need, reference should be made to the 
Lambeth Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2017, the Lambeth Housing 
Strategy and associated Lambeth strategies for individual client groups; and to 
Lambeth’s strategy for commissioning accommodation to meet the needs of specific client groups in the borough. The London Plan states that, where they  T o table of contents70
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsare of reasonable standard, HMOs should generally be protected. HMOs that 
are lawful in planning terms (i.e. those with planning permission or established-
use rights) and, where applicable, licensed, are protected, subject to the 
criteria set out in part (b) of the policy. Similarly, hostels for which there is an 
identified need will be protected.
5.73 There are concerns regarding the quality of some existing HMOs and hostels 
in the borough, and improving the standard of this type of accommodation is a 
priority reflected in the Housing Strategy. Proposals that achieve this objective 
will be supported in principle. 
5.74 In addition to the criteria set out in policy H9, proposals must also comply with any relevant standards for houses in multiple occupation; for example 
regarding fire precaution, WCs and baths/showers and facilities for the 
storage, preparation and cooking of food, which apply to both licensable and 
non-licensable properties. 
5.75 Hostels and small HMOs that meet an identified local need are not subject to 
the requirement to provide affordable housing under Local Plan policy H2. New 
large HMOs that are intended as general needs housing for single people (and 
not to meet the needs of an identified client group) will be expected to make 
a financial contribution towards affordable housing. This will be calculated on 
the same basis as for large-scale purpose-built shared living (see Local Plan policy H13).
5.76 Hostels and HMOs providing accommodation for vulnerable groups (such as young offenders undergoing rehabilitation or half-way house accommodation 
for those returning to independent living) are important and necessary uses 
to meet specific forms of housing need. However, they can in some cases 
result in anti-social behaviour when too many such uses are located in close 
proximity, which can in turn have a harmful impact on the mix, balance and well-being of communities. To avoid harmful over-concentration, new uses of 
this nature should generally be located at least 150 metres away from similar 
premises (measured by walking distance at street level).
Policy H10: Gypsy and traveller needs
A. Three pitches for gypsies and travellers will be needed in Lambeth over the plan period to meet identified need. This equates to one pitch every 
five years. There is no identified need for plots for travelling showpeople in 
the borough.
B. The council will meet the needs of Lambeth’s gypsy and traveller community by safeguarding the existing gypsy and traveller site in 
Streatham Vale and managing the churn in vacant pitches on this site to 
meet the identified future need.
C. To ensure any new site proposed is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable, proposals should meet the following criteria:
i. The site is suitable for residential occupation.  T o table of contents71
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsii. The site does not have an unduly adverse impact on the local 
environment, the character of the area and the amenities of both local 
residents and the future occupiers of the site, including the potential for 
noise, traffic movements and other activities likely to be taking place 
within or in the vicinity of the site. 
iii. The site has, or will have, a supply of essential services, such as mains 
gas and electricity, water, sewerage and drainage and waste disposal.
iv. The site provides accommodation from which travellers can access services and community facilities, in particular schools and 
health services.
v. The layout of the site, associated facilities and landscaping, including 
pitches, hard-standings, amenity blocks, parking and turning areas, 
amenity and play spaces and boundary treatments, are well planned 
to ensure the amenity of site residents and adjoining occupiers and 
facilitate the integration of the site within the surrounding environment. 
vi. The site is not located in an area at high risk of flooding.
Supporting text 
5.77 The council owns and manages a long-established gypsy and traveller site, 
at Lonesome Way in Streatham Vale, currently with 16 residential pitches. 
Capacity was increased by one pitch through improvement works in 2015.   
A new assessment of need for future accommodation for gypsies and 
travellers in Lambeth was undertaken during 2014 and updated in 2016 to 
address national Planning Policy for Traveller Sites as amended in August 2015 
(PPTS 2015). The 2016 Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation Assessment update (GTAA update 2016) found there would be a need for three additional 
gypsy and traveller pitches over the period 2016 to 2031, one every five years, 
to meet need arising from net new household formation. It found no need for 
plots for travelling show-people in Lambeth over this period. 
5.78 An assessment was undertaken in 2016 of the potential supply of land to 
meet identified gypsy and traveller needs in the borough. This assessed (a) 
capacity on the existing site and (b) the supply of other land in Lambeth that 
is suitable, available and deliverable to meet gypsy and traveller need. This 
land supply study identified two vacant pitches at the existing Lonesome Way 
site. The study concluded that re-letting vacancies on the existing site was the most deliverable approach to meeting current and future gypsy and traveller 
accommodation needs in the borough. Analysis of past lettings demonstrates 
it is very likely at least one pitch will become available every five years, as required to meet the identified need for three pitches over 15 years. The 
availability of pitches will be monitored annually.
5.79 The council will continue to protect the pitches on the existing site from 
change to alternative uses unless they are replaced by equivalent or improved  T o table of contents72

5.80 Any applications for new sites should demonstrate that the criteria in Local Plan policy H10 can be met and that consideration has been given to the 
principles of good design (including adequate landscaping) in the layout of the 
site. Sites should be designed having regard to the CLG good practice guide 
‘Designing Gypsy and Traveller Sites’ (2008), or any guidance that replaces it.
Policy H11:  Estate regeneration 
A. Estate regeneration schemes must achieve at least 50 per cent affordable 
housing in the final scheme, based on habitable rooms. Applicants should 
demonstrate through a viability assessment that they have sought to 
maximise the proportion of affordable housing in the scheme and should 
where possible provide more than 50 per cent.
B. Existing affordable housing floorspace on estate regeneration schemes 
should be replaced on an equivalent basis, i.e. where social rented 
floorspace is lost, it should be replaced by general needs rented 
accommodation with rents at levels based on that which has been 
lost. Affordable housing that is replacing social rent housing must be 
provided as social rent housing where it is facilitating a right of return for existing tenants. Where affordable housing that is replacing social rent 
housing is not facilitating a right of return, it may be provided as either 
social rent or London Affordable Rent housing. Replacement affordable housing should be integrated into the development to ensure mixed and 
inclusive communities. 
C. The tenure of additional affordable housing (other than the replacement 
provision) should include an appropriate mix of low cost rented and 
intermediate affordable units to meet identified housing need (including 
priority for those on the lowest incomes) and achieve a mixed and balanced 
community. The type of intermediate provision should reflect the principles 
identified in the council’s Tenancy Strategy.
D. The size of accommodation provided through estate regeneration schemes will be dependent on the particular needs of both existing and prospective 
future residents of the estate and should be justified on this basis. 
E. The design of schemes should follow the principles of high quality design 
set out in the policies in section 10 of this Plan. See also Local Plan policies 
EN1(a)(ii) and Q12(c) for the approach to housing estate amenity land. 
F. External amenity space provision should address the Lambeth specific 
requirements set out in Local Plan policy H5. However, there may be 
particular circumstances associated with housing estate regeneration 
schemes that justify a different approach to the layout of external 
amenity space and ratio between private and communal space. This 
should be justified on a case by case basis, having regard to the  T o table of contents73
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsLambeth Housing Design Principles, privacy, safety, overlooking, 
appropriate separation between residential units, and management and 
maintenance arrangements. 
G. Provision for play and informal recreation should follow the approach 
set out in London Plan policy S4 and associated Supplementary 
Planning Guidance.
H. Estate regeneration schemes should seek to increase permeability and 
integration into the existing urban fabric; improve safety and access for 
walking, cycling and public transport use to local amenities for residents; 
improve the public realm within the estate; and create new walking and 
cycling routes through estates as appropriate.
I. General parking standards will apply to estate regeneration schemes, as set 
out in Local Plan policies T3 and T7, unless exceptional local circumstances 
are demonstrated.
J. Applicants for estate regeneration schemes should set out in a supporting 
statement the overall social, economic, environmental and health benefits 
of the proposal.
Supporting text 
5.81 This policy applies to social housing estate regeneration schemes led by 
the council and/or other registered providers of affordable housing and their 
development partners. This policy should be read and applied in conjunction 
with London Plan policy H8.
5.82 The percentage of affordable housing will be assessed on the basis of the overall proportion of affordable housing that will result in the final estate 
regeneration scheme, once all phases have been completed. This can in some 
cases include blocks that are being refurbished as part of the regeneration 
scheme. This assessment will be based on habitable rooms (see definition in 
the Glossary). Where affordable housing on an estate has been provided as off-site provision associated with a development elsewhere in the borough, 
the affordable housing units on that part of the estate should not generally be 
included for the purposes of calculating overall provision of affordable housing in the final regeneration scheme, as this would amount to double-counting 
borough-wide.
5.83 The London Plan requires all estate regeneration schemes to follow the 
Viability Tested Route. The general approach will be to test viability in relation 
to the estate regeneration proposal as a whole. An over-riding principle for 
estate regeneration schemes is that development viability must be considered 
in the round for each estate regeneration proposal. It is not generally 
appropriate to assess the development viability of individual parts or phases of an estate’s redevelopment, because the financial model for the proposal will 
be based on a whole-estate approach that includes cross-subsidy between 
different elements of the housing that is to be re-provided plus the provision  T o table of contents74
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsof other benefits (such as improvements to the wider external environment). 
Viability review mechanisms will be applied in appropriate cases.
5.84 In no circumstances will a net loss of affordable housing, or of social rented housing, be allowed in an estate regeneration scheme. All existing affordable 
housing floorspace must be replaced on an equivalent basis as set out in 
section (b) of the policy. Former social rented properties sold under right to 
buy/right to acquire should be categorised as market sector housing. 
5.85 Net loss calculations should be made on the basis of habitable rooms rather 
than dwellings where the redevelopment of an estate is providing a housing 
mix that is more appropriate to the needs of both existing and prospective 
future residents – for example, where an increased provision of family dwellings 
is proposed. To achieve no net loss, significantly increased density may be 
necessary to increase the viability of schemes and achieve a more mixed and balanced community. To support the assessment of proposals, planning 
applications for estate regeneration schemes should provide information on 
existing and proposed housing by habitable rooms, floorspace and units. 
5.86 Replacement and additional affordable housing should reflect the housing needs of existing and future tenants of the estate. Schemes should make 
provision to re-house existing residents, after which the mix of all additional 
units should reflect the wider housing needs of the borough in all but 
exceptional cases where a variation can be robustly justified. Existing residents 
should be rehoused in advance of occupation of new market housing and the number of moves for existing residents during the construction period should 
be minimised.
5.87 Where shared ownership units are provided as part of an estate regeneration 
scheme and the occupant ‘staircases out’ to own the unit outright, the 
proceeds from the sale of the unit will be retained by the registered provider 
of affordable housing that manages the estate and recycled into provision of 
other affordable housing elsewhere in Lambeth. This will be secured through 
a section 106 legal agreement associated with the planning permission for the proposal.
5.88 Local Plan policy H5 sets a Lambeth-specific standard for external amenity space but policy on estate regeneration acknowledges that there 
may be circumstances that could justify a different approach in this type 
of development. Proposals of this nature should be clearly justified in a 
supporting statement that addresses the requirements of the policy, explains 
the relevant constraints and sets out the benefits of the proposed alternative approach. The requirements for provision of green infrastructure in Local Plan 
policy EN1 and social infrastructure in policy S2 (d) will apply. 
5.89 The council has developed guidance on Lambeth Housing Design Principles 
in collaboration with tenant and leaseholder representatives. This guidance 
sets out the following ten key design principles for new homes in estate 
regeneration schemes in the borough:
• Secure, warm, safe and comfortable homes with high levels of insulation and sound proofing; T o table of contents75
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contents• Practical homes with plenty of storage space and easy access to services;
• Where we are re-housing residents, they will be involved in the 
design process;
• Personal outdoor space for each home;
• New homes are indistinguishable by tenure and fit well into the existing pattern of streets and open spaces;
• Communal spaces that residents enjoy spending time in, designed with safety in mind;
• Discrete and convenient storage for waste and recycling and secure covered storage for cycles;
• Places that support the character of the area, contribute to Lambeth’s rich architectural heritage, and are built to last;
• Streets and public spaces that create a safe and secure environment for all; and
• Sustainable buildings and spaces that are easy and economical to manage and maintain
5.90 Applicants should have regard to these principles and the associated guidance when designing schemes and will generally be expected to explain how 
they have addressed these principles in their design and access statement. 
Applicants should also have regard to designing for community safety and 
youth violence reduction in accordance with Local Plan policy Q3 and 
associated ‘Secured by Design’ guidance.
5.91 The NPPF requires planning decisions to consider the social, economic and environmental benefits of estate regeneration. In Lambeth’s view, health 
benefits are equally important to address the objectives of sustainable 
development. Applicants for estate regeneration schemes should set out in 
a supporting statement the overall social, health, economic, environmental 
benefits of their proposal to enable consideration in the decision-making process.
Policy H12: Build to rent 
The council supports Build to Rent developments that meet the definition in 
London Plan policy H11. For Build to Rent proposals, the council will follow 
the policy approach set out in London Plan policy H11, subject to the following additional requirements:
A. Where a development proposal involving Build to Rent has potential to include more than one residential core and/or block, applicants should 
use this separate core and/or block to provide low cost rented housing 
to be managed independently by a registered provider of affordable 
housing. To follow the Fast Track Route, the council will seek 70 per cent  T o table of contents76
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsof the overall affordable housing requirement for the development as low 
cost rented accommodation within this separate core and/or block. The 
30 per cent intermediate affordable housing requirement will normally be 
accepted as discount market rent accommodation within the Build to Rent 
element of the scheme at London Living Rent levels. If the low cost rented 
accommodation to be managed by a registered provider in the separate core and/or block equates to less than 70 per cent of the overall affordable 
housing requirement for the development, the proposal must follow the 
Viability Tested route. In these circumstances, the council will seek from the applicant the optimum affordable housing offer for the development 
as a whole.
B. Where an applicant can demonstrate to the council’s satisfaction that it 
is not feasible in design terms to include a separate residential core and/
or block in the development proposal, the council will accept the full 
affordable housing requirement for the scheme as discount market rent 
units managed alongside the market rent units, in accordance with the 
requirements of London Plan policy. To follow the Fast Track Route, the council will seek 30 per cent of the affordable provision at rents equivalent 
to London Living Rent level, with the remainder at a range of genuinely 
affordable rents to meet priority housing need in Lambeth, in accordance with the preferred approach set out in the council’s Tenancy Strategy. 
If these requirements are not met, the scheme must follow the Viability 
Tested route.
C. The package of discounted units below market rent will be secured through a section 106 legal agreement. This agreement will also cover the approach 
to letting the discounted market rent units and associated management 
and monitoring arrangements.
D. The minimum covenant period for all Build to Rent schemes in Lambeth will be 25 years, to be secured through a section 106 legal agreement. A claw-
back mechanism will apply in accordance with London Plan policy.

5.92 The council supports the provision of more high quality, stable rented homes 
in the borough through the Build to Rent model. The council will apply the 
definition of Build to Rent and eligibility of Build to Rent schemes for the 
Fast Track Route in accordance with London Plan policy H11, subject to the 
additional Lambeth-specific requirements set out in this policy. Schemes that 
propose a proportion of homes as Build to Rent and a proportion for sale to the market will be considered in accordance with London Plan policy H11E.
5.93 The council’s preference is to secure low cost rented housing where possible through schemes involving Build to Rent by including this in a separate core 
and/or block managed independently by a registered provider of affordable 
housing. The reason is to increase the stock of low cost rented housing 
secured in perpetuity through management by a registered provider in  T o table of contents77
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsLambeth to meet priority housing need, including through nominations from 
the council’s housing register. Low cost rented accommodation refers to 
London Affordable Rent, in accordance with the preferred approach set 
out in the council’s Tenancy Strategy. Applicants are therefore required to 
demonstrate that this possibility has been fully explored from the outset in the 
design of Build to Rent proposals. The onus will be on the applicant to explain the design reasons why it is not feasible to provide a separate core and/or 
block for low cost rented housing. Only where this has been demonstrated to 
the satisfaction of the council will the council accept the full affordable housing requirement as discount market rented accommodation managed alongside 
the market rented accommodation.
5.94 Where low cost rented housing is provided in a separate core or block, this 
should be equivalent in design and appearance to the rest of the housing 
proposed in the scheme and maintained as such. 
5.95 Percentages of affordable housing will be calculated on the basis of habitable 
rooms. The levels of discount for the affordable units to be provided in Build 
to Rent schemes have been tested through the viability evidence supporting 
this Plan.
5.96 The covenant period for Build to Rent schemes in Lambeth will be 25 years to ensure they make a long-term contribution to meeting housing need in 
the borough across all tenures. A claw-back mechanism will be applied in 
accordance with London Plan policy and national planning practice guidance 
on Build to Rent, to recoup the value of the affordable housing provision that 
is withdrawn if affordable housing units in Build to Rent blocks are converted to another tenure after the expiry of the 25 year covenant period. If a Build 
to Rent scheme includes more than one Build to Rent block, each block 
may be subject to a separate covenant and claw-back provision in the legal agreement. A valuation of the market and affordable units must be included 
within the S106 agreement to enable the level of clawback to be calculated 
in the event that the covenant is breached. Prior to the end of the covenant 
period, if the applicant wishes to deviate from the covenant in any way they 
must apply to vary the s106 agreement. This will be assessed using the methodology set out in the London Plan and associated guidance. Subsidy for 
affordable housing recouped through the use of a claw-back mechanism will 
be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision in Lambeth.
5.97 The Discount Market Rent units within Build to Rent blocks should be marketed in the following way:
•  Under parts (a) and (b) of the policy, for the 30 per cent secured at rents equivalent to London Living Rent levels, the units should be advertised via 
the GLA Homes for Londoners portal and allocated in accordance with 
the criteria for eligibility for intermediate affordable housing set out in the 
council’s Tenancy Strategy.
•  Under part (b) of the policy, the 70 per cent secured at a range of 
genuinely affordable rents to meet priority housing need in Lambeth should 
be advertised via the Lambeth Private Sector Solutions service. This offers  T o table of contents78
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsa tenant-finding service and dedicated tenancy sustainment team who 
support tenants after they move in. The service carries out affordability 
checks on prospective tenants and typically arranges viewings with multiple 
candidates, allowing the landlord to choose the tenant. If the landlord has 
not found a suitable tenant through this process within six months, the 
landlord will be free to market the properties more widely to other priority groups in the borough subject to income thresholds appropriate to the 
level of rent secured for the units (social tenants, local residents and those 
working in the borough)
5.98 The arrangements for management and monitoring of these tenancies, and provisions for tenants at the end of the covenant period, will be set out on a 
scheme by scheme basis in a section 106 legal agreement in accordance with 
national planning practice guidance on Build to Rent.
5.99 The council will generally follow the approach to review mechanisms for Build to Rent schemes set out in the Mayor’s Affordable Housing and Viability SPG.
5.100  The mix of dwelling sizes should be as set out in Local Plan policy H4. Applicants will be asked to demonstrate how family-sized units with three or 
more bedrooms have been designed with a layout primarily to be suitable for 
family use. This is likely to include a range of bedroom sizes and generous 
living space, which will also contribute towards optimising density. It is 
acknowledged that some larger flats may be used by sharing adults as opposed to families, however it is considered that this form of occupation can 
still occur appropriately within flats designed primarily for family use. Design 
standards for Build to Rent developments are as set out in London Plan policy H11 and Local Plan policy H5.
Policy H13: Large-scale purpose-built shared living 
A. Development proposals for large-scale purpose-built shared living will be supported where they meet both the requirements of London Plan policy 
H16 and the following additional Lambeth-specific requirements:
i. each private unit includes at least 15m2 functional living space separate 
from the communal facilities; 
ii. communal space meets the minimum requirements for houses in 
multiple occupation;
iii. the location has good or excellent public transport accessibility and is well-served by local services; and
iv. includes a management plan that, to the satisfaction of the Council, will appropriately mitigate potential harm to residential amenity.
B. A development proposal for large-scale purpose-built shared living will not be permitted where:
i. it would result in the loss of existing self-contained residential accommodation (C3); T o table of contents79
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contentsii. it is proposed on a site allocated or protected for other uses; 
iii. it is proposed on a site with an extant planning permission for C3 
housing; and/or
iv. it would result in an over-concentration of similar uses, including purpose-built student accommodation, which may be detrimental to 
the balance and mix of uses in the area or place undue pressure on 
local infrastructure. 
C. Affordable housing contributions should be made in accordance with London Plan policy H16 in the form of a single upfront payment to Lambeth 
based on 50 per cent discount to market value of 35 per cent of the units 
(or 50 per cent of the units where the London Plan threshold applies), to be 
secured through a section 106 legal agreement.
Supporting text 
5.101  In Lambeth, large-scale purpose-built shared living developments are generally 
considered to consist of at least 30 non-self-contained units. 
5.102  Given the very high density nature of this type of accommodation, proposals should be located in parts of the borough with good or excellent public 
transport accessibility levels and well-served by local services. An appropriate 
management plan will be required to mitigate potential harm to neighbouring 
residents and monitoring of this plan will be secured as a planning obligation. 
Car and cycle parking standards set out in the London Plan and Local Plan policies T7 and T3 will also apply.
5.103  Large-scale purpose-built shared living schemes may be able to help meet housing need among single-person households in Lambeth by adding to the 
stock of rooms available for rent in the borough. 
5.104  15m2 is the minimum personal living space considered acceptable in a large-
scale purpose-built shared living development in Lambeth. A smaller area per person would not provide an adequate living environment for the health 
and well-being of people in the borough. Each personal room should include 
windows to provide natural daylight. Community space should meet the 
minimum standards expected of houses in multiple occupation (including at least one set of cooking facilities for every 2-5 persons and two sets for 
every 6-10 persons). Storage space should be provided in both private and 
communal areas.
5.105  Proposals for large-scale purpose-built shared living should not compromise delivery of self-contained housing to meet Lambeth’s London Plan housing 
target. When considering whether a proposal for large-scale purpose-built 
shared living would compromise capacity to meet the need for conventional 
dwellings in the borough the council will have regard to:
• whether a proposal would displace existing C3 residential accommodation T o table of contents80
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 5: Housing
 T o table of contents• whether a site has been allocated for housing
• whether a site has been identified in the London SHLAA and/or Local Plan 
housing trajectory as having capacity for conventional housing 
• whether a site has an extant planning permission for C3 housing 
5.106  Several schemes of this nature in close proximity, and/or in proximity with student housing schemes, could adversely affect the mix and balance of 
population in a neighbourhood or result in particular local pressures on 
services and infrastructure given their very high-density characteristics. The 
policy therefore would not support proposals with potential to result in an 
over-concentration of such uses in a neighbourhood. Over-concentration, including purpose-built student accommodation, will be assessed on a 
case by case basis, having regard to the location of the site and local 
circumstances. Generally two uses of this nature, including purpose-built student accommodation, will not be permitted on adjacent sites. T o table of contents81

6.1 The policies in this section take forward the spatial approach set out in section 
3 based on: 
• the London Plan Central Activities Zone 
• London Plan Opportunity Areas
• Key Industrial and Business Areas (KIBAs) (see Annex 3)
• the hierarchy of major, district and local town centres (see Annex 2).
6.2 Various policies in this section require evidence of unsuccessful marketing of business and other commercial premises before a change of use can be 
considered. Evidence of marketing should be clear and robust, based on 
an active, continuous and wide-ranging marketing campaign and realistic 
terms. The detailed requirements for marketing and the evidence required 
of applicants are set out in the council’s Planning Guidance Note on the Marketing of Business Premises. 
6.3 The council will apply London Plan policy S6 public toilets in relation to the provision of free publicly-accessible toilets in large-scale commercial 
developments that are open to the public. These should include fully 
accessible and fully equipped changing facilities for people with disabilities 
and their carers. 
Policy ED1: Offices
A. Proposals for large offices (1,000m2 or more gross external area) will be 
supported in the Central Activities Zone, Vauxhall and Waterloo London Plan Opportunity Areas and Brixton and Streatham major town centres. 
Elsewhere, large office development will be supported where the scale of 
the proposal is appropriate to its location and the PTAL level is 4 or above 
and subject to the sequential test in section 7 of the NPPF.
B. Proposals for smaller offices (up to 1,000m2 gross external area) will be 
supported in the Central Activities Zone, Opportunity Areas and all town 
centres, subject to other plan policies relating to the existing use of the 
land, environment, transport and design. Proposals for smaller offices 
outside town centres will be subject to the sequential test in section 7 of 
the NPPF and other plan policies. T o table of contents83
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsC. Proposals involving a complete loss of office floorspace will not be 
permitted unless the following tests are met.
 Either
i. there is no demand for the office floorspace as demonstrated by evidence that the floorspace has been vacant and continuously 
marketed for a period of at least two years; and
ii. it would not be feasible and/or viable to refurbish, renew, modernise 
or redevelop the offices in order to meet the requirements of existing 
or future occupiers as demonstrated through appropriate supporting 
evidence; and
iii. it would not be feasible and/or viable to adapt the office floorspace as smaller office units to meet demand from small businesses. This should 
be demonstrated through marketing evidence and an independently 
validated viability assessment;
 or
iv. the office floorspace to be lost is replaced in the vicinity and within Lambeth.
  Wher e these tests are met, proposed new use(s) will be considered against 
the policies for those uses. 
D. Redevelopment of offices for a mix of uses will be supported if the quantity of original office floorspace is replaced or increased as part of the 
development or elsewhere in the vicinity within Lambeth, incorporating 
existing businesses where possible. Outside of the CAZ, partial 
replacement of existing office floorspace in a mixed use redevelopment may 
be supported where other significant planning benefits are delivered and it can be demonstrated that the maximum feasible and viable proportion of 
office floorspace is included in the scheme, and/or that the replacement 
space will result in an intensification of office use. In these circumstances, viability evidence must be provided.
E. Where appropriate to the scheme, the phasing of delivery of different uses within mixed-use schemes may be secured by planning obligation. 
F. Development proposals for new office floorspace greater than 2,000 m2 
(gross external area) should consider the scope to provide a proportion of 
flexible workspace suitable for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, 
in accordance with London Plan policy E2. This can include a variety 
of types of space including serviced offices and co-working space. 
Opportunities for long-term management of the flexible workspace by a company specialising in the management of this type of space should be 
fully explored.
G. All new office floorspace intended for use by micro, small and medium-
sized enterprises should be made available to the market fully fitted out to 
turn-key standard, unless an agreement is in place prior to occupation with 
a specialist small business space management company.  T o table of contents84

6.4 Lambeth needs to protect and increase its stock of office floorspace to 
support investment and economic growth. The presumption in policy is 
therefore no loss of existing office floorspace and support for new office 
space in appropriate locations in accordance with London Plan policy E1. 
However, office floorspace will not be protected where it is demonstrated that 
it is ancillary to, or integral to the operation of, a hospital or other strategically important health facility. Where replacement office floorspace is provided 
within the vicinity of the proposed development, this should be in Lambeth and 
generally be within a one kilometre radius of the proposal site. Intensification of office use will be measured through an increase in worker to floorspace ratio, 
taking account of potential for flexible working.
6.5 In some locations in Lambeth, demand for smaller office units is stronger 
than demand for large-scale offices of 1,000 m2 or more. When submitting 
a planning application for change of use, it is not sufficient to demonstrate 
that there is no demand for large-scale offices of the existing type on the 
site. It is also necessary to explore the potential to upgrade the building to 
meet modern requirements, or to adapt the building to meet the needs of 
smaller firms, including those in growth sectors such as the creative and digital industries. 
6.6 The appropriate supporting evidence required in section (c) of the policy should include a viability assessment which addresses the feasibility and 
economic viability of refurbishing, renewing or modernising larger office 
buildings for use as smaller office units. It should be produced by a qualified 
surveyor familiar with the local market for business premises. The council may 
seek independent validation of the report in order to assess the quality of the evidence provided; the applicant will be expected to cover the cost of this 
assessment. Independent verification of the applicant’s marketing evidence 
and feasibility/viability assessment will be at the applicant’s expense. The use of vacant office space for short-term meanwhile uses is supported, subject to 
other development plan policies. Short-term meanwhile uses within the two 
year marketing period would not count as occupation for the purposes of the 
marketing requirements.
6.7 Under clause (d) of the policy, partial replacement of office-floorspace 
in a mixed-use redevelopment may be considered outside of the CAZ. 
Generally, no less than 50 per cent replacement floorspace will be expected 
in these circumstances; and in all cases the applicant must demonstrate the 
maximum feasible and viable quantity of replacement office floorspace has 
been provided. Supporting evidence must be provided with the application, including viability information; the council may seek independent validation of  T o table of contents85
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsthis information and the applicant will be expected to cover the cost of this 
assessment. It will also be necessary to demonstrate that other significant 
planning benefits will be achieved through a mixed-use approach, such as 
improvements to the quality, flexibility and adaptability of the office space and 
delivery of new housing with a threshold level of affordable housing (or the 
maximum viable level of affordable housing subject to viability testing).
6.8 Applicants should make clear in their submission whether some or all of the proposed new office floorspace is intended for use by micro, small and 
medium-sized enterprises.
6.9 Where necessary and justified, the council will use conditions and/or planning 
obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the 
objectives of this policy. The council has introduced Article 4 directions 
removing permitted development rights for change of use from B1a office 
to C3 residential across the whole of the Central Activities Zone in Lambeth, 
and in Brixton Town Centre, parts of Clapham and ten KIBAs. The council will consider the introduction of further Article 4 directions of this nature in 
other parts of the borough where there is evidence that office to residential 
permitted development rights are harming the stock of office floorspace in the borough to the detriment of businesses and the borough’s potential for 
economic growth.
Policy ED2: Affordable workspace
A. In accordance with London Plan policy E3, the council will apply the 
following requirements for the uplift of affordable workspace in the following 
locations:
i. In Waterloo/Southbank and Vauxhall developments proposing at least 
1000m2 gross office floorspace should provide 10 per cent of the 
rentable floorspace (Net Internal Area (NIA)) at 50 per cent of market 
rents for a period of 15 years;
ii. In Oval, Kennington and Clapham developments proposing at least 
1000m2 gross office floorspace should provide 10 per cent of the 
rentable floorspace (NIA) at 80 per cent of market rents for a period of 
15 years;
iii. In the Brixton Creative Enterprise Zone (CEZ) developments proposing 
at least 1000m2 gross office floorspace should provide 10 per cent of 
the rentable floorspace (NIA) as affordable workspace for a period of 
25 years with the following discounts on market rents:   T o table of contents86

B. The affordable workspace secured should be provided on-site and be designed to meet a local need for office, light industrial or research and 
development workspace. 
C. Affordable workspace must be made available in one of the following ways: 
i. Leased and managed by an affordable workspace provider on the 
council’s approved list in accordance with an agreed workspace 
management plan.
ii. Managed directly by the owner where it is demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the council that they have the necessary skills and 
experience and an agreed workspace management plan is in place.
iii. Leased by the owner to one or more end users on the council’s 
approved register of organisations that require non-managed 
affordable workspace.
D. The affordable workspace should be made available for occupation within 
12 months of first occupation of the non-affordable workspace. In phased 
developments, the affordable workspace can be delivered on a pro-rata 
basis, requiring that at least the minimum amount triggered for that phase 
is delivered and ready for occupation within 12 months of the occupation 
of the non-affordable workspace element. Where affordable workspace is being provided through a phased mixed-use development, planning 
obligations will be required to ensure timely delivery.
E. In exceptional circumstances, a payment in lieu may be accepted where it 
can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that on-site provision 
is not feasible and/or that a greater economic impact would be achieved 
through this route. The payment should be calculated using the method set 
out in Annex 9. Payments in lieu will be used by the council to support the 
provision of affordable workspace anywhere in Lambeth.
F. Proposals that do not provide the level of affordable workspace required by this policy will be required to submit viability information, which will be 
independently assessed. Where this assessment determines that a greater 
level of affordable workspace could viably be supported, a higher level  T o table of contents87
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsof affordable workspace will be required, capped at the level required by 
the policy. In addition, early and late viability reviews will be applied to all 
schemes that do not provide the level of affordable workspace required by 
the policy.
G. Proposals requiring planning permission that involve the loss of existing affordable workspace will not be permitted unless the quantum of 
affordable workspace is replaced on-site or re-provided elsewhere in 
Lambeth on equivalent terms to the satisfaction of the council.

6.10 The London Plan defines affordable workspace as workspace that is provided at rents maintained below the market rate for the space for a specific social, 
cultural, or economic development purpose. These types of workspaces, for 
example business incubators, accelerator spaces and creative production 
spaces, are an integral part of London’s ecosystem, including for creative and 
digital innovation. 
6.11 Local evidence highlights that the borough provides a focus for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, however rising rents and changes to permitted 
development rights have put this identity at risk. Brixton is a designated 
Creative Enterprise Zone which supports the growth of creative and digital 
industries. Lambeth therefore needs to maintain its existing affordable 
workspace and provide a new supply of affordable workspace to ensure that the cost of space does not prevent micro, small and medium-sized enterprises 
in key business sectors (such as social enterprises, third sector organisations, 
and in the creative and digital industries) from continuing to operate and grow in the borough. Further justification for the policy is set out in the Workspace 
Topic Paper 2019. 
6.12 The levels of affordable workspace required by the policy, and the time periods 
for which the discount will be applied, have been tested for viability in the 
Local Plan and Community Infrastructure Levy Viability Review July 2018 and 
The Brixton Creative Enterprise Zone: Affordable Workspace Analysis 2018. 
The areas referred to in the policy ED2 a) i) and ED2 a) ii) correspond to CIL 
charging zones A (Waterloo/ Southbank and Vauxhall) and B (Kennington, Oval and Clapham). 
6.13 The policy will apply to all applications involving 1,000m2 or more gross office 
floorspace in the areas of Lambeth identified in part (a) the policy, but the 
requirement for affordable workspace would only apply to the net uplift in office 
floorspace.This includes applications for the redevelopment and extension 
of existing offices, but will not include office floorspace that is ancillary to, or 
integral to the operation of, a hospital or other healthcare facility. The policy will also apply to planning applications that involve refurbishment of existing 
office space where this would result in an increase in the quality and rental 
value of the space. Affordable workspace will be secured through s106 planning obligations. Further information on the implementation of the policy  T o table of contents88
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsand approach to planning obligations is set out in the council’s Affordable 
Workspace SPD. Where necessary and justified, the council will use conditions 
and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to 
achieve the objectives of this policy. The application of the policy would require 
an applicant to demonstrate at least 6 months’ continuous lawful use during 
the three years prior to the permission, mirroring the approach taken in the application of CIL.
6.14 The affordable workspace secured should be provided on-site and be designed to meet a local need for office, research and development or light 
industrial floorspace. In the majority of cases affordable workspace will be 
provided as affordable office space. In the Creative Enterprise Zone, and 
elsewhere in support of CDIs in particular, it may be appropriate to provide 
the affordable workspace as discounted light industrial and/or research and development space, where this is feasible in design terms. In these 
circumstances, the proportion of affordable workspace provided could be 
lower than the policy requirement given the lower values associated with this type of space. The proportion of discounted floorspace in these cases will be 
determined through consideration of site characteristics and viability. 
6.15 For the purposes of calculating the reduced rents for affordable workspace, 
the market rent is the expected rent that would have been achieved at market 
rates for the discounted space. Service charges should be set at a reasonable 
level that does not offset the overall affordability of the space. The market rent 
(and associated service charges) will be assessed on a case by case basis at 
the time of the application, taking into account the nature and location of the proposed development. 
6.16 The boundary of the Brixton Creative Enterprise Zone (CEZ) is defined on the map on page 89. The Brixton CEZ covers the whole of Brixton town centre 
plus a wider area outside of the town centre. The Brixton Creative Enterprise 
Zone: Affordable Workspace Analysis 2018 identified that development 
viability generally differs in these two parts of the CEZ. Consequently, in the 
policy ED2 a) iii), different affordable workspace discount rates are required in different parts of the CEZ, depending on the quantum of office floorspace 
being proposed.  T o table of contents89

 T o table of contents6.17 In exceptional circumstances the council may accept a payment in lieu (PIL) 
where the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that 
on-site provision is not feasible and/or that a greater economic impact would 
be achieved through this route. The PIL calculation for affordable workspace 
is shown in Annex 9. PIL will be spent anywhere in Lambeth because there 
is a need for affordable workspace borough-wide (see Workspace Topic Paper 2019). 
6.18 The council will expect affordable workspace to be provided through on eof the three routes referenced in part (c) of the policy. In relation to part (c)(i) and 
(iii), the council will maintain a council-approved list of workspace providers 
and a register of organisations requiring non-managed affordable workspace. 
Applicants are encouraged to engage with providers at an early stage in the 
planning process.
6.19 Under (c)(ii), the workspace can be managed directly by the owner of the building. Whilst the policy requirement is expressed as a percentage of 
floorspace, it is acknowledged that in some cases a building owner may wish 
to provide the affordable workspace in the form of discounted memberships 
giving access to a range of spaces rather than discounted rents on a defined 
percentage of space. In these circumstances, the value of the discounted memberships should be equivalent to the capital value of providing the 
required percentage of discounted floorspace. The PIL calculation in Annex 9 
can be used to identify the capital value. 
6.20 Applications that include an element of affordable workspace to be managed by an affordable workspace provider (c)(i) or managed by the building owner 
(c)(ii) must include a draft Workspace Management Plan (WMP) that sets 
out how the workspace will be managed and the terms of its provision. This 
requirement will be secured through a planning obligation. Further guidance 
relating to the content of WMPs is set out in the Affordable Workspace SPD.
6.21 Applications that propose the required level of affordable workspace may be eligible for the Fast Track Route, assuming all other policy requirements 
are met to the satisfaction of the council. For mixed-use schemes involving 
housing, applications will only qualify for the Fast Track Route if they propose 
the required level of both affordable housing and affordable workspace. 
6.22 Applications that propose levels of affordable workspace below the policy 
requirement will be viability tested. Viability information must be submitted 
with the planning application in accordance with the requirements set out in 
the council’s Development Viability SPD. Applicants will be expected to pay 
for the cost of the independent viability assessment. Viability tested schemes 
will be subject to viability reviews as set out in the Affordable Workspace SPD. Review mechanisms provide a reappraisal mechanism to ensure that 
maximum public benefit is secured over the period of the development. 
They allow increases in section 106 contributions up to the level required by the policy, to reflect changes in the value of a development from the date of 
planning permission to specific stages of the development programme.  T o table of contents91

applications which are required to provide affordable workspace. During pre-
application discussions, the council can advise of suitable types of affordable 
workspace reflecting local need and will advise on the content of the WMP .
6.24 For all schemes that provide affordable workspace, the council will require an annual monitoring report to be submitted to show how policy requirements 
are being met. This requirement will be secured as a planning obligation and 
a monitoring fee will be sought.
6.25 Planning obligations used to secure affordable workspace should include mechanisms to ensure its timely delivery, ath the same time or in advance 
of the office floorspace, and where included as part of mixed use schemes 
it may be appropriate to require it in advance of some or all of the 
residential elements. 
Policy ED3: Key Industrial and Business Areas (KIBAs)
A. Development in KIBAs will be permitted only for business, industrial, 
storage and waste management uses, including green industries and other 
compatible industrial and commercial uses (excluding large scale retail), 
other than where clause (c) below applies. 
B. The intensification of business, light and general industry, storage and distribution uses is encouraged in KIBAs, in accordance with London Plan 
policy E7 section A. Development proposals of this type should have regard 
to operational requirements (including servicing) and mitigate impacts on 
the transport network where necessary.
C. Areas of KIBA land with potential for both industrial, business, light and 
general industry, storage and distribution uses intensification and co-
location with residential and other uses (in accordance with London Plan 
policy E7 sections B and D) are shown on the Policies Map. To be eligible 
for the Fast Track Route, a 50 per cent affordable housing threshold will 
apply to proposals of this nature if there is a net loss of industrial floorspace capacity, in accordance with London Plan policy H6.

6.26 KIBAs are Lambeth’s Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSIS) and are listed in Annex 3 and shown on the Policies Map. In accordance with London Plan 
policy E4, Lambeth’s KIBAs are a vital part of the local economy representing 
the borough’s strategic supply of land for industry, business, logistics and 
services to support London’s economic function and to enable sufficient land 
of the right type is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth and innovation and be flexible enough to accommodate needs not 
anticipated in the Plan, allow for new and flexible working practices and enable 
a rapid response to changes in economic circumstances. The London Plan  T o table of contents92
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsplaces Lambeth within the Central Services Area and optimising employment 
use. (CSA). CSA status requires a particular focus on sustainable ‘last mile’ 
distribution/logistics, ‘just-in-time’ servicing (such as food service activities, 
printing, administrative and support services, office supplies, repair and 
maintenance), waste management and recycling, and land to support 
transport functions, to service the functioning of the Central Activities Zone. Waste management and recycling are also particularly important uses in KIBAs 
given the requirement to meet the London Plan waste apportionment (see 
Local Plan policy EN7).
6.27 Lambeth undertook a review of its KIBAs to inform the partial review of the Lambeth Local Plan 2015 in the context of the Mayor’s evidence on industrial 
land and capacity in the revised London Plan (Lambeth Review of KIBAs 
2019, updated 2020). This study included an analysis of occupancy and 
development activity in the existing KIBAs in Lambeth and assessed whether 
any changes were needed to current designations, as well as considering potential for intensification. It also assessed potential for designation 
of additional land as KIBA. The assessment was carried out in parallel 
with Lambeth’s input to the London Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) 2017. It also took account of comments in response 
to public consultation on the Draft Revised Lambeth Local Plan in 2018, and 
of the parallel assessment of waste management capacity in the borough 
(Waste Evidence Base updated 2020). Overall, the study presents a strong 
picture, finding very high levels of occupancy and industrial/business related development activity in the majority of existing KIBAs in Lambeth. However, 
changes to the boundaries of nine existing KIBA are proposed in the study 
as a result of changing circumstances, as is one full de-designation. Four 
new KIBAs are proposed but the result is an overall net loss of designated 
industrial land. 
6.28 The level of industrial floorspace capacity lost in Lambeth in recent years, in combination with these boundary changes, means that any scope for 
intensification within KIBAs must be prioritised for industrial floorspace 
capacity, rather than to allow space for non-industrial uses. Lambeth does 
not need to rely on KIBA land to meet and exceed its London Plan housing 
target. KIBA land must be prioritised instead to meet the requirements of Lambeth’s CSA location and the London Plan waste apportionment. Industrial 
intensification appropriate within the KIBAs includes intensification for light and 
general industry including emerging industrial-related sectors; storage and logistics/distribution including ‘last mile’ distribution close to central London, 
wholesale, consolidation centres and collection points business and waste 
management uses use; utilities infrastructure; some rail and bus infrastructure; 
flexible hybrid spaces to accommodate services that support the wider 
London economy and population; low-cost industrial and related space for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (including many in the creative, 
cultural and digital industries and other sectors such as food-making and 
distribution); and research and development of industrial and related products 
and processes. New B2 and B8 uses are particularly encouraged. The  T o table of contents93
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsapproach to industrial intensification should follow that set out in the London 
Plan and the guidance in the Mayor’s Industrial Intensification Primer.
6.29 Given the position explained above, only three KIBAs or parts of KIBAs are identified on the Policies Map as having potential for industrial intensification 
and co-location with other uses, based on particular circumstances affecting 
those locations. See the Review of KIBAs for further information. For sites 
in KIBAs with potential for industrial intensification and co-location, the 
appropriate amount of industrial floorspace to be re-provided will be assessed as the existing quantum of floorspace and/or actively used yardspace, or 65 
per cent plot ratio (defined as total proposed industrial floorspace divided 
by total proposed site area), whichever is greater for the site in question; unless a site specific policy in the Site Allocations DPD specifies an alternative 
approach. This is based on the methodology in the Mayor’s evidence on 
London Industrial Land Demand (CAG October 2017).
6.30 Some KIBAs include existing office space, usually in the form of small business units and/or as part of a permission for flexible B1 space. These 
business units are important to the Lambeth economy and in some cases 
are protected by an Article 4 direction removing permitted development 
rights for change of use from office to residential. However, going forward 
any potential for intensification within KIBAs should be for industrial uses that meet the definition in London Plan policy E4. This could include flexible 
workspace within Class E, so long as it is not used for retail, food and drink 
or leisure uses (which will be controlled as appropriate through conditions or planning obligations). Proposals for intensification in KIBAs that affect existing 
office floorspace should ensure that the uplift in floorspace is provided in the 
form of space that falls within the London Plan definition, which could include 
flexible workspace within Class E as described above. Proposals for additional 
floorspace intended for office use only will not generally be permitted permitted in KIBAs because office space is a main town centre use and none of the 
KIBAs is located in a town centre. 
6.31 In some cases, uses such as small-scale cafés and gyms intended primarily to 
serve the needs of those working in and visiting the KIBA, may be considered 
appropriate. Proposals for café, restaurant or leisure uses that would, by virtue 
of their use, location or configuration, attract significant numbers of customers 
with no connection to the KIBA will not be permitted. Where necessary and 
justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the objectives of this policy 
and to avoid the proliferation of main town centre uses in KIBAs.
6.32 The council’s approach to waste management uses is set out in Local Plan 
policy EN7. The approach to land in existing use for transport or support 
functions is set out in Local Plan policy T4. 
6.33 ‘Green industries’ refer to businesses which contribute to achieving a low 
carbon economy such as environmental goods and services. Examples 
include recycling; refurbishing and repair; production and distribution of 
renewable energy technologies; and facilities that enhance the recovery of 
materials and resources from waste streams (resource recovery or ‘upcycling’). T o table of contents94
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contents6.34 Applications for employment-training uses within a KIBA should be 
accompanied by supporting information setting out the nature of the activity 
proposed and how it would be ancillary to, or provide for, the needs of 
the KIBA. Office-based language schools and business colleges are not 
considered to meet this definition and can attract large numbers of students 
into industrial areas, potentially jeopardising the future viability of the KIBA. They are more appropriately located in town centres where there is usually a 
choice of suitable premises and a higher level of public transport accessibility. 
6.35 In relation to sections (b and c) of the policy, London Plan policy D13 relating 
to the Agent of Change principle will also apply. 
Policy ED4: Non-designated industrial sites 
A. The intensification of industrial uses on non-designated industrial sites is encouraged through introduction of small units, development of multi-storey 
schemes, addition of basements or more efficient use of land through 
higher plot ratios. Development proposals of this nature should have regard 
to operational yard space requirements (including servicing) and mitigate 
impacts on the transport network where necessary.
B. Development proposals for change of use, mixed-use or residential development on non-designated industrial sites will be assessed under 
London Plan policies E2 and E7 sections C and D. Where marketing is 
required by the policy, this should be for at least one year and the site 
should be vacant during this period. To be eligible for the Fast Track Route, 
a 50 per cent affordable housing threshold will apply to proposals of this nature if there is a net loss of industrial floorspace capacity, in accordance 
with London Plan policy H6. London Plan policy D13 Agent of Change will 
also apply to mixed-use developments on non-designated industrial land.
C. Development proposals involving the provision of new industrial floorspace and/or operational yard space outside of KIBAs will be assessed under 
London Plan policies E2 and E4. New B2 and B8 uses should generally 
locate in KIBAs, away from neighbouring residential uses. For new waste 
management uses, see Local Plan policy EN7.
D. Development proposals for new commercial, business and service 
floorspace floorspace greater than 2,500 m2 (gross external area) should 
consider the scope to provide a proportion of flexible workspace or small 
units suitable for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.

6.36 Non-designated industrial sites are defined in the London Plan as sites 
containing industrial and related functions that are not formally designated as 
Locally Significant Industrial Sites in the Local Plan. In Lambeth, this means 
industrial sites outside of KIBAs.  T o table of contents95

 T o table of contents6.37 Intensification proposals under section (a) of the policy that involve the creation 
of basements will not generally be permitted where the costs involved in 
the creation of the basement adversely affect development viability to the 
detriment of affordable housing provision.
6.38 ‘Industrial uses’ are as defined in London Plan policy E4A and include a number of sui generis uses such as builders’ yards, telecommunications 
centres and postal sorting offices, bus depots, freight interchanges, tyre retail 
and fitting, cash and carry warehouses. Industrial floorspace capacity includes 
operational yard space capacity as defined in London Plan Policy E4A. 
6.39 Some specific employment-generating sui generis uses are covered by 
separate policies in the Local Plan and are not considered to be industrial uses 
for the purposes of this policy. These are:
• ambulance, fire or police stations – policy S2
• theatres and rehearsal rooms – policy ED13
• work-live accommodation – policy ED5
• mini-cabs, taxis and private hire vehicles – policy T9
6.40 Land in existing use for transport or support functions is also covered by Local 
Plan policy T4. Waste related uses are also covered by Local Plan policy EN7.
6.41 There is a shortage of lower-cost workspace for small businesses across Lambeth, particularly for businesses in the creative sectors, as set out 
in Topic Paper 3: Workspace. In addition to the lower cost space within 
KIBAs, non-designated industrial sites can contribute to providing a range of 
types of space available to small businesses in these sectors. Development 
proposals that involve the loss of existing industrial space outside of KIBAs will be assessed against the tests in London Plan policy E2C. Requirements 
for affordable workspace in Local Plan policy ED2 only apply to development 
proposals for office floorspace. 
6.42 Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the 
objectives of this policy and to avoid the proliferation of main town centre uses 
outside of town centres.
Policy ED5: Work-live development
A. Work-live development will not be permitted in Key Industrial and Business Areas. It may be acceptable on non-designated industrial land and in the 
Brixton Creative Enterprise Zone and the West Norwood Creative Business 
Cluster, provided it does not result in the loss of a site which is suitable 
for continued business use and it meets the provisions set out within 
this policy. 
B. The work element should be physically distinct from the residential accommodation with a separate access. Servicing arrangements should  T o table of contents96
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsbe appropriate to the scale of the use proposed and located so as to 
minimise impacts on residential accommodation. The residential element 
should aim to meet the standards for housing development in policy H5 
wherever practical.
C. Change of use of work-live accommodation to residential use will not be permitted.
D. Where planning permission is required, the use of existing housing for home-working purposes will be supported where:
i.  it is a subsidiary part of the use of the dwelling and does not compromise the continuing use of the accommodation for residential 
purposes; and 
ii. the nature and form of the work activity would not have an 
unacceptable impact on the residential amenity of an area through for 
example noise, servicing, goods deliveries, traffic generation or hours 
of hours of activity that would be likely to cause nuisance.
Supporting text 
6.43 Work-live development provides segregated living and working accommodation in a single, self-contained unit. It is distinct from working from 
home as it involves the provision of purpose-designed workspace, and it does 
not fall within a specific use class under the Town and Country Planning (Use 
Classes Order) 1987 (as amended). It is therefore a sui generis use.
6.44 It is recognised that combined work-live units contribute to the range of 
homes and the range of business premises in the borough and can offer a 
number of benefits including a reduction in traffic, more efficient use of land, 
minimising business start-up costs, and supporting flexible working. Work-live 
development will generally be supported where it does not result in the loss 
of sites that are suitable for continued business use or the loss of permanent housing (see Local Plan policy H3). It will generally be treated in the same way 
as housing in applying all other Local Plan policies, including the provision of 
affordable housing.
6.45 Historically work-live development in Lambeth has often resulted in an incremental loss of employment-generating land to residential. Units have 
frequently reverted to 100 per cent residential use, with some misused 
as purely residential units, with a work-live description potentially used to 
circumvent policies designed to protect employment space and affordable 
housing obligations. Existing work-live properties will be safeguarded from changes of use to residential.
6.46 Work-live units do not generate significant employment and, where proposed, will not be considered to contribute to the overall proportion of business 
floorspace within proposals nor as re-provision where employment-generating 
floorspace is lost. Planning conditions or obligations will be used to secure  T o table of contents97

 T o table of contentsan element of workspace within work-live premises to ensure that a suitable 
working environment is provided and retained. 
6.47 Plans accompanying planning applications will be assessed for adequate separation of residential and business uses. Servicing should be located 
appropriately and not impact on residential accommodation, particularly in 
terms of amenity or traffic movements. 
Policy ED6: Railway arches
A. The use of railway arches within London Plan Opportunity Areas and major, district and local centres for commercial, business, service, leisure and 
community uses and appropriate sui generis uses will be supported. B2 
micro-breweries will also be supported in town centre locations, subject 
to assessment and mitigation of potential harm to neighbouring uses. 
Within town centres, the requirements of other relevant Local Plan policies, including places and neighbourhoods policies, will apply. 
B. Elsewhere, industrial uses will be supported. Proposals for nightclubs in railway arches outside of town centres will not be permitted. Proposals for 
change of use of railway arches from industrial uses to other commercial or 
community uses will be considered against other development plan policies 
relevant to the proposed use. Proposals for contiguous sets of railway 
arches are encouraged to enable a comprehensive approach.
C. Proposals to use railway arches for car parking will not be permitted. 
D. Class C and residential sui generis uses will not be permitted in railway arches.
E. Where necessary to make a development proposal acceptable in planning terms, applications affecting railway arches will be required to improve 
the immediate environment around the arches, including the public realm. 
This will include accessibility, safety, servicing and lighting appropriate to 
the location and the opening up of routes that contribute to the ‘Low Line’ 
project. In some circumstances the loss of useable railway arch floorspace may be supported as part of major development proposals where it is 
demonstrated this is necessary to increase site permeability and/or achieve 
public realm improvements.
Supporting text 
6.48 In relation to section (a) of the policy, ‘appropriate sui generis uses’ will be assessed on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the use 
proposed in relation to neighbouring and surrounding uses. ‘Industrial uses’ in 
part (b) are as defined in London Plan policy E4A.
6.49 The policy indicates the types of alternative uses supported within railway arches in particular locations but does not preclude other uses where  T o table of contents98

 T o table of contentsappropriate to the location, subject to other development plan policies. 
Applicants are strongly encouraged to bring forward proposals for contiguous 
sets of railway arches, to enable a comprehensive approach and more 
effective consideration against the wider place-shaping objectives set out in 
the policies for places and neighbourhoods in section 11 of the Local Plan.
6.50 In the case of railway arches located within Key Industrial and Business Areas, 
Local Plan policy ED3 takes priority over other policies in the plan. In general, 
new B2 uses are encouraged to locate within KIBAs but they may be suitable 
in some railway arches outside of KIBAs. A micro-brewery is an example of 
a B2 use that may be appropriate in a railway arch outside of a KIBA. Micro-
breweries may also be appropriate in town centre locations where they include an ancillary tap-room because this can add to activity levels in the centre. 
Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning 
obligations to limit uses consented within Class E in order to achieve the objectives of this policy and to avoid the proliferation of main town centre uses 
outside of town centres.
6.51 See the Places and Neighbourhoods policies for potential locations of the Low 
Line project. 
Policy ED7: Town centres
A. The council will support the vitality and viability of Lambeth’s hierarchy of major, district and local centres, and Central Activities Zone retail 
clusters, by:
i. supporting retail, service, leisure, recreation and other appropriate uses 
in these areas; 
ii. maintaining the predominant retail function of primary shopping areas in major and district centres and the Central Activities Zone 
retail clusters; 
iii. delivering the regeneration of Lambeth’s town centres; 
iv. improving existing retail facilities; 
v. supporting and protecting market areas and areas of specialist 
shopping including the Lower Marsh/The Cut/Leake Street Special 
Policy Area; 
vi. safeguarding local shops and other local services to meet community 
need within neighbourhoods; and
vii. encouraging new residential development on appropriate sites as part of a wide mix of town centre uses and supporting the conversion 
of unused or underused space above ground floor units for new 
residential accommodation (subject to the requirements of other 
relevant policies relating to the existing use of the property). T o table of contents99
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsB. Development within centres will be encouraged in accordance with national 
policy to provide up to 800m2 net additional comparison retail floorspace 
across the borough by 2041. 
C. Development in town centres and Central Activities Zone retail clusters will be supported if:
i. it is in scale and form appropriate to the size, role and function of the centre and its catchment;
ii. it is designed to integrate with and add to the physical attractiveness of the area within which it is located, avoiding blank walls and façades; 
and
iii. the mix of uses is in line with the places and neighbourhoods policies 
and policies ED8 (evening economy and food and drink uses), ED10 
(betting shops and payday loan shops) and ED11 (local centres). Active 
frontage uses will be required at ground floor level. Exceptions will be 
allowed only outside of the primary shopping area where the nature of 
the development does not allow for this and/or it can be shown that a fully serviced active frontage use is unlikely to be let, and it can be 
demonstrated that the proposal would contribute to enhancing the 
vitality and viability of the centre. 
D. Proposals for town centre uses in edge of centre and out-of-centre locations will be assessed against the sequential test and impact 
assessment set out in the NPPF. Applications that fail the sequential test 
and/or where the impact assessment (where required) demonstrates 
significant adverse impact will not be permitted. Where necessary and 
justified, the council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Classes E, F1 or F2 in order to achieve the 
objectives of this policy and to avoid the proliferation of main town centre 
uses outside of town centres.
E. Major redevelopment proposals will be required to re-provide on affordable terms any small shop premises that would be lost and ensure that these 
are available at the same time as the main elements of the development, 
subject to viability. This will be secured through conditions or, where 
appropriate, planning obligations.
F. In accordance with London Plan policy E9, major development proposals 
should provide an appropriate mix of unit sizes. Large-scale commercial 
development proposals (containing over 2,500m2 gross shop, service and 
food and drink floorspace) should consider the provision of small shops.
G. The subdivision of larger units of over 250 m2 gross floor area within primary 
shopping areas will not be permitted unless it is demonstrated, though marketing evidence, that there is a lack of demand for larger units. 
H. The conversion or change of use of the storage and yard facilities of 
existing retail units will not be permitted where this would compromise the 
viability or future use of the remaining retail unit.  T o table of contents100

6.52 Lambeth’s town centres are listed in Annex 2 and town centre boundaries are 
shown on the Local Plan Policies Map. The primary shopping area of a town 
centre is an area with a concentration of retail uses as defined in the NPPF. 
The boundaries of primary shopping areas are also shown on the Policies 
Map. In the Central Activities Zone (CAZ) proposals for retail, service, leisure, 
recreation and other appropriate uses should be focussed on the identified CAZ retail clusters and the Lower Marsh/The Cut/Leake Street Special Policy 
Area. However, such proposals will be acceptable elsewhere in the Central 
Activities Zone without the need for a sequential test, provided any impact on the identified CAZ retail clusters and Lower Marsh/The Cut/Leake Street 
Special Policy Area is carefully considered first.
6.53 Future comparison retail capacity is taken from the Greater London Authority’s 
report on Consumer Expenditure and Comparison Goods Floorspace Need 
in London (Experian, October 2017). The figure in the policy relates to the 
period 2015-2041 and is a net figure derived from the ‘baseline’ scenarios in 
the study. The quantum of net additional retail floorspace completed in the 
borough will be monitored. 
6.54 When considering whether a development is of an appropriate scale, consideration will be given to factors such as the size and amount of town 
centre floorspace being provided and where this is appropriate when 
considering the size, role and function of the centre and its catchment in 
relation to the town centre network set out in Annex 1 of the London Plan and 
Annex 2 of the Local Plan.
6.55 Active frontage uses in a town centre are those that bring activity to the street frontage through a flow of people entering and leaving the premises at ground 
floor level and a glazed façade through which activity can be seen from the 
street. This natural surveillance also has potential to discourage crime and anti-
social behaviour. All commercial, business and service uses, learning and non-
residential institutions, local community uses and appropriate sui generis uses such as beauty salons or nail bars; launderettes; nightclubs; cinemas; bingo 
halls; concert halls; dance halls; live music venues; public houses, wine bars 
and drinking establishments; hot food takeaways and theatres at ground floor will be expected to be designed to provide an active frontage. Amusement 
arcades are not considered to provide an active frontage when the interior 
cannot be viewed from the street. Mini-cab and private hire vehicle offices are 
considered appropriate sui generis uses within town centres, subject to the 
requirements of Local Plan policy T9. Residential use of ground floor premises in the middle of a town centre shopping parade can detract from the vitality 
and viability of the parade or centre and can raise safety concerns.
6.56 The London Small Shops Study (June 2010) defines a ‘small shop’ as 
being one of around 80m2 gross internal floorspace or less, occupied by an 
independent retail or service outlet which has nine units or less (as per the 
Goad definition). Re-provision of small shop premises ‘on affordable terms’ 
means at less than market rents. T o table of contents101

 T o table of contents6.57 Centre-specific policies which clarify the approach to managing the 
proportions of shops and food and drink uses in major and district centres and 
the CAZ retail clusters are set out in the Places and Neighbourhoods section 
of the Plan. The approach for all local centres is addressed in Local Plan policy 
ED11. The two other centres in Lambeth are cross borough district centres, 
the majority of which falls within the neighbouring borough (Lavender Hill/Queenstown Road and Camberwell). For the purposes of assessing proposals 
affecting shop units within these two centres, Local Plan policy ED11 will 
apply.
6.58 In applying the centre-specific approaches to managing the proportions of town centre uses set out in the Places and Neighbourhoods policies, the 
calculation of the proportion of units in a particular use should be made on 
the basis of ground floor units as originally constructed. It should also take 
account of unimplemented planning permissions for change of use.
6.59 Unless marketing evidence demonstrates no demand, larger units of over 
250 m2 are protected from sub-division in order to ensure a range of unit size 
within a centre, including units appropriate for use by larger multiple retailers. 
Evidence of active and appropriate marketing over a continuous period of at 
least one year will be required to support any claim that there is no demand 
for such retail space. This should include evidence that premises have been 
marketed at an independently assessed market value price by an agent that specialises in commercial land sales.
6.60 The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) and the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) 
Order 2015 (as amended) establish use classes and permitted development 
rights for some changes of use between classes. Planning permission is not 
needed when both the present and proposed uses fall within the same use 
class (such as within the E use class) or if a change of use is permitted to another specified class. Where necessary and justified, the council will use 
conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E 
to achieve the objectives of this policy and to maintain the function of primary shopping areas and ensure an appropriate mix of uses in town centres. The 
council will monitor the impact of the changes to the Use Class Order on the 
function of the town centre network. Further guidance may be provided in the 
form of a Supplementary Planning Document. Some permitted development 
rights are subject to a prior approval process. For the purposes of the prior approval process, ‘key shopping area’ is defined as being a designated town 
centre or CAZ retail cluster.  
Policy ED8: Evening economy and food and drink uses

iv. visual intrusion arising from service plant such as ventilation and air conditioning equipment;
v. size and scale of the proposal;
vi. operating hours;
vii. impact of delivery vehicles/services;
viii. traffic generation and impact on traffic flow and road safety.
C. Proposals for evening and food and drink uses should be accompanied by a management plan and a customer management plan, including mitigation measures for any negative impacts of these uses. Impacts such as noise and light pollution on local wildlife and biodiversity should be considered through appropriate location, design and scheduling to address the requirements of London Plan policy G6 Biodiversity and access to nature. 
D. The use of outdoor areas including garden areas, rooftops, forecourts and pavements in association with food and drink uses will be supported only where:
i. this would not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of adjoining residential property and the area generally, taking into account the size and type of the proposal, the hours of use proposed and the nature and character of the area; and
ii. in the case of pavements, the width of the footway is adequate to allow this without obstructing pedestrian flow, and the use is arranged so as not to be a hazard to people with disabilities and older people and families with small children. This may require a suitable means of enclosure to demarcate the extent of the use. Stopping up of public highway to provide private outdoor seating areas will be resisted, especially in town centres. 
E. Proposals for hot food takeaways will not be permitted if proposed within 400 metres of the boundary of a primary or secondary school. The opening hours of hot food takeaways may be controlled through conditions where this is considered necessary to manage impacts on neighbouring residential amenity. Operators are encouraged to comply with the Healthier Catering Commitment standards. Proposals for drive-through takeaways will not  T o table of contents103

drive-through takeaways for other uses will be supported, subject to other 
development plan policies. 
F. Applications for food and drink uses where home delivery of food is 
proposed should include a Delivery and Servicing Plan providing details 
of the scale of operation, delivery collection points, locations for parking 
of delivery vehicles/bikes and hours of operation, to enable assessment 
of impacts. In areas of high footfall or where there are highway safety 
or amenity issues, the council will not permit home delivery services. In other situations the council will seek to agree a management plan with 
the applicant.

6.61 Food and drink uses include cafes and restaurants, public houses, wine bars, 
drinking establishments and hot food takeaways. Evening economy uses 
include food and drink uses, night clubs, live music and/or dance venues 
and other entertainment activities. Where necessary and justified, the council 
will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within 
Class E in order to achieve the objectives of this policy, to manage the impact of food and drink uses on amenity and to avoid the proliferation of main town 
centre uses outside of town centres.
6.62 Sensitive uses include nursing homes, older people’s accommodation, 
hospitals, hospices and places of worship. 
6.63 The evening economy in areas such as Clapham High Street, Brixton and Vauxhall has brought investment and vitality into local areas and the London 
Plan identifies many of Lambeth’s town centres as making a significant 
contribution to London’s evening and night-time economy. However, this can 
have negative impacts on local residents and the local environment needs to 
be carefully managed. See the policies for the Places and Neighbourhoods in Section 11 and in particular, policy PN3 in relation to the Brixton night-
time economy management zone. The council will monitor the impact of the 
changes to the Use Class Order on evening and food and drink uses, including any emerging harmful concentrations of these uses. Further guidance may be 
provided in the form of a Supplementary Planning Document.
6.64 Licensing and planning are separate regulatory regimes. For licensable 
activities, consents under both regimes must be in place for a business to 
operate legally. Co-ordination between Planning and Licensing is therefore 
required at the level of individual applications. Lambeth’s statement of licensing 
policy sets out the council’s approach to licensing. 
6.65 The council is committed to improving the health of its residents and to 
reducing childhood obesity. The restriction of hot food takeaway shops 
within 400 metres from a school equates to a walking time of 10 minutes 
and will help to reduce pupils’ access to unhealthy food options. 400 metres  T o table of contents104

 T o table of contentswill be calculated on the basis of the shortest walking distance from the 
entrances and exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school. 
In accordance with London Plan policy E9, proposals for hot food takeaway 
uses may be conditioned to require the operator to achieve and operate in 
compliance with the Healthier Catering Commitment standard. Drive-through 
takeaways are not permitted because they promote car-use, which adversely affects congestion, air quality and public health. 
Policy ED9: Public houses
A. In accordance with London Plan policy HC7, the council will use its available planning powers to support the retention of public houses. In 
considering applications which require planning permission for the change 
of use, redevelopment and/or demolition of a public house, the council will 
consider whether: 
i. the public house use is no longer economically viable; a viability report 
must be submitted and this must include evidence of active and 
appropriate marketing over a continuous period of at least 24 months 
and evidence that all reasonable efforts have been made to preserve 
the facility;
ii. the proposal would not result in the loss of a service or facility of 
particular heritage, economic, social or cultural value to the local 
community; and
iii. the proposed alternative use will not detrimentally affect the vitality of 
the area and the character of the street scene.
B. Changes of use will only be acceptable where the criteria set out in part (a) of the policy above are met and there is no reasonable prospect in the 
medium term of re-use or refurbishment for an alternative commercial, 
business and service, community or appropriate sui generis use in town 
centres; or for an alternative social infrastructure use outside of town 
centres, demonstrated through marketing evidence. Where necessary and justified, the council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to 
limit uses consented within Classes E, F1 and F2 in order to achieve the 
objectives of this policy and to avoid the proliferation of main town centre uses outside of town centres.
C. If the public house is considered by the council to be either of townscape value or a heritage asset the council will seek retention of the building and 
any external features of interest, including characteristic pub features.
D. Schemes affecting public houses should not result in a loss of cellarage, 
staff accommodation or other features within the curtilage of the public 
house which might render the public house use unviable.
E. Proposals for new public houses will be supported within Lambeth’s town 
centres, subject to other development plan policies.  T o table of contents105

 T o table of contentsF. This policy applies to lawful public houses and sites previously in lawful pub 
use, whether currently in use as a public house or vacant. The council will 
have regard to the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) definition of a public 
house when applying this policy.
Supporting text 
6.66 Over recent years many pubs in Lambeth have been lost to alternative uses, or have closed and are currently vacant. Changes to the Town and Country 
Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) mean pubs are now a sui 
generis use. 
6.67 Public houses have an economic role, contributing to employment generation, the local economy and the vitality of an area, but they are often more than just 
private businesses. Many pubs also play a valuable role in local community life, 
providing a hub for social interaction, and contribute to the culture, identity, 
heritage and character of an area.
6.68 The council will resist proposals that would result in the loss of public houses, 
unless convincing evidence can be provided to show that the public house 
is not economically viable and is no longer required to meet the needs of 
the local community. Applicants will be expected to demonstrate that all 
reasonable efforts have been made to preserve the public house, including 
appropriate diversification options explored, and it has been proven that it would not be economically viable to retain the building or site in its 
existing use.  
6.69 Where applications for the change of use or redevelopment of a public house 
are received, the council will require evidence that: 
• a comprehensive sustained marketing campaign has been undertaken, offering the public house for sale as a going concern and using an agreed 
realistic independent valuation of the premises and in a condition that 
allows the property to continue functioning as a pub;
• the marketing campaign has run for a period of at least 24 months before the planning application is submitted, as specified in the London Plan;
• if marketing has been based wholly or partly on an alternative community or employment use, there has been prior discussion with the council on the 
principle of the proposal; 
• the public house has been offered for sale locally, and in the region, in 
appropriate publications and through relevant specialised agents; 
• it can be demonstrated that the public house is not financially viable; in order to determine if this is the case, the council will require submission of 
trading accounts for the last three full years in which the pub was operating 
as a full-time business; and T o table of contents106

 T o table of contents• the CAMRA Public House Viability Test, or a similar objective evaluation 
method, has been employed to assess the viability of the business and the 
outcomes (to be shared with the council) have demonstrated that the public 
house is no longer economically viable. 
6.70 When assessing whether a pub has heritage, cultural, economic or social value, the council will consider whether the public house meets the tests 
outlined in paragraph 7.7.6 of the London Plan. The listing of a pub as an 
Asset of Community Value will also be a material planning consideration. 
6.71 The council will also need to consider whether:
• there are alternative licensed premises within easy walking distance (400m) of the public house
• any such alternative premises offer similar facilities and a similar community environment to the public house which is the subject of the application
• the role the public house plays in the provision of space for community groups to meet, and whether the loss of such space would contribute to a 
shortfall in local provision, will be a material consideration in the assessment 
of applications. 
6.72 Where public houses are located in town centres, relevant town centre and places and neighbourhoods policies will also apply. Where the evidence 
demonstrates that the public house is not economically viable and is no longer 
required to meet the needs of the local community, the council will seek 
alternative uses that can provide an active frontage (commercial, business 
and service, learning and non-residential institutions, local community or appropriate sui generis uses) in line with policy. Outside of town centres, 
appropriate social infrastructure uses will be preferred and evidence of 
marketing for alternative social infrastructure uses will be required before a change of use outside of these use classes will be accepted.
6.73 Proposals for new public houses in town centres will be considered under Local Plan policies ED7 and ED8. The council will also consider issues such as 
licensing ‘cumulative impact zones’. London Plan policy D13 Agent of Change 
may also apply. 
Policy ED10: Betting shops and payday loan shops 
A. Applications for betting shops will not be permitted: 
i. in district centres, other than West Norwood, where this would lead to an over concentration defined as being more than three betting shops 
or more than 1 in 10 consecutive premises; or
ii. in local centres where this would lead to an over concentration defined 
as being more than one betting shop per centre; or
iii. where it would lead to an increased perception or likelihood of reduced vitality and commercial viability in the area; or T o table of contents107

anti-social behaviour and disturbance to local residents and users of 
the town centre and a risk to the level of crime.
B. Applications for payday loan shops will not be permitted: 
i. in local and district centres where this would lead to an over-
concentration of such uses, defined as being more than one per 
centre; or 
ii. it would lead to an increased perception or likelihood of reduced vitality 
and commercial viability in the area. 
C. The approach to betting shops and payday loan shops in Waterloo, Brixton, Streatham and West Norwood/Tulse Hill is set out in their respective Places 
and Neighbourhoods policies. 
Supporting text 
6.74 Too many betting shops and payday loan shops in one area can lead to a 
negative impact on the vitality and viability of a town centre, discourage other 
investors and affect the quality of life of those living nearby. This can result 
in the perception that a centre’s retail offer is weak and that the centre is in 
decline. Betting shops and payday loan shops are sui generis uses.
6.75 Proposals for betting shops, in particular, are unlikely to receive favourable 
consideration if located near a predominantly residential area. In such locations 
noise, litter, general disturbance and the generation of additional traffic, both 
vehicular and pedestrian, would be likely to give rise to conditions which would 
have an adverse effect on amenity and cause inconvenience to neighbours. 
Over-concentrations of betting shops and payday loan shops can also have both direct and indirect impacts on health and wellbeing. 
6.76 When assessing whether a betting shop is likely to give rise to anti-social behaviour, disturbance to local residents and town centre users and risk to 
the level of crime, consideration will be given to whether the proposed betting 
shop is within walking distance of a public house. This equates to 400 metres 
measured on the basis of the shortest walking distance curtilage to curtilage. 
6.77 The calculation of the proportion of units in payday loan shop or betting 
shop use should be made on the basis of original ground floor units within 
the whole of the town centre. This calculation should also take account of 
unimplemented planning permissions for change of use. 
Policy ED11: Local centres and dispersed local shops 
A. The council will support and protect the role of local centres and local shops in meeting the day to day needs of communities. Active frontage 
uses, and particularly retail uses, will be encouraged and protected. Where  T o table of contents108
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsnew ground floor units are created, generally 50 per cent of this ground 
floor floorspace should be in commercial, business and service use. Where 
necessary and justified, the council will use conditions/and or planning 
obligations to limit uses consented within Class E to achieve the objectives 
of this policy.
B. To ensure the vitality, viability and function of local centres, the change of 
use of ground floor units will be supported only where the use proposed 
is an active frontage use and an appropriate mix and balance of uses is 
retained. The requirements of Local Plan policies ED8, and ED10 also 
apply. 
C. Exceptionally, the loss of active frontage uses within local centres will be 
allowed where it is demonstrated that:
i. the premises have been actively marketed over a continuous period of at least one year for an active frontage use compatible with the 
function of the centre, and it has not been possible to secure an 
occupier; and
ii. the proposal would not detrimentally affect the character of the centre.
D. The loss of dispersed local shops outside of local centres will only be supported where:
i. the premises have been actively marketed over a continuous period of at least one year for an alternative shop or social infrastructure use 
compatible with the location, and it has not been possible to secure an 
occupier; and 
ii. there is a town centre or accessible provision of essential daily goods within reasonable walking distance (within 400m).
Supporting text 
6.78 There are 42 designated local centres in Lambeth, which are listed in Annex 2 and also shown on the Policies Map. In addition, there are many smaller 
parades and solitary shops throughout the borough which are not designated 
centres. Having key local retail uses such as newsagents, chemists, grocers, 
and bakers within walking distance of home is important to many of our 
residents and these local centres and dispersed local shops provide a valuable service in meeting the day to day needs of communities. They also 
have a range of wider benefits, including providing locally accessible facilities 
for low income groups, the elderly and people with mobility difficulties, play an important social role, provide local employment and contribute to the 
character and identity of an area.
6.79 The council wishes to ensure that the retail and service function of local 
centres is maintained and enhanced. The planning powers available to local 
authorities to ensure that local centres fulfil this function are restricted; the 
council is unable to specify what types of shop uses locate in local centres  T o table of contents109
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsand cannot control changes of occupier within the E use class as planning 
permission is not required. However, the council will seek to ensure that local 
centres provide a good mix of appropriate commercial, business, service, 
community, learning and non-residential institution uses.
6.80 Changes of use will be managed to promote a good quality retail offer within local centres and a variety of local shops and services that meet local needs. 
The loss of ground floor active frontages, particularly where this results in a 
break in the continuity of frontages, can undermine the vitality and viability of a 
centre or parade and will not be permitted unless it is demonstrated through 
marketing evidence that the unit is unlikely to be let for an active frontage use (see paragraph 6.26). The provision of community uses may be appropriate to 
support the viability and vitality of the local centre in preference to a change of 
use to residential.
6.81 The aim of retaining active frontage units should not result in long-term vacancies, particularly where there is no prospect of achieving an occupier. 
Nevertheless, the council would need to be satisfied that every effort has 
been made to let premises for an active frontage use (as defined under Local 
Plan policy ED7, excluding hot food takeaways in close proximity to schools) 
before accepting the loss of units to other uses such as residential. Evidence of active and appropriate marketing over a continuous period of at least one 
year will be required to support any claim that there is no demand for retail 
space or other appropriate active frontage use. This should include evidence that premises have been marketed at an independently assessed market value 
price by an agent that specialises in commercial land sales. Applications must 
also demonstrate that proposals will, through careful design, provide a high 
standard of amenity for residential occupants.
6.82 A key priority for business growth and the economic quality of life in the 
borough is to reduce the number of vacant shops by supporting the 
community and businesses to occupy empty premises, including on a 
temporary basis. 
6.83 Proposals affecting ground floor shops should retain or provide a shop-front with a window display.
6.84 Reasonable walking distance will be assessed based on a safe walking route using public highways and footways.
6.85 This policy also applies to the parts of Lavender Hill/Queenstown Road and Camberwell district centres that fall within Lambeth.
Policy ED12: Markets 
A. Proposals for new off-street permanent, indoor or street markets, car boot sales and temporary markets will be supported provided that:

iv. there would not be an unacceptable impact on traffic flow or increase 
in traffic congestion in the area.
B. The council will seek to maintain, and support the enhancement of, existing indoor and street markets within the borough. Developments that would 
adversely affect existing indoor or street markets will not be permitted. 
Where construction of a development could adversely affect a street 
market, applicants should assess this impact and propose mitigation 
measures to ensure the street market can continue to operate. 
Supporting text 
6.86 Markets add to the vibrancy, social value and character of local areas. Lambeth’s markets are well established and popular with local communities 
and visitors. However, if poorly designed and managed they can cause harm 
to surrounding areas in terms of congestion of local roads and pavements, 
rubbish and refuse, storage and noise. 
6.87 The council wishes to see all of the markets in the borough continue to thrive 
and will encourage a coordinated approach to development and management 
of street and indoor markets, including the implementation of the Brixton 
Street Market Masterplan and Action Plan, once finalised. A specific approach 
to managing the mix of uses within the indoor markets in Brixton is set out in 
Local Plan policy PN3.
6.88 Proposals for new markets considered under a) will also be subject to the requirements of section b) of the policy.
Policy ED13: Visitor attractions, leisure, arts and cultural uses 
A. In accordance with London Plan policy HC5, the council wishes to promote, safeguard and improve leisure, recreation, arts and cultural 
facilities in the borough where they meet local and wider needs, especially 
in the Central Activities Zone, Vauxhall and Waterloo London Plan 
Opportunity Areas and in town centres.
B. Visitor attractions and major leisure and cultural activities located in the 
Central Activities Zone, Vauxhall and Waterloo London Plan Opportunity 
Areas and Brixton and Streatham major town centres will be supported. 
Proposals should demonstrate in a visitor management plan how the 
potential impacts of high volumes of visitors would be managed, including

any additional public service provision and maintenance, including local 
transport services, required as a result of the development in accordance 
with the approach set out in Annex 9. Planning obligations may also be 
sought for improvements to the public realm, especially on routes to and 
from public transport nodes. 
C. Change of use or loss of existing visitor attractions, leisure, arts and cultural uses will not be permitted. Redevelopment for mixed use will only be 
supported where the existing use is re-provided on site, or a replacement 
facility is provided elsewhere in the locality. In exceptional circumstances, 
commuted payments may be accepted for replacement leisure, arts or 
culture uses elsewhere in the borough.
D. Commercial development related to cultural facilities on the South Bank and in Waterloo will be supported where it is associated with arts and 
cultural uses or is ancillary and complementary to the arts and cultural uses 
and where it can be demonstrated that:
i. it is essential to the development and/or the retention of arts and cultural facilities;
ii. it would not undermine the primary character and function of the South Bank as an arts and cultural quarter; and
iii. any enabling development supports and enhances the function and role of the arts or cultural facility that is proposing the development. 
E. Temporary use of vacant commercial premises, open space and public realm for performance and creative work will be supported, subject to 
the nature of the proposed activity and the requirements of other policies. 
Open space will be expected to be returned to its previous use and 
improvements made to the quality of the open space.

6.89 Lambeth has many cultural venues and facilities which are identified in the 
London Cultural Infrastructure Map and the Lambeth Cultural Infrastructure 
list. The council wishes to safeguard and improve leisure, recreation, arts and 
cultural facilities such as art centres, art galleries, museums, cinemas, dance 
and music performance venues and theatres, where they meet local and wider 
needs, especially in town centres, unless adequate replacement provision is made. These uses will be primarily assessed against Local Plan policy ED13. 
Some more local community facilities, such as community halls and meeting 
spaces, libraries, indoor play, indoor recreation and sports facilities, as well as pubs and open spaces, also make an important contribution to the cultural life 
of the borough because they provide space for cultural activities and events.

6.90 Major development proposals for leisure, recreation, arts and cultural facilities should be accompanied by a visitor management plan, which addresses 
how the impacts of high volumes of visitors will be managed, including any 
implications for public services, including local transport services. Planning 
obligations will be sought to mitigate any negative impacts identified. Financial 
contributions towards management and maintenance arrangements will be calculated in accordance with the charging approach set out in Annex 9. 
Proposals for arts and cultural programming will be considered against Local 
Plan policy Q4. All proposals should address the requirements of public safety set out in policy Q3. 
6.91 The London Plan designates the whole of the South Bank/Bankside as a Strategic Cultural Area in recognition of its role as a strategically important area 
for arts, culture and entertainment and one of London’s leading international 
cultural and tourist destinations. In Lambeth, the South Bank Strategic 
Cultural Area extends from Westminster Bridge to the borough boundary with 
Southwark, bounded by Belvedere Road and Upper Ground. This includes County Hall, the Southbank Centre (a national arts complex comprising the 
Festival Hall, Hayward Gallery, National Poetry Library, Queen Elizabeth Hall 
and Purcell Rooms), the National Theatre and the British Film Institute (BFI). The regeneration of the South Bank is a priority for the council as well as all 
major stakeholders in the area. This is recognised in the vision and strategic 
objectives of the Local Plan and in policy PN1 – Waterloo. 
6.92 The criteria for enabling development listed in section (d) of the policy will be applied to proposals for commercial development within the South 
Bank Strategic Cultural Area that are associated with or ancillary to, but not 
specifically for, arts and cultural uses. This will normally be secured through 
a legal agreement. A reasonable proportion of restaurant and café uses will 
be considered enabling development that supports the function and role of arts and cultural uses however other uses, for example hotels and residential 
accommodation, will not. 
Policy ED14: Hotels and other visitor accommodation 
In accordance with London Plan policy E10: 
A. Visitor accommodation (C1) will be supported in town centres, where it 
does not cause unacceptable harm to local amenity and the balance and 
mix of local land uses. Outside town centres, proposals for new visitor 
accommodation will be assessed against the sequential test for main town

accommodation in a way that causes unacceptable harm to local amenity or the balance of local land uses. 
C. Additional visitor accommodation (C1) will only be permitted in Waterloo within the boundary of the Central Activities Zone (CAZ) where it does not 
cause unacceptable harm to local amenity or the balance and mix of local 
land uses.
D. Proposals to extend existing visitor accommodation will only be supported in the locations set out in clauses a) and b), subject to the other 
requirements of this policy being met.
E. In all locations set out in clauses a) and b), proposals for visitor 
accommodation (C1) will be acceptable only where it can be demonstrated 
that the development does not compromise a site’s capacity to meet the 
need for conventional dwellings, especially affordable family homes. 
F. Proposals for new or extended visitor accommodation should include an assessment of impact on neighbouring residential amenity, including 
cumulative impact taking account of existing hotels nearby. Where 
necessary, measures to mitigate harm to residential amenity will be secured

6.93 Given the significance of tourism to London’s and Lambeth’s economy it is important that Lambeth contributes to meeting the accommodation needs of 
tourists and business visitors. There are many benefits of the visitor economy 
including training and employment opportunities and local spending within 
the area, particularly for local businesses. In recent years, Lambeth has 
made a strong contribution to London’s supply of new hotel rooms. The borough’s pipeline and stock of new hotel rooms is largely concentrated in 
the north of the borough. There is also a good supply of other forms of visitor 
accommodation including short-term lets and the use of student halls during university holiday periods that supplements the supply of traditional serviced 
visitor accommodation. 
6.94 To support the growth of the visitor economy in other parts of the borough, 
visitor accommodation is encouraged to locate in Lambeth’s major and 
district centres. The provision of a range of types of visitor accommodation in 
Lambeth is supported, including budget and mid-range accommodation and 
accommodation for business travellers. 
6.95 Whilst Lambeth recognises the economic benefits of visitor accommodation, 
it is important to ensure an appropriate mix and balance of uses in each 
neighbourhood and to avoid significant concentrations of one type of use at 
the expense of others. The policy therefore sets out an approach to managing 
the intensification of visitor accommodation in the north of the borough where 
the greatest concentrations of this use exist. 
6.96 When considering whether a proposal is of an appropriate scale, regard will be had to the location of the site and local circumstances. ‘Balance and 
mix of uses’ will be assessed on a site by site basis having regard to the  T o table of contents115
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentscharacteristics of an individual locality, including existing concentrations 
of visitor accommodation, and the nature and scale of the proposed 
development. Generally, two uses of this nature will not be permitted on 
adjacent sites. This assessment will take account of the visitor management 
plan provided and the potential to effectively mitigate negative impacts on the 
local area through planning obligations.
6.97 In accordance with the London Plan, strategically important visitor accommodation will only be supported in the parts of Waterloo and the 
Vauxhall Nine Elms Opportunity Areas that are in the CAZ. Strategically 
important visitor accommodation is defined as having floorspace of more 
than 20,000m
2 (GIA). To ensure the council can meet the need for other 
uses, including housing, office and other strategic functions of the CAZ, hotels in Vauxhall will be expected to be part of mixed-use developments. 
When considering whether a proposal intensifies the provision of serviced 
accommodation and whether this causes unacceptable harm to local amenity 
or the balance of local land uses, the council will have regard to the location of the site and local circumstances. Generally, two hotels will not be permitted on 
adjacent sites to prevent concentrations of this type of use. 
6.98 When considering whether a proposal for visitor accommodation would 
compromise capacity to meet the need for conventional dwellings in the 
borough the council will have regard to:
• whether a proposal would displace existing C3 residential accommodation 
• whether a site has been allocated for housing 
• whether a site has been identified in the Local Plan housing trajectory as 
having capacity for conventional housing 
• whether a site has an extant planning permission for C3 housing. 
6.99 See Topic Paper 5: Visitor accommodation for further justification of the policy approach. 
6.100  An Inclusive Design Statement should demonstrate new visitor accommodation is meeting the requirements of London Plan policies 
E10 and D5. The needs of those requiring additional access features and 
assistance should be considered alongside the requirements for wheelchair 
accessible rooms. 
6.101  Information about the National Quality Assessment Scheme and quality 
standards can be found at www.visitenglandassessmentservices.com.
6.102  To ensure that hotels provide facilities for business visitors, new hotels will be expected to provide ancillary spaces such as meeting rooms and flexible 
working areas, unless it is demonstrated not to be feasible because the hotel 
is too small to accommodate them. In areas with an identified shortage of 
workspace and meeting space, the council will explore potential for these 
business facilities to be made available for use by other local small businesses at agreed times. Where there is an identified shortage of leisure facilities in the 
location of the proposal (particularly swimming pools, gyms and other indoor  T o table of contents116
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsor outdoor sports facilities) as set out in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, the 
council will explore the potential for any leisure facilities of this type provided 
as part of the hotel to be made available for use by the general public at times 
to be agreed with the council. This provision and associated maintenance 
requirements of both business and leisure facilities will be secured through a 
legal agreement. 
6.103  Proposals for short-stay apartments intended for people visiting London will be considered as C1 visitor accommodation. Proposals for the use of existing 
C3 accommodation as short-term lets will be considered against Local Plan 
policy H3.
6.104  The council will publish annual monitoring information on visitor accommodation in the borough. 
Policy ED15: Employment and training 
A. In accordance with London Plan policy E11, the council will support employment and training schemes to maximise local employment 
opportunities and help address skills deficits in the local population. 
Planning obligations will be used to ensure major development proposals 
contribute to this aim by fulfilling the requirements set out below. 
B. Applications for major development must include a site-specific 
Employment and Skills Plan (ESP) and the developer will be expected to 
agree to deliver the commitments secured in the ESP . The ESP should 
address, in detail, how the developer intends to deliver the following 
requirements:
i. A target of 25 per cent of all jobs created by the development (in both 
the construction phase and net additional jobs for the first two years of 
end-use occupation of the development) to be secured by the council 
for local residents.
ii. Developers to engage with local schools, colleges and/or community organisations to promote amongst young people the range of careers 
available, skills and qualifications needed for employment in the 
construction and commercial sectors of the end-use occupiers in place 
during the first two years of the development. 
iii. The council will expect the developer to make all reasonable 
endeavours to meet the obligations set out in (i) and (ii), above. The 
developer is expected to make or bring about the necessary provision 
to meet these obligations. However, if the developer can demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the council that there are circumstances specific 
to the scheme such that either direct provision is not operationally feasible, or that an alternative means of delivery would result in a 
more effective outcome, then the council may consider a financial 
contribution in lieu. In these circumstances, the amount of the contribution will be based on the calculation set out in Annex 9. T o table of contents117
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contentsC. In addition to the obligations in (b) above, major development proposals will 
be expected to make financial contributions to help support those sections 
of the Lambeth workforce that are furthest from employment, having been 
out of work for a long period of time and/or having low levels of skills. The 
financial contributions will be used by the council to fund local training 
and support to enable access to newly created employment opportunities arising from development for those who may struggle to access the 
opportunities without extra support, in particular the long-term unemployed 
and young people. The approach to calculating these financial contributions is set out in Annex 9.
D. Applicants will be required to provide monitoring reports on the implementation of their ESP at agreed regular intervals to enable the council 
to fulfil its monitoring obligations.
E. Payment of planning obligations relating to employment and skills will 
normally first fall due on the implementation of planning permission. A 
section 106 agreement will set out the detailed arrangements for the timing 
of payments in individual cases. Completed planning agreements will also 
provide for a monitoring fee linked to the overall package of obligations.

6.105  Promoting employment and training opportunities for local people will generate 
local employment opportunities and reduce the need to travel, which will 
contribute to sustainable economic development. Focusing activities mainly on 
those most marginalised from the workforce, including those that lack the skills 
required by employers, will help to reduce deprivation and inequalities and 
improve social inclusion. 
6.106  Seeking planning obligations to maximise the potential of the current Lambeth population to compete for the jobs being created, whether during the 
construction phase or end user phase, through improving their skills levels, 
is necessary to ensure that future development is economically and socially 
sustainable, and that barriers to employment for those marginalised from 
the workforce are removed. It is important the economic benefits of new development in terms of improved local skills and employment outcomes 
are realised.
6.107  Skills levels are a key determinant of a sustainable local economy, but they 
also have an impact on employment opportunities and thus an individual’s 
economic prosperity. Improving the skills of the local labour force will be 
key to maintaining its economic competitiveness. Securing obligations for 
employment training of local people will help to ensure that local residents 
are given access to the right skills training so they can take advantage of opportunities created by new development. The Council works with other 
London boroughs on programmes which can involve the sharing of job 
vacancies across boroughs. Opportunities secured from developments in Lambeth may be made available through these programmes. T o table of contents118
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contents6.108  In order to improve the prospects for young people in Lambeth, and ensure 
that local businesses are able to attract an appropriately qualified workforce, 
there is a need to better integrate the education system with the labour market 
and to expand the range of vocational routes into work (Work Foundation 
(2014) London: addressing the youth employment challenge).
6.109  Major development will be required to produce a site specific Employment 
and Skills Plan (ESP). Developers are encouraged to contact the council’s 
Employment team at the pre-application stage in the development process, 
so that the content of a proposed ESP can be discussed before a planning 
application is submitted. Funding to deliver activities contained in the ESP will 
be the responsibility of the developer.
6.110  The ESP itself will need to have been approved by the council by an agreed point in the development process (typically, three months prior to 
implementation, although exact timescales will need to be agreed as part of 
the detail of the planning obligations in individual cases). 
6.111  The ESP will need to contain realistic estimates of the numbers and types of jobs the developer envisages being created by the construction phase, and 
the number and types of net additional jobs created by the end-use phases, 
and actual figures will need to be supplied through 6-monthly monitoring 
reports. In assessing expected levels of employment generation the council 
will have regard to evidence on employment densities of end uses based upon standard employment density benchmarks. For example, the Homes & 
Communities Agency Employment Densities Guide 2015. 
6.112  It is expected that the developer will work with the council or its nominated 
agent and use all reasonable endeavours to achieve the 25% target through 
one or more of the following measures1:
• Provision of apprenticeships for Lambeth residents, with demonstrable 
targeted engagement of those aged under 252. The council expects that 
ordinarily, one new apprenticeship would be capable of being generated 
by every 1,000m2 of development or every 10 residential units provided3. 
Apprenticeships can be from the construction or end-use phase, or a combination of the two. These apprenticeships will need to be open to 
candidates nominated by the council (or another agency as agreed by the 
council) who are seeking recognised Level 2 or above NVQ qualifications.
1 Whether the r equirements at (b) (i) are satisfied by only one of the measures set out at 6.92,  
or by a combination of more than one of these, will be addressed as part of the process of 
preparing and approving the ESP . The same approach will be taken to the example measures 
set out at 6.93 for b (ii)
2 Aiming to encourage mor e young people into apprenticeships, in response to relatively high rates 
of youth unemployment in the borough.
3 The Gover nment has set a target of 3 million apprenticeships in England by 2020, which spread 
evenly would mean 750,000 apprenticeship starts per year. This equates to 2.6% of the total 
number of jobs. Based on standard employment densities, 2.6% would represent 1 or 2 people per 1,000m
2, depending on the use class and sector. T o table of contents119
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 6: Economic Development, Retail and Town Centre Uses
 T o table of contents• Provision of employment opportunities in the end-user phase which have 
appropriate support to make them suitable for long-term unemployed 
Lambeth residents4 (for example. those who have been out of work for at 
least two years). The council would expect every 2,500 m2 of development 
to be capable of generating at least one paid job placement lasting for a minimum of six months. These supported employment opportunities 
will need to be open to candidates nominated by the council (or another 
agency as agreed by the council).
• Provision for notification of job vacancies, arising from both the construction 
and end-use occupation, to the council or any other agency nominated by 
the council. 
• Provision for delivery of bespoke pre-employment and skills training for 
Lambeth residents that will provide them with the skills and experience to 
access the jobs that are being created.
6.113  The ESP will need to contain a detailed programme for the initiatives to 
be delivered to meet the requirements for engagement with local schools, 
colleges and/or community organisations for the purposes of careers 
education and inspiration for young people. Examples of the activities that 
developers (or agents that they may nominate to act on their behalf, which 
could include end-use occupiers) may be expected to undertake are: 
• Career inspiration: speakers provided to schools, role models to inspire and encourage career progression, work ‘taster’ events.
• Employability: mentoring and support for specific cohorts of young people (e.g. under-achievers, high achievers, young people from particular areas or 
estates), sessions on employer expectations, mock interviews and interview 
preparation.
• Curriculum support: advice on curriculum design to bring employer relevance into lessons.
• Work-based learning: workplace visits to complement curriculum, work experience placements.
6.114  Examples of scheme specific circumstances that may justify an alternative approach (see Local Plan policy ED15(b)(ii)) could include where highly 
specialised labour requirements are likely to be required by the end-
users of the development, or where there are demonstrable links with 
other developments, or with existing initiatives in the local area, relating to 
employment and skills programmes. The council encourages developers to engage with council officers at the earliest opportunity to discuss the specific 
circumstances of the scheme. Calculations relating to cash-in-lieu payments 
are indicative of the costs to the council of delivering the relevant obligations. 
4 This can also be r eferred to as “supported employment”. Supported employment refers to a 
personalised approach to working with people with complex needs, including individuals with 
disabilities, to access and retain open employment. T o table of contents120

Social Infrastructure 
7.1 Social infrastructure includes community meeting spaces, places of worship, 
libraries and premises for the delivery of essential services including education, 
youth services, childcare and early years; health and social care; sport, 
recreation and play; policing and the emergency services.
7.2 The policies in this section of the plan set out the approach to safeguarding and improving community premises and support for the development of new 
facilities where there are identified gaps in provision. They support the shared 
use of community facilities by different service providers and community 
groups, where practical, and underpin Lambeth’s co-operative council ethos 
by which communities have more involvement in and control of the services they use.
7.3 These policies are intended to facilitate the implementation of agreed strategies for the provision and improvement of community premises 
developed by, or co-produced with, the council in relation to community hubs, 
libraries, schools, youth services, early years provision, sport, recreation and 
culture; and by its partner agencies responsible for further education, health 
and the emergency services. The Infrastructure Delivery Plan provides a list of relevant infrastructure strategies and programmes. 
7.4 Local Plan policies S1 and S2 apply to facilities such as healthcare, childcare, higher, further and adult education, training, community halls and meeting 
spaces, libraries, indoor play, indoor recreation and sports facilities and 
places of worship. They also apply to other public service uses (such as fire, 
ambulance, policing, criminal justice and community safety facilities) which are 
not in a given use class and are categorised sui generis. Local shops, cafes, pubs, post offices and markets are covered by the policies in section 6 of this 
plan. Outdoor sport facilities and playing fields will be considered under Local 
Plan policy EN1.
7.5 State-funded nursery, primary, secondary, Special Educational Needs (SEN) schools and sixth forms are covered separately in Local Plan policy S3.
7.6 Site allocations are included where necessary in this section to achieve the delivery of essential social infrastructure projects during the plan period. 
See also site 11 in section 11 (Vauxhall), which includes provision of a new 
primary school.
Policy S1: Safeguarding existing social infrastructure 
A. The council will support and encourage the most effective use of community premises to address different and changing priorities and needs 
in the borough, in accordance with agreed strategies where relevant. T o table of contents123
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 7: Social Infrastructure
 T o table of contentsB. Existing community premises, and land formerly in use as community 
premises, will be safeguarded unless it can be demonstrated that either:
i. there is no existing or future need or demand for such uses, including reuse for other community services locally, and adequate alternative 
accommodation is available to meet the needs of the area; or
ii. replacement facilities are proposed on or off site of equivalent or better 
functionality to serve the needs of the area; or
iii. development of the site/premises for other uses, or with the inclusion of other uses, will enable the delivery of approved strategies for service 
improvements.
C. In exceptional circumstances, where tests (i) and (iii) are not met and it 
is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that it would not be 
feasible and/or effective to include replacement facilities in the proposed 
development, a payment in lieu may be accepted.
Supporting text 
7.7 It will continue to be important to safeguard existing social infrastructure unless there is adequate justification for the loss or provision for replacement facilities. 
Sports facilities in particular should also be tested against paragraph 97 of the 
NPPF. Where necessary and justified, the council will use conditions and/or 
planning obligations to limit uses consented within Classes E, F1 or F2 in order 
to achieve the objectives of this policy.
7.8 The functionality of the replacement facilities must be equivalent to or better than that of the existing provision. The applicant will be expected to provide 
an assessment of the existing provision (including factors such as size, quality 
of accommodation, facilities, accessibility, useage and potential for flexible 
use) and demonstrate how the proposed replacement accommodation will 
include equivalent or better provision. A smaller quantity of floorspace may be acceptable where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that the 
new accommodation can be used more effectively.
7.9 In order to demonstrate that there is no further need or demand for a building 
in use for social infrastructure, applicants should undertake the following 
measures as a minimum:
• explain the proposed loss in the context of the relevant strategies for social 
infrastructure in Lambeth listed in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and any 
subsequently approved strategies where relevant 
• where appropriate, seek confirmation in writing from the relevant agency 
that the proposed loss of premises is consistent with the agreed strategy 
for delivery of that service in Lambeth T o table of contents124
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 7: Social Infrastructure
 T o table of contents• market and advertise the vacancy for the existing use class continuously 
for a twelve month period and provide evidence of this, including a log of 
enquiries with reasons why the premises were considered unsuitable
• during this marketing period, notify the council of the proposed vacancy, 
so that community organisations, arts, sports and cultural groups seeking 
premises can be made aware of it.
7.10 In order to enable the delivery of the strategies for social infrastructure 
listed in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan (and any subsequently approved 
strategies), it may be necessary to maximise the development value of some 
existing sites and premises for other uses such as housing. If the need for 
the change of use is clearly demonstrated in the context of the relevant 
strategy, the requirement for marketing set out in paragraph 7.9 may not apply. Potential examples could include the disposal of a site in community 
use in one part of the borough where there is adequate provision, in order to 
fund provision or improvements elsewhere. This could also apply to agencies such as the police, fire or ambulance services in modernising the provision 
of their services for the capital and the borough as part of their infrastructure 
improvement strategies.
7.11 Under section (c) of the policy, payment in lieu of replacement facilities will be considered in exceptional circumstances only, where it has been 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that it would not be feasible 
and/or effective to provide this as part of the development or in kind off-site. In 
these circumstances, the applicant will be asked to explain why in their view in 
kind provision would not be feasible and/or effective. Payments in lieu will be calculated on a case by case basis, depending on the nature of the facility lost. 
Payments will be invested in improvements to community facilities elsewhere 
in the borough. 
7.12 Where premises have been registered with the council as an asset of community value under the Localism Act 2011, this is likely to be a material 
consideration in the determination of applications for the site for change of use 
to non-community related use.
Policy S2: New or improved social infrastructure 
A. Proposals for new or improved premises for higher, further and adult education, childcare, worship, health care (including hospitals), sports, 
recreation, affordable meeting space and other community uses will be 
supported where:
i. the site or buildings are appropriate for their intended use and accessible to the community; and
ii. the location, nature and scale of the proposal, including hours of operation, do not unacceptably harm the amenities of the area through 
noise, disturbance, traffic generation, congestion, local parking or 
negative impacts on road safety; and T o table of contents125
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 7: Social Infrastructure
 T o table of contentsiii. buildings and facilities are designed to be flexible, adaptable, promote 
social inclusion and sited be to maximise shared community use of 
premises, where practical.
The council will also apply the provisions set out in London Plan policies 
S1, S2, S3 and S5, where relevant.
B. The use of residential floorspace for a nursery or childcare use may be acceptable where:
i. there are a specific local need and locational reasons to justify this; and
ii. there is no readily available non-residential accommodation to meet this need in the locality; and
iii. it would not result in the loss of a complete residential unit and the remaining residential floorspace will continue to meet the standards 
required of a self-contained residential dwelling.
C. Development proposals for more than 500 residential units should 
incorporate suitable childcare provision to meet additional need arising from 
the development that cannot be met by existing local facilities. 
D. Proposals for more than 25 residential units should be supported by 
an assessment of anticipated impact on social infrastructure, including 
impact on the quality and sustainability of existing provision. Development 
proposals should include appropriate provision for social infrastructure 
to meet the additional need that will arise, where this cannot be met 
adequately through existing facilities. New social infrastructure should be made available to all residents, irrespective of tenure. Proposals should 
include a plan for the management and maintenance of the new facilities. If 
it is not possible or effective to meet the additional need through provision of new social infrastructure on site, a payment in lieu will be sought to 
contribute towards additional service provision in existing facilities in 
Lambeth, including for management and maintenance costs associated 
with the increased level of provision. 
E. Development proposals for schemes that are likely to be used by children 
and young people should address the requirements of London Plan 
policy S4B.
Supporting text 
7.13 Applications for new or improved premises to provide a community 
service should make reference to the relevant infrastructure strategy listed 
in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan, or a subsequently approved strategy 
where relevant.
7.14 New community premises should be conveniently located for those who use them, easily reached on foot or by bicycle or public transport and fully 
accessible to all sections of the community (including people with disabilities  T o table of contents126
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 7: Social Infrastructure
 T o table of contentsand older people). They should also be provided in buildings and facilities 
which are flexible and adaptable to communities’ needs and sited to maximise 
the shared use of premises and promote social inclusion. 
7.15 Community premises should be appropriate to their surroundings in terms of 
scale, character and mix of uses, and should not harm residential amenity, the 
environment, or result in adverse transport impacts in line with other relevant 
policies. Some facilities within residential neighbourhoods can have an impact 
on residential amenity which may need to be carefully managed. The hours 
of operation will need to balance the needs of service providers and users of the premises against impacts on neighbouring residents. Planning conditions 
will be used, as appropriate, to mitigate potential adverse amenity impacts. 
Where necessary and justified, the Council will use conditions and/or planning obligations to limit uses consented within Class E, F1 or F2 in order to achieve 
the objectives of this policy and to avoid the proliferation of main town centre 
uses outside of town centres.
7.16 There is a particular demand for places of worship in the borough, given the many and diverse faith groups represented in Lambeth’s population. In some 
cases, places of worship can attract large numbers of visitors for services 
and ceremonies and this can have an impact on highways and on residential 
amenity. Places of worship should therefore be located whenever possible in 
areas of high public transport accessibility, such as town centres. Proposals for change of use to a place of worship will be supported, subject to the tests 
set out in policy S2 (a) above and other relevant policies relating to the existing 
use of the land. The council will provide guidance to faith groups about finding appropriate premises that meet the requirements of planning policy.
7.17 Proposals for nurseries and childcare facilities that involve the loss of existing residential floorspace should be supported by a statement explaining the need 
for the facility in that location in relation to the council’s most recent childcare 
sufficiency assessment; and by an assessment of potential alternative non-
residential accommodation in the locality and the reasons why this was not 
suitable. Proposals for nurseries and childcare facilities should include access to an outdoor play area, of sufficient size and quality to meet the needs of the 
facility. This should be located away from, or be screened from, roads causing 
poor air quality. 
7.18 To facilitate implementation of section (c) of the policy, applicants should provide an assessment of the additional childcare demand that will arise 
from their proposal. This should include anticipated child yield for residential 
developments and anticipated demand from workers for major commercial 
schemes. The council will consider this information against its latest evidence 
of existing childcare provision (childcare sufficiency assessment) within one kilometre of the development site. Requirements to include or contribute 
towards additional childcare provision will be applied on this basis. 
7.19 In section (d) of the policy, the need for contributions towards community 
premises and other community facilities will be considered in the light of 
existing evidence of social infrastructure including the council’s online mapping 
tool, the Infrastructure Delivery Plan and any other relevant infrastructure  T o table of contents127
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 7: Social Infrastructure
 T o table of contentsprovision programmes. This assessment should include schools, children’s 
centres, primary healthcare facilities, libraries, community centres and 
any other forms of social infrastructure relevant to the site. There may be 
circumstances in which the contribution takes the form of land or buildings 
to provide for the identified need. Payments in lieu will be calculated on a 
case by case basis depending on the nature of the unmet need and will be used to contribute towards additional service provision in existing facilities in 
Lambeth, including for management and maintenance costs associated with 
the increased level of provision. 
7.20 Community facilities will not be permitted in Key Industrial and Business Areas (see Local Plan policy ED3). They will be supported on other employment sites

B. Where planning permission is required, proposals for new schools on sites in other uses will be considered against the relevant policies for those uses. 
The loss of existing residential accommodation (C3) in order to provide 
additional school places will only be supported if it is clearly demonstrated 
that the places are required to meet unmet demand for state-funded places 
in the borough and no alternative, suitable site is available.
C. Proposals involving the loss of land in use, or previously in use, by a state-funded school will not normally be supported, unless the council’s 
agreed strategy for school places has identified the site as surplus and 
its development for other uses would contribute to improvements in the 
delivery of school places in the borough.
D. Proposals for the shared use of schools for wider community use will be 
supported provided that the nature and scale of the proposal does not 
unacceptably harm the amenity of the area.

7.21 The need for school places in Lambeth, between 0-19 years and for Special Educational Needs (SEN), is set out in Infrastructure Delivery Plan and will be 
updated in the council’s annual assessment of needs for state-funded school 
places. A degree of flexibility may be required to meet changing needs and 
proposals will be considered in the light of evidence submitted and having 
regard to the government’s guidance.
7.22 In order to meet priorities and enable delivery of strategies to meet the need for school places in the borough, it may be necessary to maximise the 
development value of some existing sites and premises for other uses such 
as housing. This would need to be clearly demonstrated. This could include 
the disposal of a former school site in one part of the borough in order to fund 
provision or improvements elsewhere.
7.23 State-funded schools include local authority maintained schools (community, foundation and voluntary aided and controlled schools), academies and free 
schools. T o table of contents131

Policy T1: Sustainable travel 
A. In accordance with London Plan Policy T1, the council will promote a 
sustainable pattern of development in the borough, minimising the need 
to travel, maximising trips made by sustainable modes and reducing 
dependence on the private car in accordance with the Lambeth Transport 
Strategy and Implementation Plan.
B. The council will apply London Plan policy T2, Healthy Streets, in 
accordance with the Lambeth Healthy Routes Plan and Low Traffic 
Neighbourhood Plan, to facilitate trips by walking and cycling in order to 
reduce health inequalities.
C. In managing the road network, Lambeth will give priority to the movement of people according to the following hierarchy and this should be reflected 
in development proposals:
i. walking;
ii. cycling;
iii. buses;
iv. Licenced Taxis and Private Hire Vehicles (PHVs);
v. motorcycles/scooters;
vi. private cars.
The council will also promote and prioritise sustainable freight (see Local 
Plan policy T8).
D. Development that generates a significant number of trips will be required to be located in an area with an appropriate level of public transport 
accessibility and where public transport capacity can accommodate 
the proposed increase in the number of trips, or where capacity can be 
increased to an appropriate level through contributions, where this cannot 
be achieved through Transport for London or other agencies’ funding.
E. Development must contribute towards the improvement of inclusive access to public transport and the improvement and delivery of walking and cycling 
routes that serve the site. This could be achieved through the design itself, 
and/or through financial contributions, appropriate to the scale and impact 
of the development.  T o table of contents136

mitigation of transport impacts, including requirements for travel plans. 
G. All development should reduce road danger, to help meet the Mayor’s ‘Vision Zero’ target. Road danger should be reduced at source by limiting 
motor vehicle trips and identifying and delivering highway safety measures 
at and around the development site, including temporary measures during 
the construction phase.

8.1 The Lambeth Transport Strategy 2019 and Transport Strategy Implementation 
Plan sets out the council’s strategic vision for transport in the borough. 
Development is expected to support delivery its objectives. The key 
components of the Strategy are: 
Vision: 
• Our transport network is inclusive and has a positive impact on quality of life 
and the environment, helping us deliver more homes and jobs and ensuring 
long term sustainability. We prioritise walking and cycling and a high quality 
street environment and our transport network is safe and accessible to 
everyone. People want to live, work and invest here because we focus on 
people, not traffic, and create better places for all to enjoy.
Guiding Principles:
Sustainable Growth 
• Support new homes, jobs and investment through improved transport 
infrastructure and services.
Inclusive and accessible 
• Make our transport network more inclusive and accessible to all and ensure the benefits of improved transport provision are shared across the whole 
community.
Efficient and connected 
• Make our transport network efficient, allowing people to make quick and 
reliable journeys, supported by digital connectivity, reducing pressure on 
the physical transport network.  T o table of contents137
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentsActive and safe 
• Focus on people rather than motor traffic and enable people to travel safely 
and live healthier, more enjoyable lives. 
Clean air and carbon neutral 
• Take bold action to clean up our air and avert climate catastrophe. 
Strategic outcomes
• A radical overhaul of rail services delivers a high frequency ‘metro’ style service at our rail stations. 
• The vast majority of trips in the borough are made on foot, by cycle or using public transport and the impact of development related traffic is minimised. 
• Lambeth’s major town centres, district centres and opportunity areas benefit from the highest quality public realm, driving investment and 
attracting business and visitors from all over the world.
• The transport network in Lambeth is accessible to all.
• Pedestrians have genuine priority on our streets, with the whole street 
environment tailored to their needs.
• In Lambeth we have One Public Realm, with seamless access to all our streets and public spaces, regardless of housing tenure or land ownership.
• Motor traffic levels have fallen significantly across the whole borough. 
• Strategic roads prioritise the most space efficient modes (buses and cycles) for longer trips and the movement of goods. 
• Parking for private car owners does not dominate our public spaces and the council has harnessed new technology that reduces the need to own a 
car while retaining control of streets for the public good.
• Our transport network is safe and secure, people will feel confident about 
using public transport and our public spaces are well designed and 
maintained, encouraging people to interact and spend time together. 
• All of our neighbourhoods, schools and town centres are connected 
by ‘healthy routes’ that enable walking and cycling in a low / no 
traffic environment.
• We will remove barriers to active travel by investing in infrastructure and 
initiatives that make it easier to walk, cycle and access public transport. 
• Transport related emissions have fallen significantly so that air quality across Lambeth is well within safe limits.
• Our transport network is carbon neutral.
• Our transport network is resilient to the impacts of climate change.  T o table of contents138
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contents8.2 Lambeth will manage the local transport system in line with the road user 
hierarchy, and development proposals should be planned on the same basis - 
maximising the use of sustainable modes of transport. Development should be 
located and designed to be accessible by the whole community and promote 
social inclusion (including for people with disabilities and those with reduced 
mobility), and to reduce reliance on the private car. 
8.3 In accordance with London Plan policy T4, development proposals will be required to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the council, that the proposal 
is appropriate to the level of public transport accessibility of the site and 
available capacity by submitting a transport assessment or transport 
statement. In accordance with London Plan policy T4, development schemes 
will be required to submit a travel plan to ensure that occupants/users of the development benefit from sustainable travel options and reduce car trips. 
8.4 Transport assessments/statements should provide detailed information on transport conditions before, during and after a proposed development has 
been constructed, including in detail how conditions are likely to change, 
considering growth impacts. Where suitable site comparator data is not 
available this should be procured. Transport assessments/statements should 
identify and address transport problems associated with developments and provide solutions and also incorporate traffic reduction measures, including 
travel plans. Areas requiring improvements to support people with disabilities 
and reduced mobility should be identified. The form of development is expected to promote sustainable travel and transport assessments/statements 
should therefore not be prepared after a development is designed but at the 
design formulation stage to ensure transport impacts are addressed in the 
most appropriate and feasible way.
8.5 Development proposals resulting in permanent changes to the layout of the 
highway should be accompanied by a safety audit.
8.6 Travel plans and statements should include arrangements to monitor travel patterns including servicing activity, car and cycle parking occupancy and 
incentives and information to reduce car use and promote walking and cycling. 
The approach to calculating travel plan monitoring fees is set out in Annex 9. 
8.7 Conditions will be imposed and planning obligations used to secure mitigation measures required to make a development acceptable in transport terms 
and for the implementation and monitoring of travel plans and/or car parking 
management plans and cycle parking occupancy levels. Planning obligations 
will be sought where new development is demonstrated to have a negative 
impact on the operation or safety of the highway network, requires additional/improved public transport capacity, services or infrastructure, and/or requires 
provision for cyclists and pedestrians including routes serving the site. The 
council may require a bond to ensure trip generation does not exceed predicted levels with any resulting payments going towards sustainable travel 
measures. Planning obligations will be used to pay for works outside the 
development site where these are required to mitigate the transport impacts of 
the scheme. Any transport infrastructure affected by development proposals 
must be replaced at the expense of the developer.  T o table of contents139
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentsPolicy T2: Walking 
A. Lambeth will support the delivery of a programme of public realm 
improvements designed to create attractive places that encourage 
economic and social activity, improve conditions for pedestrians, and make 
walking a safer, healthier, quicker, more direct and attractive form of travel.
B. In line with the hierarchy set out in Local Plan policy T1(c), Lambeth will promote walking by giving greater priority to pedestrians in the 
use of road space, introducing appropriate motor traffic management 
measures, reducing road danger from other transport modes and through 
improvements to signage and way-finding.
C. Development proposals should deliver an improved environment for 
pedestrians, appropriate to the scale and nature of the proposal with 
particular regard to accessibility, safety, convenience and directness 
of movements, including provision of new routes and desire lines, and 
enhancement of existing routes with reference to the Lambeth Healthy 
Routes Plan. All development should reduce road danger, to help deliver ‘Vision Zero’ in the borough. Major development proposals should identify 
key routes and destinations and assess existing and predicted pedestrian 
flows to, through and from the site. They should provide safe, direct, and attractive routes that accommodate these flows and will be expected 
to provide improvements that will encourage additional walking trips, 
including, where appropriate, Legible London signage. Development 
proposals should facilitate the improvement of footways to minimum 
standards where these are not currently met, including through the provision of land for adoption as highway, and enable footway widening 
where increased footfall is expected. Reductions in footway space will not 
be permitted.
D. Pedestrian routes should normally be provided at street level, and Lambeth will seek opportunities to replace existing subways and footbridges 
with safe routes at street level. Planning applications must ensure that 
existing pedestrian routes and public rights of way are retained and where 
appropriate improved. Where new routes that will improve permeability are 
identified, rights of way should be secured for these. 
E. The council is committed to ensuring that the physical environment in Lambeth, including all our streets, is fully accessible to all. Provision 
for pedestrians should therefore be inclusive and prioritise people with 
disabilities and particular mobility needs.

8.8 Walking and cycling are the most sustainable forms of transport, with no environmental impact but many health benefits. Lambeth believes creating 
places that are safe and attractive to walk around is fundamental to good 
place-making. People should be able to walk around Lambeth without the  T o table of contents140
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentsdanger, inconvenience and unpleasantness often forced on them by the rest 
of the transport system. Almost all journeys, particularly those made by public 
transport, involve an element of walking. Provision for pedestrians should 
include children and people with disabilities and other mobility needs. Where 
space is to be shared between pedestrians and vehicles, the safety and 
comfort of these user groups must be considered and prioritised.
8.9 The council will seek opportunities to reduce the dominance of motor traffic, opening up more public space, the planting of street trees and other measures 
to make walking in the borough more enjoyable. This could include support 
for initiatives such as Home Zones. In appropriate locations, Lambeth will 
introduce traffic management measures to reduce through motor traffic. 
Lambeth’s Transport Strategy aims to reduce danger from motor traffic to make walking and cycling safer and more attractive.
8.10 Development of sites to higher densities can add to the numbers of pedestrians in an area, adding to crowding on pavements. Lambeth will take 
this into account when considering planning applications, and will ensure that 
pedestrian activity is properly catered for and that conditions for pedestrians 
are improved as part of development proposals.
8.11 Lambeth’s network of streets and footpaths allow easy pedestrian movement 
through the borough, and smaller paths can provide shortcuts or interesting 
routes away from motor traffic. The closure of such routes or their absorption 
into development sites will not normally be considered. Development 
proposals will be expected to contribute to improving routes and to improving 
safety on such routes, through more activity, more overlooking and better lighting. Existing subways and footbridges should be replaced with surface 
level pedestrian facilities where possible. Subways will be considered 
only where they provide a direct and convenient link to the underground rail network.
8.12 Public realm design considerations, including minimum standards for footways are set out in Local Plan policy Q6 and in Lambeth’s Healthy Routes Plan. 
Policy T3: Cycling
A. The council will apply London Plan policy T5 in accordance with the Lambeth Healthy Routes Plan to promote cycling.
B. Local Plan policy Q13 sets out the council’s quality requirements in relation to the provision of cycle parking. Lambeth’s Healthy Routes Plan sets out 
the quality requirements in terms of cycling infrastructure.
C. Lambeth will improve conditions for people to cycle and make cycling a 
safer, healthier, quicker, more direct and attractive form of travel. Lambeth 
will help to enable people who want to cycle to do so and seek to address 
concerns around road danger and air quality.
D. In line with the hierarchy set out in Local Plan policy T1(c), Lambeth will promote cycling by reducing motor traffic and through improvements to  T o table of contents141
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentsroutes, giving greater priority to cyclists in the use of road space, reducing 
road danger from other transport modes and through improvements to 
signage and facilities.
E. The council will require the provision of appropriate secure and covered 
cycle parking facilities in accordance with the minimum standards set out 
in London Plan policy T5 and with Local Plan policy Q13. When designing 
building layouts sufficient space should be allocated at the outset to meet 
these requirements. Development proposals for non-residential uses should 
include provision of showers, changing facilities, drying rooms and lockers for cyclists appropriate to the number of cycle parking spaces provided. 
In purpose-built student accommodation schemes, part of the required 
cycle parking provision could be provided as pool bikes. For other types of development, pool bike provision is encouraged in addition to the cycle 
parking requirement.
F. In all developments at least 25 per cent of the total cycle parking provision 
should be of the most accessible type, such as ‘Sheffield’ stands, of which 
five per cent of the total cycle parking provision should be designed and 
clearly designated for larger and adapted cycles. These stands should be 
spaced further apart and close to access points, to cater for users with 
disabilities and cargo bikes. For a development requiring 100 cycle parking spaces, this would equate to 20 spaces with standard Sheffield type stands 
and a further 5 in stands spaced further apart and close to access points. 
In all cases at least one Sheffield stand should be provided, close to the access point. The provision of folding bikes with storage will be considered 
where a high level of cycle-rail trips is expected.
G. In all developments at least one charge point should be provided to allow 
for re-charging of electric cycles and a charge point should be provided 
for a minimum of 1 in 10 cycle parking spaces. Charge points should 
be accessible to all cycle stand types, particularly those intended to 
accommodate larger/cargo cycles which may be more likely to require 
electric assistance.
H. Development proposals will be expected to enable and contribute towards improvements to cycle access, including the delivery and improvement of 
local and strategic routes and links, as identified in the Lambeth Healthy 
Routes Plan. All development should reduce road danger, to help deliver 
‘Vision Zero’ in the borough. In appropriate locations, developers will be 
required to contribute land and/or finance towards the delivery of new cycle hire docking locations and other public facilities ancillary to cycling, 
such as cycle pumps/servicing facilities. A minimum of three years free 
membership of the Cycle Hire scheme for all residents regardless of tenure, should be made available in new residential developments. Uptake of cycle 
hire business accounts should be encouraged for occupiers of commercial 
developments through the travel plan process. T o table of contents142

8.13 Cycling is a healthy, efficient, sustainable and effective form of transport which 
produces no emissions. In urban areas such as London, cycling often allows a 
journey to be made more quickly than by car. 
8.14 Lambeth’s Transport Strategy and Healthy Routes Plan aims to ensure that 
any member of the community who wants to cycle is able to do so easily and 
safely, and is not discouraged by road danger concerns. 
8.15 In order to enhance the convenience and attractiveness of cycling, routes 
need to be continuous and direct to facilities, places of work and interchanges. 
Lambeth will develop a network of high quality, continuous routes throughout 
the borough in accordance with the Healthy Routes Plan. These routes will 
provide protected space for cycling on busy roads, improvements to the 
permeability of the road network for cycling (through measures such as contra-flow lanes and filtered permeability) and will create a more cycle-friendly 
environment through reducing the volume and speed of motorised traffic.
8.16 Lambeth has one of the highest existing and potential rates of cycling in 
London and so will require enhanced levels of cycle parking as set out in the 
London Plan. The council considers that the quality of provision is paramount 
and will not support development that fails to deliver cycle parking to the 
highest standard accessible to all. Appropriate and adequate space within 
developments to allow this must be identified at the outset. Pool bikes are a bank of shared cycles available for use free of charge for a defined period. 
Pool bikes can be particularly beneficial to encourage the take up of cycling 
where occupiers may be unlikely to have access to their own cycle. For example, many students come to study for a short time and do not have 
access to their own bike in London. A small proportion of the required student 
accommodation cycle parking provision can therefore be provided as pool 
bikes, depending on the nature and location of the student accommodation. 
Pool bikes may also be beneficial in workplaces for business-related trips but should not form part of the required cycle parking provision for this type of 
use. Pool bikes should be freely available to use at all times, and demand for 
pool cycles should be continuously monitored, with any shortfall in provision 
made up.
8.17 Lambeth will seek the provision of convenient and secure cycle parking 
facilities particularly at key locations such as shopping areas, employment 
areas and transport interchanges, but also throughout residential areas. 
Staff and residents’ cycle parking spaces should be off-street, covered, well-
lit and secure. Visitors are usually better provided for by providing parking 
near entrances and active frontages in prominent, convenient locations. The requirements for cycle storage are set out in Local Plan policy Q13, and 
developers should also refer to the London Cycling Design Standards (LCDS). 
Residents’ cycle parking should normally be within the curtilage of the dwelling or, where this is not possible, in a secure, covered area where only a few 
(usually a maximum of 10) have access.  T o table of contents143
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contents8.18 Contributions of land and/or finance towards delivery of new cycle hire stations 
will be sought both within and adjacent to the London Cycle Hire Scheme 
operating area and in areas where the council is promoting complementary 
cycle hire schemes. Cycle hire caters for a different market/model of cycle 
usage to personal cycle ownership, so cycle hire access should be provided in 
addition to and not in lieu of the minimum cycle parking requirements.
Policy T4: Public transport infrastructure
A. Lambeth will seek better connectivity, quality, accessibility and capacity in public transport and development should support and enable the following 
projects, where appropriate:
i.  the Northern Line extension from Kennington to Battersea Power 
Station with an intermediate station at Nine Elms;
ii. improvements to capacity, access (including the facilitation/delivery of step-free access) and interchange at Waterloo and Vauxhall rail and 
underground stations;
iii. improved interchanges and east-west orbital links;
iv. an increase in the quality and frequency of train services to Lambeth 
stations through investment in station capacity, track layouts and 
signalling improvements as part of the ‘metroisation’ of rail services in 
the borough;
v. improvements to bus services in Lambeth, including bus priority measures across the borough and new services to the Vauxhall Nine 
Elms Battersea Opportunity Area, including bus services along the 
Albert Embankment, in support of Policy PN2 (k) in relation to areas 1 
and 2;
vi. improvements to facilities and the provision of step free access at 
railway and underground stations, including delivery of the Access for 
All scheme at Streatham station and other priority locations;
vii.  refurbishment and provision of step free access at Brixton rail station;
viii. new interchange at Streatham Common station;
ix. platform lengthening at Clapham High Street and Wandsworth Road to 
permit Victoria trains to call at these stations;
x. potential extension of the Croydon Tramlink to Crystal Palace; and T o table of contents144

 T o table of contentsxi. the delivery of Crossrail 2. 
B. Lambeth will work in partnership with Transport for London, Network Rail 
and other public transport providers to bring forward improvements to 
public transport infrastructure and services in the borough, including the 
strategic interchanges at Waterloo, Vauxhall and Brixton, and improved 
provision for buses.
C. The council will apply London Plan policy T3 to support and safeguard 
improvements to public transport.
D. Development proposals will be expected to provide, or contribute to the provision of, new and/or improved public transport infrastructure and 
services proportionate to the projected number of additional trips arising 
from the development and considering cumulative impacts of other 
approved developments in the area. 
E. Where appropriate, development proposals should improve accessibility 
to public transport by creating and improving walking and cycling links to 
stops or stations.
F. Proposals to improve or provide new public transport infrastructure and 
interchange facilities, including railway, underground and bus stations and 
bus stands will be supported subject to:
i. being acceptable in terms of impact on the environment including 
townscape, public realm and amenity of adjoining areas; 
ii. being designed to be safe, convenient, attractive and accessible for use especially for people with disabilities and specific mobility needs; 
and 
iii. providing adequate cycle parking and ease of access on foot, including 
consideration of pedestrian desire lines.

8.19 Accessibility to public transport is important to ensure that people can move around Lambeth with ease and connect with other parts of London. As 
Lambeth has a low level of car ownership, there is considerable reliance on 
public transport and this is expected to increase.
8.20 A high quality public transport system is essential to Lambeth’s strategy to promote sustainable travel patterns in the borough, with less reliance on 
private cars and increasing use of other modes. There is a need to continue to 
upgrade public transport infrastructure in the borough to facilitate the needs of 
the growing population and ensure that public transport remains an attractive 
and convenient mode of transport for all people in the borough. 
8.21 Improvements to the accessibility and quality of public transport infrastructure are required in order to maximise its use, especially by people with disabilities, 
the elderly, young children and others for whom limited public transport  T o table of contents145
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentsaccessibility is a barrier. Improvements to routes to and from public transport 
nodes (bus stops and stations) are critical in persuading people to use buses 
and trains. In accordance with the Lambeth Transport Strategy the council 
will prioritise step-free access at stations where the difference between typical 
journey times and step-free journey times is the greatest. 
8.22 Developers will be expected to contribute towards new and improved 
infrastructure including improvements to access and capacity and considering 
cumulative impacts from related development where appropriate. Such 
impacts should be calculated with reference to projected trips from consented 
developments in the area and should assess how this will affect highway 
capacity and operation and demand for public transport services.
8.23 The key transport infrastructure projects to be delivered during the plan period are listed in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Lambeth will also lobby for 
improved rail services from stations in the borough. Rail services currently tend 
to favour longer distance commuter routes and more frequent services and 
better connections are required to Victoria, Clapham Junction, south London 
and London’s airports. 
8.24 Although there are no planned stations in the borough, Crossrail 2 will have a significant beneficial impact on public transport capacity in Lambeth, by 
relieving rail services between Clapham Junction, Vauxhall and Waterloo, 
interchange with underground services at Vauxhall, the Jubilee line at Waterloo 
and the Victoria and Northern lines through the borough.
Policy T5: River transport 
A. Lambeth will support and promote use of the River Thames as a strategic 
transport route for passengers and freight.
B. The removal of existing piers will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that they are not required and that they are not capable of 
adaptation for the needs of river transport or other river-related purposes.
C. Proposals for new piers or improvements to existing piers for transport or 
river-related leisure uses will be supported provided they do not result in 
unacceptable harm to: 
i.  river navigation; 
ii. the effectiveness of flood defences;
iii. the hydrology, environment or biodiversity of the river; or 
iv. the setting of heritage assets. 
D. Proposals must be in keeping and appropriate to their context and include 
arrangements for safe maintenance, management and access which will be 
secured through planning obligations.
E. Development of sites on the Thames riverside must include a riverside walk 
at least 6 metres in width along the entire river frontage of the site which: T o table of contents146

 T o table of contentsi. is wheelchair accessible;
ii. incorporates provision for safe use by pedestrians and people who 
cycle;
iii. is well lit;
iv. is overlooked by activities within the development; and
v. is well linked to the adjoining street pattern with any new access routes designed to be safe and convenient for all users.

8.25 The River Thames is a major attraction and popular environmental feature and resource for London. It also has an important role for transport for commercial, 
public transport and leisure purposes. The safeguarding and improvement of 
access to and views of the river are required under the Mayor’s London Plan 
and River Strategy as well as maintaining and improving the riverside walk for 
use by people walking and cycling.
8.26 Where there are proposals which involve provision for leisure use of the river, or in other relevant situations, applicants should provide information on access 
and arrangements for visitors, ensuring that proposals would not lead to 
obstruction of the highway through queuing or the use of ticket booths.
8.27 The council will secure the provision of a continuous riverside walk and will secure necessary connecting routes through planning obligations.
8.28 Development proposals close to the Thames should maximise use of water transport by considering using the river for the transportation of construction 
materials and waste as part of the construction management plan. The 
potential for water transport will be assessed on a case by case basis based 
on the local characteristics of the site and potential for road access to nearby 
safeguarded wharves in the neighbouring London Borough of Wandsworth.
Policy T6: Parking
A. The council will apply London Plan policy T6 to promote a reduction in car ownership and private car trips.
B. The council will apply the maximum residential car parking standards set out in London Plan policy T6.1 apart from in PTAL areas 1 and 2, where the 
following Lambeth specific maximum standards will apply:  
 
 
 PTAL 2 Up to 0.25 spaces per unit

parking zone;
ii. avoid reliance on the public highway to meet the parking requirements 
of development, including in relation to parking for people with 
disabilities, motorcycle and coach parking. Where evidence is 
presented that it is not possible to accommodate parking requirements 
within the site the council will seek planning obligations in the form 
of a commuted sum, considering both the cost of implementation and maintenance of any parking bay and infrastructure for electric or 
other Ultra-Low Emission vehicles, as well as the opportunity cost of 
lost kerbside space, for example in terms of parking revenues. The approach to calculating commuted sums is set out in Annex 9. 
iii. make car club membership available to all residents in new residential development and in mixed development that includes housing, and 
provision of car club spaces where appropriate: all development 
schemes should promote and provide for car club membership or car 
pool schemes in place of private parking;
iv. comply with London Plan policies for motor-cycles, electric vehicle 
charging points and coaches;
v. ensure that all outdoor and open parking areas are permeable to water.
E. Parking in new shopping and leisure developments in opportunity areas and centres should serve the area/centre as a whole and not be reserved solely 
for use in connection with the development proposed. Preference should 
be given to short-stay parking. Blue Badge parking and cycle parking 
should be located closest to town centres and the entrance of facilities.
F. In mixed-use development, flexible, shared use of car parking should be 
provided with consideration of parking spaces for occupants such as 
families and older residents.
G. Lambeth expects that parking control and management should be 
consistent across the borough, regardless of land ownership or highway 
status. Parking regimes on housing land should be fully integrated and 
aligned with parking controls on the surrounding public highway.
H. Lambeth will consider the introduction of parking controls across the borough in order to manage demand for parking and allow for more 
efficient uses of the kerbside such as car club spaces, the creation 
of better conditions for walking and cycling and in line with carbon 
reduction objectives.
I. When considering parking impacts, the council will prioritise alternative 
kerbside uses supported in the Transport Strategy, such as car club cars,  T o table of contents148

J. The redevelopment of existing car parks and garages for other uses will be supported. Parking provision in development proposals on existing car park 
and garage sites should comply with the standards for the uses proposed 
and should not seek to replace or re-provide the parking spaces that 
existed previously.

8.29 Part of Lambeth’s overall approach to sustainable travel patterns and 
addressing congestion is to control and manage the availability of parking - 
both on and off street. In many parts of Lambeth, there are good alternatives 
to access by car for work, shopping and leisure trips, and “car-free” 
developments will be expected.
8.30 Lambeth is densely developed with pressure for further development, and 
minimising parking provision allows space for other uses and more efficient 
use of land. 
8.31 Lambeth will expect car-free development in most areas, with no general 
parking at all in areas with excellent, very good or good public transport 
access (PTAL 4,5 and 6) and limited parking elsewhere. Lambeth’s standards 
in areas with lower access to public transport reflect already low levels of 
car ownership in such areas, as well as projected modal shift to sustainable 
modes and the need to accommodate growth while decreasing car usage. Refer to ‘Lambeth Car Parking Standards Supplementary Information’ paper 
for more details. Public transport accessibility is assessed using Transport for 
London’s Public Transport Access Levels (PTAL), which measures access to public transport.
8.32 Non-residential parking for people with disabilities should be provided in line with London Plan standards, which require at least one bay, and state 
that ‘adequate provision’ should be made for people with disabilities. The 
appropriate level of parking for people with disabilities will depend on local 
factors including the nature of the development, site constraints, and existing 
provision. The availability of step-free access to public transport is also a relevant consideration, and where appropriate the developer will be expected 
to facilitate improvements to this. Wherever possible, the minimum initial 
requirement for parking for people with disabilities should be provided on-site in order to ensure convenient access and effective allocation of spaces 
to users of the development. A more flexible approach may be considered 
in meeting future demand over and above the initial requirement, subject to 
highway constraints.
8.33 ‘Car-free developments’ are developments where no on-site parking is 
provided and residents will be excluded from the council’s residents’ parking 
permit scheme. Where development involves the redevelopment of existing  T o table of contents149
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentsdwellings, all of the dwellings within the new development should be permit 
free. Section 106 agreements will be used to secure car-free developments. 
Car-free developments do not necessarily restrict provision for visitor 
permits and provision for Blue Badge parking will be made as appropriate, 
in accordance with London Plan policy T6.1. Site-specific solutions for Blue 
Badge parking will be considered on a case by case basis. The council will ensure that parking spaces for people with disabilities are not sold with 
individual residential units but will be made available for lease, in accordance 
with an approved car parking management plan. 
8.34 Lambeth has high levels of on-street parking stress. Without parking controls the council cannot prevent developments from adding to that stress and 
therefore will consult on new Controlled Parking Zones and review existing 
CPZs, and implement parking controls as appropriate. In areas where there 
are currently no on-street parking controls, developers will be expected 
to demonstrate that new development does not lead to an unacceptable increase in the level of on-street parking, or an unacceptable impact on 
highway safety. Developers will be expected to provide, or contribute towards, 
measures that prevent this from happening, including contributions towards the introduction of parking controls (see Annex 9) and also towards measures 
to promote sustainable travel such as improvements to public transport 
capacity and infrastructure for walking and cycling. 
8.35 ‘Car clubs’ and ‘pool car schemes’ are shared pools of cars available locally for short term hire and are a convenient alternative to car ownership. They 
allow for occasional car use but discourage unnecessary car journeys. There 
is now good coverage across Lambeth of car club bays and the council is 
aiming for a car club bay within 400m of each other to ensure convenient 
provision for all Lambeth residents. Car club spaces will be required where appropriate, preferably with public access to allow general use. The provision 
of car clubs is particularly relevant in areas less well served by public transport. 
All car club spaces, including on-street bays, should be supplied with an electric vehicle charging point to allow zero emissions vehicles to operate from 
the bay. Provision of car club membership will be required for all residents from 
first occupation of a development scheme. Planning obligations will be used to 
secure such contributions. 
8.36 Lambeth will require that any car parking is ‘tenure blind’ and allocated on 
a fair and transparent basis, with parking need prioritised over commercial 
considerations. In accordance with London Plan policy T6.1, the provision of 
car parking should not be a reason for reducing the level of affordable housing 
in a proposed development.
8.37 In redevelopment schemes, Lambeth’s parking standards will apply regardless 
of existing parking provision or permit availability. T o table of contents150
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentsPolicy T7: Servicing 
A. The council will apply London Plan policy T7 to promote sustainable freight 
and servicing.
B. New development, and in particular non-residential and mixed-use development, will only be permitted where adequate provision is made 
for servicing appropriate to the scale, form and location of the proposed 
development, including provision for commercial vehicles, ensuring 
that it is appropriate and acceptable in terms of impact on amenity of 
adjacent properties and road and traffic conditions of the location. Off-site consolidation to reduce the number of deliveries should be considered 
for larger developments or where access to the site is constrained, while 
smaller developments should also include consolidation strategies such as common and local procurement. Innovative local delivery and last mile 
logistics approaches should also be considered to further reduce traffic 
impacts and emissions, and minimise potential conflict with vulnerable 
road users.
C. Servicing should take place off-street within the development site. Where 
evidence is presented that this is not possible and it is demonstrated that 
servicing can take place from the public highway the council will seek 
planning obligations in the form of a commuted sum, considering both 
the cost of implementation and maintenance of any loading bay, as well 
as the opportunity cost of lost kerbside space, for example in terms of parking revenues. The approach to calculating commuted sums is set out 
in Annex 9. 
D. Planning applications for developments where the delivery/servicing 
requirements are of a nature where the type or number of trips generated is 
considered to be likely to have a significant impact on the adjoining public 
highway should be supported by a delivery and servicing plan. 
E. Planning applications for major development, and other development where construction related activities may lead to a significant impact on the 
surrounding public highway, should include a construction logistics plan 
or a construction management plan that is appropriate to the scale of the 
development demonstrating arrangements for construction traffic and how 
environmental, traffic and amenity impacts will be minimised. 
F. Developers and their contractors will be expected to adhere to the Construction Logistics and Community Safety (CLOCS) standard and 
be registered through the Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) 
or equivalent. They will be required to demonstrate in a construction 
logistics plan that they have considered the impacts of other construction 
activities in the vicinity of the site and where appropriate have co-ordinated construction activities with the developers and/or contractors of 
adjoining sites.
G. 24-hour servicing operations should be considered where appropriate to 
encourage and support out-of-peak deliveries in order to reduce motor  T o table of contents151
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentstraffic and road danger, minimising the impact of servicing at the busiest 
times, particularly in areas of high footfall. In these cases quiet delivery 
agreements should be considered.
H. New development should make use of existing consolidation and 
distribution facilities in order to minimise the number of trips required to 
service the site. Smart or joint procurement measures should be considered 
to reduce the numbers of deliveries and servicing trips as should the use 
of micro-consolidation centres. New micro-consolidation centres should 
be provided within developments where appropriate. The council will also support applications for new standalone micro-consolidation centres within 
the borough.
I. Zero emissions vehicles should be used for servicing wherever possible and 
consolidated deliveries are expected to be of this type. Servicing by cycle 
and other non-motor vehicular modes should be used wherever possible. 
Any on-street loading bay required for a development should be supplied 
with an electric vehicle rapid charge point to allow zero emissions vehicles 
to operate from the bay.
J. Planning obligations will be used to help secure and enforce appropriate arrangements.

8.38 Servicing provision is essential to the viability of commercial developments. Servicing, including waste collection facilities, must be provided on-site 
and vehicles must be able to pull clear of the public highway without 
causing obstruction, unless it is clearly demonstrated that this cannot be 
accommodated and adequate justification is provided for this. If servicing is 
to be undertaken on street, it must be demonstrated that it would not lead to obstruction of traffic including buses, or lead to adverse safety implications for 
vehicles and/or pedestrians.
8.39 This is particularly important in mixed-use developments where adequate 
areas for servicing must be designed in a way which does not conflict or cause 
adverse amenity impacts where residential accommodation is included as part 
of the scheme. Therefore, servicing should be integrated into the development 
at the early design formulation stages and not after the scheme has been 
designed. Last mile logistics schemes enable goods for a town centre to be delivered to one local consolidation centre and then distributed to businesses 
by local, less polluting modes such as bikes and electric vehicles. Lambeth will 
support such schemes where they reduce the number of vans and lorries and cut costs for businesses. 
8.40 The need to reduce the number of freight vehicles on Lambeth’s roads is growing. The movement of goods vehicles in the capital has increased 
by approximately 20 per cent since 2010, contributing to poor air quality, 
congestion and road danger. Lorries and vans currently account for around  T o table of contents152
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contents20 per cent of road traffic in London and around one third in central London 
during the morning peak, when more people use public transport, walk and 
cycle. The Mayor’s Transport Strategy includes an objective to reduce the 
number of lorries and vans entering central London in the morning peak 
by ten per cent, by 2026. Developers must therefore minimise the need 
for freight trips and seek to manage freight and servicing, demonstrating through transport assessments, construction logistics plans and delivery and 
servicing plans, how the environmental impacts and road danger resulting 
from servicing vehicles will be minimised. Servicing at off-peak times of day and night can reduce impacts on road congestion and air quality, and 
potential conflict with vulnerable road users. Where major developments give 
rise to environmental impacts arising from their servicing arrangements that 
cannot be fully ameliorated through the policy requirements set out above, 
planning obligations will be sought to enable other forms of mitigation (such as implementation of Low Emission Zones).
8.41 Cycle safety measures should be included in construction logistics plans for new developments, particularly to provide safe routes for cyclists during the 
construction period. Construction vehicles should meet or exceed minimum 
Direct Vision Standards and should be fitted with cycle safety equipment, 
including side bars, blind spot mirrors and detection equipment to reduce the 
risk of collisions on the borough’s roads. Minicabs, taxis, private hire and ride hail services.
Policy T8: Minicabs, taxis, private hire and ride hail services
A. Proposals for Private Hire Vehicle (PHV) offices and Licenced Taxi ranks will be supported in town centres and other areas where they will meet 
a demonstrable transport need and where they demonstrate through a 
transport assessment that their operation would not adversely impact 
on traffic congestion, local parking supply, capacity or need, pedestrian 
movement or road safety. 
B. Proposals will not be permitted where they would cause unacceptable harm to residential or wider amenity; or to highway safety or operation.
Supporting text 
8.42 Licenced Taxis and Private Hire Vehicles (PHV) are part of the transport system and aid the overall aim of seeking a lesser dependence on car ownership. It is 
recognised that Licenced Taxis have unique characteristics which differentiate 
them from other PHVs, such as greener vehicles, better wheelchair 
accessibility, and higher standards of driver training. While not considered to 
be sustainable travel modes, Licensed Taxis and PHVs provide an important service for people with mobility difficulties and should be part of ensuring 
safe transport options are available late at night. Interchange between public 
transport and Licenced Taxis and PHVs is important; however, proposals for  T o table of contents153
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 8: Transport and communications 
 T o table of contentssuch facilities must not compromise safety, traffic congestion and residential 
amenity. Designated Licenced Taxi ranks should be part of the transport 
network in town centres and other locations where there is a busy late night 
economy. Provision should be made in major schemes and within Licenced 
Taxi ranks to set down passengers and for pre-booked pickups by PHVs. 
8.43 Proposals for PHV offices and Licenced Taxi ranks can often have significant 
transport impacts including highway safety concerns from passengers 
alighting, vehicles turning in unsafe locations and reducing the amount of 
parking available to residents, visitors and other commercial uses. Proposals 
should be accompanied by a transport assessment and management plan 
that demonstrate there will not be an unacceptable impact. This should include assessments showing how adverse transport impacts will not be 
diverted onto surrounding streets, particularly residential areas. In particular it 
must be demonstrated that sufficient parking would be maintained for other commercial users in the area. Proposals for Licenced Taxi ranks should include 
provision of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
8.44 Where a high demand for Licenced Taxis, PHVs and ‘ride hail’ services is 
identified and where pick up and drop off is expected to take place on street, 
impacts should be mitigated through agreement of preferred pick up and drop 
off locations on the adjacent highway.
8.45 Particularly in relation to the growth in ‘ride hail’ services, there is a need to consider local amenity impacts where significant demand for these services is 
expected. Where this is the case agreements should be secured with service 
providers to ensure navigational systems direct both customers and drivers to 
designated ‘virtual’ drop off and pick up locations.
Policy T9: Digital connectivity infrastructure
A. The council supports the delivery of high quality digital infrastructure to 
enable the future expansion of electronic communications networks, 
including next generation mobile technology and full fibre broadband 
connections. The council will require provision for digital connectivity 
infrastructure in accordance with London Plan policy SI6.
B. Proposals for electronic communications equipment, including applications 
for determination for prior approval procedure under Part 16 of the General 
Permitted Development Order 2015, will be supported if:
i. the siting, height and design of the equipment will not cause harm 
to the character or appearance of the areas or the building on 
which it is located, including the significance and setting of historic 
assets, and will not be visually intrusive in the street scene or create 
unacceptable clutter; 
ii. it can be demonstrated that the equipment will meet International 
Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)  T o table of contents154

iv. in the case of structures on the highway (including equipment 
cabinets and other ancillary equipment), they do not result in clutter, 
cause an obstruction on the highway or block visibility splays - a 
minimum footway width of 2 metres should be maintained in all but 
exceptional circumstances;
v. obsolete/surplus equipment is removed and the building or land is 
restored; and
vi. it can be demonstrated that the equipment will not cause interference with other electrical equipment, air traffic services or instrumentation 
operated in the national interest.

8.46 Advanced, high quality and reliable communications infrastructure is essential 
for economic growth and social wellbeing and can help relieve pressure on the 
transport network by reducing the need to travel. It supports every aspect of 
how people work and take part in modern society, helps smart innovation and 
facilitates regeneration. Better digital connectivity with a focus on affordability, 
security, resilience and the provision of appropriate electrical power supply should be promoted across the borough. The council is preparing a Digital 
Connectivity Strategy to further this objective and support the aims of the UK 
Digital Strategy.
8.47 Electronic communications operators enjoy a general planning permission under Part 16 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General 
Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)(GPDO). This 
allows an operator to carry out the development permitted by Part 16 - subject 
to exclusions and conditions without making a planning application to the local 
planning authority. Certain development permitted under Part 16 is conditional upon the operator making a prior approval application to the local planning 
authority. 
8.48 In relation to part (iv) of the policy, see Local Plan policy Q6 regarding minimum 
footway standards.
8.49 It is important to ensure that installations, together with any necessary enabling works, will not result in unacceptable damage to visual amenity or 
harm to environmentally sensitive features or locations. Operators will therefore 
be required to demonstrate that proposals for electronic communications 
development have been sited and designed to minimise visual and 
environmental impact having regard to technical and operational constraints.  T o table of contents155

painted glass reinforced plastic (GRP) to camouflage all or part of the proposal 
– including the use of shrouds, screens and other camouflaging methods to minimise the impact of equipment in prominent locations.
8.50 Electronic communications equipment should not be sited in a way that makes it vulnerable to flood damage.
8.51 The council will expect all agents and operators to follow the government’s Code of Best Practice in respect of electronic communications development.

9.1 This section on Environment and Green Infrastructure provides policies 
on open space, biodiversity, green infrastructure, local food growing, 
decentralised energy, sustainable design and construction, flood risk, 
sustainable drainage systems and water management and sustainable 
waste management. This section of the Lambeth Local Plan should be 
read alongside Chapters 8 and 9 of the London Plan, relating to green infrastructure, natural environment and sustainable infrastructure. All of these 
policies are intended to work together to contribute towards the improvement 
and sustainability of Lambeth’s environment, including climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Air Quality
9.2 Lambeth will apply London Plan policy SI1 Improving air quality to all development proposals in the borough, along with associated Mayoral 
guidance on Air Quality Neutral and Air Quality Positive standards and on 
ways to reduce construction and demolition impacts. The whole of Lambeth 
is designated an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) on the basis of its 
high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO
2) and particular matter (PM10). To address 
Lambeth’s poor air quality, the council has agreed an Air Quality Action Plan 
to 2022, which can be found on the council’s air quality webpages. Lambeth’s 
air quality priorities are to continue to encourage sustainable travel and 
sustainable construction; to reduce exposure to air quality and raise 
awareness; and to work in partnership with residents, community groups, Business Improvement Districts, Transport for London and other organisations 
to concentrate on local pollution problems in Lambeth.
9.3 There are currently five Air Quality Focus Areas (AQFA) in the borough, 
which are locations that have high levels of both pollution and human 
exposure. These are the A23 from Brixton to Streatham; Kennington Oval/
Camberwell New Road/Kennington Park Road; Vauxhall Cross; Clapham 
Road; and Waterloo Road. In accordance with London Plan policy SI1, 
developments in these areas should incorporate design solutions that prevent or minimise exposure to existing air pollution and make provisions to address 
local air pollution. These five current AQFAs are identified in Lambeth’s Air 
Quality Action Plan; in addition the Mayor’s London Datastore maintains an up-to-date list of AQFAs across the capital, taking account of changing 
circumstances. Opportunity Areas (Nine Elms Vauxhall and Waterloo) should 
adopt an air quality positive approach that actively reduces air pollution in 
accordance with London Plan policy SI1. Lambeth’s Air Quality Action Plan 
identifies the sources of air pollution in Lambeth and the location of sensitive  T o table of contents158

colleges, schools and nurseries. Lambeth also has a Low Emission Bus Zone 
from Brixton to Streatham.
9.4 Alongside London Plan policy SI1, the implementation of London Plan 
and Local Plan policies on sustainable transport, open space and green 
infrastructure, energy, sustainable design and construction and waste will also 
contribute towards the objective of improving air quality across the borough.
Policy EN1: Open space, green infrastructure and biodiversity
The council will meet requirements for open space and green infrastructure by:
A. Protecting and maintaining open spaces, green infrastructure and their function. Development which would involve the loss of existing public or 
private open space will not be permitted unless at least one of the following 
tests is met:
i. Replacement open space of equivalent or better quality and quantity is provided within a suitable location in the local area.
ii. In the case of housing estate amenity areas, significant regeneration and community benefits would be achieved that could not be achieved 
in any other way, and appropriate compensatory provision for the loss 
of open space is made, including improvements to the quality of the 
remaining open space.
iii. It is for the provision of facilities directly related to the use of open 
space including ecology centres, indoor sports facilities, changing 
rooms, toilets or cafes as long as these are appropriate in scale and 
form to the size and character of the open space and acceptable 
in terms of impact on openness and do not harm the function and 
operation of the open space.
B. Preventing development which would result in loss, reduction in area or significant harm to the nature conservation or biodiversity value of an open 
space including any designated or proposed Local Nature Reserves (LNR) 
or Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) unless adequate 
mitigation or compensatory measures of equivalent or better biodiversity 
value are included, appropriate to the nature conservation value of the assets involved. In the case of SINCs, the mitigation hierarchy in London 
Plan policy G6 C will apply.  
C. In accordance with London Plan policy G6, development proposals should 
wherever possible protect, enhance, create or manage nature conservation 
and biodiversity interest in accordance with the borough’s Biodiversity 
Action Plan (BAP) and the Mayor’s Biodiversity Strategy. 
D. Increasing the quantity of open space and green infrastructure in the borough through proposals such as the Vauxhall Square initiative, the  T o table of contents159
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 9: Environment and Green Infrastructure  
 T o table of contentsextension of Jubilee Gardens and by linking existing spaces through green 
chains, the Greenway and Thames Path National Walking trail initiatives, but 
also through:
i. The provision of open space in new developments appropriate to their 
scale, the uses involved and the location of the development. 
ii. Requiring major development in areas of open space deficiency and/or in areas of access to nature deficiency to provide new on-site 
open space/access to nature improvements. Where the development 
proposal includes residential units, this new open space should 
be in addition to the external amenity space requirements in Local 
Plan policy H5. Where it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that new on-site open space provision or access to nature 
improvements would not be feasible and/or effective, a payment in 
lieu will be sought as a planning obligation to enable the provision of new open space or improvements to the accessibility of existing public 
open space in the vicinity of the development, including their nature 
conservation and biodiversity value. Planning obligations will also be 
sought towards management and maintenance of new or improved 
open space. 
iii. Where appropriate and feasible, ensuring that development is designed so as to contribute to the creation or extension of green 
chains and links (‘green corridors’) involving safe, healthy, convenient 
and attractive access for pedestrians and cyclists and to promote 
migration and protection of plants, animals and habitats of biodiversity 
importance.
E. Improving the quality of, and access to, existing open space and green infrastructure, including the range of facilities available and its biodiversity 
and nature conservation value and heritage value, through various means 
including the implementation of the Lambeth Open Spaces Strategy and 
Lambeth Green Infrastructure Strategy.
F. Applying London Plan policy G5 in relation to the urban greening factor 
for major developments. For other developments the council will strongly 
encourage inclusion of urban greening measures. Development proposals 
should incorporate living roofs and walls where feasible and appropriate to 
the character and context of the development. All proposals should include 
a maintenance plan for the lifetime of the development. Planning obligations may be sought to cover future maintenance of green infrastructure.

its value in providing space for leisure, recreation and sport, health and wellbeing, air quality, habitats and species, and for its contribution to visual 
amenity, sustainable urban drainage, urban cooling and ecological function. Development on garden land will be assessed against Local Plan policy Q14.
9.6 Green infrastructure includes green spaces and features such as street trees and green roofs that deliver multiple benefits. These include mitigating 
flooding, sustainable urban drainage, cooling the urban environment, 
enhancing biodiversity and ecological resilience, improving air and water 
quality, as well as providing more attractive places for people to encourage 
walking and cycling, promote play, recreation and social inclusion, and improve mental and physical health and wellbeing. Green infrastructure should 
be planned, designed and managed in an integrated way to achieve these 
multiple benefits. 
9.7 Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) is London’s strategically important open space within the built environment and is a unique designation to London. As outlined 
in the London Plan MOL is afforded the same level of protection as the Green 
Belt. Policy G3 (Metropolitan Open Land) of the London Plan will be applied 
to areas of open space designated as MOL in the borough. The list of areas in 
Lambeth protected by the MOL designation is set out in Annex 5. The areas of designated MOL, SINC and LNR in Lambeth are shown on the Policies Map.
9.8 The Lambeth Open Spaces Strategy 2013 (updated from 2004 and 2007) and Lambeth Green Infrastructure Strategy 2018 identify areas of open space 
deficiency in the borough by open space type, such as small open space, 
district parks and open spaces and metropolitan open spaces. There are 
limited opportunities to create significant areas of additional open space in 
the borough. New open space can include hard landscaped areas as well as green areas. There are areas in the borough, which are noticeably deficient 
in certain types of open space. Similarly there are areas with deficiency in 
access to nature and major development should seek to alleviate these deficiencies. Development of open space will only be considered in very limited 
circumstances therefore, and only where major planning priorities are being 
met and which have been very carefully justified including an assessment 
of why all other alternatives have been considered and ruled out. Where 
this requirement has been satisfied proposals must still achieve an overall better quality and quantity of existing open space. Replacement of existing 
ground floor public open space at roof level is not achievable in most cases, 
however where this is proposed the applicant would need to demonstrate 
how it would be of equivalent quality, including how full public access would 
be achieved. Arrangements for the maintenance and management of new, improved or replacement open space will also need to be demonstrated and 
will be secured through a s106 legal agreement. These arrangements will 
be considered on a case by case basis having regard to factors such as the anticipated maintenance and management costs for the space in question,  T o table of contents161
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 9: Environment and Green Infrastructure  
 T o table of contentsthe anticipated level of usage and the nature of any existing maintenance and 
management regimes.
9.9 Various housing estates in the borough are set in areas of open land, which are not well arranged and are no longer attractive, safe or pleasant to use. In 
such cases, where the land is of poor quality and has limited value as useable 
open space, there is benefit in supporting the reorganisation of open space as 
part of housing regeneration proposals. Benefits include the provision of more 
usable and functional open space and better and improved surveillance of open space, which reduce opportunities for crime and anti-social behaviour. 
9.10 It is important that in areas of open space deficiency and in areas of access to nature deficiency on-site open space provision/accessibility improvements 
to borough and metropolitan SINCs are secured in all major developments (in 
addition to the external amenity space requirements of Local Plan policy H5 
where residential units are proposed). While on-site open space provision and 
access to nature improvements will be sought in all instances, it is recognised that this will not always be feasible and/or effective. Some development sites 
may be too small or restricted in other ways for this always to be practicable. 
Where this is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council, planning obligations in the form of a financial contribution will be sought, to improve 
access to local parks, open spaces and borough and metropolitan SINCs in 
the vicinity of the development (generally within one kilometre of the application 
site boundary).The financial contribution will be based on the cost of measures 
required to improve access identified by the council. The measures should specifically improve access to open space/access to nature and may include, 
for example, new gates, signage/interpretation, path improvements, fences 
within parks to improve permeability and lighting. Alternatively the contributions 
may be spent on the creation of a new open space where possible in the 
vicinity of the development site. In town centre locations, the creation of landscaped public spaces such as squares may be appropriate to provide a 
focus and sense of place in the public realm that can provide seating, planting 
or opportunities for public art. The council may prepare a supplementary planning document to provide further guidance on these requirements and 
requirements for management and maintenance. 
9.11 The council wishes to secure the extension of Jubilee Gardens onto two-thirds 
of the adjoining Hungerford car park site. This will realise the longstanding 
council and GLA objective of creating a coherent public space of metropolitan 
value to serve the increasing numbers of residents, workers and visitors in the 
South Bank/Waterloo area, as well as providing land to support the needs of 
the South Bank to fulfil its role as a world class arts and culture facility. This is supported through policy PN1 Waterloo and South Bank. 
9.12 Green chains are linked but separate open spaces, which are accessible to the public and are an important part of the open space network in the borough 
and London as a whole. Development should be designed where possible to 
enable integration and enhancement of existing green chains and/or explore 
opportunities to create new green chains, such as the Low Line project.  T o table of contents162
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 9: Environment and Green Infrastructure  
 T o table of contents9.13 The inclusion of urban greening measures in new development results in 
multiple benefits including an increase in green cover, visual amenity, improved 
air quality, water attenuation, improved physical and mental wellbeing, 
biodiversity habitat enhancements, carbon storage and better temperature 
regulation. Urban greening should be integral to planning the layout and design 
of new buildings and developments. It is therefore important to consider green infrastructure at the pre-application stage. The urban greening factor model is 
a systematic way to deliver urban greening in developments. In accordance 
with London Plan policy G5 the borough applies the Mayor’s recommended urban greening factor target scores for residential (0.4) and commercial (0.3) 
major developments. The council may in future develop its own urban greening 
factor for new developments through a supplementary planning document. 
In accordance with London Plan policy G5, industrial and warehouse 
developments are not required to meet the target score of 0.3 but they will be expected to set out what measures they have taken to achieve urban greening 
on site and to quantify their UGF score.
9.14 Development proposals should incorporate living roofs and walls. Living 
or green roofs and walls are roofs, decks or other structures onto which 
vegetation is intentionally grown or habitats for wildlife are established. They 
provide a range of environmental benefits such as attenuating or capturing 
rainwater run-off, providing a range of habitats for biodiversity and wildlife, 
increasing energy efficiency, improving air quality and reducing the need for artificial cooling in hot weather. Where applications affect heritage buildings 
or are sited in particularly sensitive locations, consideration will be given 
to whether the design is appropriate to the character and context of the development, having regard to other policies in this plan. Guidelines for the 
design, installation and maintenance of green roofs can be found in the 
Mayor’s Living Roofs and Walls Technical Report (2008) and the GRO Green 
Roof Code (2014) and any subsequent updated guidance. Maintenance plans 
should be for the lifetime of the development and planning obligations may be sought to ensure continued maintenance. 
Policy EN2: Local food growing and production
A. The use of land and buildings as new allotments, orchards and for local food growing spaces and production will be supported, including the 
temporary use of vacant or derelict land or buildings and the use of 
incidental open space on housing estates and other open space areas, 
where this does not conflict with other policy objectives or land use 
priorities.
B. The incorporation of community gardens, allotments, orchards and innovative spaces for growing food, including green roofs, will be 
encouraged and supported in major new developments where possible and 
appropriate, particularly where there is demand for food growing space in 
the vicinity of the application site. T o table of contents163

development. 
Supporting text 
9.15 Allotments, orchards and community gardens can play an important role in 
enabling small-scale local food production, community engagement, and also 
supporting local biodiversity and as a wildlife resource. By providing regular 
outdoor activity, food growing can also help to improve health and wellbeing 
and reduce health inequalities. Food growing in schools has also been shown 
to help children and young people to achieve learning, skills and health and wellbeing outcomes. Demand for food growing space will be evidenced by 
matters such as shortage of allotment spaces in the area; local community 
groups expressing interest in having space to enable local food production; or local school food projects requiring growing space in the vicinity of the 
application site. 
9.16 The inclusion of food growing opportunities in new developments extends 
beyond the conventional provision of gardens and allotments. It might include 
the creative use of roofs, walls and balconies where external space is limited, 
and landscaping with productive plants that produce fruit, nuts or seeds rather 
than ornamental trees and shrubs.
9.17 In some cases initiatives such as the use of incidental open space on housing 
estates for food growing may not require planning permission. This would 
depend on its scale and form, and the extent to which it would change the 
character and function of the open space. The acceptability of such proposals 
would also depend on the impact on the availability of open space for general 
amenity use by residents.
9.18 The temporary use of vacant land and buildings for food growing will be supported where it would not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of 
adjoining areas arising from the scale and nature of the activity through noise, 
disturbance or noxious smells.
9.19 Green roofs also provide opportunities for food growing, if structurally suitable, and can accommodate both growing beds and greenhouses. Local food 
growing spaces should incorporate sustainable landscape principles and 
practices, including effective water management, efficient energy use and use 
of sustainable materials (see also Local Plan policy EN4 sustainable design 
and construction).
9.20 Where provided, the identified space for food growing may be secured through planning condition or section106 agreement. Existing allotments are protected

A. All major developments will be expected to connect to, and where 
appropriate extend, existing decentralised heating, networks in the vicinity 
of the site, unless a feasibility assessment demonstrates that connection 
is not reasonably possible. Minor new-build developments should be 
designed to be able to connect wherever reasonably possible. Where 
networks do not currently exist, developments should make provision to connect to any planned future decentralised energy network in the vicinity 
of the site, having regard to opportunities identified in Heat Network Priority 
Areas of the London Heat Map and area specific energy plans. Major development proposals that cannot immediately connect to an existing 
heating network should follow the heating and cooling hierarchies set out in 
London Plan policies SI3 (D) and SI4 (B). 
Supporting text 
9.21 Major development proposals should select energy systems in accordance with the London Plan heating hierarchy set out in London Plan policy SI3. 
9.22 In practice this means the following:
• Major development in the vicinity of an existing heating network is required to connect to it, unless a feasibility assessment demonstrates that 
connection is not reasonably possible.
• If there is no existing network but a planned future network within 
the vicinity of the site, provisions to facilitate a future connection will 
be required.
• In areas where there is no planned district heat network, it is expected that 
a full investigation into the potential to “future-proof” the development (i.e. 
to facilitate a future connection to a district heat network that may arise 
in the future) will be carried out. Sites should be communally heated and 
served from a single energy centre unless it can be demonstrated that this 
is not feasible or that it is likely to result in an increase in net carbon dioxide emissions over the lifetime of the development.
• Major development proposals that cannot immediately connect to an existing heating network should evaluate the feasibility of other systems 
as per the London Plan heating hierarchy. Zero emission systems 
are encouraged. 
9.23 The London Heat Map, and in particular the Heat Network Priority Areas, should be used by applicants as a starting point to identify opportunities for 
decentralised energy. In addition applicants should have regard to:

C. In addition to the requirements for zero-carbon in major new developments in London Plan policy SI2:
i. All new non-residential development and non-self-contained residential accommodation, must meet at least BREEAM ‘Excellent’. 
ii. All major non-residential refurbishment of existing buildings and conversions over 500m

BREEAM Non-Domestic Refurbishment ‘Excellent’. 
iii. Minor new-build residential developments of between one and nine units, including proposals that involve extensions or change of use 
to provide dwellings, must achieve a minimum on-site reduction in 
regulated carbon emissions of at least 19 per cent beyond Part L of 
the Building Regulations, unless it can be demonstrated that such 
provision is not feasible.
D. Proposals should demonstrate in a supporting statement that sustainable design standards are integral to the design, construction and operation of 
the development. New build residential development are encouraged to 
use the Home Quality Mark and Passivhaus design standards. Planning 
applications for non-residential developments should be accompanied by a 
pre-assessment, demonstrating how the BREEAM standards, or any future replacement standards, will be met. 
E. Development will be required to be resilient to climate change by including appropriate climate change adaptation measures.

for different types of development. These standards provide a widely 
recognised and well-understood framework for the promotion of sustainable 
design, incorporating categories such as energy, water, materials, transport, 
waste, pollution, health and wellbeing, management, land use and ecology.
9.26 BREEAM pre-assessments should be submitted at application stage, clearly identifying the credits to be targeted and detailing how these will 
be achieved. The council expects these requirements to be achieved in all 
but exceptional cases and clear justification will be required if a particular 
standard is not met. In the event that the BREEAM building standards are 
replaced by other national measures of sustainability, equivalent standards of relevant replacement schemes will be sought. Voluntary use of sustainability 
assessment tools for housing will be encouraged. For infrastructure, public 
realm and open space developments, schemes will be encouraged to reach a Civil Engineering Environmental Quality Assessment (CEEQUAL) rating 
of ‘Excellent’.
9.27 Major residential and non-residential development proposals must comply 
with the requirements of zero carbon set out in London Plan policy SI2. 
Local Plan policy EN4 clause (c) (iii) sets energy performance standards for 
minor residential developments involving between one and nine units to the 
equivalent of Level 4 of the Code for Sustainable Homes. This equates to 19 
per cent beyond 2013 Part L of the Building Regulations and is in accordance with the Written Ministerial Statement 2015 and subsequent Planning Practice 
Guidance on climate change. These requirements should be demonstrated in 
an energy statement submitted with the planning application. Conditions may be used to ensure principles outlined in this policy are adhered to throughout 
the lifetime of the development. 
9.28 The Home Quality Mark, launched in 2015, is one way of demonstrating the 
standard of a new residential dwelling, which includes measures for low CO2, 
sustainable materials, good air quality and natural daylight. The council will 
encourage schemes to use the Home Quality Mark. The use of the Passivhaus 
standard is also encouraged in demonstrating energy efficient design. 
9.29 The council encourages all development to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from on-site renewable energy generation (which 
can include sources of site related decentralised renewable energy), unless 
it can be demonstrated that such provision is not feasible. Where possible, 
this should be in addition to the carbon dioxide emissions reduction required 
through London Plan policy SI2 and Local Plan policy EN4.

Standard the Government is considering increasing the energy efficiency 
requirements in Part L of the Building Regulations for new homes in 2020. Development proposals will be expected to meet new standards set  T o table of contents167

that mains water consumption would meet a target of 105 litres of water or 
less per person per day. See also policy Local Plan policy EN6 in relation to 
sustainable drainage systems and water management; and Local Plan policy 
EN7 in relation to on-site waste management and sustainable management of 
construction, excavation and demolition waste. 
9.32 Where contamination exists, a remediation strategy should be submitted to the council for approval and implemented by a suitably qualified person prior to 
development commencing. 
9.33 Where supporting information about environmental impacts submitted 
with planning applications requires independent technical assessment, the 
applicant will be required to pay for this assessment. Conditions and planning 
obligations will be used as appropriate to secure the proper installation, 
maintenance and responsibility for sustainability measures included in 
development proposals. 
9.34 Retrofitting existing homes and buildings better to cope with impacts of climate change is an important part of climate change adaptation and the 
council will expect proportionate measures to be taken to improve the 
environmental sustainability of existing buildings. See also Local Plan policies 
Q6, Q7, Q11 and Q18 and the Design Code SPD.

Policy EN5: Flood risk 
A. The council will seek to minimise the impact of flooding in the borough through:
i. applying a sequential, risk-based approach to the location of development to avoid, where possible, flood risk to people and 
property and manage any residual risk, taking account of the impacts 
of climate change over the lifetime of the development; 
ii. steering development towards areas of lowest flood risk, both across Lambeth and within the development site boundary, through the 
application of the Sequential Test in accordance with the NPPF, taking 
the vulnerability of the proposed uses into account, as set out in the 
Lambeth Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA);  T o table of contents168
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 9: Environment and Green Infrastructure  
 T o table of contentsiii. ensuring development does not increase flood risk and where possible 
reduces flood risk from all sources of flooding; 
iv. permitting appropriate development in Flood Zones 1, 2, 3a and 3b subject to meeting the criteria set out in Annex 4; and
v. taking account of the flood risk management measures identified by the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan.
B. All development in Flood Zones 2, 3a and 3b defined in the SFRA, or identified as at risk of flooding from other sources, should contribute 
positively to actively reducing flood risk through avoidance, reduction, 
management and mitigation.  
C. A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) will be required for major development proposals within Flood Zone 1, all development within Flood Zones 2, 
3a and 3b, or where the development may be subject to other sources 
of flooding. The FRA should be proportionate with the degree of flood 
risk posed to and by the proposed development; consider the impact 
of climate change on flood risk to and from the development using the latest government guidance; and take account of the advice and 
recommendations set out in the SFRA, Surface Water Management Plan 
(SWMP) and Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS).
D. FRAs must consider the risks of both on and off-site flooding to and from the development for all sources of flooding including fluvial, tidal, surface 
water run-off, groundwater, ordinary watercourse, sewer (separate or 
combined) and reservoir.
E. For all developments, it must be demonstrated that the development will be safe (for its lifetime), and where required, it will reduce fluvial, tidal, surface 
water run-off and groundwater flood risk and manage residual risks through 
appropriate flood risk measures, including the use of sustainable drainage 
systems (SuDS) in accordance with Local Plan policy EN6. Measures to 
mitigate flooding from sewers should be discussed with Thames Water Utilities Ltd. and be included in development proposals for which this is 
a risk.
F. The use of basement space for bedrooms and non-residential uses 
where flooding could threaten the safety of people will not be permitted 
in areas susceptible to flooding (including but not limited to areas within 
current modelled breach flood extent and surface water modelling). The 
use of basement space for all other residential and non-residential uses 
must adopt resilient design techniques and be flood resilient. Basement proposals should not increase flood risk elsewhere. See also Local Plan 
policy Q27. 
G. For developments adjacent to the River Thames and River Graveney, 
maintenance, remediation and improvements to the flood defence walls 
will be required where necessary. Developments adjacent to defences and 
culverts should demonstrate that their development will not undermine the  T o table of contents169

9.36 Management of flood risk within the London Borough of Lambeth will be undertaken in line with the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (NPPF), 
Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (FWMA), Thames Estuary 2100 Plan 
2012, Flood Risk Regulations 2009 (FRR), the European Water Framework 
Directive 2000 transposed into law through the Water Environment (Water 
Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2003, and the Land Drainage Act 1991.
9.37 The council is the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) in Lambeth. As the LLFA, Lambeth are the risk management authority (RMA) for local flood risk, including 
flooding from surface water run-off, ordinary watercourses and groundwater. 
It will work in partnership with other RMAs including the Environment Agency, 
which is the RMA for Main River and tidal flooding; Thames Water Utilities Ltd, 
which is the RMA for flooding from public sewers; and neighbouring LLFAs.
9.38 Developers must consider flood risk from all sources as part of an FRA and ensure they are utilising the most appropriate and up-to-date information 
in assessing the risk of flooding from all sources to the development 
site. Discussions should be held with each of the flood risk management 
authorities identified above when considering measures to mitigate flooding 
from different flood sources within development proposals. Conditions or planning obligations will be used as appropriate to secure flood risk 
mitigation measures.
9.39 Flood zone maps are included within the borough’s Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessment (SFRA) 2013 and Addendum 2018. These maps divide the 
borough into zones on the basis of the probability of flooding occurring 
from tidal and fluvial sources, ignoring the presence of any flood defences / 
alleviation measures. The flood zone maps are based upon data produced by 
the Environment Agency. Although the SFRA is updated regularly, more up-to-date information may be available from the Environment Agency. 
9.40 Development proposals will be assessed against the most up-to-date information. Pre-application discussions are therefore recommended to 
confirm which flood zone the proposal is within and the risk posed to 
the development from other sources. Definitions and explanations of the 
flood zones and other sources of flood risk, land uses and their flood risk 
vulnerability are set out in the SFRA and NPPF.
9.41 Lambeth’s SFRA has been produced in two parts: Level 1, which provides an overview of flood risk issues in Lambeth, and Level 2, which analyses specific 
locations where development is proposed in areas at risk from flooding. 
The Level 2 SFRA provides sufficient information to allow the application of 
the NPPF Exception Test. However, breach models within the SFRA are for  T o table of contents170
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 9: Environment and Green Infrastructure  
 T o table of contentsguidance only and they should be verified by site-specific breach models to 
determine more accurate flood zones. 
9.42 The Level 1 and Level 2 SFRA report (2013) and any future updates or addendums are to be used in conjunction with each other to provide a more 
detailed overview of the flood risks apparent in the borough. Areas identified 
in the SFRA as at highest risk of fluvial and tidal flooding in Lambeth are 
Waterloo, Vauxhall and adjacent to the River Graveney. Sequential testing 
of the site allocations within the Local Plan in relation to flood risk has also been undertaken.
9.43 The council has produced a Lambeth Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS) which identifies Lambeth’s objectives and measures for managing 
local flood risk, including surface water run-off and groundwater, and includes 
specific requirements with regards to management of flood risk to and from 
development. Developers should ensure that development proposals meet the 
objectives and requirements identified in the Strategy. 
9.44 In determining proposals for basement and other underground development, the council will require an assessment of the scheme’s impact on drainage, 
flooding, groundwater conditions and structural stability. Applications will be 
required to demonstrate that the proposal would not cause harm to the built 
and natural environment and local amenity and would not result in flooding 
or ground instability. Basement schemes which include bedrooms and other uses where flooding could threaten the safety of people, especially when 
sleeping, (for example community uses such as nurseries, daycare centres 
and hospital beds), will not be permitted in areas susceptible to flooding. For the purposes of Local Plan policy EN5 (f), susceptibility to flooding includes 
areas at high risk of surface water flooding. In assessing this, the council will 
have regard to the Environment Agency’s Risk of Flooding from Surface Water 
mapping made available via https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.
uk/long-term-flood-risk/map. This data will be updated periodically as and when new data becomes available. Susceptibility to flooding includes surface 
water and combined water modelling and in certain circumstances the use of 
basements will be restricted to non-habitable uses. Positively pumped devices 
and non-return valves should be installed to protect basements from the risk 
of sewer flooding. See also Local Plan policy Q27 Basements and Annex 4. 
9.45 Any development adjacent to the River Thames or River Graveney, should allow for inspection, maintenance and replacement of flood defences to be 
done in a safe manner without incurring undue costs and environmental 
impacts. To do this development adjacent to the tidal River Thames should 
maximise opportunities to achieve a 16m setback from the rear of the flood 
defences. On the fluvial River Graveney development should maximise opportunities to achieve an 8m setback from the watercourse, defences 
and culverts. T o table of contents171

Development proposals should:
i. maximise opportunities for restoring river channels, flood flow 
pathways and floodplains to their natural state and managing surface 
water run-off above ground and as close to the source as possible 
to reduce flood risks downstream; and implement sustainable water 
management through water sensitive urban design (WSUD);
ii. provide compensatory storage to ensure that there is no loss in flood 
storage capacity where flood storage is removed, as set out in the 
Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA);
iii. ensure that the layout and design does not have a detrimental impact 
on floodwater flow routes across the site;
iv. demonstrate that there will be a net decrease in both the volume and rate of run-off leaving the site by incorporating sustainable drainage 
systems (SuDS) in line with the London Plan drainage hierarchy and 
non-statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems. 
Details submitted to the council to demonstrate compliance with this 
policy should follow the design principles within the SuDS Manual and guidance identified within the council’s SFRA or Local Flood Risk 
Management Strategy (LFRMS) to maximise amenity and biodiversity 
benefits and improve the quality of water discharges.
v. seek to improve the water environment in line with the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive 2000 and its associated 
legislation, and the Thames River Basin Management Plan;
vi. minimise water consumption and the pressure on the combined sewer 
network, through incorporating water efficiency measures including 
rainwater harvesting, grey-water recycling and other innovative 
technologies where practical; and
vii. demonstrate that the local water supply and public sewerage networks have adequate capacity both on and off-site to serve the 
development for its lifetime or can be provided; where there is a 
capacity constraint the council will, where appropriate, apply phasing 
conditions to any approval to ensure that any necessary infrastructure 
upgrades are delivered ahead of the occupation of the relevant phase of development.

in the Thames River Basin Management Plan (RBMP). They should also seek 
to implement a holistic water management approach through water sensitive 
urban design (WSUD). WSUD ensures that a development is designed to 
maximise opportunities within the urban water cycle to manage water quality, 
flood risk and the demand and supply of water to minimise environmental degradation and improve aesthetic and recreational appeal.
9.47 In the terms of this policy a sustainable drainage system (SuDS) is one which utilises a ‘management train’ of drainage techniques used in series to mimic 
as closely as possible the natural site’s processes, thereby mitigating and 
enhancing the development’s impact on flood risk, water quality and habitat / 
amenity value. Further explanation of SuDS can be found in The SuDS Manual. 
9.48 SuDS cover a whole range of approaches to surface and ground water 
management. Successful SuDS design requires the drainage to be carefully 
integrated into the site while taking account of the original greenfield drainage 
patterns. A greenfield run-off rate is one that reflects the natural rate of water 
run-off if it was undeveloped. Early integration is the most effective way to 
achieve the desired objectives of SuDS use. Development should aim to achieve greenfield run-off rates, although it is recognised that this is not always 
possible. SuDS designs that integrate the features into the overall site design 
generally result in smaller, more cost-effective solutions. 
9.49 Developments on brownfield sites should seek to reduce the volume and rate of run-off leaving the site to the standards set within the London Plan. 
9.50 To reduce the volume and rate of run-off from heavy rainfall the council will expect developments to utilise sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), such 
as green and brown roofs, rain gardens, green infrastructure and attenuation 
ponds, in line with the London Plan drainage hierarchy.
9.51 As an alternative to Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (i.e. the SuDS Approval Body), the Secretary of State for Communities 
and Local Government set out changes to planning policies that came in to 
effect on 6 April 2015. These changes require all Local Planning Authorities 
to consult Lead Local Flood Authorities on surface water flood risk and 
management for all major developments, to ensure that the proposed minimum standards of operation are appropriate, and ensure through 
the use of planning conditions or planning obligations that there are clear 
arrangements in place for ongoing maintenance over the lifetime of the development. These changes ensure the use of SuDS will be provided for 
all new major developments in accordance with the London Plan, the Non-
statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems and by virtue 
the NPPF. A Drainage Strategy should be submitted as part of a planning 
application by the applicant to demonstrate standards relating to surface water flood risk and surface water management have been achieved. Schedule 3

identified in the Thames River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) and Lambeth 
Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS).
9.55 The Thames River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) outlines the Environment 
Agency’s approach to managing the Thames River Basin District in line with 
the European Water Framework Directive 2000 (WFD). The WFD establishes a 
legal framework for the protection, improvement and sustainable use of water 
bodies such as rivers, brooks and groundwater. The Thames RBMP describes 
the quality of water bodies, the pressures they face and the actions needed to meet WFD objectives of ‘good’ water body status within the Thames River 
Basin District.
9.56 Site-specific Flood Risk Assessments and/or Drainage Strategies should 
address the management of surface water run-off, the amount of impermeable 
surfaces resulting from the development, and the methods used to manage 
flood risk both on-site and elsewhere within the catchment.
9.57 Where appropriate planning permission for developments which result in the need for off-site upgrades will be subject to conditions to ensure the 
occupation is aligned with the delivery of necessary infrastructure upgrades. 
9.58 The council will seek to ensure that there is adequate water and wastewater 
infrastructure to serve all new developments for their lifetime. Developers 
are encouraged to contact the water/wastewater company as early as 
possible to discuss their development proposals and intended delivery 
programme to assist with identifying any potential water and wastewater 
network reinforcement requirements. Where there is a capacity constraint the council will, where appropriate, apply phasing conditions to any approval to 
ensure that any necessary infrastructure upgrades are delivered ahead of the 
occupation of the relevant phase of development. 
9.59 The council supports the implementation of the Thames Tideway Tunnel, which will be a storage and transfer waste water tunnel running under the 
River Thames, reducing the overflows of untreated sewage and resulting 
in a cleaner river. This project is listed in the Infrastructure Delivery Plan as 
significant regional infrastructure to be delivered during the plan period. T o table of contents174

 T o table of contentsPolicy EN7: Sustainable waste management 
A. In accordance with London Plan policies SI7, SI8 and SI9, the council will 
contribute to the sustainable management of waste in Lambeth by:
i. supporting circular economy principles and the approach to driving waste management up the waste hierarchy in accordance with national 
and regional policy and targets, and in particular the efficient use of 
resources, the reuse of materials and resources, composting and the 
recovery of energy from materials; 
ii. Contributing to the Mayor’s target for London’s waste capacity 
and net self-sufficiency by identifying sufficient capacity and land 
to meet Lambeth’s identified waste needs, including the borough’s 
apportionment target;
iii. supporting delivery of the Western Riverside Waste Authority’s statutory Waste Management Strategy and implementing its own 
Lambeth Sustainable Waste Management Strategy;
iv. safeguarding existing waste transfer and management sites for waste 
use and encouraging the intensification of capacity on existing sites 
where appropriate. The loss of a waste site for other uses will only 
be supported where appropriate compensatory capacity is provided 
in appropriate locations elsewhere in the borough. Compensatory 
provision should be at or above the same level of the waste hierarchy of that which is lost and meet or exceed the maximum achievable 
throughput of the site over the last five years;
v. identifying sites/areas for waste management in Key Industrial and 
Business Areas and other appropriate locations to provide additional 
capacity to meet, over the plan period, the borough’s waste 
apportionment set out in the London Plan and any other identified 
waste management needs;
vi. supporting the provision of an adequate supply of land for the 
operational delivery of the waste collection service, including depots 
and waste transfer sites;
vii. co-operating with the local waste planning authorities that receive 
waste from Lambeth to address any issues associated with this during 
the plan period.
B. Proposals for new and improved waste management facilities will be 
assessed against the criteria in London Plan policy SI8 and national waste 
planning policy.
C. On-site waste management facilities should be incorporated into all major 
development proposals unless it is demonstrated that provision is not 
feasible or the location renders the site unsuitable for such facilities.
D. All developments will be expected to recycle construction, demolition and 
excavation (CD&E) waste on-site wherever practicable. For all development,  T o table of contents175

9.60 Lambeth has a number of different roles and responsibilities related to waste. 
Lambeth is responsible for collecting and disposing of household waste, 
and both of these services are outsourced. Lambeth also arranges for the 
collection of some business waste in the borough. Lambeth also has a 
planning responsibility to ensure there is sufficient waste management capacity 
to meet the borough’s identified waste needs. This is achieved through Local Plan policy EN7.
9.61 The Mayor’s Environment Strategy and London Plan set out ambitious targets for reducing waste, increasing re-use and recycling, reducing waste going 
to landfill, and supporting the circular economy. Lambeth will promote these 
objectives by planning to meet its identified waste management needs, 
working with the Western Riverside Waste Authority (WRWA) and London 
Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) to increase household and business reuse and recycling rates, encouraging facilities that operate higher up the 
waste hierarchy and assessing applications for new development against key 
circular economy principles.
9.62 Lambeth is required to plan for the management needs of waste generated in the borough, contributing towards the target of net self-sufficiency in London 
by 2026. There are seven waste streams, including household waste, business 
waste and construction waste. The London Plan apportions an amount of 
household and business waste that Lambeth needs to manage and the Waste 
Technical Paper estimates how much waste will be generated from the other waste streams. A summary of the amount of waste Lambeth needs to plan for 
is set out in the table below.

Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 9: Environment and Green Infrastructure  
 T o table of contents9.63 Lambeth is one of four London boroughs (along with Wandsworth, 
Hammersmith & Fulham and Kensington & Chelsea) for which the Western 
Riverside Waste Authority (WRWA) is the statutory waste disposal authority for 
the municipal waste collected by its constituent councils. A thirty year Waste 
Management Service Agreement (WMSA) was established between WRWA 
and Cory Environmental Ltd to dispose of WRWA waste, commencing in October 2002 and ending in 2032. Lambeth’s household waste is managed 
outside of the borough, with recyclables going to a Materials Recovery 
Facility in Wandsworth and residual (‘black bag’) waste transported down river to Bexley energy recovery facility. Lambeth will continue to support the 
delivery of the WRWA’s Waste Management Strategy and implement its own 
Lambeth Sustainable Waste Management Strategy. Lambeth will also work 
with the WRWA to deliver the Mayor’s municipal waste management policies 
and proposals set out in his Environment Strategy, including the 50% LACW recycling target. 
9.64 Lambeth has a number of sites currently used for waste management but these do not have the capacity to manage this quantity of waste. Sites 
currently in waste management or transfer use in the borough are identified in 
the Waste Evidence Base 2019. These existing sites are safeguarded by the 
policy. Only waste at waste transfer sites sorted for recycling or composting 
counts towards meeting the borough’s apportionment target. The shortfall in capacity equates to around 136,600 tonnes by 2036. Lambeth already has 
a number of waste facilities which can help towards managing its waste and, 
where appropriate, the intensification of these sites is encouraged. Existing waste sites are safeguarded for waste uses and are identified in Lambeth’s 
Policies Map and the Waste Evidence Base. Redevelopment of safeguarded 
waste sites for other uses will only be supported if compensatory waste 
capacity is provided elsewhere within the borough or if waste capacity is 
re-provided on-site with suitable mitigation measures to ensure any new development does not impact on the ability of the waste operation to function, 
in line with the agent of change principle. This is to ensure Lambeth is able 
to continue meeting its waste needs. Once delivery of compensatory waste 
capacity has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council, an existing 
waste site can be released for other uses. The maximum throughput achieved on the site over the last five years can be identified through the Environment 
Agency’s Waste Data Interrogators. Where this information is not available, for 
example if a waste site has been vacant for a number of years, the potential capacity of the site should be calculated using an appropriate and evidenced 
throughput per hectare. 
9.65 The difference between existing capacity and the amount of waste Lambeth 
needs to manage is the ‘capacity gap’. Further information is set out in the 
Waste Evidence Base. A summary of the capacity gap (in tonnes) is set out 
in the table below along with a reasonable assumption of how much land is 
needed to bridge the gap.  T o table of contents177

9.66 The council has undertaken an assessment of locations and sites suitable 
for additional waste management facilities in the borough. This is set out in 
the Waste Evidence Base 2019. This identifies the borough’s designated Key 
Industrial and Business Areas (KIBAs) as particularly appropriate for new waste 
management uses. Waste management and recycling facilities are one of the 
priority uses for Lambeth’s industrial land (see Policy ED3). KIBAs represent Lambeth’s main stock of safeguarded industrial land. The benefits of directing 
new waste facilities towards KIBAs includes co-location with other industrial 
uses. This helps to reduce the risk of waste facilities being located next to more sensitive development, such as residential. KIBAs have already been 
assessed for their suitability for industrial uses and are safeguarded for these 
uses. KIBAs also tend to have access which is wide enough for larger vehicles 
and are well-connected to main road networks.
9.67 Not all types of waste facility are appropriate in Lambeth due to their impact 
on the dense urban environment. The broad types of facility which are suitable 
in each KIBA can be found in the Lambeth Waste Evidence Base 2019. 
The policy for KIBAs is set out in Local Plan policy ED3, which makes clear 
that they are appropriate for green industries including waste management. 
This includes facilities that may be aimed at moving waste materials up the waste hierarchy (repair and refurbishment workshops). KIBAs are specifically 
safeguarded for B class and other compatible industrial uses. Knolly’s Yard, 
Waterworks Road and part of Montford Place KIBAs also have potential for industrial intensification and co-location with residential development. 
Waste management uses are typically B class or sui generis. The total area 
of Lambeth’s KIBAs (including new KIBAs) is approximately 45 hectares of 
which an estimated 40 hectares is potentially suitable for waste uses. Lambeth 
needs 2.3ha of land to meet its waste management needs to 2036. Land within the KIBAs is released through business churn and the Lambeth Waste 
Evidence Base demonstrates that enough land can come forward during the 
plan period to provide sufficient opportunities to meet this need.  T o table of contents178
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 9: Environment and Green Infrastructure  
 T o table of contents9.68 No major waste facilities are expected to come forward in the borough in 
the period to 2036 but there is scope for a number of smaller facilities to 
serve the needs of the commercial waste sector. Lambeth would particularly 
welcome new facilities that contribute towards the circular economy, meeting 
the Mayor’s recycling targets, and helping to develop and diversify the local 
economy and create jobs. 
9.69 Although Lambeth is planning for its own waste, some waste will continue to be exported, for example household waste is exported to Wandsworth and 
Bexley and excavation waste could be exported to be used for beneficial 
purposes outside of London. It is expected that a small proportion of waste 
which cannot be reused, recycled, recovered or put to beneficial use will be 
disposed of to landfill outside of London. Lambeth will continue to work with other waste planning authorities on imports and exports of waste through 
duty to co-operate and monitor any significant changes in patterns of waste 
movements. 
9.70 The Western Riverside waste planning authorities work together on cross-boundary waste issues, but do not intend to plan for waste collectively. 
Lambeth is therefore planning for waste independently but will continue to 
work with Western Riverside authorities on cross-boundary waste issues. 
9.71 All proposals for new or improved waste management facilities will be assessed against the criteria in London Plan policy SI8 and in national waste 
planning policy. These criteria include: protection of water resources, land 
instability, visual intrusion, nature conservation, historic environment and built 
heritage, traffic and access, air emissions including dust, odours, vermin and 
birds, noise and vibration, litter and potential land use conflict. Proposals will also be assessed against all other relevant Local Plan policies, including in 
relation to transport, amenity and quality of the built environment.
9.72 On-site waste management facilities provide for the management of waste 
out of the waste stream on the site at which the waste arises. This is distinct 
from facilities for on-site storage or collection of waste. Where on-site waste 
management facilities are not feasible, detailed justification will be required 
including explanation of the options that were considered and the reasons 
they were not pursued. Development proposals should be designed to enable future occupiers to segregate and store dry recyclables, food and residual 
wastes ready for collection to maximise recycling and recovery. See also Local 
Plan policy Q12 Refuse/recycling storage.
9.73 The requirements of sections (c) and (d) of the policy should be addressed in the site waste management plan where this is required; or in a supporting 
statement that accompanies a planning application. The requirements of the 
policy will be secured through planning conditions. 
9.74 See also Local Plan policy T8 Servicing in relation to delivery and servicing plans; and the London Plan Sustainable Design and Construction. 
9.75 Monitoring indicators IND24, IND25 and IND26 will report on new waste capacity, loss of waste sites and compensatory capacity, and waste exports.

10.2 Sustainable development should protect the amenity of existing/future 
occupants, neighbours and the visual amenity of the community as a whole. 
Most new development in Lambeth results in an intensification of uses. It is 
therefore essential that amenity considerations are at the fore when designing 
at higher residential densities for a growing population. 
10.3 Quality of life issues are exceptionally important. Private space, shared space 
and the design and construction of quality communal spaces all contribute to 
our amenity. Poor design and inconsiderate servicing can have unacceptable 
impacts on people’s quality of life. For the council’s approach to conversions, 
see Local Plan policy H6. Every effort should be made to design out reliance 
upon plant and other equipment in order to reduce energy consumption and achieve the principles of sustainable design and construction set out in Local  T o table of contents183

Code SPD.
10.4 The council will seek the use of communal satellite dishes in order to reduce the visual harm to amenity caused by multiple dishes on premises.
10.5 The council will use established industry standards when assessing schemes, including ‘Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight’ (BRE Trust, 2011) 
having regard to context and other material considerations, ‘Professional 
Practice Guidance on Planning & Noise, (2017); and any other relevant 
documents. Where supporting information about amenity impacts submitted 
with planning applications requires independent technical assessment, the applicant will be required to pay for this assessment.
Policy Q3  Safety, crime prevention and counter terrorism 
A. In order to create a safe borough for all, the council will expect good design to:
i. design out opportunistic crime, anti-social behaviour, violence and fear of crime in a site-specific manner, based on an understanding of the 
locality and likely crime and safety issues it presents;
ii. pay particular regard to shared public spaces and communal areas 
(particularly cycle stores and refuse stores); and
iii. ensure that materials and construction details are robust, durable and resistant to malicious damage.
B. Applicants should:
i. engage in early pre-application discussions where possible; and
ii. meet the standards and objectives of the Secured by Design initiative.
C. Development proposals should address resilience to terrorism in a manner which is proportionate to the threat and appropriate to the context.
D. The council will apply London Plan policy D12 on fire safety. 
Supporting text 
10.6 All proposals will be expected to create positive and attractive environments. Negative design responses such as obscured glazing, solid roller shutters, 
high or solid gates and boundaries and external security bars on windows 
and doors will not normally be considered appropriate as they often result 
in very hostile environments. Positive design solutions such as good natural 
surveillance, well placed entrances, clear circulation routes, good lighting and secure boundaries are encouraged and will contribute to addressing priority 
issues, such as reduction in youth violence. Development proposals should 
consider security and counter-terrorism measures at pre-application stage  T o table of contents184

available to mitigate this risk in a proportionate and well-desiged manner. 
Further detail on acceptable security solutions for retail premises will be 
provided in the council’s Design Code SPD. 
10.7 The use of materials is particularly important. In some places, timber gates 
and fences may be considered inappropriate where they might be particularly 
vulnerable to damage. Render should be avoided in exposed locations where 
it is likely to attract graffiti. The use of anti-graffiti treatments is encouraged.
10.8 Lambeth supports, with the police, initiatives aimed at preventing crime, such as the national Secured by Design programme.
10.9 See also Local Plan policy Q6 and London Plan policy D11. For detailed advice see ‘Protecting crowded places: design and technical issues’, 2014 
and ‘Secured by Design’ guidance. 
Policy Q4  Public art 
A. The council will encourage the provision of places and spaces suitable 
for artistic and cultural programming, and maintain a framework of local 
artistic programming specialists adept at working within the locality of new 
development, for example in theatre, music and the visual arts. 
B. The council will seek the retention of good-quality public art (including statues, memorials, murals and examples of historic street furniture). Where 
appropriate the council will seek contributions towards the provision of new, 
restoration or repair of existing off-site public art, including memorials and 
street furniture, in the locality of new development.
C. The council will maintain an audit of public art works and will locally list 
those examples that are considered to be of sufficient special interest. 
Where in-situ retention of a permanent art work is not possible, where 
appropriate, the council will expect the decommissioned art work to be 
relocated to an appropriate place elsewhere within the borough.
D. The council will seek the provision of appropriately located new public 
art in:
i. opportunity areas and town centres; and
ii. large-scale redevelopment schemes.
E. All new proposals for public art, must:
i. be durable and robust;
ii. not compromise the flexibility of use or character of the space; and
iii. not harm visual amenity.
F. In addition to (f) proposals for memorials must have:  T o table of contents185

subject and location will not be considered; and
ii. arrangements in place for future maintenance such as an endowment 
if the proposal is to be erected on public land.

10.10  Culturally vibrant places play an important role in enriching Lambeth’s communities. The council will encourage investment in cultural programming 
and the production of new work and events that support, celebrate and 
reflect our diverse communities. This will include encouraging projects that 
help Lambeth become a more visibly creative and cultural borough outdoors; 
especially bringing arts activity to places that are currently underserved as well as supporting existing artistic clusters.
10.11  Public art (including memorials and street furniture) play an important role in enriching Lambeth’s environment. However, when inappropriately located, or 
where densely concentrated in a particular area, they can compromise the 
usability, flexibility of use and visual amenity of public places to their detriment. 
10.12  New work can include high-quality ornamentation/decoration integrated into the building architecture. All new artwork will be expected to be executed 
to a high standard and be of robust materials to ensure longevity. Subjects, 
themes, materials and detailing which respond to local contexts and local 
distinctiveness will be encouraged. 
Policy Q5  Local distinctiveness 
A. The local distinctiveness of Lambeth should be sustained and reinforced 
through new development. 
B. Proposals will be supported where it is shown that design of development is a creative and innovative contextual response to positive aspects of the 
locality and historic character in terms of:
i. urban block and grain, patterns of space and relationship, townscape/
landscape character;
ii. built form (bulk, scale, height and massing) including roofscapes;
iii. siting, orientation and layout and relationship with other buildings and spaces;
iv. the use of low maintenance, robust and durable walling materials; and 
v. quality and architectural detailing (including fenestration and articulation). T o table of contents186

patterns, applicants will be required to show in their design/heritage 
statements that:
i. the proposal clearly delivers design excellence; and

10.13  The council is committed to securing a high-quality built environment and 
wishes to secure excellent modern architecture and design which is inspired 
by and reinforces Lambeth’s unique local distinctiveness. This includes 
the contribution made by the historic environment and Lambeth’s diverse 
community identities. Irrespective of their architectural style, new buildings 
should be attractive and interesting, enrich their localities and improve the quality of people’s every day architectural experiences. When implementing 
this policy, the council will have regard to London Plan policy H2 (B)(1) which 
requires boroughs to acknowledge that local character evolves over time. See further guidance in the Design Code SPD.
10.14  Lambeth is characterised by well constructed brick-built buildings; the majority being also faced in good-quality brickwork. Most buildings are well 
proportioned and exhibit carefully considered and robustly executed fine 
detailing. All development should be built in materials that are durable (chosen 
in order to minimise future maintenance burden) and robustly detailed for 
longevity. In this respect, brick and Portland stone (or similar) are successful and are considered a key aspect of Lambeth’s local distinctiveness. 
10.15  Render was used extensively in the 19th century as a cheap substitute for finely dressed stone. Originally tinted to resemble natural stone, it stained badly 
in the urban environment and, where it survives, it has largely been painted 
to improve its appearance. Without regular maintenance, render surfaces 
become dirty and unattractive, and regular redecoration places a significant 
maintenance burden on property owners. Owing to its poor performance and poor appearance in local conditions, render finishes and detailing on new 
development (painted or unpainted) will generally be discouraged.
10.16  Timber buildings or buildings with areas of timber cladding (or timber-effect 
cladding) are historically not characteristic of Lambeth and do not contribute 
to local distinctiveness. Timber cladding, where it has been used locally, has 
been subject to differential weathering and deterioration under local conditions 
which has resulted in poor appearance. Owing to this poor performance the 
use of external timber cladding and detailing will generally be discouraged on buildings with the exception of structures in rear gardens (sheds, home offices 
etc.) and in parks and open spaces. 
10.17  A key element of local distinctiveness is the robust, low-maintenance character 
of Lambeth’s buildings – materials perform well and generally improve with age  T o table of contents187
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentswithout the need for regular maintenance. This aspect of local distinctiveness 
will be sought in all new development. 
10.18  The council has prepared the Lambeth Local Distinctiveness Study (2012) in order to help applicants understand the key components of local 
distinctiveness and inform good new contextual development.
Policy Q6  Urban design: public realm 
The council supports development that provides:
i. the most effective use of the site;
ii. safe, attractive, uncluttered, co-ordinated public realm that enhances the 
setting of and spaces between buildings;
iii. improved legibility, permeability and convenient access via direct routes for all users (but avoiding alleyways and back lanes);
iv. a building line that maintains or improves upon the prevailing building line (forward encroachment of established building lines will only be 
supported where it is fully justified and where no unacceptable change to 
amenity or local character will result);
v. new or enhanced public space and green infrastructure;
vi. climate change adaption measures such as sustainable urban drainage systems, urban shading and heat reduction measures; 
vii. robust street furniture, permeable paving, good-quality construction materials and landscape design which is appropriate for its site and 
immediate locality;
viii. for the removal of redundant or unsightly street furniture/clutter;
ix. modestly-sized infrastructure cabinets in unobtrusive locations and 
places them below ground in conservation areas and adjacent to heritage 
assets;
x. retains and enhances the heritage value of existing spaces, in terms of 
the spatial form, function, connection and relationship with surrounding 
buildings, materials and finishes (such as historic paving, street furniture 
and boundary treatments; and
xi. pedestrian and cycle-priority environments which are not dominated by vehicles whether moving or parked.

10.20  When assessing proposals on the footway, a clear footway width of at least 2m will be required in all schemes affecting public footways and property main 
entrances. This width allows two wheelchairs to pass one another comfortably 
and will be regarded as the minimum. Greater clear footway distances may be 
required in high footfall locations such as at major transport interchanges. 
10.21  Public realm improvements should accord with TfL’s Healthy Streets Approach. 
It is important that public realm works are consistent with the council’s agreed 
standard streetscape materials and street furniture. The council supports 
good-quality public realm and where appropriate may seek improvements from 
developers that include the provision of non-standard materials. Where there 
is deviation from the council’s standard materials, developers will be expected to contribute towards any additional maintenance costs. Improvements on the 
Transport for London Road Network (TLRN) should accord with the TfL Streets 
Toolkit Streetscape Guidance. Local guidance will apply to non-TLRN roads. 
10.22  Climate change will result in more extreme weather events and increased urban temperatures. The design of the public realm must anticipate and 
respond to these challenges through, for example, optimising opportunities 
for shade and green infrastructure which has a cooling effect on the urban 
environment and adequate sustainable drainage systems to respond to 
increased rainfall. 
10.23  Maintenance costs and practicalities of replacement are very important when designing schemes and choosing materials. Proposals that are likely to be 
problematic, or carry an unnecessary maintenance burden, will be resisted. 
For example, in-ground lights set into the root ball of trees are particularly 
susceptible to root damage, fail as a result and are expensive to maintain and 
replace. Similarly, bespoke light fittings integrated within walls and paving can be difficult to repair and replace. 
10.24  Historic street furniture can include York stone paving, granite setts and kerbs, parish markers, cast iron coal hole covers, cobbles, street names and 
signs, street lamps, historic advertising signs, bollards, post boxes and horse 
troughs. Their sympathetic retention will be sought across the borough, not 
just in conservation areas.
10.25  Streetscape/urban design guidance has been prepared for some parts of the 
borough. This includes the South Bank Public Realm Design Guide, the South 
Bank and Waterloo Partnership Covid-19 Recovery Plan and the Waterloo and 
South Bank Public Realm Framework. Any such area-specific guidance, where 
it has been agreed by the council, should inform design development in these 
areas. See also Local Plan policies EN1, T1, T2, T3, policies for Places and Neighbourhoods, and London Plan policies T2 (Healthy Streets) and D8. T o table of contents189
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsPolicy Q7  Urban design: new development 
New development (new buildings and conversion schemes) will generally be 
supported if: 
i. it is of a quality design which is visually interesting, well detailed, well-proportioned with adequate detailing/architectural interest (which can 
include accent colour, decoration and ornamentation);
ii. it has a bulk, scale/mass, siting, building line and orientation which 
adequately preserves or enhances the prevailing local character. 
Where the context is changing, the proposed development should also 
contribute towards the intended future character of the area;
iii. it includes climate change mitigation and adaptation measures such as passive solar design, sustainable urban drainage systems, urban shading 
and heat reduction measures; 
iv. it is built of durable, robust, low-maintenance materials and is designed 
to be flexible and adaptable internally for different uses and changing 
circumstances over the lifetime of the development;
v. it includes well-considered windows and doors/entrances in street and 
other public frontages, so that all entrances are attractive, safe and 
legible. Designers should ensure that features such as canopies and 
letter boxes, doorbells and intercoms, external lighting etc. are integrated 
effectively into the design, and that naturally-lit entrance halls, corridors 
and circulation spaces are provided where possible;
vi. plant and equipment (for example: meter boxes, pipes, cables, electronic communications antenna, and air conditioning units) is not placed on 
important elevations - where possible it should be fully integrated into the 
building or located in visually inconspicuous locations within effective and 
robust screened enclosures;
vii. it creates attractive roofscapes/roof tops where plant and equipment is 
fully integrated and completely screened from public view;
viii. it would not create canyon-like development especially along streets and railway lines; and
ix. any vehicular access, parking (particularly in undercrofts or basements) or servicing is designed so as to be safe and well-related to the users of the 
site and wider adjacent area, not prejudice or preclude active frontages, 
minimise impact on amenity and be visually attractive.
x. it does not prejudice the optimum future development of, or access to, adjoining plots by omitting openings on party walls and avoiding direct 
overlooking, unacceptable overshadowing or undue sense of enclosure. T o table of contents190

 T o table of contentsSupporting text 
10.26  Good design is essential for all development irrespective of its location or 
type. Generally the greatest height within any development should be to the 
street frontages with subordination in scale and height at the rear in response 
to the character and constraints of the context. Designs should be unified 
with consistent treatments and detailing to all elevations – especially in 
prominent locations. The appearance of schemes from above (especially near the London Eye), from the Westminster World Heritage Site, from the River 
Thames and from railway viaducts needs careful consideration as it is from 
these vantage points that visitors to the borough and those passing through experience Lambeth.
10.27  Climate change will result in more extreme weather events and increased urban temperatures. The design of new buildings should anticipate and 
respond to these challenges through, for example, passive solar heating and 
cooling, optimising for shade and green infrastructure which has a cooling 
effect on the urban environment and adequate sustainable drainage systems 
to respond to increased rainfall. The design of new buildings should anticipate the potential vulnerability of a development to climate change over the lifetime 
of the development. Designers should be mindful of the risk of maladaptation, 
for example designing buildings to maximise solar gain in winter without thinking through the implications for overheating in summer. 
10.28  See further guidance on design in the National Planning Practice Guidance. See also Local Plan policies EN1, EN4, Q5, Q19-23, and the Lambeth Design 
Code SPD. 
10.29  As part of the council’s ongoing commitment to delivering good design the 
council will continue to promote the role of its Heritage and Design Champion 
and will seek to ensure that Independent Design Review is available in 
accordance with London Plan policy D4 to those schemes which would 
benefit from it. The role of the Design Champion is considered relevant to all 
the Q policies in Section 10 of the Local Plan.
Policy Q8  Design quality: construction detailing 
A. When negotiating schemes the council will seek to ensure that proposed building designs and submitted details are buildable and visually attractive. 
Poorly-detailed and undeliverable built forms will be resisted.
B. When considering the details of proposals the council will:
i. resist ‘value engineering’ approaches which dilute the design quality 
and integrity of approved schemes; and
ii. seek construction detailing that is unified, visually attractive, robust and maintenance free. T o table of contents191
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsSupporting text 
10.30  The council recognises that in the realisation of buildings their design 
quality can often be compromised by poorly-considered detailing and 
inappropriate materials. 
10.31  Failure to deliver good design at construction stage often robs schemes 
of their quality and results in poorly-considered detailing which can be 
visually unattractive and difficult to maintain. Common issues include: crude 
construction detailing, gutters and down pipes being unsympathetically 
placed, integrated detailing being substituted for stick-on ornamentation, 
unattractive soffits, poorly placed meter boxes, boiler flues and gas pipes; and inadequate weathering detailing on cills, parapets and mouldings.
10.32  The council will normally request, as a condition of approval, detailed drawings including section of all external construction detailing 1:20 scale. See also 
London Plan policy D4F in relation to the maintenance of design quality. 
Policy Q9  Landscaping 
Development will be supported where landscaping:
i. is fit for purpose and demonstrates that satisfactory provision has been 
made for future growth and aftercare;
ii. retains and enhances existing planting and landscape features of value and protects them during construction;
iii. protects and enhances existing priority habitats and creates new habitats/areas of nature conservation interest and biodiversity value;
iv. maximises opportunities for provision of green infrastructure, such as through planting of trees and other soft landscaping;
v. makes use of plant species that are in keeping with the character of the existing vegetation on the site and in the general area;
vi. takes into account established or potential pedestrian and cycle desire lines and suitably accommodates them;
vii. provides strong boundary treatments, including trees and shrubs where appropriate;
viii. avoids piecemeal treatments and leftover spaces;
ix. provides means of access routes and or parking areas which are compliant with highway safety requirements and minimum parking space 
standards;
x. is attractive and well designed, taking a co-ordinated approach with any 
adjoining landscaping schemes; and 
xi. provides sustainable drainage and minimises surface run-off. T o table of contents192
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsSupporting text 
10.33  Good-quality hard and soft landscaping is encouraged. The council considers 
green and brown roofs to contribute towards the successful landscape 
quality of schemes. See also Local Plan policies Q10 and EN1 in relation to 
trees, green infrastructure and biodiversity; and London Plan policy G5 on 
urban greening. 
10.34  All planning applications should be supported by a landscape design scheme, 
and a management/maintenance programme will need to be submitted 
before work on site commences. Compliance will be secured through 
planning obligations. 
10.35  Consideration should be given to the appropriate use of plant species that provide food for human consumption such as fruit trees. If included as part of 
a proposal, allotment gardens and communal food-growing gardens will be 
supported where they are accompanied by a suitable management plan. 
10.36  When developing planting schemes, consideration should be given to creating opportunities for composting as well as the creation of a range of planting 
types which might mitigate against poor air quality; and support habitats for 
insects and animals such as hedgehogs. 
Policy Q10  Trees
A. Proposals for new development will be required to take particular account of existing trees on the site and on adjoining land. 
B. Development will not be permitted that would result in the loss of trees of significant amenity, historic or ecological/habitat conservation value 
(including veteran trees), or give rise to a threat, immediate or long term, 
to the continued wellbeing of such trees.
C. Where trees are located within a development site, the proposal will be supported only where it has been demonstrated that:
i. trees of significant amenity, historic or ecological/habitat conservation value have been retained as part of the site layout; 
ii. the retained trees can be satisfactorily protected from construction impacts and site works during the development stage; and
iii. the retained trees have been positively integrated, on a sustainable basis, as part of the site layout.
D. The council will continue to protect trees in new development by making tree preservation orders and/or by the use of appropriate 
planning conditions.
E. The council will continue to protect trees, by the use of tree preservation 
orders, that contribute to the amenity of an area or that are under threat 
from inappropriate pruning works or removal. T o table of contents193
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsF. Wherever appropriate, the planting of additional trees should be included 
in new developments in a coordinated way to maximise the green 
infrastructure network.
G. Where it is imperative to remove trees, adequate replacement planting will 
be secured. The amount and nature of the replacement planting will be 
based on the existing value of the benefits of the trees removed, calculated 
using cost/benefit tools such as i-tree or CAVAT as set out in London Plan 
policy G7 C. 
Supporting text 
10.37  New development should be designed positively to integrate existing 
trees. Where trees are located within a development site, the appropriate 
arboricultural information should be obtained and applied to demonstrate that 
layouts have been informed by the use of such survey and tree constraints 
mapping information. See also London Plan policy G5 Urban greening.
10.38   Tree planting should be recognised from the outset as an integral part of any 
development scheme and should be purposefully designed to complement the 
proposed features of the development, and those existing features intended 
for retention. On sites that have no trees whatsoever, it is important to plan for 
the planting of trees as part of the development.
10.39  Tree planting schemes should be appropriate for the intended use of the 
development and will be expected to contribute to the establishment of a 
well-constructed framework of diverse ages, sizes and species with potential 
to be managed constructively over the forthcoming years and decades. To 
ensure planting becomes established, the council will use planning conditions 
requiring weeding, watering and mulching (where appropriate) over the first five years of the planting. 
10.40  Particular attention should be given to the use of tree planting in enhancing public areas within developments and views into sites from surrounding 
viewpoints, taking into account the need to ensure that clear sightlines and 
open outlook are maintained as necessary to ensure community safety is not 
adversely affected.
10.41  Where development would have an impact on street trees, the presumption 
is in favour of their retention. Where retention is shown not to be possible, 
replacement planting on or near the same location will be secured. Parts (a), 
(b) and (c) of this policy will apply in these instances.
10.42  In Air Quality Focus Areas there will be a presumption in favour of retaining canopy cover and new development will be required to deliver additional trees 
of a suitable resilient type. 
10.43  Q10 (f) planting should be in a co-ordinated way that maximises the green 
infrastructure network, wherever possible. Such an approach aligns with 
London Plan policies G1 – Green Infrastructure and G5 – Urban Greening.  T o table of contents194

Policy Q11  Building alterations and extensions
A. The council is supportive in principle of building alterations and extensions where they have potential to deliver enlarged and additional residential 
units to meet Lambeth’s housing need. When considering proposals 
for the alteration or extensions of buildings the council will generally 
expect proposals:
i. to have a design which positively responds to the original architecture, 
roof form, detailing, fenestration (including design, materials and means 
of opening) of the host building and other locally distinct forms (such 
as group characteristics); such features should be respected, retained 
and where necessary on heritage assets authentically reproduced; 
ii. to ensure, wherever possible, that new or replacement plant or 
equipment (for example: meter boxes, pipes, cables, antenna, air 
conditioning units) are fully integrated into the building, are not placed 
on publically-visible elevations and, where integration is not an option, 
are adequately and robustly screened;
iii. to, wherever possible, include energy efficiency improvements 
such as more efficient plant, improvements to thermal performance 
and renewable energy generation; and climate change adaptation 
measures such as improved shading on southern elevations and 
natural ventilation. 
Extensions
B. Subordination will be a key consideration when assessing proposals for 
extensions. Development which unacceptably dominates the host building 
will not be permitted. Subordination, in all its forms, is particularly important 
in relation to heritage assets. To protect outdoor amenity space, as a 
general rule, no extension should reduce amenity space to less than the 
minimum required for that dwelling type by Policy H5.
C. Closet extensions are characteristic of many early- to mid-19th century 
buildings and should generally be retained. Where considered appropriate 
new closet extensions should generally reflect the following locally distinct 
patterns, especially on heritage assets:
i. come off a stairwell; 
ii. have floor levels aligned with the stairwell half-landings;
iii. be a similar width to the stairwell; 
iv. not obstruct the outlook from adjoining windows; and
v. terminate at least half a storey below eaves level. T o table of contents195
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsD. Rear returns (also known as outriggers) are characteristic of many mid- late 
19th century buildings in Lambeth and should generally be retained. New 
rear returns will normally be acceptable where they are characteristic of the 
building type and immediate locality.
E. Infill extensions (infilling the space along-side existing closet extensions or rear returns) should generally: 
i.  be single storey on heritage assets;
ii. have a glazed, light-weight appearance to differentiate them from the rear return; and 
iii. be set back from the end of the main return on heritage buildings and not project beyond the end wall of the return above ground floor level 
elsewhere.
F. Full-width rear extensions will normally be supported where they meet 
criteria (a) (i) and (b).
G. Front extensions are not considered appropriate where they would unacceptably break the established building line or be at odds with the 
prevailing architectural character of the host building or its group.
H. Side extensions should:
i. retain sufficient side space above ground floor level to maintain gaps 
between buildings and prevent visual terracing. In suburban locations 
a minimum of 1m side space should generally be retained between the 
extended building and the property boundary. In some instances, for 
example on corner sites or in development affecting heritage assets, 
the retention of established spatial standards may deem all side extensions unacceptable. 
ii. not unacceptably imbalance semi-detached pairs; and
iii. generally be set back from the corners of the building and with lower roofs than the main roof.
I. New dormers should:
i. be avoided on front roof pitches (unless similar buildings in the immediate context already exhibit appropriate front dormers);
ii. be subordinate (below the ridge and set in from the eaves and flanks) so that the roof remains the dominant element in the composition;
iii. be of design, materials and detailing appropriate to the host building; and
iv. have windows (solid, windowless dormers are generally not acceptable).
v. On sensitive buildings (including heritage assets), where dormers are considered appropriate in principle, they should also be modest in  T o table of contents196
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentssize, aligned with the openings below. Box dormers are considered 
unacceptable in sensitive heritage contexts. 
J. Where rooflights fall under planning control they should generally be modest in size and be placed and aligned sensitively to respect the character of the 
host building. On heritage assets they will normally be resisted on street 
facing roof pitches; where considered appropriate they should be small in 
size and aligned with the windows on the elevation below.
K. Roof additions and mansards will not be permitted where they would harm 
the architectural integrity (building form and design integrity) of the original 
building or its group. Where considered appropriate on locally distinct 
buildings, mansards should:
i. replicate locally distinct forms, materials and detailing;
ii. preserve, extend or reinstate original features such as chimneystacks and pots, parapets and party wall upstands.
L. Other types of additional accommodation on roofs will normally only be acceptable on non-standard roof types where they comply with (a) (i) 
and (b). 
M. Roof terraces and balconies will be assessed against Local Plan policy 
Q2 (Amenity). Where their loss is proposed as part of a roof extension, the 
re-provision of that amenity space will be required to meet the minimum 
requirements of Local Plan policy H5. 
N. Living (green) roofs will be strongly encouraged for flat roofs which are not used as amenity space.

10.44  Residential conversions and residential extensions (upward, rear and side) present important opportunities to deliver additional homes across Lambeth. 
See also policies Local Plan policies H6, Q2 and Q14 and the council’s Design 
Code SPD. The council is committed to ensuring that all building alterations 
and extensions deliver good design and respond to climate change through 
mitigation and adaptation measures. The vast majority of Lambeth’s buildings are built to established local patterns and forms. Design unity, repetitive 
detailing and compositional harmony are essential characteristics of local 
distinctiveness and should be respected when alterations and extensions are being undertaken.
10.45  Climate change will result in more extreme weather events and urban heating. Every opportunity should be taken through building alterations and extensions 
to adapt to these challenges. For example, simple measures such as the 
use of brises soleil and external blinds on south facing elevations to lessen 
overheating; or upgrading insulation when undertaking internal refurbishment. 
Designers should be mindful of the risk of maladaptation, for example  T o table of contents197
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsdesigning buildings to maximise solar gain in winter without thinking through 
the implications for overheating in summer.
10.46  A key element of Lambeth’s local distinctiveness is its rich historic roofscape which includes slated pitched, hipped and ‘London’ type roofs. On traditional 
buildings the council will expect the detailing of dormers fully to accord with 
established locally distinct patterns as set out in English Heritage’s listed 
building guidance leaflet ‘Dormer Windows’ (1991) which is available on the 
council’s website.
10.47  On traditional buildings the council will expect the detailing of traditional mansards fully to accord with established locally distinct patterns as set out 
in English Heritage’s listed building guidance leaflet ‘Mansard Roofs’ (1989) 
which is available on the council’s website.
10.48  Rear gardens are the area of land to the rear of the back elevation of the main body of the host building, excluding any returns of extensions to the 
host building but including any outbuildings, hard standings, ponds, garages 
or other structures. Where a plot is unconventionally shaped, for example 
when there is no rear garden and a side or front garden function as the main 
private amenity space, the garden that provides the private amenity space will be treated as a rear garden for policy purposes. Otherwise, front and side 
gardens should be excluded from the calculation. 
10.49  See also Local Plan policy Q7 which will be applied to significant alteration 
schemes such as estate renewal projects; and policy Q14 in relation to 
development in gardens and the Design Code SPD.
Policy Q12  Refuse and recycling 
A. The council will expect all refuse and recycling storage to:
i. fully integrate into the wider design from the outset;
ii. be conveniently located for users and within the stipulated distances 
for collection;
iii. have attractive heavy-duty, robustly detailed structures;
iv. be fully ventilated; 
v. be large enough to accommodate the easy manoeuvring of refuse/recycling containers and have sufficient space to accommodate any 
increased storage requirements; and
vi. be secure and safe.
B. Additionally communal, commercial or large scale refuse stores should be:
i. located away from residential accommodation to avoid harm to 
amenity and outlook;
ii. mechanically ventilated where necessary; and 
iii. have a water supply and drain to allow for wash down.  T o table of contents198
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsSupporting text
10.50  The council has a strategic objective to move the management of municipal 
waste higher up the waste hierarchy. This requires all development to have 
refuse and recycling provision that maximises the amount of waste that is 
recycled and composted and minimises residual waste. By reducing overall 
waste and moving waste up the hierarchy the objective is to reduce the 
environmental impacts of waste and recycling. This includes reducing the associated greenhouse gas emissions which is a key ambition of the council’s 
response to the climate emergency. 
10.51  The storage and management of refuse and recycling is a priority on which 
the council places great importance. Poorly designed and located, refuse 
and recycling storage facilities that do not cater for all, result in unacceptable 
environments and poor living conditions for residents. In meeting the policy 
requirements designers should also be mindful of the needs of people with 
disabilities, children and older people. Innovative approaches to optimise recycling and minimise cross-contamination will be strongly encouraged. 
10.52  Ideally in housing schemes each property with its own front door should have its own recycling and waste storage located in an unobtrusive 
location within its curtilage such as a side or rear garden. Where there is 
only front garden provision, simple screened enclosures built in brick are 
considered appropriate. 
10.53  As the majority of household waste is generated in the kitchen, designers 
are encouraged to ensure adequate storage provision within the kitchen for 
Lambeth’s three main waste streams: i) co-mingled recycling, ii) food waste 
and (iii) general waste that cannot be recycled. 
10.54  See also Local Plan policies EN7 and H6, the council’s Refuse and Recycling Storage Design Guide and Waste and Recycling Storage and Collection 
Requirements – Technical Specification for Architects and Developers.
Policy Q13  Cycle storage
A. Cycle storage in all development (including conversions) should be:
i. fully integrated into proposals from the initial design stage;
ii. directly and conveniently accessed from outside the building;
iii. accessible, attractive, secure and safe to use;
iv. either in individual lockers, or in stores shared by groups of 
immediate neighbours;
v. covered, fully ventilated, robustly constructed and easy to maintain; 
vi. be fully compliant with the London Cycling Design Standards; and
vii. inclusive, allowing for different user needs and different types of cycles. T o table of contents199
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsB. When considering small-scale flat conversions and intensification of use the 
council will: 
i. assess whether there is scope to provide adequate cycle storage provision when assessing unit numbers/site layouts (and may seek 
a reduction in unit numbers in order to accommodate suitable cycle 
storage provision);
ii. support cycle storage in front gardens/forecourts only where it does not compromises visual amenity or access;
iii. support storage within flats where there is a dedicated storage place, fire safety is not compromised, accessibility is convenient and it does 
not result in cycles being stored externally such as on a balcony or 
roof; and 
iv. consider the removal of an on-street parking bay in favour of an on-road cycle store to be shared between residents where it can 
be shown that there is no other practical alternative due to site 
constraints. The cost, including the opportunity cost of kerbside space, 
is to be borne by the development.
C. All cycle storage should be fully compliant with the minimum standards set 
out in the London Plan and exceed these where a high demand for cycling 
is expected. 
Supporting text 
10.55  In order to encourage the increased use of cycling for sustainable transport, 
health and wellbeing (see Local Plan policy T3), the council will require all 
development to provide safe, covered and secure cycle storage of the highest 
quality that is accessible to all users. Within the cycle storage a minimum 
of 25 per cent of provision in the form of single-height horizontal stands 
(‘Sheffield’ type stands) is required in all developments. A minimum of 5 per cent of the total cycle parking provision should be spaced sufficiently far 
apart to accommodate adapted or cargo cycles. For the remaining provision, 
less accessible solutions, such as two tiered racks and ‘walk in’ vertical wall mounted storage should only be considered where it can be demonstrated 
that available space requires this. Vertical storage where the cycle must be 
lifted off the floor will not be accepted. Only options where it is possible to 
lock the frame and wheel of the cycle to the stand are acceptable. Communal 
bike stores should provide charging facilities for e-bikes. The council sets a premium on the quality of parking provided and, where space is limited, 
will consider a flexible approach allowing for the introduction of more space 
efficient options after first occupation. All cycle parking should be provided in 
accordance with contemporary cycle parking standards as contained within 
the London Plan, with reference to the London Cycle Design Standards. 
10.56  In new-build schemes each house (or flat with its own front door and residential curtilage should have its own dedicated cycle locker. In small front  T o table of contents200
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsgardens cycle storage should generally be the low type – bike boxes and bike 
hangers – rather than taller walk-in structures which, because of their height 
and bulk, are likely to harm visual amenity. Particular care is required in relation 
to heritage assets. 
10.57  The quality of cycle storage is a matter on which the council places great importance as poorly designed and located cycle storage facilities are often 
abandoned by residents, discouraging cycle use or forcing residents to store 
their cycles in communal stairwells (causing obstruction) or on their balconies 
(causing inconvenience, damage to interior finishes and visual harm). Where 
cycle parking is provided in basement car parks the council expects cycle access to be separate or segregated from other vehicular access. When 
accessed by lifts, the lifts must have sufficient capacity to cope with maximum 
demand and not be shared with pedestrian or refuse uses. Ramps should have a shallow gradient. Cycle parking which relies on access via stairs is 
not acceptable.
10.58  In new-build schemes, communal cycle storage areas should be fully 
integrated into the building and placed close to the main entrance for ease of 
use. Users should not be expected to take their cycles through more than two 
doors (including the exterior door) and direct access from outside is preferred. 
Large communal cycle storage areas are discouraged. Cycle storage areas 
should be broken down into a number of small secure facilities preferably shared by immediate neighbours to foster neighbourliness and improve 
security. Ideally cycle lockers should be provided for each flat and numbered 
accordingly in order to ensure cycles are safe from theft and damage. Communal facilities should be well lit, feel secure and welcoming, and be 
naturally ventilated with adequate space for manoeuvring. Doors, frames and 
lockers should be wide and of robust construction.
10.59  On estates and on spacious developments free-standing cycle storage structures may be acceptable. These should be purpose built permanent 
structures with roofs. Lightweight enclosures in timber are not considered 
adequately robust. The design approach should be the same as that for 
integrated cycle storage facilities, with the provision of bike lockers. Good 
lighting is essential. External cycle parking should be planned and integrated into the design of the public realm at an early stage.
10.60  In exceptional cases visitor cycle parking for developments may be provided on street subject to agreement of the council and approval of 
statutory process. 
Policy Q14  Development in gardens and amenity spaces
A. Development in gardens (or on land most recently used as gardens) should 
not result in loss of biodiversity, loss of trees of value, or poor drainage and 
accord with the requirements set out in parts (b), (c ), (d) and (e) below.
B. Front gardens and prominent corner/side gardens are not considered 
appropriate for development. Car parking in these locations will only be  T o table of contents201
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentspermitted for Blue Badge holders where a Blue Badge parking space 
cannot be accommodated on-street within an acceptable distance. In such 
cases, the proposal should demonstrate that:
i. there would be no harm to the visual amenity or biodiversity value;
ii. there would be no harm to residential outlook;
iii. an adequate boundary treatment can be maintained across the street 
frontage (without the need for outward opening gates);
iv. perimeter shrub planting is provided to act as a screen;
v. as much soft landscaping as possible is retained and the parking area surface is permeable to water;
vi. access arrangements meet relevant standards (including inclusive mobility guidance), are safe and direct;
vii. the creation or widening of a crossover would not result in the unacceptable loss of on-street parking spaces, result in more than one 
crossover at the property, be at odds with local distinctiveness or harm 
the character or appearance of a conservation area; and
viii. parking spaces meet the minimum standard dimensions.
C. New development in rear gardens (or on land last used as rear gardens) will be supported where:
D. outside of conservation areas, the total area of ground covered by buildings within the curtilage does not exceed 50 per cent of the total area of the 
curtilage excluding the ground area of the original dwelling; and
E. Local Plan policy H5 requirements for external amenity space for both 
new and existing residential properties on the site are achieved, plus an 
additional 10m2 amenity space for every bedroom above three in the host 
building; and 
i. it is subordinate in height and scale to the host building; and
ii. access arrangements meet relevant standards (including inclusive 
mobility guidance), are safe and direct; and
iii. there would be no unacceptable impacts on amenity.
F. Domestic curtilage structures such as garden sheds, garages and summer houses should not exceed one storey and should be set back at least 1m 
from all site boundaries (to allow access for the maintenance and to provide 
gaps between buildings) unless site circumstances dictate otherwise.
G. In addition to the requirements in (c) and (d) above, development on return frontages (rear gardens that front a side road) will only be supported where:
i. sufficient gaps between buildings, and views to the rear are retained maintained; and
ii. established building lines are respected. T o table of contents202

10.61  Front gardens provide a landscaped setting to buildings and an important 
defensible semi-public space. The gaps in built frontages created by side 
spaces/side gardens (and rear gardens on side streets) often provide spatial 
openness and attractive glimpse views between buildings to rear gardens. 
Rear gardens especially have visual amenity value, contribute to wellbeing, are 
of biodiversity value and are important for sustainable drainage. Collectively, gardens are an important amenity to Lambeth residents and in defining the 
borough’s spatial character. 
10.62  Parking in front gardens will only be permitted where the applicant is a Blue 
Badge holder, and a Blue Badge parking space cannot be accommodate 
on-street within a reasonable distance (normally 50m). On all classified roads 
and local distributor roads planning permission is required for the creation 
of a vehicle crossover to gain access over the footway/ verge onto the site. 
Visibility splays (vehicular and pedestrian), turning areas (required if on a classified road), parking bay dimensions (length and width) must meet current 
national guidance and local standards. Furthermore, a minimum one-metre 
wide footpath must be provided from the public footpath to main pedestrian entrance of the property. 
10.63  Advice on different approaches to constructing driveways or other paved areas using permeable surfaces is provided within the Department for Communities 
and Local Government document, ‘Guidance on the Permeable Surfacing of 
Front Gardens’ (May 2009). The use of loose gravel as permeable paving is 
discouraged as it tends to attract weeds, settles in drifts and can spill out onto 
the footway causing a trip hazard to pedestrians. 
10.64  The council will expect paved areas in gardens to be kept to the minimum necessary and be permeable / porous as an excess of hard-standing harms 
visual amenity and can cause excess surface water run-off which overloads 
drains. Proposals should retain / incorporate as much soft landscaping 
(including trees) as possible for visual amenity and biodiversity. Landscape 
design should optimise the opportunities to improve air quality and support wildlife habitats for birds, insects, reptiles and mammals such as hedgehogs. 
See Local Plan policy Q9. 
10.65  Rear gardens are the area of land to the rear of the host building, excluding 
any extensions to the host building but including any outbuildings, hard 
standings, ponds, garages or other structures. Land most recently used as 
garden is former garden land which does not benefit from an implemented 
change of use planning approval or a certificate of lawful Development 
confirming another lawful use. 
10.66  The introduction of new dwellings in gardens requires careful consideration to avoid harmful impacts on the amenity and diversity. This is especially the 
case in locations where rear gardens are small, residential densities are high 
and where there is an open space deficiency. It is essential that existing 
and proposed dwellings have access to adequate private amenity space. 
The overlooked, semi-public nature of front gardens means they cannot  T o table of contents203
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsprovide the necessary levels of privacy and quietude required by residents. 
Furthermore, a reliance on front gardens for private amenity often necessitates 
the erection of higher front boundaries, retrofitted screening, garden sheds 
and similar structures which harm the visual amenity value of front gardens. 
The use of front gardens as the primary private amenity space for residential 
properties will therefore be resisted. 
10.67  The council recognises the need for London’s character to evolve to accommodate additional housing. However, regard will still need to be 
given to the prevailing spatial characteristics when building in rear gardens. 
For example, high density mews-type developments will not generally be 
considered appropriate in spacious suburban locations where detached and 
semi-detached properties prevail. Given the statutory obligation to preserve or enhance conservation areas, it is not anticipated that development in rear 
gardens will be appropriate within most conservation areas. See Local Plan 
policy Q22 and the relevant conservation area character appraisal. 
10.68  Where a proposal involves the demolition of a residential property and the redevelopment of the whole site, the proposal will be considered against Local 
Plan policies H1, H3, H5, Q2, Q5, Q6, Q7 and Q8 (and any other relevant 
policies), rather than policy Q14. 
10.69  The council has produced a Design Code SPD to help designers deliver high quality outcomes in gardens.
Policy Q15  Boundary treatments
A. The council will seek to retain boundary treatments that are characteristic of the immediate locality, are historically unique or contribute to local 
distinctiveness.
B. Where replacement is considered appropriate, and in new development, 
the council will expect:
i. replication of positive locally distinct boundary treatments and a sympathetic response to its context in terms of height, design and 
appearance;
ii. front boundaries in residential areas and those between front gardens 
not to exceed 1.2 metre in height (unless specifically justified by the 
character of the locality or specialist function of the development);
iii. front boundaries in non-residential areas not to exceed 2 metres 
fronting the street (unless specifically justified by the character of the 
locality or specialist function of the development) and to be open in 
character rather than solid; 
iv. rear boundaries between gardens and sites not to exceed 2 metres; and
v. boundaries flanking a vehicle crossover to not exceed 900mm in height (to maintain sight lines). T o table of contents204
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsC. The raising in height of existing boundaries will only be supported where 
it is undertaken in a well designed and carefully detailed manner which is 
consistent with local character and not discordant.
Supporting text 
10.70  Historically many of the early- to mid-19th century urban properties in 
Lambeth had front boundary railings in the region of 1.1m in height. Suburban 
properties up until the First World War tended to have timber boundary 
treatments of similar height or cast iron railings on dwarf walls. Dwarf walls 
and low fences are common to inter-war properties. War-time removal of 
railings for scrap iron and the passage of time have removed many historic boundary treatments which could be authentically reinstated. Many post-war 
developments are characterised by an absence of boundary enclosures. One 
example of historically unique boundary treatments is the railings on some housing estates which were made from metal stretchers after the Second 
World War. Authentic reinstatement of locally distinct boundary treatments is 
encouraged; so too are high-quality innovative new designs inspired by locally 
distinct examples. 
10.71  This policy relates to man-made means of enclosure and not to hedges or 
screen planting. 
10.72  Boundary design should optimise the opportunities for wildlife, such as hedgehogs, to move freely between properties. 
10.73  With non-residential sites, especially large ones such as schools, great care will be required to ensure new boundary treatments and associated 
landscaping do not harm residential amenity. 
Policy Q16  Shop fronts
A. On existing premises the council will seek the retention of historic shop 
fronts or those of architectural quality or any features of interest that survive 
on premises (including historic shop signage). These should be retained, 
refurbished and sympathetically incorporated into new work even when 
changes of use are proposed.
B. Designs should:
i. integrate well into the host building, respecting the scale, style and 
general building forms;
ii. use robust, carefully detailed (for aesthetics and weathering) materials – timber framing normally being required for heritage assets;
iii. reinstate lost features which are characteristic on similar adjoining premises; T o table of contents205

entrance doors, good proportions, careful detailing;
v. maintain/include independent access to upper floor accommodation from the street frontage as part of an integrated design;
vi. have level entrances where possible; where ramps are required they should be internal except in exceptional circumstances. Materials and 
finishes should be appropriate and of high quality;
vii. permanently display the property numbers of the shop and any 
accommodation at the entrances;
viii. provide a dedicated place for a signage fascia above the shop front (not encroach above ground floor level), defined by permanent, 
integrated architectural detailing - on new-build development a 
projecting band or cornice should be built into the façade to clearly 
demark a line between fascia and the floor above;
ix. incorporate security measures in an integrated design (internally where 
possible) in order to avoid the need for external retrofitting; and
x. not have solid or perforated roller shutters or exposed, externally-mounted shutter housings.
C. The council seeks to protect the open, uncluttered character of commercial forecourts. Boundary treatments, enclosures, screening shelters etc will be 
resisted where their impact is considered harmful.

10.74  Lambeth has many examples of historic shop fronts and surviving fragments. 
They date mostly from the 19th and 20th century and often follow a set 
of general rules which contribute to local distinctiveness. Unsympathetic 
alterations can have a very damaging effect.
10.75  Unfortunately a great many replacement shop fronts are of poor quality – badly detailed with overly dominant signage and oppressive retrofitted external 
security shutters. These give many retail areas a poor appearance and harm 
visual amenity generally and contribute to unattractive night-time environments 
which imbue a fear of crime. Wherever possible the council will seek that 
new proposals reverse this unacceptable situation. Lambeth is committed to improving upon the current poor quality of many of its shop fronts (including 
bank façades and pub fronts).
10.76  Access ramps require particular attention. They must be carefully considered 
from the outset and carefully designed. They must not cause obstruction or 
affect safety. They will only be permitted on the public highway in exceptional 
circumstances. T o table of contents206
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsPolicy Q17  Advertisements and signage 
A. No advertisement shall harm amenity or highway/public safety. The council 
will support proposals for advertisement panels (hoardings) where they:
i. are individually or collectively well integrated into their context, the design of new or existing buildings or landscaping schemes;
ii. deliver design excellence in terms of access structures, framing, lighting/ illumination;
iii. contribute positively to the local scene;
iv. do not add unacceptable street/visual clutter; and 
v. do not diminish the setting or significance of heritage assets.
B. In order to enhance the environment, proposals for the renewal of advertisement consents for existing large panel advertisements will 
generally be resisted. 
C. Shop signage should:
i. be accommodated solely within a defined fascia above the façade (on 
historic buildings the height will be dictated by the pilaster/console 
detailing and on new premises it should not exceed one-fifth of the 
ground floor height);
ii. be restricted to one fascia above the shop window and one projecting/hanging sign (not exceeding 600mm x 600mm x 80mm) per elevation 
and 2.4m above the footway;
iii. the fascia sign height shall be dictated by any prevailing original pilaster 
detailing or not noticeably exceed 1/5 of the height of the ground floor 
accommodation;
iv. be illuminated (if required) in a discreet and subdued manner – without 
overly dominant fittings, clutter or cables - lighting should be limited to 
the advertisement element (logos and words) and not the full width of 
the fascia; and 
v. not be excessive, visually discordant, overly large, project excessively forward or rise up the façade above the ground floor level.

10.77  The council is committed to enhancing the environment. Unfortunately the majority of large panel advertisements within Lambeth do not contribute 
positively to Lambeth’s character. Indeed, a great many advertisement 
hoardings are considered to harm amenity because of their ad hoc 
appearance and discordant forms.  T o table of contents207
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contents10.78  In theory, design excellence has the potential to address many of the council’s 
concerns over the adverse impact of advertisements. However, rarely do 
proposals come forward where the display of large, panel advertisement 
is fully integrated into the design of a new building or in the landscaping or 
layout of a site. All too often they have been placed with little thought for visual 
amenity of integration with their surroundings. Groups of mismatched panel advertisements (long, tall and of various panel sizes) can be particularly visually 
discordant. Many exist as a hangover from when some neighbourhoods 
were neglected and run-down; yet whilst these localities have been significantly improved or enhanced over the years the hoardings remain as 
discordant features. 
10.79  Conservation area appraisals and assessments relating to the area 
regeneration schemes have identified panel advertisements as being harmful 
to the character of these areas and contributory in no small part to the 
perception of poor environmental quality/visual amenity. The same can be 
said for the setting and approaches within Lambeth to the Westminster World 
Heritage Site. Such perceptions can be a barrier to inward investment and therefore the removal of discordant advertisements in these circumstances is 
considered a priority.
10.80  Temporary shroud advertisements at high level on scaffolding are generally 
only considered appropriate in town centre locations. Applicants will be 
required to provide a full schedule of the building works being undertaken and 
a timescale for those works so that any consent granted can be time limited. 
10.81  The intensity of digital illumination (individually and cumulatively) can have a significant impact on amenity and animations or moving images can be 
distracting to road users. Proposals will be resisted where unacceptable 
impacts result. Image transition times need to be carefully considered to 
lessen the element of distraction. There are also risks of the malfunction 
in digital displays, erroneous flickering or flashing. Where digital signage is supported the council will seek to ensure that a black or dark blue default 
screen is programmed. 
10.82  Details of luminance levels appropriate for Lambeth are set out in Lambeth’s 
Advertisement and Signage Guidance 2016. 
10.83  On-street advertisements will be assessed against Local Plan policies Q1, Q6 and T2.
Policy Q18  Historic environment strategy
In order to ensure that heritage assets continue to play a key role in the quality of Lambeth’s environment, the council will prepare an Historic Environment Strategy, 
which will assist developers and other interested parties in understanding the 
justifications behind its approach to development management policies Q19, Q20, Q21, Q22, Q23, Q24, Q25 and Q26 and the wider local issues relating to the historic 
environment. T o table of contents208

 T o table of contentsSupporting text 
10.84  Through the Lambeth Historic Environment Strategy (HES) and through its 
decision making prior to preparation of the HES, the council will:
i. use its planning powers (including enforcement powers) to ensure that special regard is paid to sustaining and enhancing the 
historic environment; 
ii. support the principle of climate change mitigation alterations and 
adaption responses and sustainable design and construction within the 
historic built environment in accordance with established conservation 
best practice; 
iii. use, where appropriate, statutory powers (including non-planning legislation) to sustain or enhance the historic environment; especially 
where they might address issues preventing heritage at risk from being 
brought back to viable use/good repair;
iv. support initiatives to sustain or enhance the historic environment and bring heritage at risk back to viable use/good repair (such as the national 
‘heritage at risk’ initiative);
v. continue the identification of local heritage (undesignated) assets with the 
input of local people, groups and national amenity societies to ensure that 
Lambeth’s historic environment gains the recognition it deserves;
vi. prepare appraisals, guidance documents and SPDs, securing the input 
and support of local people, local groups and other parties, and use 
these in decision making to help guide development in a positive manner; 
vii. request that copies of significant heritage statements, desk based 
assessments and record documents are submitted to the London 
Historic Environment Record (HER); 
viii. appoint an historic environment champion to raise the profile of built 
heritage within the council and across Lambeth;
ix. use established best-practice guidance from Historic England, national amenity societies and other organisations, the British Standard 
publication BS7912:2013 ‘Guide to the Principles of the Conservation of 
Historic Buildings’ and locally prepared SPD documents to deliver best 
practice in relation to management and alteration of heritage assets; and

Lambeth’s historic environment – particularly where there are gaps in 
knowledge/understanding. 
xi. work in partnership with Historic England, neighbouring boroughs and 
other relevant groups on heritage issues.

contribution to the distinctiveness of central London. The historic environment 
is key to delivering sustainable development and is the main component of 
Lambeth’s distinctiveness and is of interest to residents and visitors alike. 
10.86  The borough’s most historic areas are also its most desirable and thus it pays financially to maintain assets in good condition. Generally Lambeth’s historic 
environment is well maintained and in a viable use as a result of the care and 
attention of asset owners and managers. Other than development pressure, 
the greatest threats to heritage assets are generally incremental change, 
poorly considered alterations and poor workmanship. The council will prepare a Heritage Strategy document to define, and keep under review, the priorities 
for sustaining the historic environment of the borough.
10.87  West Norwood Cemetery is one area where a better understanding of the 
significance of the tombs and memorials would be of value to parties involved 
in the management and conservation of the site. 
10.88  In 2019, the vast majority of Lambeth’s Heritage At Risk is concentrated at 
West Norwood Cemetery where statutory listed tombs and memorials are 
subject to decay and structural instability. An ongoing programme of works 
within the cemetery agreed between the council and the Friends of West 
Norwood Cemetery (FOWNC) proposes to address this over time. A strategy 
has been agreed, with financial support from the HLF, for the whole cemetery which includes repairs and stabilisation to 14 memorials.
10.89  The work of Lambeth Council’s in-house architects (1960 – 1990) is another area where greater understanding would benefit/inform the borough’s estate 
renewal programme and ensure the best examples are preserved. 
Policy Q19  Westminster World Heritage Site 
A. Development affecting the setting and approaches of the Westminster 
World Heritage Site will be required to demonstrate that it: 
i. preserves or enhances the Outstanding Universal Value, authenticity and integrity of the World Heritage Site (as set out in the official 
statement of Outstanding Universal Value and its setting;
ii. preserves or enhances the environmental quality of the public realm/
vantage points; and 
iii. provides the opportunity to better understand, appreciate and reveal the Outstanding Universal Value, authenticity and integrity of the site. 
B. Where existing development is identified (through area appraisals, characterisations or similar studies) as negative elements in the setting of 
approaches to the Westminster World Heritage Site the council will support 
proposals which address the adverse impact through demolition/removal, 
height reduction or re-cladding. T o table of contents210

10.90  Westminster Abbey, the Palace of Westminster and St Margaret’s Church 
were together inscribed as a world heritage site in 1987 (‘Westminster World 
Heritage Site’). World heritage sites are recognised as internationally important 
and their inscription by UNESCO highlights their Outstanding Universal Value 
which is a key consideration to take into account when determining planning 
applications. See Annex 6 for further information.
10.91  The World Heritage Site’s location on the bank of the River Thames makes it highly visible from within Lambeth. Indeed the most impressive views of the 
Houses of Parliament’s striking silhouette and some of the most attractive 
approaches/views (by river, by road, by air from the London Eye, and on 
foot) are from within the ‘immediate setting’ in Lambeth. Equally important is 
Lambeth’s role in the ‘wider setting’ or backdrop to the World Heritage Site in views from within the City of Westminster (in terms of clear sky) and in views 
from the Thames bridges (in terms of urban context).
10.92  The presence of Lambeth Palace immediately across the river from the 
Houses of Parliament, and what this represents in terms of the separation 
of Church and State, adds a further layer of significance which requires 
careful management.
10.93  An uncluttered, well-ordered and attractive urban environment, including public realm, is key to maintaining a suitable setting and approaches to the World 
Heritage Site. New development within this context should be well mannered 
and subordinate in terms of form, materiality and treatment in order to ensure 
that the Palace of Westminster retains its pre-eminence within the cityscape.
10.94  The adopted World Heritage Site Management Plan will be a material 
consideration when considering proposals. The council has prepared setting 
studies and mapped the approaches and immediate setting to inform that 
work and will continue to work in partnership with all relevant stakeholders in 
the ongoing work of maintaining, updating and preparing the management 
plan and any associated documents such as setting studies. The council sees no conflict between this aspiration and the continued role of the South 
Bank’s public realm in providing a rich and varied temporary arts, culture and 
leisure offer. 
10.95  The potential adverse impact of tall building development within Lambeth on the wider setting of the World Heritage Site has been / is a matter of concern 
for UNESCO. This concern necessitated the 2017 ICOMOS Monitoring 
Mission. Applicants will be expected to demonstrate that full account has

Development affecting listed buildings will be supported where it:
i. would conserve and not harm the significance/special interest;

10.96  Statutory listed buildings are ‘designated heritage assets’. Applicants will be 
required to provide a heritage statement for their proposals which explains in 
detail the significance of the building and the impact of the proposals on that 
significance. In line with NPPF any proposed harm to significance will require a 
clear and convincing justification.
10.97  Lambeth’s statutory listed buildings stock is rich and varied. However, the 
vast majority of listed buildings in Lambeth are residential terraces, semi-
detached houses and villas from the early- to mid-19th century. These are 
representative of relatively common (for their time) London building types 
and are listed because of their intact/little altered state. Their significance lies 
largely in the survival of their historic characteristics which include group value, repetitive/common built forms and floor plans, compartmented/ rectangular 
room layouts (reflecting a hierarchy of original uses), refined, traditional joinery 
and iron detailing, the use of brick, natural timber and natural slate; and of regionally significant building forms such as semi-basements and London 
roofs. Surviving interior features such as windows, glass staircases, doors, 
joinery, chimney breasts and chimney pieces, lath and plaster/decorative 
plasterwork, floor boards, wine cellar shelving, partitions, glass, stone sinks 
and built-in cupboards all contribute to significance and should be retained.
10.98  The council will support only the minimum amount of alteration necessary to secure the optimum viable use of a listed building. Where a building is 
already in its optimum viable use, alterations which diminish significance will be 
resisted.
10.99  New work should preserve significance, reinforce appropriate local characteristics and, where possible, secure enhancement of the listed building. 
High-quality craftsmanship will be required to ensure that authentic detailing 
is achieved using original materials. Authenticity is essential in this respect. 
Inferior modern materials and inferior modern detailing are not considered 
acceptable for the replacement or reinstatement of historic fabric or features. The acceptability of double glazing will be judged on a case by case basis 
using best-practice guidance from Historic England. See also Policy EN4.

outbuildings; their demolition will also normally be resisted.
10.101  The conversion of a listed building to new uses can result in a significant impact on historic fabric and plan form in order to meet the necessary 
building regulations. Change-of-use proposals should be accompanied 
by full information on the impacts relating to any such issues including fire 
spread, floor loading, sound attenuation and servicing. Changes of use will 
not be permitted unless interventions of this nature can be sympathetically accommodated. Any resulting harm should be fully justified as necessary for 
delivering the optimum viable use for the building. In this respect it should be 
proved that other, less harmful uses are not viable. 
10.102  Consideration will be given to the cumulative impact of development when considering changes affecting the setting of statutory listed buildings. Listed 
buildings need to maintain the ability to adapt and evolve. In this respect 
it is important that they retain adequate space around them to provide an 
adequate setting and sustain future uses. Similarly, the development of 
curtilage land around a listed building will be resisted where it is considered that the listed building would not retain sufficient land to remain viable in the 
longer term. 
10.103  Applications for works to statutory listed buildings should be accompanied 
by a Heritage Statement (proportionate to the extent and nature of the works 
proposed) which covers the significance of the asset, describes the proposal, 
explains the need/justification for the proposal; and assesses the impact of the 
proposed changes on the significance of the listed asset.
Policy Q21  Registered parks and gardens
Development proposals affecting parks and gardens on the national register will be 
supported where they:
i. sustain and enhance the significance of landscape and its features of interest (including structures); 
ii. take opportunities to restore original features or do not compromise future restoration opportunities; 
iii. promote greater accessibility; 
iv. preserve the setting (including views in and out). ; and

The majority are public parks and include some of the largest and most 
attractive parks in the borough. West Norwood Cemetery is also publicly 
accessible. However, some designated landscapes are private property 
and do not have public access. The special interest of all the designated 
landscapes lies in their layout, landscape and structures and they often contain heritage assets. The character of their settings can also be important. 
Proposals involving tall buildings in the settings of registered parks and 
gardens will also be considered against the criteria in Local Plan policy Q26. 
Policy Q22  Conservation areas 
A. Development proposals affecting conservation areas will be permitted where they preserve or enhance the character or appearance of 
conservation areas by:
i. respecting and reinforcing the established, positive characteristics 
of the area in terms of the building line, siting, design, height, forms, 
materials joinery, window detailing etc; 
ii. protecting the setting (including views in and out of the area).
B. Façade retention with the demolition of the remaining building is generally 
not considered appropriate in conservation areas as it results in the loss of 
historic structures. Development involving demolition in a conservation area 
will only be supported if:
i. the structure proposed for demolition does not make a positive contribution to the character or appearance of the area; 
ii. a suitable replacement has been granted planning permission; and
iii. a planning condition and/or section 106 agreement has been made that the building shall not be demolished until a contract for the 
replacement building has been made.

10.108  The council’s ongoing preparation of conservation area statements, with valuable input from local people, local groups and other bodies is giving a 
better understanding of the significance of each area and the issues they face. 
Themes across conservation areas such as inappropriate boundary treatments

will pay particular regard to ensuring that poor examples of alterations within conservation areas do not set precedents for future proposals and that any 
subsequent new works raise standards in terms of its design, detailing, 
materials and appearance. 
Policy Q23  Non-designated heritage assets: local heritage list 
A. The council will maintain a list of non-designated heritage assets which it considers to be of local (or greater) significance. It will be known as the 
‘local heritage list’. It will include:
i. archaeology (archaeological priority areas);
ii. buildings and structures (local list); and
iii. designed spaces and landscapes (local landscape register).
B. The objectives of maintaining the local heritage list are to:
i. raise awareness of these assets and foster a greater appreciation of 
them;
ii. sustain or enhance their significance; and
iii. protect them and their settings. 
C. The council will:
i. resist the destruction of assets on the local heritage list (or harm to their settings) and expect applicants to retain, preserve, protect, 
safeguard and, where desirable, enhance them when developing 
proposals that affect them; 
ii. require proper investigation and recording of archaeological remains and publication and archiving of results to advance understanding; and
iii. apply London Plan policy HC1D. 
D. In accordance with London Plan Policy HC1, the council will require applicants for proposals which involve excavation or ground works on sites 
of archaeological potential to:  T o table of contents215
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsi. submit an archaeological assessment and evaluation of the site, 
including the impact of the proposed development 
ii. preserve, protect, safeguard and enhance archaeological monuments, remains and their settings in development, and seek a public display 
and interpretation where appropriate 
iii. undertake proper investigation and recording of archaeological remains 
as an integral part of a development programme, and publication and 
archiving of results to advance understanding.

10.109  Assets on the local heritage list are ‘non-designated heritage assets’. 
Applicants will be required to provide a heritage statement/ archaeological 
assessment/site evaluation for their proposals. Proposals that will have a 
harmful impact will be required to meet the relevant tests set out in the NPPF.
10.110  The council will seek to keep the local heritage list up to date with input from local people, groups and national amenity societies. However, through the 
delivery of normal planning duties the council may also identify non-designated 
heritage assets that may not be on the local heritage list. Where applications 
are received for such assets this policy will apply.
10.111  Where appropriate the council will seek statutory designation (designated 
heritage asset status) to secure the protection of undesignated 
heritage assets. 
10.112  The local heritage list should be considered a work in progress as it will be 
subject to change over time as more assets are identified. It can be viewed 
on the council website. Proposals affecting buildings and structures will 
be permitted where their architectural interest, historic interest, townscape 
value and rarity are sustained or enhanced in accordance with established 
conservation best practice. 
10.113  Proposals affecting designations associated with a close historical association will be permitted where they maintain those aspects of the building/structure 
which were present during the period of the recognised historical significance.
10.114  Archaeological Priority Areas are identified on the Policies Map.
10.115  Local historic spaces and designed landscapes also contribute significantly to 
Lambeth’s local distinctiveness and are included on the local heritage list. 
10.116  Some of these spaces benefit from protection under other legislation such as the Rush Common Act (1806) or the London Squares Preservation Act (1931). 
For a full list of the sites affected by this Act see Appendix 7. 
10.117  Proposals affecting local spaces and landscapes will be permitted where their 
settings, openness, design integrity and features of interest are preserved 
or enhanced. The authentic reinstatement or modern reinterpretation  T o table of contents216

strongly encouraged. 
10.118  The council will maintain a local ‘heritage at risk register’ with a view to raising the profile of undesignated heritage assets at risk and securing their 
conservation, restoration or enhancement.
Policy Q24  River Thames 
A. When making proposals fronting the River Thames, or visible from the river 
or its bridges, applicants should be able to show that their proposals:
i. enhance the character of the river frontage, views from the river and from the opposite bank;
ii. preserve the setting and approaches of the Thames bridges;
iii. maintain and create publicly accessible spaces / routes along the river for a continuous riverside walkway;
iv. are contextual - reinforcing the distinctiveness of the wider city river front;
v. respect the unique character of the Albert Embankment as a piece of historic engineering;
vi. protect, restore and enhance the draw dock, slipways, steps, stairs, paving and other historic features associated with the river;
vii. reinforce connections from the city to the river; 
viii. maintain existing access / egress points to and from the river; and
ix. recognise the value of the river’s ‘blue infrastructure’ and its connection with adjoining green infrastructure and green corridors.
B. Unless directly related to River transport, development on/in the river itself will be resisted. Proposals for permanent moorings on the River Thames:
i. will only be permitted for uses which require such a location and which support those providing river functions or public access and enjoyment 
of the river;
ii. should not adversely affect the open aspect, historic setting or 
security of the river frontage, archaeology of the foreshore and historic 
embankment retaining walls, steps, locks or slipways;
iii. should not impede views across the river from the river, the riverside 
and the bridges, particularly of landmark buildings, especially between 
the Westminster World Heritage Site and Lambeth Palace, and should 
be in scale with the river scene;
iv. should not have a detrimental impact on navigation, river regime or environment; T o table of contents217

waste disposal and servicing, but not require excessive on-shore areas 
for servicing; and 
vi. should be of outstanding architectural or historical importance, or have 
some special maritime interest.
C. The council will seek retention of all existing river bridges and is supportive in principle of new pedestrian and cycle bridge proposals in appropriate 
locations, including the Wandsworth to Pimlico pedestrian / cycle bridge. 
D. Development fronting the river should provide riparian life-saving equipment 
where necessary and appropriate. 
Supporting text 
10.119  Exceptional quality is required of new buildings and the spaces between them to ensure that the setting of the Westminster World Heritage Site and other 
heritage assets, and London’s image and status as a world city are preserved. 
10.120  The River Thames frontage is Lambeth’s window to the city and presents 
an opportunity to ensure that new development harnesses the positive 
characteristics of central London as a whole – contributing to the city’s 
unique character.
10.121  Development that blocks sunlight and daylight to the riverside and which presents incompatible uses (such as parking/servicing and private space) to 
the river side are considered unacceptable.
10.122  New piers, if acceptable, should not lead to the obstruction of the footway 
either through structures or queuing. The council will continue to support 
initiatives which deliver a safe and attractive river environment including 
suicide prevention measures (CCTV, signage, and information) and lighting 
initiatives such as the Illuminated River project. The provision of riparian 
life-saving equipment such as grab chains, access ladders and life buoys will be considered on a case by case basis taking account of the type of 
development, its location and any potential risks. 
10.123  The Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is responsible for issuing marine 
licences under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. A marine licence 
may be needed for activities involving a deposit or removal of a substance 
or object below the mean high water springs mark or in any tidal river to the 
extent of the tidal influence and early consultation with the MMO is advised. 
Applicants should also refer to the Marine Policy Statement for guidance on any planning activity that includes a section of tidal river.  T o table of contents218

A. The council will resist harm to the significance of strategic views 
(Panoramas, Linear Views, River Prospects and Townscape Views defined 
in the LVMF and listed in Annex 6) and secure improvements within them in 
accordance with London Plan policy HC4. 
B. The council’s views of local interest are set out in part’s c and d below. In assessing proposals the council will seek to protect their general 
composition and character from harm. Particular regard has been paid 
to the identification of views of the Westminster World Heritage Site. The 
following views are considered to be of local interest:
Panoramas
C. The objective in identifying these views is to ensure that no foreground or 
middle- ground development is intrusive, unsightly or prominent in relation 
to the panoramic view as a whole, or landmark buildings within:
i. Views NNW from Brockwell Park to (a) Lambeth Town Hall’s tower and 
(b) St Matthew’s Church tower; and (c) views N and NNE to the city;
ii. View NNE from Norwood Park (across LB Southwark) to the city;

ix. View NW from Queen Elizabeth Hall roof garden to the North Bank of the Thames including the Houses of Parliament;
x. View W from the level 4 terrace of the Royal Festival Hall to the North Bank of the Thames including the Westminster World Heritage Site.
Landmark Silhouettes
D. The objective in identifying these views is to ensure that no development obscures or is intrusive, unsightly, visually dominates or competes with, 
and no background development harms, the silhouette of the assets in:

10.124  The relatively long north-south section of the River Thames and the proximity 
of the Westminster World Heritage Site and the wider city means that many 
strategic and local views are concentrated in the northern part of the borough 
looking up and down the river and out of Lambeth. Lambeth is also the focus 
of views from across the river: either of heritage assets on the South Bank and 
Albert Embankment, or as the backdrop of views of the Westminster World Heritage site. The contribution of these views to the significance of the wider 
city is major.
10.125  Lambeth’s topography plays an important role in dictating local views. The 
elevated land of the Norwood Ridge to the south of the borough and the 
relatively flat topography to the north means that most distant views are 
northerly; a number looking out across low-lying Southwark to the city beyond.
10.126  The nature of local views designations in Lambeth and adjoining boroughs means that many views cross borough boundaries. This means that co-
operation between boroughs is particularly important if views are to be 
managed effectively. The local views identified as significant by adjoining 
authorities in their policies and SPD documents will be a material consideration 
when considering planning proposals. These include the City of London’s St Paul’s Heights policy.
10.127  Applicants should provide accurate digital model based assessments of the impact of their proposals on designated views; including, where 
necessary, verified renders of the proposal within the view. Digital models, 
where submitted, should be VUCity compatible. The Mayor’s London 
Views Management Framework SPG (LVMF) will be used when considering 
proposals that affect strategic views. See Annex 6 for a list of the strategic views identified in the LVMF. Historic England’s ‘Setting of Heritage Assets’ 
guidance will also be used to inform the assessment of proposals where a 
heritage asset are affected. The council will produce a Lambeth Local View Management SPD to assist with the management of development within local 
views, wherever possible, in a positive manner. T o table of contents221

A. Having particular regard to the international obligation to preserve the 
OUV of the Westminster World Heritage Site and taking into account the 
desirability of preserving the settings of heritage assets, proposals for 
tall buildings will be supported where they are in locations identified as 
appropriate for tall buildings in Annex 10 and where:
i. will not adversely impact on strategic or local views; 
ii. design excellence is achieved (form, proportion, silhouette, detailing 
and materials etc.);
iii. the proposal makes a positive contribution to public realm and townscape including at street level, whether individually or as part of a 
group; 
iv. where proposed near existing tall building groups, proposals should 
follow the established principles of group composition such as 
noticeable stepping down in height around cluster edges; 
v. the proposal adequately addresses the criteria in London Plan policy 
D9C in terms of acceptable visual, environmental and functional 
impacts including microclimate, wind turbulence, noise, daylight and 
sunlight, reflective glare, aviation (including the safeguarded zones 
around Heathrow Airport, London City Airport, Battersea Heliport 
and the helipad at Kings’ College Hospital), navigation and electronic communication or broadcast interference; and
vi. it can be shown that the site can accommodate the uses and quantum of development proposed in terms of meeting acceptable standards of 
amenity, access, transport accessibility and servicing.
B. Outside the locations identified in Annex 10 or as identified in site 
allocations, there is no presumption in favour of tall building development. 
Should tall buildings be proposed outside the locations identified in 
Annex 10 or as identified in site allocations, the applicant will be required  T o table of contents222
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment

met. In addition:
i. proposals for tall buildings will only be considered acceptable in established low rise residential neighbourhoods where they are part of 
a comprehensive scheme which integrates well with the locality.
C. Where existing tall buildings are identified (through CA appraisals, 
characterisations and other similar studies) as negative elements in 
strategic or local views, heritage setting or townscape terms etc., the 
council will encourage and support proposals which lessen the adverse 
impact though redevelopment, height reduction or re-cladding.

10.128  In the right locations tall buildings can make important contributions towards 
delivering new homes, economic growth and regeneration. The locations 
identified as appropriate for tall buildings in Annex 10 are situated in those 
parts of Vauxhall and Waterloo that are Opportunity Areas and in Brixton town 
centre. Place specific policies for these locations are provided in Section 11: 
Places and Neighbourhoods, along with a small number of retained policies. The council is also preparing a Site Allocations DPD which may identify sites 
suitable for tall building development. 
10.129  High level visual impact analysis, taking into account heritage asset settings, 
views and, where relevant, existing guidance on cluster formation and 
rudimentary 3D modelling, has been used to identify the general heights 
shown on the Annex 10 maps. See Topic Paper 8 Tall Buildings and the 
supporting evidence base documents listed in Annex 1. Applicants should use 
this information to inform their proposals. Given the high level nature of the analysis that informed them, these heights should be considered indicative as 
careful siting and massing informed by detailed site specific analysis may show 
greater heights can be achieved without harm. Where it is proposed to exceed the Annex 10 heights the council will expect the verified technical evidence 
supporting that approach and the proposed massing to be subject to review 
from Lambeth’s independent Design Review Panel (DRP) at master-planning 
stage and again when a detailed proposal has been developed. Applicants 
should also seek pre-application advice from Historic England. 
10.130  From time to time windfall sites may provide the opportunity for tall building development in locations that have not been anticipated through the plan-
led process. Part (b) of this policy is intended to deal with these situations. 
It should be recognised that outside the Annex 10 locations there is not a 
presumption in support of tall development and therefore, in these instances, 
the onus will be upon the applicant to fully meet all of the policy tests. Where  T o table of contents223
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsit is proposed to bring forward proposals under part (b) the verified technical 
evidence supporting that approach and the proposal should be independently 
reviewed by the DRP at master-planning stage and again at detailed design 
stage during the pre-application process. The Design Code SPD provides 
further guidance on heritage impact assessments. Applicants will also be 
required to seek Historic England’s pre-application advice. 
10.131  All proposals for tall buildings should be accompanied by a detailed urban design assessment including accurate information on the townscape impact 
assessment. This should include a map showing the Zone of Theoretical 
Visibility (ZTV) of the proposal, verified digital modelling showing the impact 
on its immediate locality, on local and strategic views; and on any affected 
heritage asset settings. Any digital models submitted for assessment should be in a VUCity compatible format. Important views from within adjoining 
boroughs should also be included in any assessment. Historic England Advice 
Note 4 -Tall Buildings (2015) should also be used to inform the development and assessment of tall building proposals.
10.132  The safeguarded area around the Battersea Heliport is in place to ensure its operation is not inhibited by development. The safeguarded area is marked on 
the Local Plan policies map. In accordance with ODPM Circular 01/2003 (as 
updated), certain applications within that area will be subject to consultation 
with the Civil Aviation Authority and the Heliport operator. Restrictions may 
affect building height and design, or for development that might create a bird hazard (impacting on helicopter safety).
10.133  Development which results in canyon-like environments due to tall buildings being in uncomfortably close proximity, will not be permitted on design and 
amenity grounds. Given the hilly character of some parts of South Lambeth 
the influence of the topography on the visual and environmental impact of the 
proposal will be a consideration in assessing schemes.
10.134  Low rise and mid rise proposals will be assessed against Local Plan policies 
Q6 and Q7. See also Local Plan policies Q19 and Q25 in relation to the 
Westminster World Heritage Site and views.
Policy Q27  Basement development 
D. The council will support basement and associated development (light 
wells, basement area excavation, access ramps etc.) where applicants can 
demonstrate that no unacceptable impacts will result to:
i. subterranean ground water flow (ground water);
ii. slope stability (land stability); 
iii. surface flow and flooding (see also Local Plan policy EN5 and 
Annex 4); 
iv. the ability of trees and soft landscaping (existing and proposed) to thrive without irrigation;  T o table of contents224
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsv. cumulative effects of basement development in the locality; 
vi. waste to land fill and carbon emissions; and 
vii. designated and non-designated heritage assets 
(including archaeology).
E. Proposed basement accommodation will generally be expected to:
i. have external features and details that respond appropriately to the character and materials of the host building and cause no harm to the 
visual amenity of the wider context; 
ii. include a positive pumped device (or equivalent) to mitigate against the 
risk of sewer flooding; 
iii. fully integrate plant and machinery in order to minimise visual and noise impacts; 
iv. incorporate sustainable urban drainage measures or any other mitigation measures where required; and
v. where possible be naturally ventilated.
F. Beneath existing residential buildings and in new-build residential schemes basement level accommodation should:
i. not result in any more than one storey of basement accommodation below ground level; 
ii. not create basement accommodation beneath existing basements or semi-basements; and
iii. meet the necessary standards for habitable accommodation in relation to room size, outlook, daylight and sunlight etc. 
G. Full (as opposed to semi) basement extensions beyond the ground floor footprint of a residential building, and any associated basement level 
outdoor space and steps, will be supported where the proposal:
i. is limited to the rear; 
ii. has a roof treatment level with ground level which allows it to continue 
to provide amenity space for the host building; 
iii. the basement footprint does not exceed the existing footprint of the house to the side or at the front; and 
iv. generally retains no less than 70 per cent of the rear garden area free of subterranean development and at its original ground level. 
H. In front and side gardens basement lightwells (on existing buildings or with new build) should:
i. only be provided where required for outlook and daylight for the accommodation they serve; T o table of contents225
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsii. not entail the inappropriate alteration of existing basement areas and 
enclosures;
iii. not result in the excavation or loss of front or side garden space which would harm the integrity of the host building or the character of the 
locality (especially on heritage assets); 
iv. minimise the visual impact through good design (in many cases, 
especially conservation areas, this is likely to mean lightwells with 
pavement grilles rather than open basement areas enclosed with 
balustrades); and 
v. ensure existing parking bays are not shortened to below the minimum standard (where this occurs the council will seek the removal of the 
parking bay); 
I. In the case of wholly non-residential buildings, it may be possible to 
have a non-residential basement greater than one storey in depth if it 
can be robustly demonstrated that no unacceptable impacts will result in 
accordance with part (a) of this policy. In addition, the proposed scale and 
quantum of development must be appropriate to the site and its context 
and all other planning policy requirements should be addressed to the satisfaction of the Council. 
J. Applicants for basement proposals should submit a Stage 1 (Screening) Basement Impact Assessment, undertaken by a qualified professional, 
which captures all issues relevant to the proposal including:
i. subterranean ground water flow (ground water); 
ii. slope stability (land stability);
iii. surface flow and flooding (see also Local Plan policy EN5 and 
Annex 4);
iv. cumulative effects of basement development in area;
v. waste to land fill and carbon emissions; and 
vi. designated and non-designated heritage assets.
K. The council may, upon review of the Stage 1 (Screening) require further, more detailed Basement Impact Assessment (stages 2 – 4). Applicants 
will be expected to carry the cost of any independent assessment on the 
council’s behalf of this further work.

10.135  Basement excavation can affect ground conditions, sustainable urban drainage, biodiversity, heritage assets, local character and garden settings. 
Excavation in a dense urban environment is more complex than standard 
residential extensions and if it is poorly constructed, or has not properly 
considered geology and hydrology, has the potential to cause structural  T o table of contents226
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 10: Quality of the Built Environment
 T o table of contentsdamage to existing and neighbouring properties and infrastructure and 
irreversibly alter ground conditions.
10.136  Basements can also be vulnerable to flooding from a number of different sources such as overflowing sewers or watercourses, groundwater flooding 
and surface water flooding. Although unlikely to change the groundwater 
regime, where basements are located close together their cumulative effect 
could alter groundwater levels. Limiting the extent and depth of basement 
development can help reduce both the risks and mitigate any negative environmental and amenity impacts. 
10.137  Given the complexities it is essential that screening assessments and full basement impact assessments should be carried out by appropriately 
qualified professionals. The qualification required to prepare a BIA is Chartered 
Engineer, Member of MICE, C.WEM, CGeol. Structural methodology 
statements should be prepared and certified by a Chartered Civil Engineer 
(MICE) or Structural Engineer (MI Struct.E), and geo-hydrologist where appropriate. In the case of listed buildings, the engineer should be CARE 
accredited. It should be noted that the council does not have in-house 
expertise in these specialist areas and therefore applicants will be required to pay for the independent assessment of any BIA submissions beyond Stage 1.
10.138  In some circumstances where basement accommodation is proposed under gardens and external spaces, where trees will be planted in confined locations, 
or where particularly large new trees are proposed, soil depths of up to 1.5m 
(plus drainage layer) may be required. In cases where the removal of trees is 
permitted, the council will usually require their replacement within the curtilage 
of the property.
10.139  Where natural ventilation cannot be achieved and mechanical ventilation is necessary, systems should include heat recovery.
10.140  Extensions to semi-basement accommodation will also be considered against Local Plan policy Q11. 
10.141  Applicants will be required to demonstrate reasonable consideration has been given to potential impact of construction on the amenity of neighbours.

Places and Neighbourhoods
11.1 This section sets out policies for places and neighbourhoods in Lambeth 
(PN policies). These policies reflect the aspirations and approach for eleven 
different parts of the borough, within the strategic framework set by the 
borough-wide policies. 
11.2 These policies should be read and applied alongside the borough-wide policies in sections 4 to 10 of the Local Plan. Some parts of the PN policies 
are strategic and some are local: this is set out in Annex 11. The policy for 
Waterloo should be applied in association with the policies in the South Bank 
and Waterloo Neighbourhood Plan (2019), which has equal status to the Local 
Plan as part of the development plan for Lambeth. 
11.3 The policies for places are in some cases supplemented by guidance. This includes for example the London Plan Opportunity Area Planning Frameworks 
for Waterloo and Vauxhall; and existing or emerging area supplementary 
planning documents (SPDs) for Vauxhall, Brixton Central and Norwood 
High Street. 
11.4 Each policy is preceded by a summary of the characteristics and challenges 
for the area in question, referring where relevant to locally-specific studies 
and masterplans that have informed the approach, as well as input from 
neighbourhood planning forums and groups. These summaries give an 
indication of the potential for housing and commercial growth in each area 
and include reference to Air Quality Focus Areas, open space deficiency areas and London Plan strategic areas for regeneration. The council’s regeneration 
objectives for these areas are referred to where relevant and include socio-
economic regeneration, not just physical improvements.

Context and character 
11.6 Waterloo and South Bank plays a key role in central London and is home 
to international cultural landmarks, health and educational institutions and 
a diverse community of residents, workers, visitors and students. Waterloo 
station is the UK’s busiest railway terminus and is a strategic transport hub 
and interchange for London and the south east sub-region. The area is within 
the Central Activities Zone and is identified as an Opportunity Area in the London Plan. In 2007 an Opportunity Area Planning Framework was jointly 
prepared by the Greater London Authority and the council and, as a result, the 
area has emerged as one of Lambeth’s key economic growth areas. Waterloo is home to a resident population of approximately 10,000 people and the 
London Plan identifies remaining potential for an additional 1,500 homes and 
6000 jobs between 2019 and 2041. 
11.7 Waterloo has a significant concentration of heritage assets and much of the area sits within the immediate and wider setting of, and approaches to, the 
Westminster World Heritage Site.
Community
11.8 The South Bank and Waterloo neighbourhood plan has been prepared by the 
South Bank and Waterloo Neighbours neighbourhood forum for the cross-
border neighbourhood area. It was made by Lambeth in December 2019. 
11.9 There are a number of key stakeholders and a large number of active local 
business and community groups in the area, including South Bank and 
Waterloo Neighbours, South Bank Employers’ Group (SBEG), South Bank 
Business Improvement District and WeAreWaterloo Business Improvement 
District, the Waterloo Community Development Group, the Jubilee Gardens 
Trust, Oasis and Coin Street Community Builders. The South Bank Manifesto 2018, produced by the South Bank Partnership, reflects the shared ambitions 
and key priorities of major landowners and a range of other organisations in 
the area. 
11.10  Waterloo and South Bank is home to significant health and education uses, including St Thomas’ Hospital, King’s College London and Morley College. 
New leisure facilities are expected to be provided as part of the Doon Street 
development and the council is exploring opportunities for the location of a 
new Waterloo library. 
11.11  St Thomas’ Hospital covers a large riverside site at the southern end 
of Waterloo and has an ambitious programme for development and 
improvements to the range and quality of health services it provides. There are 
aspirations for St Thomas’ Hospital and the wider Westminster Bridge campus 
to deliver a MedTech, healthcare and life sciences cluster in partnership with  T o table of contents230
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsKing’s College and Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity. There is also a requirement 
for a new primary care centre in Waterloo.
Housing 
11.12  The London Plan identifies the CAZ retail cluster and the South Bank as having incremental residential growth potential. In the wider Waterloo and South Bank 
area, larger sites that will or are expected to deliver new housing include the 
final phase of the Southbank Place development, Arches at 176-177 and 202 
Lambeth Road and land bounded by Doon Street and Upper Ground. The 
eastern area of Waterloo offers development opportunities for appropriate uses including housing that can make a long-term contribution to the vision 
and objectives for the area. There is scope for further residential growth on 
small sites and this is likely to be delivered by the extension/redevelopment of existing housing stock, as well as new build residential and mixed-use 
development. There is limited scope for additional development within 
residential curtilages due to the dense urban nature of this area. Affordable 
housing is a priority in Waterloo, as in all parts of Lambeth. 
Economy and Culture
11.13  Due to its strategic location and transport links, Waterloo is increasingly 
becoming a leading business district with emerging specialisms in the creative 
services and ICT/digital sectors. Public administration, education and health 
are also important drivers of the area’s economy. There are 43,000 jobs and 
1,300 businesses in the area and more than 5,400 jobs have been created 
since 2011.The London Plan identifies the Waterloo CAZ retail cluster and the South Bank as having medium commercial growth potential. There is potential 
growth in the health, MedTech and life sciences and cultural, leisure and visitor 
economy. This growth needs a broad range of commercial space including affordable and flexible SME workspace. 
11.14  The London Plan has identified an extended Waterloo Central Activities Zone retail cluster to recognise the growing level of town centre uses coming 
forward in the area to meet the needs of residents, commuters, visitors and 
workers. This includes retail and leisure uses coming forward at Waterloo 
Station (former Waterloo International Terminal) and Leake Street Arches. To 
complement the CAZ retail cluster, Lower Marsh/The Cut/Leake Street has been designated as a Special Policy Area to acknowledge and protect the 
area’s specialist character and role as a long-standing and unique cluster of 
smaller, independent retailers and food and drink uses. 
11.15  Waterloo and South Bank is one of the capital’s most successful tourist areas attracting around 30 million visitors a year and is an international centre for 
culture and the arts (part of the London Plan South Bank/Bankside Strategic 
Cultural Area). Key assets include the South Bank Centre, National Theatre, 
London Eye, Jubilee Gardens, BFI South Bank, the Old Vic, the Young Vic and 
the Vaults Theatre. A priority for the neighbourhood plan is promoting cultural uses in Leake Street and under Waterloo Station and the area forms part of  T o table of contents231
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsthe Lower Marsh/The Cut/Leake Street Special Policy Area. The South Bank 
is also identified as having a night-time economy of international or national 
significance in the London Plan. The council will work with partners to manage 
and, where relevant, apply appropriate planning obligations to mitigate the 
impact of an increasing number of visitor numbers whilst also enhancing the 
visitor experience. 
Transport and Public Realm
11.16  The area has important road, cycling and walking connections across the river into Westminster, along the river westwards towards Vauxhall and Nine Elms 
and eastwards to Bankside and London Bridge. Although car ownership is 
relatively low, Waterloo is forecast to see an overall increase in motor vehicle 
trips due to projected growth in the area. Measures are therefore required 
to address this, including traffic management measures to reduce traffic and increase walking and cycling, working towards the objective of ‘car 
free Waterloo’. 
11.17  There will be further increases in the number of pedestrian movements and 
additional highway/public realm capacity will be required to accommodate this 
alongside improvements to the quality, permeability, accessibility and safety of 
public spaces. The Waterloo and South Bank Public Realm Framework 2019 
provides guidance on this. Interventions to improve air quality and provide 
increased security measures for public places will also be necessary. There is high potential for cycling to, through and within the area and improvements 
to conditions for cycling will be required to realise this. A number of key 
interventions are required including schemes at Victory Arch Square and the Waterloo roundabout as well as measures to improve riverside walking and 
cycling routes such as along and across the ‘spine route’ on Belvedere Road 
and Upper Ground. Leake Street provides another important pedestrian route. 
11.18  Accommodating servicing needs is a priority for the area and innovative approaches are required to avoid conflicts with other trips, particularly 
pedestrian and cyclist movements. The off-site consolidation and/or retiming 
of deliveries is likely to be required in order to alleviate pressures on the 
highway network. Waterloo’s proximity to the River Thames provides significant 
potential to increase the movement of freight along the river, including construction related movements. Emphasis will also be placed on the need to 
carefully plan and co-ordinate vehicle movements associated with construction 
activities in order to reduce disruption and mitigate safety and environmental impacts. 
11.19  The conversion of the former international terminal adds capacity at Waterloo station, helping to accommodate additional rail trips. Improvements are 
required to provide step-free access to and between rail and underground 
services. The implementation of Crossrail 2 is expected to provide significant 
capacity relief at the station.  T o table of contents232

 T o table of contentsEnvironment
11.20  Annex 10 identifies locations appropriate for tall buildings in Waterloo, subject 
to addressing the requirements of Local Plan policies Q19 and Q26. Great 
care is required to ensure that new development, especially tall buildings, is 
responsive to this highly sensitive context, with regard to the Outstanding 
Universal Value of the Westminster World Heritage Site in particular. 
11.21  The area has a number of green and open spaces, including Archbishop’s 
Park, Waterloo Millennium Green, Queens Walk, Bernie Spain Gardens, 
Hatfield Green, Jubilee Gardens and Ufford Street recreation ground. However, 
parts of the area are deficient in access to some categories of open space. 
Jubilee Gardens and two thirds of the adjoining Hungerford car park are 
designated as Metropolitan Open Land (MOL). It has been a long-standing council and GLA objective to secure the use of two thirds of Hungerford 
car park as an extension to Jubilee Gardens. The remainder of the site can 
be used for arts and cultural facilities to support the South Bank’s role as a cultural quarter. Jubilee Gardens (including its future extension) are maintained 
by the Jubilee Gardens Trust. Given the extensive and growing use of this and 
other open spaces in Waterloo, their effective management and maintenance 
is a priority.
11.22  In Waterloo there are emerging proposals for development of a South Bank 
decentralised energy network. The whole of the area is within a flood risk 
zone; the requirements of Local Plan policy EN5 will apply to all development 
proposals. Waterloo Road is designated as an air quality focus area due 
to its high levels of both air pollution and human exposure and is identified 
in Lambeth’s Air Quality Action Plan. Development in this area should, in accordance with London Plan policy SI1, incorporate design solutions that 
prevent or minimise exposure to existing air pollution and make provisions to 
address local air pollution. Improving air quality in the area is a priority for both the council and the neighbourhood plan. New developments in the area will 
be expected to contribute to actively reducing air pollution and increase green 
infrastructure. The neighbourhood plan identifies a network of ‘Greenways’ 
which provide low pollution walking and cycling routes through the area. In 
the Opportunity Area the council will apply the air quality positive approach in accordance with London Plan policy SI1. T o table of contents233

Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsPolicy PN1: Waterloo and South Bank 
By 2035 Waterloo and South Bank will continue to be a thriving and competitive 
area playing a key role in the central London and Lambeth economy. The council will 
secure this by supporting and enhancing Waterloo and South Bank’s various roles as: 
i. a Central Activities Zone retail cluster;
ii. a location for specialist and independent retail as part of the Lower 
Marsh/ The Cut/ Leake Street Special Policy Area; 
iii. an international centre for culture and arts as part of the London Plan South Bank/Bankside Strategic Cultural Area; 
iv. a pre-eminent international, domestic and local tourist, leisure, retail and entertainment area; 
v. a major location for offices, creative and digital industries, healthcare, MedTech and life sciences businesses and higher education;
vi. a mixed residential area with appropriate supporting community, service and shopping facilities; 
vii. having a valued historic character; and
viii. one of London’s most important transport hubs. 
This vision for Waterloo and South Bank will be achieved by:
A. supporting sustainable development for jobs and homes in line with London Plan targets, securing maximum benefits for Lambeth residents 
and businesses through the application of affordable housing policy, 
affordable workspace policy and planning obligations for local training and 
employment. 
B. supporting development that contributes to long term place-shaping 
objectives. 
C. optimising the area’s potential for the full range of central London and town centre activities consistent with its Central Activities Zone retail cluster 
status to enable it to compete effectively, securing significant inward 
investment for the benefit of the local community and more widely for the 
borough, including safeguarding and promoting the role of Lower Marsh/
The Cut/Leake Street Special Policy Area as a centre for local needs and specialist independent retailing. This will be done by:
i. requiring at least 50 per cent of ground floor units in the Lower Marsh/The Cut/Leake Street Special Policy Area to be in retail use and at least 
30 per cent of ground floor units in Lower Marsh to be in food and 
drink use. Where necessary and justified to achieve the objectives of 
this policy, the council will use conditions and/or planning obligations in 
new development proposals to limit uses within Class E;
ii. not permitting in the Lower Marsh/The Cut/Leake Street Special Policy Area the conversion of two or more retail units into larger retail units; T o table of contents236
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsiii. supporting improvements to Lower Marsh street market; and
iv. not permitting proposals for additional betting shops in the Central 
Activities Zone retail cluster. 
D. promoting the growth of the area’s role as a business district by supporting office development and affordable workspace that provides a range of unit 
sizes, can be subdivided to encourage flexible use and co-working and 
workspace suitable for small and medium enterprises and creative and 
digital industries. 
E. promoting and supporting development and uses of an appropriate height 
(in accordance with Local Plan policy Q26 and Annex 10), scale and form 
to reinforce Waterloo and South Bank’s distinct identity, respecting strategic 
and local views and local contextual considerations, preserving the setting 
of heritage assets and the Outstanding Universal Value of Westminster 
World Heritage Site (Local Plan policy Q19), and ensuring that design quality is worthy of a world city. 
F. promoting expansion of creative, arts and cultural activities throughout Waterloo and enhancing the South Bank in its role as an international 
cultural and leisure centre and a London tourist destination through 
supporting the development of arts and cultural facilities, associated and 
supporting uses. 
G. promoting a high quality, permeable, safe and accessible public realm that 
is durable, well designed and maintained to reinforce Waterloo’s status 
as a world class place. The combination of the riverfront, streetscapes, 
piazzas, squares and green spaces contribute to the broader public realm 
and are places for people and residents to meet, socialise, activate and 
dwell as well as move through. Development and uses should recognise and add value to this important asset through the inclusion of flexible 
places for people, residents and events, and actively contribute to the 
enhancement of the collective public realm and increase the amount of green infrastructure in the area. See guidance in the Waterloo and South 
Bank Public Realm Framework.  
H. to supplement the public realm, green spaces will be protected and 
expanded, including Jubilee Gardens. Two thirds of Hungerford car park is 
protected as Metropolitan Open Land (MOL). Development at Hungerford 
car park can take place on the remaining one third if this promotes the 
expansion of the arts and cultural activities of Waterloo and allows for the 
extension of Jubilee Gardens on the protected two thirds. An element of enabling development on the one third may be acceptable, to support the 
delivery of the main arts and cultural uses. As with all development, any 
harmful impacts must be mitigated in accordance with the statutory tests for planning obligations. 
 
Development on one third of Hungerford car park should be designed to 
optimise the relationship with the adjacent MOL and have regard to the 
following urban design objectives:  T o table of contents237
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsi. Respect the open character and accessibility of Jubilee Gardens.
ii. Include urban greening measures as part of the development. 
iii. Carefully integrate with Jubilee Gardens and its extension, including 
with existing and new hard and soft landscape features and materials, 
resulting in a unified design, and where possible include an active 
interface between the development and Jubilee Gardens. 
iv. Maintain connection between Belvedere Road and Queen’s Walk, optimising the Belvedere Road spine route and taking account of the 
new pedestrian routes from York Road to Belvedere Road through the 
Southbank Place development.
v. Respect the character of the river frontage and surrounding views.
vi. Respect views from the Royal Festival Hall towards Jubilee Gardens, the London Eye and the Westminster World Heritage Site and through 
the Belvedere Road railway bridge towards Jubilee Gardens.
vii. Respect the setting of heritage assets such as Royal Festival Hall and 
County Hall. 
viii. Preserve or enhance the South Bank conservation area.
Any change to the boundary of the MOL shown on the Policies Map should take place through the development plan process. Development proposals 
that propose a different configuration of MOL at Hungerford car park to 
that shown on the Policies Map will need to demonstrate the benefits of 
the alternative approach, having regard to the urban design objectives 
above. In all cases, MOL on Hungerford car park must be contiguous with Jubilee Gardens and should cover no less than two thirds of the area of the 
car park.
The landscaping of the remaining two thirds of Hungerford car park to 
provide an extension to Jubilee Gardens should reflect the quality and 
design of the existing gardens and be predominantly soft landscape. It 
should be accessible to all and cater for a range of activity appropriate to the character of the Gardens, including quiet areas. Connections to 
the Belvedere Road spine route should be optimised. Management, 
maintenance and servicing requirements (including for sustainable watering) 
should be planned and designed from the outset. Supporting infrastructure 
and servicing arrangements should not harm the openness of the MOL and should address Local Plan policy EN1(a)(iii). There should continue to 
be provision of public toilets in Jubilee Gardens. Where it is demonstrated 
that major developments in the vicinity of Jubilee Gardens and its extension will result in a significant increase in visitor numbers to the open space, 
planning obligations will be sought to mitigate the impact on management 
and maintenance of the Gardens.
I. reducing traffic and supporting better conditions for walking and cycling, throughout Waterloo alongside improvements in capacity, accessibility and 
interchange quality at Waterloo Station; this includes the implementation  T o table of contents238

 T o table of contentsof the Healthy Route Network across the area and proposals to increase 
permeability by providing better linkages to Lower Marsh and other parts 
of Waterloo, while respecting the heritage context of the station and 
adjoining areas. Traffic management measures to deter unnecessary motor 
vehicle trips and innovative measures to reduce the impact of freight and 
construction traffic will be promoted, including increased use of the River Thames and existing piers for transporting people and freight. Promotion of 
low and zero emissions vehicles will be a particular focus across the area.
J. working with industry stakeholders to minimise the impact of construction 
activity in the area by planning and co-ordinating activities to reduce 
disruption, ensure safety, especially for vulnerable road users, and reduce 
environmental impacts. 
K. supporting the reconfiguration of the Waterloo roundabout and its potential for development of Central Activities Zone uses appropriate to its location. 
L. supporting measures to improve air quality, including the creation of ‘greenways’ which are located away from heavy traffic, air pollution and 
noise. Measures to promote and enable zero emissions vehicles across the 
area will be supported, including the taxi fleet serving Waterloo Station. 
M. supporting the development of a MedTech health cluster by supporting the strategies of St Thomas’ Hospital, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity and King’s 
College London at Royal Street in accordance with agreed high-level design 
principles for the estates to achieve new health facilities; replacement 
housing, open space and community facilities; capacity for Combined Heat 
and Power; new commercial development including workspace for small and medium enterprises; and related and supporting facilities such as 
accommodation for staff. Creation of a new primary care centre in the wider 
Waterloo area will be supported.
N. the creation of through routes and activation of the arches within the railway viaduct known as the ‘Low Line’ with a mix of uses to connect Waterloo

Context and character 
11.23  Vauxhall forms part of the Mayor’s Vauxhall, Nine Elms and Battersea (VNEB) 
Opportunity Area Planning Framework (OAPF), adopted in March 2012. 
This area is now referred to as Nine Elms Vauxhall (NEV) and is partly in the 
London Borough of Wandsworth. The OAPF promotes the ‘optimum level of 
development for the area’, which includes:
• growth poles in the form of new Central Activities Zone (CAZ) retail clusters 
at Battersea Power Station and Vauxhall;
• a new mixed-use residential neighbourhood and linear park in the heart of Nine Elms;
• a transformational step-change in public transport provision including the Northern Line Extension from Kennington to Battersea Power Station with 
a Lambeth station at Nine Elms to be open in Autumn 2021, supported 
by a comprehensive package of rail, bus, cycling, pedestrian and highway 
improvements around the Vauxhall transport interchange expected to be 
delivered by 2022; 
• the provision of new open space including a linear park, a new public square fronting the mainline station entrance, enlarged and enhanced 
public realm next to the railway viaducts, improved riverside walk and high 
quality public realm; and
• the creation of a sustainable place with new social infrastructure, a district heat network, utilities infrastructure and strategic flood mitigation measures.
11.24  The London Plan identifies remaining potential for 18,500 new homes and 18,500 jobs in the Nine Elms Vauxhall area as a whole. The London Plan 
identifies Vauxhall as an emerging CAZ retail cluster. 
11.25  Vauxhall sits within the setting of and approaches to the Westminster World 
Heritage Site. Riverside views to the Thames and Houses of Parliament are 
some of the most ‘special’ in London. In recognition of this, two background 
consultation areas protect strategic views to the Palace of Westminster. Albert 
Embankment contains some important and sensitive buildings, some of which 
are listed. It is designated as a conservation area.
Community
11.26  The Kennington, Oval and Vauxhall Neighbourhood Forum was designated in July 2015 and is currently preparing a neighbourhood plan for the wider 
Kennington, Oval and Vauxhall neighbourhood area. Key priorities for the 
emerging neighbourhood plan include increasing green infrastructure and 
improving air quality.  T o table of contents249
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents11.27  The Vauxhall One Business Improvement District is working to make Vauxhall 
safer, cleaner and greener for the benefit of businesses, residents, workers 
and visitors. 
11.28  The increased numbers of residents, workers and visitors in Vauxhall will 
bring significant economic and social benefits to both the immediate area and 
the rest of the borough. However, it is very important that Vauxhall’s unique 
identity and character is both retained and enhanced and that its existing 
communities have access to those benefits. The area is an active hub for 
the Portuguese community as well as being home to a number of voluntary sector organisations.
11.29  Vauxhall’s increase in residents will require investment in its social and green infrastructure as parts of Vauxhall are deficient in access to multiple types 
of open space. The council will continue to work in close partnership with 
developers to ensure the necessary infrastructure is delivered. This includes 
the two-form expansion of Wyvil Primary School, to be opened in early 
2021 and a new cinema as part of the Vauxhall Square development. Public realm improvements will be delivered through the completion of the ‘Missing 
Link Phase 3’ and Vauxhall Park will be improved in 2020. This will help 
realise the council’s clear ambition for Vauxhall becoming a strong, diverse and sustainable community, complementing the residential communities in 
Kennington, Oval and Stockwell.
Housing 
11.30  The London Plan identifies the emerging CAZ retail cluster as having high 
residential growth potential. Larger sites in this town centre with potential 
to deliver new housing include the Bondway Commercial site and Vauxhall 
Square. In the wider Vauxhall area larger sites that will deliver new housing 
include Sainsbury’s at 62 Wandsworth Road, 10 Pascal Street, 12-20 Wyvil 
Road, Keybridge House, 8 Albert Embankment and the Texaco Garage site at 38-46 Albert Embankment. There is scope for further residential growth on 
small sites and this is likely to be delivered by the extension/redevelopment 
of existing housing stock as well as new build residential and mixed-use development. There is limited scope for additional development within 
residential curtilages due to the dense urban nature of this area.
Economy and Culture
11.31  Vauxhall has a small but growing town centre in the form of the CAZ retail 
cluster. Vauxhall has a range of cultural and creative activities, including the 
Newport Street Gallery, as well as a small number of successful independent 
retail and food outlets. The London Plan identifies the potential CAZ retail 
cluster as having a night-time economy of regional or sub-regional significance 
and Vauxhall’s various lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTQ+) venues such as the Royal Vauxhall Tavern and the Above the Stag theatre 
and other venues make a very significant contribution to the character  T o table of contents250
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsof the area. Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens also has a unique historical and 
cultural importance. 
11.32  The London Plan identifies the emerging CAZ retail cluster as having high commercial growth potential. The Creative and Digital Industries study 2017 
identifies that new office developments in Vauxhall have capacity to provide 
space that could accommodate major new creative and digital industries. 
Transport and Public Realm
11.33  Vauxhall Cross is a major strategic interchange providing access to rail, underground and bus services. Given its location on strategic routes into 
central London, and having the inner London ring road pass through along 
Vauxhall Bridge and Kennington Lane, the area experiences high traffic levels. 
Congestion on main roads can result in traffic diverting onto local streets which 
impacts on residential neighbourhoods. Traffic management requires particular consideration, including the impacts of construction traffic.
11.34  The River Thames also contributes to transport accessibility in Vauxhall. Lambeth Pier and St George Wharf Pier provide access to Thames Riverboat 
passenger services and measures should be taken to bring greater awareness 
of this service to the existing and future users of rail, underground and bus 
networks. The river should also be prioritised for more for transportation of 
freight and waste during the construction of major developments in the area. 
11.35  Vauxhall’s proximity to central London results in a high level of cycle movements through the area, particularly on the Cycleway 5 which links Oval 
to Victoria. Transport for London’s Cycle Demand Analysis shows significant 
future demand for cycling to and through the area. Provision for people who 
cycle needs to be carefully balanced with the needs of pedestrians at the 
busiest locations. 
11.36  The creation of a thriving and sustainable retail cluster within the Central Activities Zone will be supported through the radical transformation of 
Vauxhall’s transport infrastructure and public realm to safely accommodate 
the significant increase in pedestrians and cyclists that is expected; reduce 
vehicular traffic dominance; and improve connectivity across the area, 
particularly from areas east of the railway viaduct to the River Thames. Lambeth and Transport for London (TfL) are working in partnership to deliver 
the replacement of the existing one-way road system to make it two-way, 
redesigning the transport interchange to include a new, modern bus station and canopy and the creation of a new public square outside the mainline 
station entrance. The Vauxhall Island site and the consented bus station will 
play a key role in delivering this strategically important transport infrastructure 
and associated public realm. Planning permission for the new bus station was 
obtained in 2018 and it is anticipated the new interchange will be delivered by 2022. These initiatives, along with the opening of the Northern Line extension 
in Autumn 2021, will help unlock a range of opportunities for the borough’s 
residents and businesses that would not otherwise come forward. T o table of contents251
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents11.37  The council will work in partnership with local stakeholders to develop public 
realm improvements in north Vauxhall. 
Environment
11.38  Vauxhall is designated as one of Lambeth’s air quality focus areas due to its high levels of both pollution and human exposure and is identified in Lambeth’s 
Air Quality Action Plan. Development in this area should, in accordance with 
London Plan policy SI1, incorporate design solutions that prevent or minimise 
exposure to existing air pollution and make provisions to address local air 
pollution. Improving air quality in the area is a priority of both the council and the emerging neighbourhood plan. The council will support TfL to identify 
Vauxhall as a Low Emissions Neighbourhood and to be included as part of an 
Ultra-Low Emissions Zone. New developments in the area will be expected to contribute to actively reducing air pollution. 
11.39  Measures to increase green infrastructure, including tree planting and other beneficial works, across the area will be supported. An energy masterplan 
for the Opportunity Area was published in 2012. The whole of the Vauxhall 
area is within a flood risk zone; the requirements of policy EN5 will apply to all 
development proposals.
11.40  The council has prepared detailed development guidance for the Lambeth 
part of the Opportunity Area in the form of a supplementary planning 
document (SPD) for Vauxhall (adopted January 2013). Character Appraisals 
are also available for the Albert Embankment, Vauxhall and Lambeth Palace 
Conservation Areas. Annex 10 identifies locations appropriate for tall buildings. T o table of contents252

 T o table of contentsPolicy PN2: Vauxhall 
A retail cluster will be created at Vauxhall, known as Vauxhall Cross. Mixed-use 
development will be supported that contributes to the creation of this centre including 
town-centre uses such as retail, employment, housing, leisure, entertainment and 
other creative, cultural and community uses in line with its Central Activities Zone (CAZ) designation and as part of the wider London Plan Vauxhall/Nine Elms/Battersea 
Opportunity Area (now known as Nine Elms Vauxhall). 
This will be achieved by:
A. Creating a sustainable mix of high density development contributing to 
the delivery of the remaining potential for new homes and jobs, including 
construction jobs, in the Nine Elms Vauxhall area as a whole; 
B. Promoting the new retail cluster, Vauxhall Cross, which will increase 
the vitality of the area and form a growth pole in keeping with the CAZ 
designation; creating opportunities for affordable retail; and focusing active 
frontage uses to support the retail cluster and underpin its viability, ensuring 
that the diverse evening economy offer is appropriately managed. At least 
25 per cent of ground floor units within the retail cluster should be in retail use to meet the needs of local residents and workers. Where necessary 
and justified to achieve the objectives of this policy, the council will use 
conditions and/or planning obligations in new development proposals to limit uses consented within Class E;
C. Reinforcing neighbourhood destinations at Black Prince Road, Old Paradise Street and Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens with new mixed-use development, 
including consolidation and expansion of the cultural and evening economy 
as part of a network of activities between places of interest; 
D. Encouraging and facilitating the use of the railway arches as an active spine, a focus for employment and business, as well as a mix of uses 
which could include cultural, artistic and community uses in appropriate 
locations, along with routes for pedestrians and cyclists as part of the Low 
Line project;
E. Reconnecting Vauxhall to the river with new pedestrian links through the 
transformation of Vauxhall’s transport infrastructure and public realm, 
improving the riverside walk and enlivening the waterfront with activities; 
F. The creation of a series of streets, spaces and places, revitalising Vauxhall 
with new active street frontages and a new public square fronting the main 
line station entrance as a focus for the new retail cluster;
G. Connecting and improving the existing green spaces, especially the Linear 
Park, Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, Vauxhall Park, Lambeth High Street 
Recreational Ground, Archbishops Park and Larkhall Park, and creating 
enlarged and new open spaces where possible; 
H. Improving the transport experience throughout the area by reducing the dominance of road traffic, increasing the capacity of public transport 
infrastructure and maximising opportunities to walk and cycle safely and  T o table of contents255
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentscomfortably throughout the whole area. This will include the replacement of 
the existing one-way road system to make it two-way and the building of a 
new modern bus station and canopy supported by an improved, accessible 
public realm and connectivity with surrounding areas. Simplified road 
junctions and crossings will concentrate movements along natural desire 
lines throughout the whole area; 
I. Working with TfL to investigate whether the one-way system at Kennington Lane/Durham Street/Harleyford Road can be replaced with a two-way 
system and to promote walking, cycling and public realm improvements 
on Albert Embankment and along the viaduct linking Vauxhall to Waterloo 
as part of the Low Line project. The council, supported by TfL, will also 
consider the introduction of traffic management measures to reduce through traffic on local streets. Developments must be at least traffic neutral 
to support the objective creating a new transport interchange. Increased 
use of the River Thames for transporting people and freight will also be promoted; 
J. Implementing the council’s Healthy Route Network, including improvements for walking and cycling on Albert Embankment to provide a high quality link 
between Vauxhall and Waterloo; 
K. Working with industry stakeholders to minimise the impact of construction 
activity in the area by planning and co-ordinating activities to reduce 
disruption, ensure safety, particularly for vulnerable road users, and reduce 
environmental impacts; 
L. Supporting development that is appropriate to the different characteristics and roles of distinct character areas of Vauxhall. This includes:
1. Lambeth Gateway
2. Central Embankment
3. Glasshouse Walk
4. Vauxhall Cross 
5. Miles Street 
6. Pascal Place
1 and 2. In the Lambeth Gateway and Central Embankment this means enhancing the appearance and character of Albert Embankment, with 
active ground-floor frontages and an expanded range of employment and 
residential uses. The area needs to become highly accessible and well 
connected to the surrounding area, maintaining and improving safe access 
to the River Thames. 
3. At Glasshouse Walk, to reinforce the character of this area, lower 
density development than elsewhere in the Vauxhall area will be supported: 
developing a creative mixed-use quarter centred on Vauxhall Walk; 
maximising opportunities for the use of the railway arches for commercial, 
leisure and night-time uses; promoting creative uses around Vauxhall Walk;  T o table of contents256
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsimproving existing public spaces including Pedlar’s Park; and regenerating 
Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens to create a high quality public green space that 
serves a community focal point which is highly connected, accessible, 
active and safe.
4, 5 and 6. At Vauxhall Cross, Miles Street and Pascal Place, town-centre-
led development, enhancing connectivity between Vauxhall Cross, the 
riverside and Nine Elms/Battersea to the south. This is consistent with the development underway. 
In addition:
M. The council supports the highest standards of sustainable design and construction and measures to improve air quality. The implementation 
of, and connection to, district heating networks and other effective forms 
of CO
2 reduction and climate change adaptation, including innovative 
approaches, will be required in line with Local Plan and London Plan 
policies and to support the implementation of VNEB (NEV) energy 
masterplan; 
N. Remaining locations appropriate for tall buildings are identified in Annex 10. For greater detail on the composition of the cluster, see the Vauxhall 
Area SPD. The appropriateness of tall building development will be subject 
to acceptable impacts on the settings of heritage assets (especially the 
Westminster World Heritage Site). See Local Plan policies Q19 and Q26; 
O. Social infrastructure, the public realm environment and green spaces 
will be further strengthened by Lambeth’s ongoing partnership working 
with organisations that are already operating in the locality including the 
business improvement district, Vauxhall One, Network Rail, Kennington, 
Oval and Vauxhall neighbourhood forum, TfL and landowners; and 
P. Development and uses should link with the adjoining areas of the London 
Plan Opportunity Area in the neighbouring borough of Wandsworth and 
support the overall approach to development described in the OAPF. 
Development proposals should take account of the potential to redevelop 
adjoining or surrounding sites. T o table of contents257

Context and character 
11.41  As one of Lambeth’s two major town centres, Brixton has developed an 
international reputation based on its markets, cultural and creative energy and 
diversity. It has a varied and vibrant retail, entertainment and leisure offer which 
is strongly connected to the economic and social life of the local community 
and attracts both local people and visitors from across London and beyond. 
The variety and cultural significance of these uses has created an increasingly popular evening and night-time economy. Brixton is also a major administrative 
and employment centre which currently supports jobs created by the public, 
retail and entertainment service sectors.
11.42  Brixton has a rich architectural heritage and its built environment includes careful massing, fine detailing and respectful buildings that create a townscape 
of variety and a strong sense of place. The majority of the town centre is 
designated as a conservation area and contains numerous statutory and 
locally listed buildings. It is characterised by mostly 19th and early 20th 
Century commercial and public buildings, the covered and street markets and the elevated railway line viaducts. The residential hinterland is characterised by 
terraced housing and large housing estates. 
11.43  While Brixton possesses many of the characteristics of a successful town 
centre, it faces a number of challenges related to its local economy and 
resilience, environment and intensity of use, socio-economic and demographic 
changes and development pressure. The economic and physical make-up of 
Brixton creates opportunities to support and diversify the local economy as 
well as increase its residential population. Investment and growth in Brixton will require careful management to protect the town centre’s existing retail and 
employment offer, whilst securing the redevelopment of land and buildings 
for uses which diversify the local economy, improve its social, economic and environmental resilience and deliver economic growth and housing.
11.44  Large parts of Brixton, including the majority of the town centre, are identified in the London Plan as a Strategic Area for Regeneration. To ensure investment 
and growth delivers sustainable regeneration of the area, the key objectives in 
Brixton are: 
• to diversify the local economy by promoting a significant increase in the amount and variety of employment floorspace, including a focus on the 
creative and digital industries in the Creative Enterprise Zone and protecting 
existing floorspace;
• to promote and protect the diverse retail and leisure sectors, including the celebrated contribution made by the indoor and street markets and the 
town centre’s diverse food offer;
• to manage growth in the evening and night-time economy in a way that 
broadens the town centre offer and mitigates its impacts; T o table of contents270
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents• to deliver high quality residential development on appropriate sites that 
meets local housing need;
• to achieve the highest standards of design in the development of new buildings, structures and public realm, and preserve and enhance the 
historic built environment;
• to improve public transport use and interchange, including refurbishment of 
the mainline train station and a new cycle parking hub; 
• to reduce traffic domination, improve air quality and improve walking and cycling by reallocating road space, providing new cycle infrastructure, 
creating new pedestrian routes, and designing pedestrian friendly streets 
and spaces; and 
• to ensure social and community infrastructure is provided to improve community well-being and cohesion.
Community
11.45  The Brixton Business Improvement District (BID) aims to strengthen business partnerships, better market the area and to improve the local environment. 
Over a number of years Brixton’s range of community groups have been 
involved in plans and strategies for its future development. This continued 
engagement will be important to the success of future programmes. 
11.46  There is a need to improve and enhance leisure and community facilities in the 
centre of Brixton, including the need to improve access for all communities. 
The historical and cultural importance of the existing Brixton Recreation Centre 
(Grade II listed building) to the community is recognised. 
Housing 
11.47  The London Plan identifies the major town centre as having medium residential growth potential. Within the town centre, larger sites with potential to deliver 
new housing include Site 15 and Site 16. Sites that will deliver new housing 
include 86 – 88 Gresham Road. In the wider Brixton area, larger sites include 
Olive Morris House, land bounded by Somerleyton Road and Coldharbour 
Lane, and Thrayle House on Benedict Road. There is scope for further residential growth on small sites and this is likely to be delivered by the 
extension/conversion of existing housing stock as well as new build residential 
and mixed-use development. Additional development within residential curtilages may come forward where site circumstances permit.
Economy and Culture
11.48  Brixton is home to approximately 11,300 jobs and 1,500 businesses, with the majority of jobs in sectors such as retail, leisure, food and drink and public 
sector activities. It also has a growing cluster of creative and digital industries 
and has been designated by the Mayor of London as a Creative Enterprise 
Zone. The London Plan identifies Brixton town centre as having medium  T o table of contents271
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentscommercial growth potential. There is a need and opportunity to diversify and 
improve the resilience of the local economy by protecting existing business 
space and increasing the supply of employment floorspace and the range of 
workspaces available through the redevelopment of key sites. This will need 
to include affordable, low-cost and flexible workspaces catering for small 
businesses. The railway arches stretching from Pope’s Road to Gresham Road play an important role in providing a range of uses that support the functioning 
of the town centre including retail and storage units and low-cost studios, 
workshops and maker spaces and contribute towards the role of the Creative Enterprise Zone. 
11.49  The Brixton Economic Action Plan (2017) identifies an under-supply of workspace compared to similar town centres in London and that this is 
affecting Brixton’s ability to facilitate growth, diversify its economy and realise 
its full potential as a hub for innovation and experimentation. The Creative and 
Digital Industries Study (2017) also identifies a lack of suitable premises for 
creative and digital businesses and recommends the development of medium-sized managed and serviced offices, flexible incubator, accelerator and co-
working spaces, creative studios, workshops and maker spaces suitable 
for small and medium businesses. An Article 4 Direction removing permitted development rights for change of use from B1 (a) Office to C3 Residential has 
been implemented in the town centre to enable the protection of the existing 
stock of office space. 
11.50  Brixton’s retail offer includes a balance of specialist independent and high street multiple retailers and covered and outdoor markets that provide a wide 
range of convenience and comparison goods. The three covered markets 
are listed buildings and are of historical and cultural importance. There are 
approximately 280 retail and service units in the town centre, excluding the 
indoor markets. However, given competition from other centres and changing consumer trends and demand (for example, internet shopping), there is a 
need to diversify and improve provision across the high street, indoor markets 
and street markets to secure and maintain local, commuter and visitor spend. Development providing retail will need to improve the variety of convenience 
and comparison goods available in the area. 
11.51  Brixton’s retail offer is supplemented by a growing food and beverage sector. 
There are approximately 100 food and drink units in the town centre, excluding 
the indoor markets. The London Plan identifies Brixton’s night-time economy 
as an area of regional or sub-regional significance. Together with the existing 
music venues, cinema and future theatre, the town centre supports a vibrant 
and culturally diverse night-time economy which has been enhanced by the night tube. While growth in the evening and night-time economy can deliver 
significant local economic benefits, the environmental, safety and amenity 
impacts require responsible and careful management, with particular concerns about the number of bars on Coldharbour Lane, Acre Lane and Atlantic Road. 
The council wishes to support Brixton’s growing food and beverage sector, 
particularly its restaurants, but will use its enforcement powers to manage any 
restaurants operating as bars without planning permission. Working with local 
residents and stakeholders, the Brixton BID, Metropolitan Police and TfL, the  T o table of contents272
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentscouncil will produce an Evening and Night Time Economy Strategy that will 
identify proposals for managing the growth of this sector. 
11.52  The Brixton Street Market Strategy (2018) emphasises the contribution made by the street markets to Brixton’s economic, social and cultural well-being. 
Electric Avenue has benefited from significant improvements to the layout, 
function, appearance and cleanliness of the market to encourage higher stall 
occupancy and increased visitors. The strategy proposes further investment in 
the Brixton Station Road and Pope’s Road street markets which will be funded and delivered through the Good Growth Fund programme and planning 
obligations in appropriate circumstances. Particular consideration will need to 
be given to improving storage, waste management, hard and soft landscaping, delivery and servicing arrangements and electricity and water infrastructure.
11.53  Delivery and servicing spaces and waste management and storage will need to be provided in locations in or accessible from the town centre. 
Transport and Public Realm
11.54  Brixton is a significant transport interchange, with the underground station in particular attracting trips from a wide catchment area and several thousand 
people accessing the town centre by bus on a daily basis. This movement 
of people contributes to significant footfall, particularly at peak times, and 
represents a challenge in terms of space available for pedestrians and the 
quality of the pedestrian experience. Brixton Road is a strategic traffic route with 25,000 daily vehicle movements. It is also a major bus corridor providing 
an important link both to the north of the borough and to Streatham in the 
south. The council will develop an area freight management plan with TfL. 
11.55  To encourage greater use of Brixton mainline station and improve accessibility and interchange, an opportunity exists to replace the poorly overlooked, 
inadequately lit and narrow underpass and physically constrained staircases. 
There is potential to explore over-station development, the relocation of the 
entrance and exit to Pope’s Road and incorporation step-free access. An 
improved station would better reflect Brixton’s role as a major centre as well as assisting in managing rush-hour capacity issues. Improved access to 
east to west rail services, such as the Overground, is also desirable and the 
council is keen to explore longer term options to deliver this as part of TfL’s ‘metroisation’ proposals. 
11.56  Many cycle trips that originate both within and outside the borough pass through Brixton. The Mayor’s Transport Strategy identifies Brixton as a key 
node in London’s Strategic Cycle Network and this is reflected in the council’s 
planned Healthy Route Network which identifies a number of key routes 
serving the area. Cycling potential is currently supressed by the lack of high 
quality infrastructure and the hostile traffic environment. Opportunities exist to develop cycle routes, increase cycle parking and deliver a town centre cycle 
hub on land between Atlantic Road and Electric Lane. Working with the Mayor 
of London and TfL, the council will support measures that reduce traffic and  T o table of contents273
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsmitigate its impact on the town centre, including its proposed designation as a 
Low Emission Neighbourhood. 
11.57  Atlantic Road, Coldharbour Lane, Brixton Station Road and Pope’s Road will be the focus of public realm improvements to reduce traffic dominance, 
improve air quality, improve servicing, support market functions, increase 
pedestrian comfort, promote cycling and facilitate interchange between the 
mainline and underground stations. The redevelopment of key sites also 
provides an opportunity to address the severance caused by railway viaducts and improve pedestrian permeability and wayfinding. These objectives are 
supported by the Brixton Liveable Neighbourhood project which seeks to 
improve conditions for walking and cycling in the town centre and surrounding neighbourhoods, primarily through measures to reduce and remove general 
traffic on local roads. 
Environment
11.58  Brixton’s open spaces include Max Roach Park, Windrush Square and Rush 
Common, with the area also in close proximity to Brockwell Park. Parts of 
Brixton are deficient in access to open space and opportunities to improve 
this, as well as increasing green infrastructure, will be sought. As a result of 
heavy traffic in the town centre, Brixton experiences poor air quality. The A23 
from Brixton to Streatham is designated as an air quality focus area due to its high levels of both pollution and human exposure and is identified in Lambeth’s 
Air Quality Action Plan. Development in this area should, in accordance with 
London Plan policy SI1, incorporate design solutions that prevent or minimise exposure to existing air pollution and make provisions to address local air 
pollution. The council will support measures that seek to improve air quality.  T o table of contents274

 T o table of contentsPolicy PN3: Brixton 
Brixton’s role as a distinctive, multicultural and diverse major town centre will be 
safeguarded and promoted through careful and sensitive regeneration, recognising 
its local distinctiveness and historic built environment, and supporting economic, 
social and environmental sustainable development. A key objective of the Brixton Economic Action Plan is to develop a broader and more resilient local economy. 
Where necessary and justified to achieve the objectives of this policy, the council will 
use conditions and/or planning obligations in new development proposals to limit uses consented within Class E. 
This will be achieved by:
A. requiring, in the primary shopping area, that the proportion of retail units 
does not fall below 60 per cent and that the proportion of food and drink 
uses does not exceed 25 per cent, taking account of unimplemented 
planning permissions for change of use. In addition, no more than 2 in 5 
consecutive ground floor units in the primary shopping area should be in 
food and drink use at one time. No more betting shops or payday loan shops will be supported within the centre as a whole.
B. requiring, in the indoor markets (as shown on the Policies Map), that no less than 50 per cent of floorspace should be in shop use and no more 
than 50 per cent floorspace should be in café and restaurant use within 
each indoor market (Brixton Village, Market Row, Reliance Arcade), subject 
to a management plan being in place that is agreed between the council 
and the managers of the indoor markets. The thresholds for shop and café/restaurant floorspace for each indoor market relate to ground floor units 
and connected upper floors that share the same access for each indoor 
market. Public houses, wine bars and drinking establishments (including with expanded food provision) in the indoor markets will not be permitted 
on both the ground floor and upper floors. All independently accessed 
upper floorspace in each indoor market currently in community, office, 
research and development use or light industrial use will be protected. 
C. implementing an evening economy management zone which will seek 
to support the growth and diversification of the evening and night-time 
economy whilst managing its impact on local residents and the local 
environment. In the evening economy management zone, the proportion 
of units in food and drink, evening and night-time economy uses should 
not exceed 40 per cent, taking account of unimplemented planning permissions for change of use. No more than 10 per cent of ground floor 
units in the evening economy management zone should be in public house, 
wine bar, or drinking establishment (including with expanded food provision) use. In addition, no more than 3 in 5 consecutive ground floor units 
should be in food and drink, evening and night-time economy uses, taking 
account of unimplemented planning permissions for change of use. There 
will be a presumption against the use of rooftops and terraces for food 
and drink, evening and night-time economy uses in the evening economy  T o table of contents277

 T o table of contentsmanagement zone unless it can be robustly demonstrated there will be no 
harmful impact as a result of these uses. 
D. outside of the primary shopping area, indoor markets (as shown on the Policies Map) and evening economy management zone, ground floor uses 
in the town centre should be in commercial, business, service, learning, 
non-residential institution, local community or appropriate sui generis use. 
The proportion of units in public house, wine bar, drinking establishment 
(including with expanded food provision) and nightclub use should not exceed 5 per cent and no more than 2 in 5 consecutive ground floor units 
should be in public house, wine bar, drinking establishment (including with 
expanded food provision) or nightclub use. This should take account of unimplemented planning permissions for change of use. 
E. supporting the Creative Enterprise Zone (CEZ) through the promotion and growth of the existing cluster of creative and digital industries active in 
Brixton and complementing the wider aspirations for Brixton’s economy. 
Applications within the CEZ for development including office, research and 
development and light industrial floorspace will be supported where they: 
i. maximise the amount of market, flexible, low-cost and affordable 
workspace suitable for creative and digital industries in accordance 
with Local Plan policies ED1 and ED2; 
ii. provide a mix of workspace typologies for different types and sizes of 
businesses with a focus on start-up, incubator and grow-on space for 
creative and digital industries that diversify and strengthen the sector; 
and
iii. provide space, such as meeting rooms and exhibition spaces, which promotes networking and information sharing between businesses 
and sectors within the creative and digital industries and that can be 
accessed by local community groups.
F. securing traffic reduction and initiatives to reduce harmful emissions and improve air quality; the creation of new high-quality, safe, accessible and 
animated public spaces with increased green infrastructure; improvements 
in provision for pedestrian movement and cyclists; improved linkages within 
the town centre and connections with adjoining areas; and communal use 
of public spaces and public art. 
G. improving the quality of public transport provision and interchange; seeking further improvements in the quality and connectivity of public transport 
such as a fully accessible refurbished mainline train station; working with 
TfL to open the rear entrance to Brixton Underground Station on Electric 
Lane; delivering a cycle parking hub near the tube station; and exploring 
opportunities to improve access to east to west rail links.
H. supporting a new mainline rail station building that improves arrival to and departure from the station and town centre, and incorporates inclusive 
access to north and south bound platforms. The new station building and 
access arrangements will be expected to reduce platform congestion,  T o table of contents278
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentspromote better interchange and improve the passenger experience. 
Development proposals in the vicinity of the station and that will directly 
benefit from these improvements will be expected to contribute towards 
their delivery. 
I. implementing town-centre energy and waste management strategies involving a wide range of sustainable elements and innovation and 
supporting this delivery through planning obligations. This could include 
provision of sustainable waste management and recycling facilities or 
district heating networks, and permanently moving the town centre waste 
compactors from their temporary location on Brixton Station Road. 
J. Somerleyton Road area – in accordance with site allocation 14, promoting options for mixed-use development: improving the residential mix and 
housing layouts and street patterns; providing employment space including 
affordable and flexible workspace, cultural and community industries, green 
industries, community facilities, educational facilities, Ovalhouse theatre / 
arts facilities; improved green and play space; active / overlooking street frontages; and improved public realm and linkages with adjoining areas. 
K. supporting development on sites 15 and 16 in accordance with the site allocation policies for those sites and the guidance and principles set out in 
the Brixton Central Supplementary Planning Document. The ground floor 
mix of uses should contribute directly to the future viability and vitality of the 
town centre in accordance with PN3a), PN3d) and PN3e). The design of the 
development proposals should complement and enhance the permeability and quality of public spaces and improve pedestrian and cycle movements 
through this part of the town centre. Development proposals will also be 
expected to contribute towards wider public realm improvements in this part of the town centre to facilitate a comprehensive and unified approach. 
L. requiring changes of use in the railway arches in Brixton Central to address the requirements of Local Plan policy ED6 and the guidance provided in the 
Brixton Central Supplementary Planning Document. 
M. supporting and delivering public realm improvements to the section of 
Brixton Station Road between Pope’s Road and Brixton Road and the 
section of Pope’s Road between Atlantic Road and Brixton Station Road, 
that provide an improved trading environment for the outdoor market and 
shops by enhancing the street market’s infrastructure, seating, lighting, 
landscaping, wayfinding and servicing. Development proposals in this part of the town centre will be expected to contribute to this objective in their 
design and through appropriate planning obligations. 
N. supporting and delivering public realm improvements to the section of 
Brixton Station Road between Pope’s Road and Valentia Place that provide 
an improved setting for new development and redeveloped railway arches 
by creating a pedestrian and cycle-friendly street that incorporates tree 
planting and meets the servicing needs of new development. Development 
proposals in this part of the town centre will be expected to contribute to this objective in their design and through appropriate planning obligations. T o table of contents279

Design principles and key 
development considerations Large site bounded by railway viaducts with considerable 
development potential subject to improving access and permeability through the site.
The council will support development on the site that:
i. provides opportunities to improve the station entrance and 
station facilities generally, including lift access and cycle parking;
ii. provides public realm improvements to Brixton Station Road to include links to both the mainline and underground stations, the opening up of arches to provide links to north-south routes east 
of Popes Road and potential links to Brixton Village;
iii. enhances the arches to provide active uses and routes through; 
iv. opens up Popes Road to provide a wider public space with the 
potential to provide improved and/or additional market spaces;
v. includes market facilities; 
vi. includes environmental improvements to the viaduct arches serving the Orpington Line;
vii. integrates and complements development on the Popes Road site (Site 15);
viii. includes the reprovision of the redundant 1950s building;
ix. avoids creating a canyon on either side of the railway viaducts;
x. proposes low buildings to protect the amenity of new residential development on Coldharbour Lane adjoining the site. T o table of contents289

 T o table of contentsStreatham
Context and character 
11.59  Streatham is one of Lambeth’s two major town centres and enjoys a strategic 
position in South London. It has a significant residential hinterland with a wide 
variety of housing types and, with its conservation areas and green spaces 
and connections to Central London, Streatham is a popular place to live. The 
town centre has a number of outstanding architectural features. To the south 
west of the town centre, Streatham Vale/Greyhound Lane is an important local centre. To the east of the town centre, Streatham Wells is a residential area 
which contains a wide range of housing. 
11.60  Once the shopping and leisure centre of South London, like many other town 
centres, Streatham’s retail offer is having to adjust to changing habits and 
shopping practices to develop a more diverse town centre economy with an 
increased office and leisure provision. Parts of Streatham, including the area 
around the southern part of the town centre, are identified in the London Plan 
as being a Strategic Area for Regeneration. 
Community 
11.61  Streatham’s people and diverse culture are seen as strengths and its large Polish and Somali communities help to bring more footfall into the area 
through cultural and food festivals. Streatham has a number of different 
neighbourhoods, based around local schools and open spaces. The area is 
home to a number of active community groups, many of which collaborate to 
host the annual Streatham Festival. The Business Improvement District hosts the annual Streatham Food Festival. 
Housing 
11.62  The London Plan identifies the major town centre as having medium residential growth potential. In the town centre, housing may come forward in the vicinity 
of Streatham Hill station and on sites around Streatham station. In the wider 
Streatham area, sites with the potential to deliver new housing include St 
Margaret’s Church Hall Barcombe Avenue. There is further scope of further 
residential growth on small sites and this is likely to be delivered by the extension/conversion of existing housing stock as well as new build residential 
development. Additional development within residential curtilages may come 
forward where site circumstances permit. 
Economy and Culture
11.63  Streatham has a good mix of multiple and independent retailers and retail vacancy rates have decreased since 2012. There are approximately 320 retail 
and service units. However, the town centre has a smaller offer of comparison 
shopping compared to other centres and the Business Improvement  T o table of contents290
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsDistrict, ‘In Streatham’, is working to expand this retail offer, particularly 
anchor retailers. 
11.64  Streatham’s food and drink offer and its evening economy have experienced growth, with an increase in the number of restaurants, cafes and bars. There 
are approximately 120 food and drink units. This is an asset and a distinctive 
characteristic of the centre, with the London Plan identifying Streatham as 
having a night-time economy with regional or sub-regional significance. The 
renowned Hideaway Jazz Club is a particular draw and regularly attracts customers from outside London. There are also a range of other cultural and 
leisure facilities including the Odeon, Streatham leisure centre and ice rink and 
Streatham Space Project. 
11.65  The consolidation of the Streatham Hill Primary Shopping Area provides an opportunity to diversify this part of the town centre and promote further growth 
in non-retail uses and the early-evening economy in this part of the High 
Street, with a particular focus on restaurants and cultural and creative uses. 
There is also an opportunity to increase the amount of office floorspace and 
workspaces for creative and digital industries. 
11.66  Streatham has low levels of office stock in comparison with other centres, particularly along the High Road. The town centre has experienced high levels 
of loss of office space through permitted development rights and this lack of 
offices and a comparative shortage of suitable SME workspace presents a 
challenge for growth in Streatham’s employment offer. However, Streatham’s 
economy has grown over recent years. Employment has increased by 19 per cent since 2011 and the number of businesses has increased by 43 per 
cent since 2012. There are now 2,000 businesses in the area employing 
approximately 11,000 people. Both average rents and vacancy rates for offices in Streatham are lower than the London average. The London Plan 
identifies the major centre as having low commercial growth potential. 
However, the Streatham Investment and Growth Strategy identifies an 
opportunity to promote Streatham as a location to start and grow businesses 
based on its relatively low rents, connections to Central London and access to local services. 
11.67  A range of small and medium enterprises, such as artist studios and furniture restorers, are located in Gleneldon Mews, providing an important cluster of 
light industrial uses in the area.
11.68  Streatham has experienced significant physical regeneration along parts of 
the High Road. In the south, the Streatham Hub development delivered a 
sports and leisure complex, homes, retail, bus interchange and public realm 
improvements. At the northern end of the High Road, the redevelopment of 
the Caesar’s/Megabowl site for residential-led development has provided new 
retail opportunities together with a new cultural asset through the provision of a theatre. The former Streatham Hill theatre is Grade II listed and provides a 
transformative opportunity to provide a major leisure and entertainment venue 
with the potential for workspace for creative, digital and cultural industries. T o table of contents291

 T o table of contentsTransport and Public Realm 
11.69  Streatham High Road is a major arterial route that dominates Streatham and 
forms part of the wider A23 corridor through South London. The layout of the 
road allows for very limited public spaces set back from the traffic. However, 
the High Road has benefitted from several stages of improvement works, 
including the removal of central reservations, their replacement with trees 
and decorative lighting and an improvement in links across the High Road. Further interventions are planned including the removal of the reservation 
and the introduction of cycle tracks northward from Streatham Hill to the 
South Circular. 
11.70  Public transport provision in the form of buses north and south along the High Road is excellent but elsewhere there is a need for improved 
connections, particularly for east-west routes. Rail services provide important 
links to Central London termini but improvements to service frequency and 
quality are required. As a result, many passengers choose to take a bus to 
Brixton for interchange with the Underground. Southern Rail has invested in improvements at Streatham Hill and Streatham Common stations, but further 
improvements are needed to upgrade the stations to improve the sense of 
arrival and deliver step-free access at Streatham station in particular. The rail network in the Streatham area would particularly benefit from better integration 
and investment to deliver metro style ‘turn up and go’ services. 
11.71  Further measures to improve cycle and pedestrian safety along the High Road 
are needed. The A23 corridor has been identified by TfL as one of the top 25 
cycle demand corridors in London and significant improvements are planned 
to create a new, high quality cycle route along the corridor between Streatham 
and Oval. Significant improvements to cycling facilities on the A23 will release 
suppressed demand for cycling in the area. The A23 will form a central part of Lambeth’s Healthy Route network and Streatham will be served by links to 
Herne Hill and Croydon in addition to the existing cycleway to Waterloo. Much 
of Streatham suffers from high levels of parking stress and the council will introduce parking controls in areas not currently covered by Controlled Parking 
Zones, based on demand. 
Environment
11.72  The A23 from Brixton to Streatham is designated as an air quality focus area 
due to its high levels of both pollution and human exposure and is identified 
in Lambeth’s Air Quality Action Plan. Development in this area should, in 
accordance with London Plan policy SI1, incorporate design solutions that 
prevent or minimise exposure to existing air pollution and make provisions to 
address local air pollution. Measures to improve air quality will be sought. 
11.73  Streatham’s open spaces have received recent investment and in general, Streatham is not deficient in access to open spaces, though there are areas 
that lack access to smaller parks. The Common and the Rookery provide 
a large area of public open space in the south of the area and include the 
Streatham Common Community Garden which hosts a number of community  T o table of contents292

provide important local amenity spaces. Measures to increase green 
infrastructure and to improve access to open space will be sought.

yard are on the Heritage at Risk Register.  T o table of contents293

 T o table of contentsPolicy PN4: Streatham 
Streatham’s role as a major town centre in South London will be supported and
enhanced to create a vibrant and viable town centre with a diverse economy 
including retail, leisure, offices, hotels and housing. Investment in public realm, green 
infrastructure and public transport will ensure it is an attractive place to live, work and 
visit and is well connected to neighbouring centres and to Central London. Where necessary and justified to achieve the objectives of this policy, the council will use 
conditions and/or planning obligations in new development proposals to limit uses 
consented within Class E.
The vision for Streatham will be delivered by:
A. supporting development which enhances the vitality and viability of the 
town centre by bringing forward new housing, retail, leisure, offices and 
workspace for creative and digital industries, whilst being sensitive to the 
centre’s conservation area status and valued heritage assets. 
B. safeguarding retail uses in the two primary shopping areas (Streatham Hill and Streatham Central) and supporting appropriate new retail uses. 
Within the major centre as a whole, no fewer than 60 per cent of ground 
floor units in each of the two primary shopping areas (Streatham Hill and 
Streatham Central) are to be in retail use and within each area no more than 
25 per cent food and drink use and no more than 2 in 5 consecutive food and drink uses. Outside of the two primary shopping areas ground floor 
units should be in commercial, business, service, learning, non-residential 
institution, local community or appropriate sui generis use. No more betting shops or payday loan shops will be supported across the centre as 
a whole.
C. safeguarding Gleneldon Mews as an important location for light industrial 
uses and small businesses. 
D. supporting sustainable travel, the accessibility and use of public transport including buses and rail services, walking and cycling through 
improvements to the safety and accessibility of public realm and public 
transport facilities and through measures to reduce the impact and 
dominance of road traffic and to improve air quality. Development should 
have regard to parking stress across much of the area and in particular on streets around the town centre and the stations including Norbury station 
situated just outside the borough. 
E. improving Streatham’s sense of place and visitor experience through 
investment in Streatham’s Heritage at Risk assets, existing public spaces, 
the creation of new, safe and accessible public realm and increasing 
green infrastructure.
F. encouraging property owners to work in partnership with others to remove assets from the Heritage at Risk Register. 
G. facilitating development and regeneration opportunities in the following key areas:  T o table of contents296
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsi. Streatham Hill – its role as a gateway to the town centre from the 
north will be improved. Development should be of a scale and form 
appropriate to its location and relationship with the conservation area, 
and provide increased accessibility to the station and surrounding area. 
The council will support the regeneration of the former Streatham Hill 
theatre to become a major leisure and entertainment venue alongside workspace for creative and cultural industries. 
ii. Streatham Central – the potential of the area surrounding Streatham station will be realised and the council will encourage landowners 
to work together to bring forward appropriate redevelopment over 
both the short-term and long-term. Mixed-use development including 
residential, office and ground-floor active frontages will be supported. 
A mix of ground-floor unit sizes should be provided to support a diverse offer and to enhance the vitality of the town centre. The high 
accessibility of this location means that density should be optimised.  T o table of contents297

 T o table of contentsClapham
Context and character
11.75  Clapham is one of Lambeth’s district centres, predominantly located along 
Clapham High Street. The town centre is characterised by late 18th Century 
residential buildings and 19th Century commercial buildings. The area is 
home to Clapham Common, which is one of the prime open spaces in south 
London, and much of the area is designated as conservation areas. Clapham’s 
residential hinterland is characterised by large houses fronting Clapham Common, terraced housing and housing estates including Clapham Park 
Estate. Clapham’s historic significance is focussed on Clapham Old Town, 
around which there are a concentration of heritage assets. Though Clapham is not considered to be deprived as a whole, there are areas of Clapham 
identified in the London Plan as Strategic Areas for Regeneration.
Community
11.76  The ‘This is Clapham’ Business Improvement District (BID) is working to 
improve Clapham as a place to work, live, visit and do business. The BID has 
ambitions to introduce public art into the area, to help position Clapham as a 
cultural destination, and is working with Studio Voltaire and other stakeholders 
to deliver this ambition. 
11.77  The Old Clapham Library building is now the Omnibus Theatre and in 
community use. Other important facilities include Clapham Leisure Centre, 
Clapham Library and Studio Voltaire. 
Housing 
11.78  The London Plan identifies the district town centre as having medium 
residential growth potential. In the wider Clapham area, sites with the potential 
to deliver new housing include the redevelopment of the Clapham Park Estate, 
363 -369 Clapham Road, 44 Clapham Common South Side, Fenwick Estate 
and Westbury Estate. There is scope for further residential growth on small 
sites and this is likely to be delivered by the extension/conversion of existing housing stock as well as new build residential and mixed-use development. 
Additional development within residential curtilages may come forward where 
site circumstances permit. 
Economy and Culture
11.79  The district town centre is well served by food and convenience shopping with a large food-store, various other smaller supermarket chain stores and 
a weekly street market on Venn Street. The centre has approximately 140 
retail and service units and 95 food and drink units. There is a lower level of 
comparison shopping.  T o table of contents298
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents11.80  Leisure and hospitality play an important role in Clapham’s economy, 
supporting many jobs and businesses. The London Plan identifies Clapham’s 
night-time economy as an area of regional or sub-regional significance, which 
is concentrated along Clapham High Street and in Clapham Old Town, with 
a cinema, many restaurants, bars and takeaways and a number of LGBTQ+ 
venues. The council will investigate the impact of the night tube on the number of people choosing to visit Clapham rather than central London and the 
impact of nearby alternative destinations, such as Brixton. The level of noise, 
litter and anti-social behaviour associated with this night-time activity can have significant impacts on the amenity of adjoining residential areas. There is a 
need to manage these impacts effectively, to redress the balance between 
the evening economy and day-time town centre functions, and to promote 
more choice in sit-down eating as opposed to drinking-only establishments 
or takeaways. Initial evidence suggests that the range of sit-down restaurants in Clapham is starting to increase and this will be monitored. The approach 
to managing town-centre uses set out in this policy is consistent with the 
council’s ‘licensing cumulative impact zone’ in Clapham.
11.81  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having low commercial growth potential. In the wider area, Clapham has a number of Key Industrial 
and Business Areas, with the largest being Timber Mill Way. Most of the 
workspaces in Clapham are studios and maker spaces, although the area also 
accommodates some flexible co-working and managed workspaces. There 
are aspirations to provide additional space for creative and digital enterprises. An Article 4 Direction, removing permitted development rights for change of 
use from B1 (a) Office to C3 Residential, has been implemented in Clapham on 
a site specific basis in order to protect small business in the area.
Transport and Public Realm
11.82  Clapham was one of the first parts of south London to be serviced by the London Underground, and this was critical to its development. Today the 
tube’s popularity results in passenger demand exceeding capacity at busy 
times. The Northern Line between Clapham Common and Stockwell is 
one of the busiest sections of the underground network, leading to serious 
overcrowding. Both Clapham High Street and Wandsworth Road overland stations are increasingly serving more residents and businesses and are 
important in connecting Clapham to the wider area. 
11.83  The long term plan to reduce this overcrowding is for Crossrail 2 to provide 
additional capacity for journeys originating in south west London. The council 
supports Crossrail 2 and TfL’s vision to improve south London’s overland 
rail network by providing metro-style turn-up-and-go frequencies at stations 
throughout the borough. Within the context of supporting the delivery of 
this metroisation of rail services, the council will explore the possibility of and promote a rail link from Clapham High Street to Victoria and platform 
lengthening to accommodate longer trains at Wandsworth Road and 
Clapham High Street stations. It is not feasible to provide step-free access at the Underground stations in Clapham which means priority should be  T o table of contents299
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsgiven to alternative forms of transport in the area, such as buses and access 
improvements at the Overground stations. 
11.84  Clapham High Street suffers from a very poor road safety record with a very high number of collisions, particularly affecting people who cycle. The council 
wishes to see safety improvements, including improvements to the quality and 
safety of Cycleway 7 that runs along the High Street. Transport for London’s 
Strategic Cycling Analysis also identifies the need to improve cycle links from 
Clapham to Battersea, Nine Elms and Brixton.
11.85  Cycleways 7 and 5 (Norbury to Waterloo) form part of the Healthy Route Network, with the latter providing a quiet route through the area including a 
section that crosses Clapham Common. The Network also includes an east 
west link to Brixton and related to this, the council has committed funding to 
improve the public realm around Voltaire Road. This will facilitate interchanges 
between Clapham North Underground station and Clapham High Street Overground station and cycle movements across the High Street. 
11.86  The council has been working in partnership with community and business representatives and TfL to implement a programme of improvements to the 
public realm, including landscaping, around Clapham Old Town to improve the 
area for local people, businesses and visitors. This includes projects identified 
through ‘Your Clapham – a vision for the high street’ including improvements 
to Voltaire Road, Clapham High Street, Clapham Park Road, Clapham Manor Street and Nelsons Row. Wandsworth Road is increasingly serving more 
residents and businesses and is important in connecting Clapham to the wider 
area. Improvements to road safety on Wandsworth Road may be required. 
Environment
11.87  Clapham Common is designated Metropolitan Open Land and part of the Common is cross-border with the London Borough of Wandsworth. It was 
awarded a Green Flag Award in 2018.Together with the High Street, it lies 
within a conservation area. It is an extremely popular community space and 
venue for formal and informal leisure and recreational activities. The Common’s 
sports facilities include football, rugby and lacrosse/hockey pitches, tennis and basketball courts and a bowling green, all of which are used for local 
sports participation. It also hosts festivals and music events, some of which 
draw up to twenty thousand participants and spectators, with people coming from across the capital and beyond. The Clapham Common Management 
Advisory Committee has developed a masterplan and a Management Plan 
for improvements to Clapham Common – many of which have already been 
carried out – with due regard to the heritage importance of the Common, 
working jointly with the neighbouring borough of Wandsworth. Though generally Clapham is considered to have good access to all forms of open 
spaces, parts of the area is deficient in access to smaller parks. T o table of contents300

The council will support the role of Clapham High Street as a district centre 
by safeguarding and encouraging retail, other town-centre uses, housing and 
workspace. It will seek to enhance its distinctive character associated with the Old 
Town, its historic environment, Clapham Common and its popularity for leisure and entertainment, and will encourage provision in particular for cultural, creative, visual 
and performing arts, street markets and other forms of community innovation, while 
managing the level of food and drink uses and the impact on amenity of the evening economy. Where necessary and justified to achieve the objectives of this policy, the 
council will use conditions and/or planning obligations in new development proposals 
to limit uses consented within Class E.
The council will seek to address this by:
A. supporting appropriate opportunities to deliver additional housing within the 
district centre and the nearby neighbourhoods;
B. requiring no less than 50 per cent of ground-floor units in the primary shopping area to be in retail use;
C. requiring no more than 25 per cent of original ground-floor units in food and drink use across the centre as a whole and no more than 2 in 5 
consecutive units in food and drink use;
D. permitting no additional public house, wine bar or drinking establishment 
(including with expanded food provision) or hot takeaway uses;
E. supporting measures to improve air quality;
F. requiring enhancements to the public realm of the town centre to increase green infrastructure and to improve the safety, accessibility and 
environment for pedestrians and cyclists and to improve linkages through 
the town centre, across the High Street and between the town centre 
and the Metropolitan Open Land at Clapham Common, including projects 
identified through ‘Your Clapham – a vision for the high street’ and the Healthy Route Network;
G. conserving, managing and improving Clapham Common through the implementation of the Clapham Common Masterplan;
H. working with TfL to increase public transport provision, including bus services, in the town centre; to promote a rail service from Clapham High

 T o table of contentsStockwell
Context and character 
11.88  Stockwell is one of Lambeth’s district centres, and alongside Brixton, is the 
most densely populated town centre in Lambeth, with a diverse population 
including a large community from Portugal and the Horn of Africa. The 
neighbourhood is overwhelmingly residential in use, with a high proportion of 
social housing on estates and smaller pockets of Victorian villas and terraced 
housing designated as conservation areas. Stockwell is one of the most accessible locations in the borough and lies equidistant between Brixton and 
Vauxhall. Vauxhall is undergoing significant growth and investment as part of 
the Nine Elms Vauxhall Opportunity Area. 
Community
11.89  Regeneration has taken place over a number of years in accordance with community-led plans for Stockwell, led by the Stockwell Partnership. This 
includes the recently completed Stockwell Square project which has created a 
safe public space on Binwell Road. 
11.90  The council has a Co-operative Local Investment Plan (CLIP), covering the wards of Stockwell, Vassal and Larkhall, which sets out the priorities for future 
investment and improvements in the area. The council will support projects 
that deliver the aspirations of the CLIP and any other community-led initiatives. 
Housing 
11.91  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having incremental residential growth potential. In the wider Stockwell area, sites with potential to deliver new 
housing include 363 – 369 Clapham Road and South Lambeth Estate. The 
council will seek to work in partnership with local landowners, including TfL 
and registered providers of affordable housing, to identify sites for housing and 
opportunities for land assembly. There is scope for further residential growth on small sites and this is likely to be delivered by the extension/redevelopment 
of existing housing stock as well as new build residential development. 
Additional development within residential curtilages may come forward where site circumstances permit.
Economy and Culture
11.92  Stockwell has a relatively small district centre. Units are occupied by a higher than average proportion of convenience shops and local services, with 
comparatively low proportions of comparison retail, restaurants, takeaways 
and cafes. Stockwell has a particular concentration of Portuguese-owned 
businesses, reflecting the local population. Opportunities to improve the local 
retail offer, particularly with regard to comparison shopping, will be sought. T o table of contents304
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents11.93  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having low commercial 
growth potential. Most residents travel out of the area for employment. The 
principal local employment opportunities in Stockwell are in shops, education, 
healthcare and the voluntary sector and the council will be supportive of 
proposals that seek to increase and diversify the local employment offer.
Transport and Public Realm
11.94  Stockwell is very well served by public transport, with a tube station at its 
heart, giving access to the Victoria and Northern lines. Together with the 
various bus routes, this provides a popular transport interchange at Stockwell 
Cross. Stockwell bus garage is a Grade II listed building. However, Clapham 
Road (A3) creates a severance within the town centre to the detriment of its 
accessibility and attractiveness for cyclists and pedestrians. 
11.95  In addition to bus and underground services, Stockwell’s neighbourhoods are well served by cycle routes with Cycleway 7 running through the centre to the 
City of London and a further Cycleway serving Waterloo. These routes form 
part of the borough’s Healthy Route Network as do Stockwell Road and South 
Lambeth Road which provide links to Brixton and Vauxhall. TfL’s analysis also 
suggests the area could support a cycle hub providing interchange with the underground. This direct and easy access to the city makes Stockwell one of 
the borough’s most desirable areas to live. 
Environment
11.96  The area alongside Clapham Road (A3), encompassing the entire town 
centre, has been designated as an air quality focus area as it is a location that 
has high levels of pollution and human exposure. The area is also identified 
in Lambeth’s Air Quality Action Plan. Development in this area should, in 
accordance with London Plan policy SI1, incorporate design solutions that 
prevent or minimise exposure to existing air pollution and make provisions to address local air pollution. The council will support measures that seek to 
improve air quality and/or limit the exposure of poor air quality in Stockwell. 
11.97  Access to open space is generally considered to be good, with Larkhall 
Park in particular playing a key role in meeting local communities’ leisure and 
recreation needs. However, there are areas of Stockwell which are deficient in 
access to local and/or regional parks.  T o table of contents305

The council will support the role of Stockwell as a district centre with a clear and 
distinguishable community focus and heart and a clear physical sense of place 
supported by its heritage assets. The council will support initiatives and strategies 
that will help Stockwell’s residents and businesses fully realise the benefits and opportunities that the adjacent NEV Opportunity Area is delivering, particularly as parts 
of the area are identified as Strategic Areas for Regeneration in the London Plan. 
This will be achieved through: 
A. safeguarding and encouraging retail uses: within the primary shopping 
area, no fewer than 50 per cent of ground-floor units should be in retail use. 
Where necessary and justified to achieve the objectives of this policy, the 
council will use conditions and/or planning obligations in new development 
proposals to limit uses consented within Class E;
B. supporting appropriate opportunities to deliver additional housing within the 
district centre and the nearby neighbourhoods;
C. enhancing its historic environment; 
D. encouraging commercial, civic and other employment uses, particularly small business space suitable for creative and digital industries; 
E. developing and enhancing its sense of place by introducing measures that will reduce the severance caused by Clapham Road, particularly in the town 
centre, reduce road danger and improve environmental and accessibility 
conditions for pedestrians and cyclists; 
F. working with TfL to implement the council’s Healthy Route Network in the area, including upgrading Cycleway 7 to make it attractive and accessible 
to the whole community; 
G. creating public open spaces and linkages throughout the area, including 
improvements to housing estates and connections to and within housing 
estates; and
H. supporting measures to improve air quality and increase 
green infrastructure.  T o table of contents307

 T o table of contentsWest Norwood/Tulse Hill 
Context and character 
11.98  West Norwood/Tulse Hill sits in a bowl defined by hillsides on three sides. 
Its access routes are characterised by distant views that include glimpses of 
the City, Crystal Palace, Dulwich and the ridge at Leigham Court Road. The 
hillsides provide challenges for older people, parents and toddlers, and people 
with reduced mobility. West Norwood and Tulse Hill are historic suburbs, 
with relatively lower density housing and a strong community focus. There is a wide range of housing in the area, from large Victorian villas to smaller flats 
and maisonettes. As a result, the area has a distinctive character and offers a 
mixture of shopping, entertainment, cultural and leisure facilities. 
11.99  There are a number of conservation areas in the area, including Lancaster Avenue, Rosendale Road and West Norwood. The area around St Luke’s 
Church and West Norwood station is evolving as a cultural and heritage hub 
with a number of sites and buildings of interest, including West Norwood 
Cemetery, Portico Gallery, South London Theatre, West Norwood Health and 
Leisure Centre and the new cinema and library complex. 
11.100  Parts of West Norwood/Tulse Hill are identified in the London Plan as being a Strategic Area for Regeneration.
Community
11.101  In January 2016, the council designated Tulse Hill Neighbourhood Forum to bring forward a neighbourhood plan for the Tulse Hill neighbourhood area. 
In July 2017, the council designated Norwood Planning Assembly as a 
neighbourhood forum to bring forward a neighbourhood plan for the Norwood 
Planning Assembly neighbourhood area. The Norwood Planning Assembly 
have aspirations for West Norwood to be the greenest town in London. 
11.102  The Station to Station Business Improvement District covers the town centre, the Park Hall Road Trading Estate and the West Norwood Commercial 
Area, focussing on growing existing business and supporting public realm 
improvements. The Norwood Action Group and Norwood Forum are active 
community groups. 
11.103  The West Norwood Masterplan 2009 set out detailed regeneration proposals 
for the area, together with a delivery framework and implementation strategy. 
As many of the projects within the masterplan were being completed, an 
update of the masterplan was undertaken in 2017. The resulting West 
Norwood and Tulse Hill: A Manual for Delivery 2017 provides a vision and 
guidance for how the local economy could evolve. 
11.104  The council has a Co-operative Local Investment Plan (CLIP) covering the wards of Gipsy Hill, Knight’s Hill and Thurlow Park, which sets out the priorities 
for future investment and improvements in the area. The council will support  T o table of contents308
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsprojects that deliver the aspirations of the CLIP and any other community-
led initiatives. 
Housing 
11.105  The London Plan identifies West Norwood/Tulse Hill district centre as having high residential growth potential. In the town centre, larger sites with potential 
to deliver new housing include Site 18. Large sites in the wider West Norwood/
Tulse Hill area include West Norwood Lawn Tennis Club and land on the 
corner of Avenue Park Road. New housing may also come forward as part 
of mixed-use developments in the West Norwood Creative Business Cluster. There is scope for further residential growth on small sites and this is likely 
to be delivered by the extension/redevelopment and conversion of existing 
housing stock as well as new build residential and mixed-use development. Additional development within residential curtilages may come forward where 
site circumstances permit.
Economy and Culture
11.106  West Norwood/Tulse Hill has a linear district town centre, stretching along 
Norwood Road from Tulse Hill in the north and including the northern ends of 
Knight’s Hill and Norwood High Street in the south. It has a good selection of 
independent retailers providing for a range of shopping goods and services 
but a limited number of multiple comparison retailers. The community-led 
Norwood Feast market takes place monthly. The northern end of the centre at Tulse Hill is performing less well and would benefit from investment through 
development of key sites.
11.107  The southern part of Norwood High Street to the south of the railway line 
is currently performing comparatively weakly in contrast to the rest of the 
town centre, with many ground floor units vacant or being converted to non-
town centre uses. Its proximity to the West Norwood Commercial Area and 
transport links including from West Norwood station offers an opportunity to 
redefine its role. It has been removed from the town centre boundary and has instead been designated as the West Norwood Creative Business Cluster. 
The removal of the southern part of Norwood High Street to the south of the 
railway line from the town centre boundary will help to concentrate new retail development within the remainder of the town centre, particularly at Site 18. 
11.108  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having low commercial growth potential. However, Site 18 (286-362 Norwood Road) provides a significant 
opportunity for town centre improvement through a higher density mixed-use 
development that includes housing with retail uses on the Norwood Road 
frontage. The council has recently acquired the freehold of the existing DIY 
operator and associated car parking. The successful development of this site will be a vital catalyst in promoting confidence and investment in the 
wider area. 
11.109  The main employment sectors in West Norwood are health, education, 
retail and small-scale manufacturing. There has been recent growth in  T o table of contents309
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsprofessional services activities, ICT and creative and digital industries and an 
increasing concentration of artists and artists’ studios. It is home to the largest 
concentration of land in employment use in Lambeth in the West Norwood 
Commercial Area Key Industrial and Business Area (KIBA). A broad range 
of uses operate in the KIBA, including manufacturing, food manufacturing, 
construction, motor trade activities, wholesale activities and waste management. It is also home to West Norwood bus garage. A number of sites 
within this KIBA provide an opportunity to densify and intensify workspace 
provision in accordance with London Plan policy on industrial land and to increase the range, size and quality of business space and jobs in the area. 
There is also an opportunity to improve public realm and connectivity with the 
wider area. 
11.110  The Park Hall Road Trading Estate is another KIBA accommodating over 100 businesses, which is becoming an established centre for creative industries, 
drawn by proximity to Brixton and the lower rents than in neighbouring areas. 
Parade Mews is a smaller cluster of studios in Tulse Hill providing much valued 
space for artists and makers, including pottery and glass blowing. Knolly’s 
Yard is in use by businesses supporting the construction sector and has further potential as designated industrial land. 
Transport and Public Realm 
11.111  The area is served by West Norwood and Tulse Hill rail stations at either end of the town centre, plus nine bus routes and two night buses providing good 
radial public transport links into central London and connecting with the 
Underground network at Brixton. Neither rail station provides full step-free 
access and both would benefit from significant improvement as well as service 
improvements to provide ‘turn up and go’ metro style services. Opportunities for contributions to improvement of the stations will be explored through 
development proposals in appropriate cases. East-west public transport links 
are much weaker with limited bus routes. The A215 runs through the town centre and carries significant volumes of traffic resulting in congestion at busy 
times. A one-way traffic system operates at the southern end of the town 
centre and the traffic dominated Tulse Hill gyratory system dominates to the 
north. There is a strong community aspiration to seek the removal of the Tulse 
Hill gyratory, which would provide opportunities for significant improvements to this part of the centre. 
11.112  A programme of improvements has been delivered on the Norwood Road corridor with more space for pedestrians and significant improvements to 
the public realm in the town centre. Norwood Road forms part of Lambeth’s 
designated Healthy Route Network for walking and cycling which also 
includes an east – west route via Palace Road towards Clapham. Significant 
improvements are required in relation to provision for cycling. Electric bicycles may be particularly appropriate given the hilly nature of the area.  T o table of contents310
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsEnvironment 
11.113  The area has a number of parks and open spaces, including West Norwood 
cemetery, Tivoli Park, Knight’s Hill Wood Norwood Park and Hillside Gardens. 
Despite this, the majority of the area is deficient in access to multiple types 
of open space and opportunities to improve this will be sought. Measures to 
improve air quality in the area will also be sought.
11.114  West Norwood Cemetery dates from 1837 and is the finest necropolis in 
south London and one of the most important cemeteries in England. It is an 
historic Registered Park and Garden and a designated conservation area, with 
more listed monuments than any other cemetery in Britain. Many of the listed 
monuments are on the Heritage at Risk Register due to their poor structural 
condition. Heritage Lottery Fund investment has been secured to enable a number of enhancements, including improving access and the delivery of 
a visitor centre and the repair of monuments currently on the Heritage at 
Risk Register.  T o table of contents311

 T o table of contentsPolicy PN7: West Norwood/Tulse Hill 
A. The council will promote the role of West Norwood/Tulse Hill as a vibrant 
district centre through the development of key sites, to improve the quality 
and variety of retail floorspace and to increase workspace, education uses, 
community facilities, cultural uses and housing. Development in the area 
will need to be of a scale and form related and appropriate to its context 
with particular regard to local views and heritage assets. Housing densities should be optimised, particularly on highly accessible sites and where 
there is a broader need to realise a range of public benefits through major 
regeneration opportunities, such as Site 18. The role and contribution of West Norwood cemetery as a major historic asset and visitor attraction will 
be promoted.
B. The council will promote the district centre as a hub of community life and 
retail, commercial and cultural activity and will ensure that development 
enhances the viability and vitality of the centre. Shopping uses will be 
safeguarded and encouraged; within the primary shopping area, all ground 
floor units should be in active frontage uses and no fewer than 50 per 
cent of ground floor units are to be in shop use. Throughout the centre as a whole, there should be no more than 15 per cent and no more than 2 
in 5 consecutive hot food takeaway uses. No more betting shops will be 
permitted in the town centre. 
C. The council will work with stakeholders to promote improvements to public transport services to the area, including accessibility improvements 
to the rail stations and the wider objective to improve the reliability and 
frequency of rail services across the area. The council will work with TfL to 
reduce traffic dominance caused by Tulse Hill gyratory, including through 
the potential re-introduction of two-way working, creating better, safer connections for walking and cycling and an improved environment. 
D. The council will bring forward improvements to conditions for walking and cycling through the Healthy Route Network. 
E. The council will support measures to increase green infrastructure, improve access to open space and improve air quality. 
F. Development and investment will be directed towards five focal areas: West Norwood Central Retail Area, West Norwood Commercial Area, Norwood 
High Street, West Norwood Cultural and Heritage Area and Tulse Hill. This 
will be delivered by: 
i. West Norwood Central Retail Area (Site 18) – promoting mixed-use development including housing; a new street frontage pulled back to 
widen the shopping parade for the town centre, an improved east-west 
permeability route through the site, preferably aligned with Chatsworth 
Way. In order to incentivise land assembly and comprehensive 
redevelopment opportunities the density of new development should be optimised, provided that the architectural quality and detailing is of 
a high standard to enhance the appearance of the town centre and  T o table of contents314
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsdoes not harm locally important views. New commercial floorspace 
must provide flexible workspace to provide opportunities for creative 
and digital industries. Any redevelopment must improve the vitality and 
viability of the town centre as a whole, as well as creating a new sense 
of place and attracting back shoppers who currently go elsewhere. 
ii. West Norwood Commercial Area – protecting Lambeth’s largest 
industrial area whilst supporting opportunities for the evolution of West 
Norwood Commercial Area as a hub of creative enterprise, innovation 
and industry. Development should provide an increase in the amount, 
range, quality and flexibility of business premises and a variety of 
industrial uses in accordance with London Plan policy. The council will proactively seek opportunities to acquire land and work in partnership 
with existing landowners to increase the amount of industrial 
floorspace capacity and to diversify the employment offer. 
iii. Norwood High Street – designating the section of Norwood High Street to the south of the railway line a Creative Business Cluster to redefine 
and revitalise its role for creative and digital industries, building on the 
proximity to the Commercial Area, West Norwood station and the 
heritage and cultural area in the town centre. The council will support 
the development and renewal of spaces appropriate for creative and digital enterprises to encourage a range of businesses such as makers, 
artists and designers to locate in the Business Cluster. The council will 
promote the function of the Business Cluster by supporting: 
• mixed-use or enabling development, which may include residential on upper floors so long as it would not negatively affect the function 
of the Business Cluster or adjacent KIBA and would deliver ground 
floor workspace for makers and creative and digital industries; 
• proposals that maximise the delivery of workspace appropriate for creative and digital industries and include a range of unit sizes and 
workspace typologies; and 
• proposals which support and complement the creative and digital 
industries, such as the inclusion of ancillary sales/display space or 
meeting spaces. 
The council will produce a Supplementary Planning Document for this 
section of Norwood High Street. 
iv. West Norwood Cultural and Heritage Area - protecting and strengthening the role of existing cultural, community and heritage 
assets; supporting new community and cultural uses; preserving and 
enhancing the historic and heritage significance of West Norwood 
cemetery including measures to remove assets from the ‘at risk’ 
register and supporting public realm enhancements. A priority is to enhance the arrival of pedestrians through significant improvements 
to West Norwood station and safe and accessible walking and cycling 
connections to the wider area and local attractions, particularly to the leisure centre and Norwood Park. Development in this area will need  T o table of contents315
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsto be particularly sensitive in terms of appropriate scale and form in 
view of the heritage importance of the adjoining cemetery and its many 
listed buildings. 
v. Tulse Hill – improving its role as a gateway to the wider West 
Norwood area. Given the area’s high accessibility, the density of new 
development should be optimised, provided the architectural quality 
and detailing is of a high standard to enhance the appearance of the 
town centre and ensure it does not harm locally important views or the 
setting of heritage assets. Specific objectives include refurbishment of the railway station, with improved access and intensification of uses 
around the station interchange; supporting higher density residential-
led growth with mixed-use retail and food and drink uses; encouraging improved active frontages along either side of the railway line; 
improved links from Tulse Hill Station to the area to its east; supporting 
improvements to the public realm to improve safety, accessibility 
and connectivity; and removal of the gyratory system which causes 
significant severance to the area, carrying high volumes of traffic on the South Circular and resulting in a hostile environment for walking 
and cycling.
Where necessary and justified to achieve the objectives of this policy, the 
council will use conditions and/or planning obligations in new development 
proposals to limit uses consented within Class E. T o table of contents316

West Norwood Masterplan (March 2009)There have been applications for alterations and improvements to various 
buildings on this site. However, there have been no recent relevant planning applications. 
Preferred use Retail-led mixed-use development to include housing, new public space and improved connections through the area, smaller retail units fronting Norwood Road and car parking. 
Design principles and key development considerationsThe regeneration of all or part of this site provides the opportunity to provide a heart for West Norwood. The council will support development on all or part of this site that:
i. is of an appropriate scale and form that respects the rich 
conservation value and heritage of the town centre, taking account of factors such as building heights and the setting of 
adjacent development and locally-important views; 
ii. provides a finer grain development rather than a single block;
iii. addresses the opportunity to provide landmark buildings 
associated with this key town-centre site;
iv. ensures heights on the Norwood Road frontage reflect the heights of the existing buildings on the eastern side of Norwood Road, avoiding a canyon effect;
v. provides development on the western edge of the site appropriate to reduce impact on the York Hill estate;
vi. improves permeability and linkages through the site including a pedestrian link through the site to improve access to the York Hill Estate; 
vii. provides a new access to Norwood Road ensuring pedestrian priority and minimising the impact on the public realm;

 T o table of contentsKennington/Oval
Context and character
11.115  The Kennington/Oval area sits between the railway viaduct in the west and 
Kennington Park Road in the east and stretches from Oval tube station in the 
south towards Lambeth Road in the north. The area sits between the Vauxhall 
Nine Elms, Waterloo and Elephant and Castle Opportunity Areas which are 
undergoing significant regeneration and transformation. The area and its 
communities are therefore well placed to benefit from opportunities that this growth will bring particularly as there are areas of deprivation in Kennington/
Oval that are identified as Strategic Areas for Regeneration in the London Plan. 
11.116  There is a diverse mix of building types in the area, including Victorian terraces 
and public housing estates. Many of the properties in Kennington have good 
architectural and structural quality, typically three storeys or higher fronting the 
main roads and squares. Accommodation in the area is overwhelmingly flats 
and home ownership is considerably lower than in the borough overall. 
11.117  Kennington/Oval has a number of conservation areas and the area 
surrounding Oval station has a very clearly defined and distinctive sense of 
place and contains St Mark’s Church, a Grade II* listed building; Kennington 
Park, a historic Registered Park and Garden; the nearby world famous 
Oval cricket stadium; and the well-known Oval gasometers. The area 
around the park and the church and the area around Kennington Cross are conservation areas. 
11.118  The priority issues for the area are how to: 
i. benefit from the significant investment opportunities that are coming forward as part of the Nine Elms Vauxhall, Waterloo and Elephant and 
Castle Opportunity Areas;
ii. secure investment in the area’s public realm, green spaces 
and built environment (particularly within and around the local 
centres) to achieve equivalent quality to that in the neighbouring 
Opportunity Areas;
iii. maximise the potential of council owned assets in the area;
iv. achieve the successful regeneration of the Oval gasworks site and the neighbouring Tesco site, deriving maximum community benefit 
including affordable housing and new employment opportunities;
v. enable successful intensification of the remaining Montford Place Key 
Industrial and Business Area;
vi. protect and enhance the stock of small business premises provided at the Kennington Business Park Key Industrial and Business Area;
vii. derive more benefit economically and for the community from the use and events at the Oval stadium, which includes many conferences, 
whilst managing the impacts of large numbers of visitors; T o table of contents320

ix. improve the quality and accessibility of the environment and public 
realm, access to open space and green infrastructure, and facilities 
and links to public transport for residents and visitors to a level 
appropriate for an international sporting venue;
x. realise the added potential contribution of St Mark’s churchyard to the public realm;
xi. support improvements to Kennington Park including its heritage attributes; and
xii. make more effective use of premises and sites within the area and the opportunities they provide – including that arising from the Oval House 
Theatre’s intention to relocate to Brixton - in order to build on and 
contribute to the area’s qualities. 
Community
11.119  The Kennington, Oval and Vauxhall Neighbourhood Forum was designated in July 2015 and is currently preparing a neighbourhood plan for the wider 
Kennington, Oval and Vauxhall neighbourhood area. Key aspirations of the 
neighbourhood forum include increasing green infrastructure and improving air 
quality in the neighbourhood area. 
Housing 
11.120  Larger sites that are expected to deliver new housing in the Kennington/
Oval area include the Knight’s Walk estate, Tesco at 263-275 Kennington 
Lane and the Oval gasworks. There is scope for further residential growth on 
small sites and this is likely to be delivered by the extension/redevelopment of 
existing housing stock as well as new build residential development. Additional 
development within residential curtilages may come forward where site circumstances permit. 
Economy and Culture
11.121  Kennington/Oval includes the local town centres at Kennington Park Road/Kennington Road, Kennington Lane, Kennington Cross, Oval (Clapham Road), 
Oval (Brixton Road) and Vauxhall Street/Jonathan Street. Policy ED11 Local 
Centres applies to the local centres in Kennington/Oval.
11.122  The area has a number of Key Industrial and Business Areas including Kennington Business Park, Durham Street/Oval Way, Montford Place 
and Stannary Street. The Kennington Business Park KIBA, managed by 
Workspace, is a hub for small businesses including creative and digital 
industries. An Article 4 Direction, removing permitted development rights for 
change of use from B1(a) Office to C3 Residential, has been implemented in the KIBA to protect the small business space.  T o table of contents321
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents11.123  The Oval gasworks and other land in the vicinity are to be transformed into a 
vibrant mixed-use area. There is potential for industrial intensification and co-
location with residential on the TfL owned land in the KIBA at Montford Place. 
Transport and public realm 
11.124  The area is served by three tube stations (Vauxhall, Kennington and Oval) and 
has numerous bus services to other parts of Lambeth and Central London. 
Car ownership is low compared to the rest of the borough and use of public 
transport to work is high. In Autumn 2021 the Northern Line extension spur 
from Kennington will open and will give direct access to the emerging CAZ 
retail cluster at Battersea. The area is served by various Cycleways forming part of the council’s Healthy Route Network. The Oval cricket ground is a 
significant visitor attraction resulting in high levels of pedestrian activity at 
certain times.
11.125  The area is bisected north-south and east-west by strategic roads carrying significant amounts of through traffic. Kennington Lane forms the boundary of 
the Congestion Charging Zone. Due to the concentration of traffic in the area, 
local streets are affected by higher than expected volumes of through traffic 
in some cases. Through traffic and development activity in the area results in 
high volumes of HGVs accessing construction sites. 
Environment
11.126  Part of the Kennington/Oval area lies in Flood Zone 3 and is at risk of flooding; the requirements of policy EN5 will apply to all development proposals. 
Kennington Oval/Camberwell New Road (A202)/Kennington Park Road (A3) 
is designated as one of Lambeth’s air quality focus areas due to its high 
levels of both pollution and human exposure and is identified in Lambeth’s 
Air Quality Action Plan. Development in this area should, in accordance with London Plan policy SI1, incorporate design solutions that prevent or minimise 
exposure to existing air pollution and make provisions to address local air 
pollution. Improving air quality in the area is a priority of both the council and the emerging neighbourhood plan and measures to improve air quality will 
be supported. 
11.127  Open space is provided by Kennington Park and the area surrounding St 
Mark’s church. Despite this, much of Kennington/Oval is deficient in multiple

 T o table of contentsPolicy PN8: Kennington/Oval
The council will support growth in Kennington/Oval as an important residential 
and employment area while enhancing the quality of its existing well-defined 
character and sense of place and seeking maximum community benefit from 
development proposals. 
This will be sought through:
A. an area-wide approach to investment and growth to ensure integration with 
neighbouring Opportunity Areas. 
B. supporting high quality regeneration for mixed use of the Oval gasworks and adjacent Tesco sites.
C. protecting and encouraging intensification of industrial floorspace capacity within the area’s Key Industrial and Business Areas in accordance with 
London Plan policy.
D. supporting development at the Oval stadium to extend the range and 
quality of facilities including those to serve the local community; improved 
public realm around the Oval to provide an enhanced experience for 
visitors, more appropriate for an international sporting venue; better links 
between local facilities and public transport; and improving the relationship 
of the stadium with the adjoining area. In particular, improvements will be sought to the quality of the linkages with the local centre along Clapham 
Road, by improving the attractiveness of the public realm, the creation of 
appropriate public spaces and interesting features and promoting active frontage uses along the route. Development proposals will be expected 
to mitigate any harmful impacts of large numbers of visitors on the 
surrounding area.
E. seeking to improve the quality and extent of shopping and other appropriate town centre uses within the area and local centres, including 
appropriate re-use of the Oval House Theatre, as well as sites in the wider 
area, to improve the range and quality of employment and housing. 
F. supporting and enhancing the heritage quality and attributes of the conservation area, Kennington Park, St Mark’s Church and the use of its 
churchyard for market use.
G. seeking the improvement of traffic, air quality and environmental conditions 
for school and cyclists, the quality and accessibility of the public realm and 
linkages between Kennington Park and other spaces and the shopping 
frontages in Clapham Road and Brixton Road.
H. seeking improvements to green infrastructure and access to open space throughout the area. 
I. implementing the council’s Healthy Route Network in the area, including improvements to Cycleway 7 on the A3 corridor, Cycleway 5 on quieter 
streets and the direct link to Waterloo via Kennington Lane. The council will  T o table of contents324

 T o table of contentsHerne Hill
Context and character 
11.128  Herne Hill is a small district centre well supported by a mixed community and 
is located close to Brockwell Park. The majority of buildings in the town centre 
are commercial on the ground floor with storage or residential on the upper 
floors. The wider area is predominantly residential in character. The district 
centre is cross border with the London Borough of Southwark and there is a 
conservation area across the borough boundary. 
Community
11.129  A neighbourhood planning area covering parts of Lambeth and Southwark was designated in December 2017. A neighbourhood plan for the area can be 
produced once a neighbourhood forum has been designated. 
Housing 
11.130  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having medium residential 
growth potential, although parts of this area is in Southwark. Outside the town 
centre, there is scope for residential growth on small sites and this is likely to 
be delivered by the extension/conversion of existing housing stock, as well as 
new build residential development. Additional development within residential 
curtilages may come forward where site circumstances permit. 
Economy and Culture
11.131  In the town centre as a whole, there are approximately 130 retail and service units. These serve an important local shopping role with a number of 
convenience shops, independent retailers, important local services and a good 
range of restaurants, cafes, takeaways, pubs and bars. There is a thriving 
weekly street market on Sundays in the new town square. 
11.132  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having medium commercial 
growth potential. Herne Hill is part of the Brixton Creative Enterprise Zone and 
opportunities to support the growth of the creative and digital industries will be 
sought. The area’s creative and digital industries include 198 Contemporary 
Arts and Learning, Ongean Studios and South London Makerspace in 
Southwark. 
Transport and Public Realm
11.133  Herne Hill has a busy railway station and is at the convergence of a number of important roads and bus routes, providing a convenient opportunity for 
interchange. The centre is split by a railway bridge and busy roads which 
intersect it, and in the past has been dominated by the presence of traffic.  T o table of contents326
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents11.134  Significant improvements have been made in recent years to create a better 
sense of place through: junction improvements at the entrance to Brockwell 
Park enabling the re-routing of buses; creation of a town square outside of the 
station; and improvements to connectivity and the public realm to provide a 
safe and high quality environment for pedestrians and cyclists. The area has 
a high demand for cycling, with Railton Road providing a key link to Brixton. Opportunities for further improvements to the station will be supported. 
Environment
11.135  Herne Hill adjoins Brockwell Park, which is one of south London’s largest open spaces and is both designated Metropolitan Open Land and an historic 
Registered Park and Garden. Brockwell Park is heavily used for a wide range 
of recreational and leisure activities, including the annual Lambeth Country 
show and has been the subject of a major programme of investment to 
improve its facilities and restore its historic features. The proximity of the park and associated leisure facilities (such as the Lido) helps both the environmental 
quality and general attractiveness of Herne Hill. Despite this, Herne Hill is 
deficient in access to multiple types of open space and measures to increase green infrastructure and improve access to open space will be sought. T o table of contents327

 T o table of contentsPolicy PN9: Herne Hill 
The council will support the role of Herne Hill as a small community-focused district 
centre by:
A. safeguarding and encouraging retail uses and other appropriate town-centre activities, including housing: within the primary shopping area, all 
ground-floor units should be in active frontage use with no less than 50 
per cent of ground-floor units in retail use and no more than 25 per cent 
in food and drink use; and outside of the primary shopping area, no more 
than 2 in 5 consecutive ground-floor units should be in food and drink use. Where necessary and justified to achieve the objectives of this policy, the 
council will use conditions and/or planning obligations in new development 
proposals to limit uses consented within Class E; 
B. supporting opportunities to deliver new residential and commercial uses whilst enhancing its sense of place including its historic character; 
C. supporting residential development on small sites both within and outside of the town centre in accordance with Local Plan policies;
D. supporting further improvements to the quality, safety and accessibility of the public realm, convenient linkage between the station and adjoining 
areas, and opportunities for improvements to the station;
E. supporting proposals to increase green infrastructure, access to open 
space and to improve air quality; 
F. improving walking and cycling links to and from the area, particularly to Brixton and West Norwood as part of Lambeth’s Healthy Route Network 
and supporting Brixton Liveable Neighbourhood; 
G. supporting the growth of creative and digital industries in the Brixton 
Creative Enterprise Zone (CEZ); and 
H. working closely with the London Borough of Southwark to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the management of the centre. T o table of contents329
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsLoughborough Junction
Context and character 
11.136  Loughborough Junction, a local centre, is defined by its high-level railway 
lines, railway arches and the many railway bridges which intersect it. The 
convergence of these railway viaducts forms a natural centre at Loughborough 
Junction which is situated between Brixton, Camberwell and Herne Hill. After 
years of under-investment, local groups are working to transform the area into 
a lively, attractive mixed-use neighbourhood, with retail, leisure, residential and industrial uses. Parts of Loughborough Junction are identified in the London 
Plan as Strategic Areas for Regeneration. 
11.137  The area has a number of large estates of social housing and to the east 
and south of the station there are streets of Victorian and Edwardian terrace 
houses, many of which are now divided into flats. The oldest houses, dating 
from the 1840s, are in the Loughborough Park Conservation Area. The 
Milkwood Estate is a housing association owned estate of small Victorian 
terrace houses south of the station. 
Community
11.138  In recent years local community groups have formed and come together with the purpose of regenerating their area and to consider how the area 
can respond to change. The Loughborough Junction Action Group (LJAG) 
is one of a number of a local resident-led groups of volunteers whose stated 
purpose is to improve the environment and lives of people living and working 
in Loughborough Junction. Other local groups include the Loughborough Junction Neighbourhood Forum and the LJ Works Steering Group. In 2013, 
LJAG worked with the council to produce the Loughborough Junction Plan. 
11.139  Projects designed to enhance the resilience of the neighbourhood have 
brought the community together via art which is important in Loughborough 
Junction as the area as a high proportion of artists working in artists’ studios 
and railway arches. LJAG has already initiated the 7 Bridges Project, with 
improvements to the bridges at Cambria Road and Loughborough Road 
already delivered. The project aims to improve the railway bridges which define the area with colour, light and art in order to engender a sense of identity 
for Loughborough Junction as a separate and distinct neighbourhood and 
to showcase local artists. Projects such as urban farming at Loughborough Farm and Community Café and activities at the Marcus Lipton Youth Centre 
and Grove Adventure Playground and the area’s places of worship have also 
proven successful.
11.140  Assets designated as Assets of Community Value include the Green Man Skills Zone, Sunshine International Arts, Ebony Horse Club, The Platform, the 
Cambria public house and Grove Adventure Playground. The Marcus Lipton 
Youth Centre and the Grove Adventure Playground are particularly important 
to the Loughborough Junction area by providing supervised facilities and  T o table of contents330
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsactivities for children and young people. The adjacent Elam Open Space also 
provides essential local play facilities and requires enhancement as an open 
space for the local community. 
11.141  The Denmark Hill campus of King’s College Hospital is primarily located in 
Lambeth. The Hospital Foundation Trust wishes to reconfigure its estate on 
the Denmark Hill campus. The Council will work with King’s College Hospital 
Foundation Trust to consider this through the preparation of The Trusts 
masterplan and a site allocation policy in the Site Allocations DPD. The 
emerging masterplan will be a material consideration in the determination of planning applications within King’s College Hospital’s Denmark Hill estate.
Housing
11.142  In the wider Loughborough Junction area, sites with potential to deliver new housing include the Higgs Industrial Estate. Sites that are delivering new 
housing include the Loughborough Park Estate. There is scope for further 
residential growth through the mixed-use redevelopment of non-designated 
industrial estates. On small sites, this is likely to be delivered by the extension/
conversion of existing housing stock as well as new build residential development. Additional development within residential curtilages may come 
forward where site circumstances permit. 
Economy and Culture
11.143  The local town centre’s retail offer has lost significant trade over the last thirty 
years and although that decline appears to be in reverse, there remain vacant 
units. The retail offer serves the day to day needs of the local community 
and opportunities to improve and diversify the retail offer will be sought. The 
council has extended the boundary of the town centre to ensure it is cohesive, 
to realise opportunities for growth and to increase the proportion of active frontages in the town centre. 
11.144  Policy ED11 Local Centres applies to the mix of uses within the Loughborough Junction local centre.
11.145  Loughborough Junction remains an industrial area and within the wider Loughborough Junction area there are seven Key Industrial and Business 
Areas, providing an important source of the borough’s light industrial and 
creative employment space. Industrial and employment uses in the area 
include waste management uses, a number of motor repair workshops, 
artists’ studios, recycling centres and an electricity sub-station. Light industrial units are particularly prominent and are located within a number of yards 
with distinct characteristics. The creation of additional employment and 
training opportunities, both in existing and new businesses, particularly for young people, is key to the regeneration of the area. This requires space 
for local businesses to start up and grow, good transport connections and 
programmes to support people to find work.  T o table of contents331
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contents11.146  Some yards, such as Belinda Yard, are located between railway viaducts 
which have allowed for a separation between the residential and noisier light 
industrial uses, a characteristic that the council will seek to protect. The area 
has an active and growing creative and digital industries sector, including those 
housed in railway arches, the Remakery, the Shakespeare Biz Centre and 
other spaces brought forward as part of the LJ:Works project. Shakespeare Biz Centre is mainly occupied by creative industries in small business units. 
Given its current and future potential role to support creative industries, 
Loughborough Junction is included within the Brixton Creative Enterprise Zone (CEZ). LJ: Works is a council supported and GLA funded project to provide 
affordable workspace, a shared kitchen and textile workshops and bring back 
into use dilapidated railway arches. It will also provide a permanent home for 
the Loughborough Farm and will provide green infrastructure. 
11.147  There is an opportunity to comprehensively refurbish and convert the Rathgar 
Road railway arches for a mix of uses alongside improvements to the 
public realm. 
Transport and Public Realm
11.148  The area is served by a number of bus routes and Loughborough Junction 
station. The station does not provide step-free access and generally requires 
refurbishment. Rail services are overcrowded at peak times and passenger 
numbers at the station are increasing. The council will promote access 
and environmental improvements at the station and longer term options to 
improve rail services as part of TfL’s ‘metroisation’ proposals. Expansion of London Cycle Hire will be explored with TfL, to be funded through developer 
contributions.
11.149  Loughborough Junction has one of the lowest levels of car ownership in 
the country. Many residents walk and cycle to get around the area and use 
public transport to access other areas. The council’s Healthy Route Network 
responds to this and identifies the need for improved walking and cycling links 
to adjacent areas. There is also an aspiration to open up additional routes 
through and around the railway viaducts to improve the permeability and accessibility of the area as part of an extension to the Low Line project. 
Environment
11.150  As an area with a high concentration of flats and few private gardens, high quality public open space and parks with well-connected and safe access 
routes with more trees planted along main roads are particularly important for 
health and wellbeing and to improve air quality in the area.
11.151  Ruskin Park to the south and Myatts Fields to the north are the two major parks and the council and Friends of Ruskin Park are producing a masterplan 
for improvements to Ruskin Park. Smaller parks include Milkwood Community 
Park, Loughborough Park, Wyck Gardens and Elam Street Open Space. 
Loughborough Park contains a children’s play area, a basketball court, a 
community building and a food growing area. Wyck Gardens has recently  T o table of contents332

 T o table of contentsreceived investment, with a new entrance and orchard, and has a number 
of facilities including the Ebony Horse Club stables, volleyball courts, a 
children’s play area and the Loughborough Farm community café. There is 
potential to improve the relationship between the Ridgway Road arches and 
Wyck Gardens, including the quality of the walking and cycling environment. 
Community engagement has expressed a strong aspiration to group the existing car repair businesses towards the western end of the Ridgway 
Road arches; this would help to improve this relationship. Elam Street Open 
Space has a wetland area and is important for local biodiversity. There are well-tended communal gardens on the Loughborough estate. Despite these 
assets, much of Loughborough Junction is categorised as being deficient in 
access to multiple types of open space and opportunities to increase access 
to open green space will be sought.  T o table of contents333

A. The council will work with local stakeholders to support the role of 
Loughborough Junction as a local centre with a clear identity and sense of 
place. This will be done by using the railway bridges, viaducts and railway 
arches as a catalyst for change, making greater use of under-used spaces 
and places and bringing forward new housing where appropriate. The 
council will: 
i. support sensitive new development which makes better use of under-used spaces and places to improve amenity, increase public safety 
and the appearance of the area;
ii. support improvements to the local centre’s retail and leisure offer and 
community facilities so residents can access essential services within 
walking or cycling distance of their homes; 
iii. encourage new employment uses in the area, particularly development 
that brings vacant and/or dilapidated railway arches back into use; 
iv. support development that enhances the character of the area’s various yards and maintains a mix of uses; 
v. support proposals that enhance the growth of creative and digital industries in the Brixton Creative Enterprise Zone (CEZ); 
vi. support proposals that increase the permeability, accessibility, navigability and safety of the area through improvements to existing 
walking and cycling routes and the creation of new, healthy, safe 
and accessible routes and opening up of key routes to previously 
inaccessible sites. Proposals to open up routes alongside railway 
arches and to contribute to the Low Line project will be supported. Proposals that harm accessibility in the town centre will be resisted; 
vii. support measures to improve local air quality;
viii. protect existing open space and support measures that improve access to open space and increase green infrastructure, including the 
creation of green chains that link together the area’s open spaces; and
ix. require development proposals to contribute to improvements to the 
quality, accessibility and safety of the public realm in the vicinity of the 
site. 
B. When considering proposals affecting existing community facilities, in 
addition to the requirements of Local Plan policies S1 and/or EN1, the 
council will ensure the maintenance of an adequate supply supervised 
facilities for children and young people, as well as other community facilities 
to meet local needs.
C. The council will work with local groups to improve transport infrastructure 
to respond to growing demand. This will prioritise walking, cycling and 
the use of public transport over car use and seek improvements to the 
station, including step-free access. The council will plan for and promote  T o table of contents336
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsa reduction in the number of people driving through the Loughborough 
Junction area, particularly for journeys under two miles, including through 
the provision of Cycleways and green routes. The Healthy Route Network 
identifies a number of priority links for walking and cycling to provide 
connections to Brixton, Camberwell, Herne Hill and Oval. Brixton Liveable 
Neighbourhood includes the provision of enhanced walking and cycling links to Brixton town centre. 
D. New and existing walking and cycling routes should be enhanced to reduce crime and the fear of crime through improved lighting, particularly under 
bridges, through arches, and alongside viaducts, and frontages should 
be activated to create surveillance. Bike-hire stations, and car club/hire 
facilities, and electric vehicle charging points should be provided throughout 
the area. 
E. The council will work with industry stakeholders to minimise the impact of construction activity in the area by planning and co-ordinating activities to 
reduce disruption, ensure safety, especially for vulnerable road users, and 
reduce environmental impacts. 
F. An opportunity exists to comprehensively refurbish and convert the Rathgar Road railway arches and associated public realm to achieve a mix of space 
for small businesses, that include workspace and maker space; community 
facilities; and cafes and restaurants that complement the nearby local town 
centre and are supported by environmental and accessibility improvements. 
The council will support proposals that achieve these objectives as part of a comprehensive approach, subject to the following requirements: 
i. no fewer than six railway arches are for office, research and development and light industrial/social infrastructure uses and no more 
than six railway arches are for café and restaurant uses; 
ii. it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that proposed café 
and restaurant uses in the arches would complement the existing local 
centre and they could not be provided within existing vacant premises 
in the local centre; 
iii. it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the council that appropriate engagement with and support for existing tenants would be provided, 
including consideration of alternative locations; 
iv. potential harm to neighbouring residential uses is assessed and 
appropriately mitigated; including through controls on opening hours; 
v. the proposal would deliver appropriate public realm improvements along Rathgar Road; 
vi. improve connectivity to the local centre and through railway arches where possible and support integration with and connectivity to the 
local centre; and 
vii. the proposal would include improvements to the back of the arches 
facing the LJ works site, including façade and lighting improvements.  T o table of contents337
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsProposals for the Rathgar Road arches that do not achieve these objectives 
in a comprehensive way will be assessed against all other relevant Local 
Plan policies, including ED6 Railway arches. Where necessary and justified 
to achieve the objectives of this policy, the council will use conditions 
and/or planning obligations in new development proposals to limit uses 
consented within Class E.
G. The council will support improvements to Loughborough Junction’s yards, including: 
i. Wickwood Street and Railway Arches (Loughborough Road Key Industrial and Business Area) - improvements to existing workspace in 
the railway arches and new servicing facilities. 
ii. Higgs Yard – improvements to the pedestrian and cycling environment 
at the junction of Coldharbour Lane/Herne Hill Road and improve the 
relationship of the Higgs development with the adjacent railway arches.
iii. Hardess Yard – improvements to workspace and reinstatement of the 
route from Hinton Road to Hardess Street. Working with the freeholder 
of the arches and leaseholders, the council will explore the potential to 
create dual aspect units in the railway arches, including those facing 
the Higgs development, where possible.
iv. Ridgway and Orphans Yard – retention of and improvements to 
existing arches in Ridgway Road and Orphans Yard, improving the 
relationship with Wyck Gardens and the pedestrian environment 
on Ridgway Road. Working with the freeholder of the arches and 
leaseholders, the council will explore the potential to group car repair 
businesses to towards the western end of Ridgway Road, enabling other types of small business to occupy the eastern arches.  T o table of contents338

 T o table of contentsUpper Norwood/Crystal Palace 
Context and character 
11.152  The Upper Norwood/Crystal Palace area, in the south east corner of the 
borough, is shared between five London boroughs: Croydon, Bromley, 
Lewisham, Southwark and Lambeth. Upper Norwood is the highest point in 
the borough and is one of the highest points in London, offering panoramic 
views towards central London and has a distinctive character. The area has 
two conservation areas and a number of statutory listed buildings.
11.153  Despite the area’s assets, Upper Norwood/Crystal Palace is identified in the London Plan as a Strategic Area for Regeneration and needs further 
investment to help the area prosper. 
Community 
11.154  There are a number of active community groups in the area. There is 
also an emerging neighbourhood planning group who wish to prepare a 
neighbourhood plan for the wider Upper Norwood/Crystal Palace area.
Housing 
11.155  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having high residential growth 
potential. There is scope for further residential growth on small sites and this 
is likely to be delivered by the extension/conversion of existing housing stock 
as well as new build residential development. Additional development within 
residential curtilages may come forward where site circumstances permit. 
Economy and Culture
11.156  The shopping centre, split between the boroughs of Lambeth, Bromley and 
Croydon and centred around Westow Hill, Westow Street and Church Road 
(‘the triangle’), is identified in the London Plan as a district centre. It has many 
independent shops and a good variety of food and drink uses resulting in a 
healthy evening economy. There is a weekly food market on Haynes Lane. A 
limited presence of comparison retail units and national multiple retailers lends it a distinctive character. The triangle is a destination in its own right, attracting 
trips from a wide catchment area. 
11.157  The London Plan identifies the district centre as having low commercial growth 
potential. However, in addition to the established retail and entertainment 
offer, the area is also home to cultural, creative and leisure uses. This includes 
assets such as the Upper Norwood Library, an independent but public library 
funded by both Lambeth and Croydon councils, and a cinema. Cooper’s Yard 
studios is home to a range of creative and digital enterprises. 
11.158  The London Borough of Croydon has identified the area as a location suitable for an enterprise centre for creative and cultural industries. The Bromley  T o table of contents339
Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Section 11: Places and Neighbourhoods
 T o table of contentsLocal Plan 2019 identifies Crystal Palace Park and Crystal Palace train and 
Overground station in the London Borough of Bromley as a Strategic Outer 
London Development Centre due to the area’s existing and potential leisure, 
tourism, arts, cultural and sports functions. 
Transport and Public Realm
11.159  The hilly nature of the area has historically restricted the construction of railways through the Upper Norwood area. The nearest train stations are 
Crystal Palace and Gipsy Hill stations, some 500 meters to the south-west 
and north-west of the centre, respectively. The area is served by the London 
Overground and this provides a model for rail services in the area. Although 
the area currently has a good level of public transport accessibility around the town centre, the surrounding area is relatively poorly served by public 
transport. Bus links to Central London to the north and Croydon to the south 
are not as direct, frequent or reliable as they could be, with many journeys taking two or more separate bus rides. There are 17 bus routes, including four 
night buses serving the area.
11.160  The triangle, where east/west and north/south A roads intersect, suffers 
from the impact of high levels of through traffic which detracts from the local 
environment and prevents the area realising its full potential as a destination. 
The area is not covered by a Controlled Parking Zone. Reducing traffic and 
congestion will assist with improving the area’s air quality.
11.161  A cross-borough approach to parking, traffic management and highway 
improvement is required as the triangle has three different highway authorities. 
The current one-way system was introduced to reduce congestion in the 
triangle but makes the area less permeable for cycling and congestion remains 
an issue. There is limited provision for cycling generally despite a high demand, 
particularly for recreational cycling, in the area. Electric bicycles may be particularly appropriate given the hilly nature of the area. 
Environment
11.162  Upper Norwood/Crystal Palace is located close to Crystal Palace Park, which is a major regional open space asset containing the National Sports Centre, 
athletics stadium and aquatics centre. It is also close to the Upper Norwood 
recreation ground and Westow Park in the London Borough of Croydon. 
Despite this, parts of Upper Norwood are deficient in access to multiple types 
of open space, including small or local parks.  T o table of contents340

 T o table of contentsPolicy PN11: Upper Norwood/Crystal Palace 
The council will support the role of Upper Norwood/Crystal Palace as a district 
centre and work with the adjoining London boroughs to safeguard and encourage 
retail uses and other appropriate town-centre uses, including housing. It will support 
opportunities for physical improvements to the centre which enhance and improve its character, increase green infrastructure, improve air quality and will seek to improve 
traffic, safety, accessibility and environmental conditions for pedestrians and cyclists in 
the area and public transport links to other parts of London. The council will support the vibrant arts and cultural scene and also encourage the growth of the creative 
and digital industries sector in the area. New housing in the wider Upper Norwood/
Crystal Palace area will be supported. Where necessary and justified to achieve the 
objectives of this policy, the council will use conditions and/or planning obligations in 
new development proposals to limit uses consented within Class E.
This will be achieved by:
A. safeguarding and encouraging retail uses: within the primary shopping area, 
no less than 50 per cent of ground-floor units should be in retail use; all 
ground-floor units should be in active frontage use; and no more than 25 
per cent in food and drink use;
B. supporting the potential extension of the Tramlink to Crystal Palace and/or improvements to rail frequencies on the Beckenham Junction corridor 
to provide improved access for the area; Gipsy Hill station is only fully 
accessible to one platform and development should seek to enable step-
free access to both platforms;
C. working with TfL on options to improve bus services towards central 
London and supporting planned improvements to the bus station; 
D. investigating, with TfL and other adjoining boroughs, ways in which traffic conditions in the area can be improved to ameliorate access to sustainable 
modes of transport, control speeds, reduce congestion and improve air 
quality, including the consideration of re-introducing two-way working at 
the triangle and a co-ordinated approach to road danger reduction, parking 
and servicing control and management;
E. implementing the Healthy Route network from Crystal Palace to Herne Hill via Gipsy Hill and West Dulwich and exploring opportunities to deliver 
improved links southward, particularly to Croydon town centre; 
F. protecting Cooper’s Yard Studios for cultural, creative and digital uses; and
G. working closely with the adjoining boroughs to ensure a co-ordinated 
approach to the management of the centre. T o table of contents342

London Plan Opportunity 
Areas,CAZ Retail Clusters 
Major, District and Local Town Centres 
The London Plan defines Opportunity Areas as the capital’s most significant locations 
with development capacity to accommodate new housing, commercial development 
and infrastructure (of all types), linked to existing or potential improvements in public 
transport connectivity and capacity, each typically contain capacity for at least 5,000 
net additional jobs or 2,500 net additional homes or a combination of the two.
London Plan Opportunity Areas in Lambeth (2)
Vauxhall (part of the wider Nine Elms Vauxhall Opportunity Area, shared with the 
London Borough of Wandsworth and includes the Vauxhall CAZ retail cluster)
Waterloo (which includes Waterloo CAZ retail cluster)
The London Plan defines major, district, and local centres and CAZ retail clusters 
as follows: 
Major Centres are typically found in inner and some parts of outer London with a 
borough-wide catchment. They generally contain over 50,000m2 of retail, leisure and 
service floorspace with a relatively high proportion of comparison goods relative to 
convenience goods. They may also have significant employment, leisure, service and 
civic functions.
District Centres are distributed more widely than Metropolitan and Major centres, 
providing convenience goods and services, and social infrastructure for more local 
communities and accessible by public transport, walking and cycling. Typically, they contain 5,000–50,000m
2 of retail, leisure and service floorspace. Some District centres 
have developed specialist shopping functions. 
CAZ retail clusters significant mixed-use clusters located within the Central Activities 
Zone, with a predominant retail function and, in terms of scale, broadly comparable to 
Major or District centres.
Local Centres typically serve a localised catchment often most accessible by 
walking and cycling and include local parades and small clusters of shops, mostly 
for convenience goods and other services. They may include a small supermarket (typically up to around 500m
2), sub-post office, pharmacy, laundrette and other useful  T o table of contents352

areas deficient in local retail and other services. This includes locally-identified CAZ 
retail centres.

as having a 
1 in 100 or greater annual probability of 
river flooding 
(>1%) or a 1 in 200 or greater annual probability of 
flooding from 
the sea (>0.5%) in any year.Development proposals are constrained to ‘water compatible’, ‘less vulnerable and ‘more vulnerable’ 
classification.
Development classed as ‘Highly 
vulnerable’ will not be permitted by 
the council. 
For more vulnerable development:
In areas of fluvial flood risk, finished 
floor land/or threshold levels should be set at least 300mm above the 1 in 100-year + climate change fluvial 
flood level. In areas of tidal residual 
risk finished floor levels should be set above the 1 in 200-year tidal flood level. 
Development proposals should 
assess whether the site can achieve safe access and egress during the 
design flood event. Flood hazard on 
access routes should be no greater than very low hazard defined within the council’s Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA). If safe access/ 
egress cannot be achieved from 
the development, an emergency plan may be provided to inform the local planning authority’s emergency 
planning decision. 
For development in areas of 
direct fluvial flood risk, floodplain 
compensation should be provided 
for sites on a level for level/volume for volume basis up to and including the 1 in 100- year climate change flood level. Development should not 
adversely affect flood flow routes and

Flood Zone 3b 
This zone 
comprises land 
where water has to flow or be stored in times of flood. 
 The functional floodplain will be 
protected by not allowing any form of development on undeveloped sites unless it is:
classed as ‘water compatible’.for development of ‘essential 
infrastructure’ which has to be located in a flood risk area and where no alternative locations are available, should be developed safely, without 
increasing flood risk elsewhere and 
where possible reduce the flood risk overall. These risks should be assessed and mitigated applying the 
same site design principles for Flood 
Zone 3a as set out above.
The council will only support 
redevelopment of existing developed 
sites if there is no increase in vulnerability and no increase in flood risk than currently exists to the redevelopment or wider community 
over the lifetime of the development. 
These risks should be assessed and mitigated by applying the same site design principles for Flood Zone 3a as 
set out above.
Basements, basement extensions and 
conversion of basements to a ‘higher 
vulnerability’ classification or self 
contained units will not be permitted by the council. Required for all developments Required for developments classed as ‘essential 
infrastructure’ Required for all 
development proposals. 
The FRA must consider 
all sources of flooding including tidal, fluvial, surface run-off, groundwater and sewer 
flooding in accordance 
with requirements identified in the SFRA and LFRMS. T o table of contents359

Protected Lambeth Squares The London Square Preservation Act (1931) seeks to protect certain squares, gardens 
and enclosures in Greater London. The Act limits the use of London Squares to “ornamental pleasure grounds or grounds for play, rest and recreation” and the only 
buildings and structures allowed are those which are “necessary or convenient for, 
and in connection with, the use and maintenance of such squares”. Whilst it is not planning legislation, the Act is a material consideration in the determination of planning 
applications.
In Lambeth, the following spaces are protected under the Act. These are presented 
below as found in the Act itself:

Outstanding Universal Value of Westminster World Heritage Site
UNESCO REF: 32 COM 8B.96 – Statement of Significance for the Palace of 
Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret’s Church, United Kingdom:
Westminster Palace, Westminster Abbey and St Margaret’s Church together 
encapsulate the history of one of the most ancient of parliamentary monarchies of present times and the growth of parliamentary and constitutional institutions.
In tangible form Westminster Abbey is a striking succession of the successive phases 
of English Gothic art and the inspiration of the work of Barry and Pugin on the Palace 
of Westminster.
The Palace of Westminster illustrates in colossal form the grandeur of constitutional 
monarchy and the principle of the bicameral parliamentary system, as envisaged in 
the 19
th century, constructed by English architectural reference to show the national 
character of the monument.
The Palace is one of the most significant monuments of the neo-Gothic architecture, 
as an outstanding, coherent and complete example of neo-Gothic style.
Westminster Hall is a key monument of the Perpendicular style and its admirable oak 
roof is one of the greatest achievements of medieval construction in wood.
Westminster is a place in which great events have taken place which have shaped the 
English and British nation.
The church of St Margaret, a charming perpendicular style construction, continues to 
be parish church of the House of Commons and is an integral part of the complex.
Criterion (i): Westminster Abbey is a unique artistic construction representing a 
striking sequence of the successive phases of English Gothic art.
Criterion (ii): Other than its influence on English architecture during the Middle Ages, 
the Abbey has played another leading role by influencing the work of Charles Barry 
and Augustus Welby Pugin in Westminster Palace, in the “Gothic Revival” of the 
19th century.
Criterion (iv): The Abbey, the Palace, and St Margaret’s illustrate in a concrete way the specificities of parliamentary monarchy over a period of time as long as nine 
centuries. Whether one looks at the royal tombs of the Charterhouse, the remarkable 
vastness of Westminster Hall, of the House of Lords, or the House of Commons, art is 
everywhere present and harmonious, making a veritable museum of the history of the 
United Kingdom. T o table of contents364

Charging approaches 
Monetary Contributions in lieu of Affordable Housing Provision on Sites 
between 10 and 25 dwellings under the Fast Track approach:
The following formula should be used to calculate the difference between two residual 
values: one for the scheme with the threshold level of affordable housing and one for 
the scheme with 100% market housing. Applicants are advised to use the on-line calculator provided on the council’s website. 
A-B=C
Where:A = value of the proposed development assuming 100% of the residential 
units are provided as private housing;
B = the value that would otherwise have been achieved by the proposed 
development incorporating an element of affordable housing in line with the 
affordable housing policy requirement;
C = payment in lieu.
Monetary Contributions to help provide off-site Children’s Play Space 
for Major New Developments:
Contributions to help fund the cost of off-site provision of children’s play space for 
developments of 10 or more dwellings where this play space is not provided on-site 
will be calculated according to the following formula: 
Number of children generated (child yield calculated in accordance  
with bedroom size and tenure variations)
 X
10m2 of play space = play space requirement
Average cost per square metre (£99)
 X
Play space requirement = financial contribution T o table of contents374
 Lambeth Local Plan 2020–2035   |  Annex 9
Monetary Contributions to Offset Impact of Visitor Attractions:
Contributions to help fund the cost of offsetting the impact of visitor attractions will be 
calculated according to the following formula.
The council will look to base the visitor attraction impact offset contribution cost on 
an annual sum payment per year based on impact in relation to 1% of turnover, or 
another sum, as agreed.
Monetary Contributions towards Employment and Training ActivitiesThe following approach will be used to calculate the level of financial contributions 
towards employment and training activities:
• Residential developments and residential elements of a mixed-use development: a monetary contribution of £6,500
1 towards the cost 
of vocational training and employment support will be required by the 
Council for every 1,000m2 of development (Gross Internal Area) or every 10 
residential units provided.
• Commercial developments and commercial elements of a mixed-
use development: a monetary contribution will be calculated on the basis 
of an assumption about the level of net additional employment generated 
by a development. An example for B1 office space is set out below: 
B1 (net) Gross Internal Area (GIA) / 12m2 per full full-time equivalent job 
(based on standard general office density)2

Monetary Contributions towards Affordable Workspace
A payment in lieu towards affordable workspace will be sought where this is 
not provided by a qualifying development. The calculation will be based on the 
following factors:
Factor
A Total lettable employment floorspace (m2)
B Percentage of floorspace to be discounted
C Amount of floorspace subject to discount 
D Market rent per m2 before discount
E Market rent for discounted floorspace before discount
F Percentage discount
G Rent after discount
H Value of discount
I Investment Yield
J Income Multiplier 
K Capital value of discount 
Using the factors above, the following seven steps will be used to calculate the fee): 
Step 1: C= A x B
Step 2: E= D x C
Step 3: G= E x FStep 4: H= G-EStep 5: J= (1/I)Step 6: K= H x J T o table of contents378

Monetary Contributions for development resulting in a loss of kerbside space
Contributions to cover the cost of the creation of parking/loading bays or cycle 
hangars on the highway will be sought. For each bay, a contribution will be calculated 
based on the following: 
Cost of Traffic Order, signage and lines, and/or cycle hangar
+Maintenance costs over a 25 year period +Enforcement costs (if within CPZ) over a 25 year period (not relevant 
to cycle hangars).
+Opportunity cost
The opportunity cost relates to annual pay and display income aggregated over a 25 
year period and will depend on the size of the bay and specific parking restrictions.  
Applicants are advised to contact the council for up to date costs relating to all of the factors above. 
Monetary Contributions for Travel Plans/Travel Plan Statements 
Monitoring Fees
Contributions will be sought to cover the cost of monitoring Travel Plans/Travel Plan 
Statements for each development. 
Cost per Travel Plan + Cost per Travel Plan Statement
Where a development has more than one Travel Plan/Travel Plan Statements, the fee 
will be the sum of each. The council keeps such costs updated and applicants are 
advised to contact the council for up to date costs.
Monetary Contributions for Controlled Parking Zones
On developments consisting of four residential units or more, a financial contribution 
of £2,500 per residential unit is sought for the management, consultation and 
implementation of Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs). 
The contribution is requested for all applications in CPZs and will be sought in areas 
where there is not currently a CPZ but where demand for parking is anticipated by 
will not be met with a development site. This is because new development has the potential to exacerbate existing on-street parking pressure which may then drive 
demand for a future CPZ. T o table of contents379

Neighbourhood Plan A statutory plan prepared by a neighbourhood forum that 
introduces non-strategic planning policies in a designated neighbourhood area. 
Original floor area (for house conversions) This is calculated so as to exclude any 
extensions, garages (including converted garages) or lost conversions to the original (i.e. pre 1948 unextended) property. The calculation excludes the area of outside walls

158 in relation to flood risk. 
Spatial development Refers to changes in the distribution of activities and the 
linkages between them in terms of the use and development of land. Spatial planning 
goes beyond traditional land use planning to bring together and integrate policies for 
the development and use of land with other policies and programmes which influence the nature of places and how they function. This will include policies which can impact 
on land use by influencing the demands on, or needs for, development, but which 
are not capable of being delivered solely or mainly through the granting or refusal of 
planning permission and which may be implemented by other means.
Statement of Community Involvement A Local Development Document that sets 
out how and when stakeholders will be involved in development plan preparation and consulted on planning applications. 
Sui generis uses Uses which do not fall within any Use Class, including

sensitive to their environment, and contribute to a high quality of life. They are safe 
and inclusive, well planned, built and run, and offer equality of opportunity and good 
services for all.
Sustainable development Development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Sustainability Appraisal (SA) A systematic process, required by the Planning and

plan strategies and policies and ensuring that they accord with the objectives of 
sustainable development.
Trees of value Trees that have the capacity to deliver eco-system benefits in the form 
of absorbing carbon dioxide (the main greenhouse gas) and producing oxygen and 
to filter, absorb and reduce other pollutant gasses including sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. To achieve improved air quality, trees of value 
will have large deciduous canopies or have the potential to develop such in the future.
Urban greening The process of providing appropriate types of green infrastructure, 
such as green roofs and street trees, in urban areas.
Viability appraisal An assessment of the financial viability of a development to 
determine the maximum level of affordable housing and other policy requirements that
